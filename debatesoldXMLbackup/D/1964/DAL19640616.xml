      <P>With your permission, <Col N="3" /> Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the agreed communiqué issued last Saturday, at the conclusion of the visit of M. Couve de Murville, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs.  With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a copy of the English text of that communiqué.</P>
      <P>The discussions with M. Couve de Murville covered the major current international political problems of interest to France and Ireland and all aspects of relations between the two countries, including Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>Our application for membership of the EEC still stands and will be actively pursued when circumstances make this course desirable in the national interest.</P>
      <P>Following is the English text of the communiqué:</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <b>IRISH-FRENCH COMMUNIQUÉ.</b>
      </P>
      <P>On the invitation of the Irish Government, Monsieur Couve de Murville, French Minister for Foreign Affairs, visited Dublin on the 11th and 12th June.  He had a full exchange of views with the Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, and with the Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Aiken, on all aspects of relations between the two countries as well as on the principal international problems of interest to both France and Ireland.  Monsieur Couve de Murville was also received by Mr. de Valera, President of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The two Ministers resumed their consideration already begun in November, 1963, on the occasion of Mr. Aiken's visit to Paris, of the range of questions affecting the relations between the two countries.  They noted with satisfaction that no difficulties exist in Franco-Irish relations which are characterised by a friendship deeply rooted in history and by a mutual and profound sympathy between the two peoples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two Ministers expressed pleasure at the close cultural relations <Col N="4" /> which exist traditionally between Ireland and France and which are founded on a common civilisation. They considered it desirable to develop further cultural exchanges between the two countries and to increase the provision of places for scholarship holders and stagiaires whose numbers have already been increasing for some years past.  In particular they considered it desirable to develop further the teaching of the French language in Irish educational programmes. Monsieur Couve de Murville and Mr. Aiken agreed to the preparation of a cultural agreement which would both strengthen the existing bonds and increase the number of cultural exchanges.</P>
    <P>Economic relations between France and Ireland were also closely reviewed. The two Ministers noted with satisfaction that trade had more than doubled since 1961 and that this growth was taking place in both directions.  They have expressed their desire for an increase in trade, balanced in so far as may be possible, in the mutual interest of both countries.  Detailed negotiations will take place in Dublin beginning the 6th July.  They noted increasing French participation in Irish industrial progress and they recognised the value of French investment in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Monsieur Couve de Murville reviewed both with the Taoiseach and with the Minister for External Affairs the major current problems in the international political sphere which are of interest to France and Ireland.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the talks, which took place in an atmosphere of cordiality and mutual confidence, the Ministers were agreed on the usefulness of such exchanges of views which serve to strengthen the existing bonds between the two countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any discussion at all about the possibility of association with the EEC rather than full membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out <Col N="5" /> that M. Couve de Murville came here as the French Foreign Minister, not as a representative of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In that objection to the admission of Britain came from France and in that the admission of Ireland depended on the admission of Britain, surely it would not be unreasonable for Ireland's application to be discussed with the French Foreign Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>And it was discussed.  I want to make it quite clear that proceeding with our application for membership depends on our own decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been any suggestion of bilateral agreement on matters of trade between us and the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>And the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is being considered and certain discussions have already taken place.  As far as M. Couve de Murville is concerned, arrangements were made for the negotiation of a bilateral agreement affecting trade with France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach if the French Foreign Minister gave any indication as to whether the French Government would favour more an application for association than for membership, in the event of our continuing to press for membership of the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for our own decision whether we seek membership, association or nothing at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it quite clear that our decision is for membership and there is no question of that decision being modified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said a few times recently that if Britain did not go in we could not go in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that one of the high officials of the EEC, namely, the principal administrator, the Director General for External Relations, stated during the course of the visit of the French Foreign Minister here that a country which by unilateral action reduced tariffs, was acting in a very philanthropic way in a world full of tariffs? In view of that important pronouncement by that important person, would the Taoiseach not reconsider Ireland's position now, as we may not have the bargaining power as a result of removing tariffs at this stage if we are offered even associate membership by EEC in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy which the Government are following is designed to improve the efficiency of Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the unilateral reductions we make, will we get an allowance for that as bargaining power if our application for membership or association is to be further considered by the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What we hope to get is a more efficient industrial organisation here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we going it alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says this is a matter entirely for us.  Is it not a fact that, if that is true, it would be equally true to say that the British Government could be a full member if they had received the support of the French Government instead of opposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is important to know whether the French Government are prepared to support associate or full membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated in <Col N="7" /> reply that the application for full membership is one for our Government in the light of the circumstances that presented themselves in the future.  Does that refer to the circumstance of whether Great Britain becomes a full member of the Common Market or not, or has the Taoiseach any anticipation of full membership for Ireland in the absence of corresponding full membership for Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The future relationship between Britain and the Community is, of course, a very important factor in our consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not prepared to say&mdash;or is he prepared to say&mdash;when he refers to the future circumstances relating to our application for full membership, has he in mind the question of whether Great Britain will be a full member or whether she will be an associate member?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course, that is an important consideration.  I might point out that the term &ldquo;full membership&rdquo; is misleading.  There is no other form of membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate to the House what circumstances he envisages would recreate a condition for the pursuance of our application for Common Market membership?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach not give some indication as to what is in his mind with regard to it?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter entirely for our decision whether we wish to pursue it.  We will do this when it is in our interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said earlier on that our application would be considered in the near future.  Maybe I took him up wrongly in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any significance in the fact that the Taoiseach left out the word &ldquo;full&rdquo; before &ldquo;member&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one form of membership of the Community. There is no such thing as associate membership.  This idea that we can get the benefits of membership at a reduced fee is without foundation.</P>

      <P>The number of persons X-rayed in 1963 by the National Mass-Radiography Association was 284,842.  This figure was exceeded only once previously.</P>
      <P>While one would like to see the service availed of to an even greater extent by the public, nevertheless having regard to the physical characteristics of the country, the distribution of the population and the increasing concentration on intensive community surveys which, although more valuable in the ultimate in achieving the eradication of tuberculosis, tend to reduce numbers, the results last year could not be adjudged as unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Association keeps its publicity campaign under continuous review.  I do not think it is necessary to detail its efforts in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as possible all building materials being used in the construction of the Abbey Theatre are of Irish origin.  The <Col N="14" /> bricks which are being used in the facing of the building are not Scottish. They are manufactured in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the management of the theatre is making every effort to use Irish materials where that is possible and accordingly I do not think it necessary to make the stipulation suggested by the Deputy in the last part of his question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the approval of a frontier road for Customs purposes requires joint action by the authorities on both sides.  The conversations with the British authorities on the question of the approval of additional cross-Border roads, to which I referred in reply to a question on 12th March last are still in progress; decisions on the Carrickmacross-Crossmaglen and other routes must await the outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this matter has been going on now for approximately 18 months?  Is he further aware that action is being taken on this road on the Northern Ireland side, which would appear to indicate they are prepared to keep the road as an approved road.  Can the Minister give me an indication as to what the decision is likely to be in view of the length of time which has elapsed since the matter was first taken into consideration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, it requires decision by the authorities on both sides.  Discussions have been going on, and, I must confess, for somewhat longer than I had expected. I am not sure when they may conclude, but I think there is not much hope of the road being opened this summer.  It will take some time.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by CIE that the <i>Pacemaker</i> report was produced by the staff of the Board in the normal course <Col N="25" /> of their duties together with outside statistical assistance; and its production was not separately costed.  The report was not put on sale.  Apart from the laying of copies on the Table of the House, which was done at my behest, the circulation of the report is a matter of day to day administration of the Board.</P>

      <P>Forty-two buses, including thirty-nine replacement buses, were built by CIE and brought into service during the year ended 31st March, 1964.  Total expenditure on additions to and replacements of road passenger rolling stock during the year amounted to £445,700.  This sum includes expenditure on improvements to existing buses and the value of work in progress.  The other information sought by the Deputy relates to matters of day-to-day administration which I do not propose to seek from the Board.  Information on the number of buses constructed is, in fact, provided in the Board's annual report and the report always includes a census of road vehicles in current operation.</P>

      <P>Tariffs on industrial products generally have been reduced by 20 per cent and a further reduction of 10 per cent will be made on the 1st January, 1965.  Future policy in regard to the reduction of tariffs will be determined by developments arising from membership of international trade groups as well as by the desirability of providing a stimulus for industrial re-adaptation and increased competitiveness.</P>

      <P>Three applications for new manufacture licences in relation to County Wexford, including one for Enniscorthy, were received during the past two years.  All three have been approved and in two of the cases the licences have been issued.  The issue of a licence in the third case awaits the receipt of a formal application.  While information regarding the individual cases is confidential, I can say that the average time that elapsed between the date of the initial approach by the promoter and the date on which my approval in principle to the grant of a licence was conveyed was about two months.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state, in respect of the specific firms investigated and found to be deficient and criticised for such deficiency in recent Committee on Industrial Organisation reports, how many have taken positive steps to remedy these deficiencies by claiming the grants, advisory aids or similar steps offered by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The CIO reports did not specify firms considered by the survey teams to be deficient or single out individual firms for criticism in this regard.  It is not possible, therefore, to give the information requested in the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surveys of 26 industries were undertaken by the CIO.  The reports on 18 of these industries have been published and the draft reports on 7 of the remaining 8 industries have been circulated to the firms which participated <Col N="34" /> in the surveys.  The total number of firms which co-operated in the 26 surveys was about 640, but the amount of work and time involved in establishing the number of these firms which have taken steps to avail themselves of the various financial aids and other services offered by the Government would not be justified.</P>
    <P>I can say for the Deputy's information, however, that up to 12th June 1964, 339 firms have applied for the special adaptation grants or loans and that approximately 970 applications for technical assistance grants for the employment of industrial consultants, attendance of management and supervisory personnel at training courses, etc. have been received since January 1962.  It does not necessarily follow, however, that these applications have come only from firms included in the CIO surveys.</P>

      <P>As indicated by the Taoiseach in reply to Questions Nos. 7 and 8 on to-day's Order Paper, the rise in the Consumer Price Index between mid-February and mid-May, 1964 was less than 4 per cent.  I am satisfied, from the reports made to me on the searching investigations carried out in respect of the commodity prices so far covered, that unwarranted increases have not been made by the Irish manufacturers and producers concerned and that there is adequate competition at the retail end.  It is a matter for the consumers to take advantage of this situation.</P>

      <P>The accommodation available for families in Griffith Barracks is provided by the Dublin Health Authority. Dublin Corporation have already taken steps to increase their housing output and have also made arrangements to assist any of the families living in Griffith Barracks, who wish to do so, to purchase houses.  I am not in a position to state whether, or when, any particular family will be rehoused by the Corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is clear from the Minister's reply that the Corporation cannot hope to accommodate these families for some years to come, could the Minister make any suggestion to the Corporation as to how these families could have their accommodation in Griffith Barracks improved, even by the provision of cubicles, so that they can resume normal family life?  The position at the moment is that they are living in a ghetto.  It is an appalling state of affairs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that and I would ask the Minister to inquire from the Corporation if they could provide some form of cubicle accommodation so that these husbands and wives and their families can live together in a <Col N="41" /> reasonably normal way?  Pending the rectification of the serious position of housing in the city, is it possible they could be given conditions in which they could be reunited?</P>

This scheme is expected to be in operation by Autumn, 1966.  In the meantime temporary filtration plant is being provided at Leixlip to enable about 1 mil. gals. per day to be supplied to the area by March, 1965.

    <P>Preliminary discussions have taken place between officers of my Department <Col N="45" /> and officers of the British Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance on the question of reciprocal arrangements between Irish old age, contributory, pensions and British retirement pensions.  Satisfactory progress has been made but many problems have yet to be resolved and these are now being studied in the light of the discussions. I regret that it is not possible to say at this stage when the negotiations are likely to be concluded but every effort will be made to expedite them.  I should emphasise, however, that, as I pointed out in reply to a question by Deputy Byrne on 14th April last, even if an agreement on reciprocal arrangements involving British retirement pensions and Irish old age, contributory, pensions can be reached, it does not necessarily follow that it will include the removal of the British restriction on the payment of increases in pensions to persons in this country; similar restrictions continue to apply in a number of countries having reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain including even some Commonwealth countries.</P>

      <P>The qualifying limit for insurance under the Social Welfare Acts to which the Deputies refer applies only to persons who are employed mainly in a non-manual capacity.  There is no limit in the case of manual workers.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> Title to the usual benefits available under the Acts does not cease immediately on termination of insurance by reason of the effect of the qualifying limit.  In the case of men, cover for such benefits could in certain circumstances continue for a period of 17 months after the end of the year in which compulsory insurance ceases. Moreover, non-manual workers who cease to be compulsorily insurable when their earnings exceed £800 a year, can maintain insurance for certain benefits by becoming voluntary contributors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The person to whom the Deputy's question relates exhausted title to unemployment benefit on 7th February, 1963.  He renewed his claim on the 6th December, 1963.  His title to benefit from that date depended on the validity of employment contributions which had been paid subsequent to 7th February, 1963.  Following inquiries, it was held by a deciding officer, whose statutory function is to give decisions in cases of this kind, that these contributions were not valid as they had not been paid in respect of insurable employment.  As a consequence the claim of 6th December, 1963 was disallowed.</P>
      <P>The claimant appealed against the decision given in relation to the insurability of his employment during the period in respect of which stamps had been affixed to his 1963 insurance card.  The appeals officer to whom the appeal was referred has decided to proceed by way of an oral hearing which will be arranged for an early date.  When the result of the appeal is known, the decision already given in relation to the claim for unemployment benefit will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>The difference in enrolments in standards one to four is not significant and may be put down to normal attenuation.  From standard five onwards, there is a movement towards junior classes in secondary schools.</P>
      <P>Because of the very young age at which children commence attendance at school in Dublin city they generally spend two years in infant grades, junior and senior, and where they begin school after Easter they spend more than two years in these grades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:</P>
      <P>Section 42: in subsection (1), line 26, &ldquo;, having regard to the desirability of encouraging inventors and the growth and development of industry and to such other matters as he considers relevant,&rdquo; inserted before &ldquo;there&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in the House on Thursday last that an amendment had been moved in the Seanad to section 42 of the Bill which I proposed to accept. The amendment is mine.  The purpose of the Bill, as the House is aware, is to give protection to inventors to exploit commercially their inventions. Under existing legislation there are certain limitations on that exploitation so that inventors may not, through the monopoly they acquire in inventions, exploit such inventions contrary to the public interest.  Normally speaking, in order to establish exploitation, a person who seeks to use an invention must establish an abuse of the monopoly given to the inventor or patentee. That, however, is not the case in relation to inventions covering drugs, medicines, curative devices, etc, and a person may apply to the Controller of Patents for a licence to use an invention connected with drugs, medicines, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill, as it left the House, the only obligation on the Controller was to ensure that adequate compensation would be made available to the inventor for the giving of the licence to an applicant for the licence.  Having regard to the representations received from a number of sources, including the drug manufacturers of this country and the Industrial Development Authority, I introduced this amendment in the Seanad, where it was accepted.  The purpose of the amendment is to make it obligatory on the Controller not only to ensure that adequate compensation be given but also to have regard to the legitimate interests of the inventor for the amount of money involved in research and, at the instance of some of these firms and the Industrial Development Authority, to have regard also to the prospect of <Col N="55" /> the development of industry in this country.  The purpose of the amendment is to oblige the Controller to have regard to these two facts and I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Amendment reported and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Ordered: That Seanad Éireann be notified accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>For many years the allowance paid to Deputies was regarded as sufficient only to cover their expenses and as such was not subject to income tax.  In 1960, for the first time, it was considered necessary to pay Deputies for their time and when the allowance was increased to £1,000 the Deputy had to come to terms with the Revenue Commissioners on what would be an equitable sum for expenses and the remainder of his allowance was then subject of income tax.  The increased allowance of £1,500 will be subject to the same terms.  Deputies are aware of these conditions and they are made aware of them by having to meet a demand for income tax on their earnings as Deputies.  It is necessary to mention this fact because some people appear to believe that neither Deputies nor Ministers pay income tax.</P>
      <P>When the proposal for higher allowances was submitted to the Dáil in 1960 and when the principle of paying Deputies for their time was first introduced, the question was posed whether the sum granted was sufficient in all the circumstances.  The Dáil Deputy is not compelled to give his whole time to his Dáil duties and it cannot be argued, therefore, that a Deputy is precluded from engaging in other remunerative occupation&mdash;part-time at least.  In theory the Deputy may be allowed to pursue another occupation but in practice there are limits to what he can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> No employer is inclined to offer work to a man who must stipulate that he would be precluded from serving his employer for at least three days in the middle of the week and perhaps for other days when he might feel obliged to accompany a deputation to see a Minister, or attend a meeting in his constituency or go to the funeral of a valued friend.  Some employers too are reluctant to take on a man who might feel obliged to express himself forcibly on occasions on matters of public importance and maybe advocate a policy that would be hurtful to his employer or to his employer's customers.</P>
    <P>It can be assumed, therefore, that employment during his spare time from Dáil duties is almost impossible.  A professional man who is elected to the Dáil suffers in his practice.  Be he a medical or a legal man he cannot hold his practice if he is absent for the greater part of the week from his home or from his office.  A proprietor of a business or a farmer may be able to control his business, but his ability to give full and proper attention to his affairs is seriously impaired.</P>
    <P>The country requires the best material that can be got for the Dáil. The primary duty of a Deputy is legislation. All Deputies are equal in their power to direct the destiny of the country.  Every vote counts and each Deputy has to decide how he will vote on every issue whether important or less important.</P>
    <P>The popular opinion is that the great majority of Deputies are just &ldquo;yes men&rdquo; for their Parties.  In all democracies the party system prevails, but a member of a party has rights as a full member to mould the policy of his party.</P>
    <P>In the party system the discussion on a particular question is first taken at a party meeting and there democracy is exercised.  There every member claims his right to express his views and as we know that right is exercised both forcibly and effectively.</P>
    <P>As time goes on Deputies are getting more involved in problems arising between their constituents and Government Departments or local authorities. Schemes are multiplying and some of <Col N="57" /> them more complex than others under which people may benefit in many ways.  It is only to be expected that when applicants are unsuccessful they may feel that they are not treated equitably&mdash;many cases of this kind come to the Deputy for his attention. He may have to call to or communicate with the relevant Department by 'phone or letter and then write to his correspondent either to seek further information or to convey a decision on the matter.  It is not uncommon for a Deputy to have to attend to as many as 300 letters per week.  In the modern world, a Deputy does not share the benefits of a five-day week or a 40-hour week.</P>
    <P>It may be said that a Deputy should confine himself to the Dáil where his talents and time are required.  In theory there is a lot to be said for that but in practice his services are required by his constituents as an advocate and adviser on many matters.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that officials should be located at convenient centres throughout the country who could do this work more efficiently and more impartially than Deputies.  I am not entering into the merits of this suggestion.  Sufficient to say that this alternative is not available to the people and, consequently, the Deputy must fill the gap.</P>
    <P>On the basis, therefore, that many Dáil Deputies must in fact regard their job as full time or so near full time that they cannot do anything else we must consider what the remuneration should be.</P>
    <P>We should then fix the remuneration or allowance of Deputies at a level that will enable them to live even if they are not in a position to supplement their incomes from other sources&mdash;and even if they have no other resources to fall back on.</P>
    <P>If the increased allowances proposed for Deputies and Senators were to be determined solely by reference to the movements in remuneration which took place under the eighth and ninth rounds, an increase of the order of 25 per cent would be warranted.  A Deputy would then get £1,250 in lieu of his present allowance of £1,000 and a Senator would get £937 10s. in lieu of his present allowance of £750.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> However, I do not accept the standard of these two rounds as the sole criterion for the reason that sufficient weight has not been attached in the past to the representational and similar demands made on members, and in particular on Deputies.  More and more demands are being made on public representatives and, in my view, any increase in their allowances should reflect this steadily growing demand.  It is in recognition of this development that the rates of increase in this Bill have been set at 50 per cent for Deputies and 33? per cent for Senators.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the public, who have become increasingly aware in recent years of the need to uphold the standards of the legislative assemblies and to afford adequate compensation to those who undertake the arduous task of representing them in Parliament will recognise the need for these increases, all the more in that the revised rates of allowances will still fall well short of those payable in the case of the majority of European legislatures.  On that basis £1,500 a year is surely not too much.</P>
    <P>As members of the Oireachtas, we can fix our own remuneration and I think I can say with conviction that we have over the years been diffident to raise the figure to an unreasonable level.  People may have ambitions to seek Parliamentary honours but they are surely not tempted by the pay.  I am a long time in this House but I have never known anyone leaving it better off than when he came in.  I have inquired how Deputies are paid in many other countries.  Nowhere except in Stormont is the allowance as low as £1,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Stormont.  It may be said that a 50 per cent increase is out of line with general increases for employees. Deputies got no eighth round. Let us take some examples from the public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of them have got not only the eighth and ninth rounds but what is known as a status increase as well. In 1960 when Deputies had £1,000, a superintendent of the Guards had £1,010.  The superintendent now has <Col N="59" /> £1,546.  Where the status increase has been decided, increases, for example, in the case of Post Office clerks, superintendents and inspectors of the Garda have been more than 50 per cent.  In the three categories of teachers, the increase is over 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Up to now, Senators' allowances have stood at 75 per cent of Deputies' allowances, but in this Bill the proportion has been reduced to two-thirds which I think comes closer to a realistic appraisal of their respective duties.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to give the Taoiseach and Ministers an increase of ten per cent.  On that part of their remuneration which applies to their duties as Deputies, Ministers receive 50 per cent, so that in the aggregate they get an increase of 23? per cent.  The ten per cent increase will also apply to Parliamentary Secretaries, to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of each House and to the Attorney General.  The allowance made to the Leaders of Opposition parties to cover secretarial expenses is increased by 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 make changes in the existing law dealing with travelling expenses.  Those changes are to a great extent aimed at administrative convenience. One change where Leinster House is named as the focal point instead of Dublin removes an anomaly and will enable Deputies living in the city to claim expenses.  The implementation of this amendment will give rise to an increased charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>When the Money Resolution comes up for the approval of the House, I shall be able to give an estimate of the total cost of the Bill.  I commend the Bill to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, we in this Party take the view that the business a Deputy is called upon to do on behalf of his constituents has so varied over the years, and more particularly in recent years, that the method of reimbursement which was formerly the case no longer can have, or should have, any real relative effect.  It is a fact, as the Minister has said, that a Deputy is called upon to do things for his constituents <Col N="60" /> at all hours of the day and night.  Certainly a 40-hour week has no relevance at all for the Deputy who does his work to the best of his ability.</P>
      <P>That does not mean to say that we approve of the method adopted by certain Deputies in trying to ensure that their constituents believe that nothing can be done without the Deputies sticking their finger in the pie.  It is an undoubted fact that of the cases that come to any Deputy, at least 50 per cent would be dealt with by the officials in the ordinary way, if the Deputy did not intervene at all. Nevertheless, I regret to say that certain Deputies delight in trying to persuade their constituents that they have no chance of obtaining their rights unless a Deputy intervenes.  That type of pressurising by Deputies does no credit to this House, and tends to degrade the standards of public life rather than to raise them.</P>
      <P>It is, however, a fact that people now believe that if they want anything to which they are entitled, they must get a Deputy to intervene on their behalf.  That is not true.  However, it does not prevent a Deputy having to deal with the matter, because if he scrupulously tells his constituent this is a matter of right and not of favour and that the constituent will get it in any event, he will find that a less scrupulous colleague will pretend he did something about it and claim benefit for it.  Even though the Deputy concerned may know that without the slightest intervention by him, the housing grant will be paid, in his own defence, he must make representations to the Department concerned.  That is a fact which must be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, other cases in which a Deputy can put a point of view very much more clearly and succinctly than the constituent himself would be able to do.  Naturally enough, everybody is not able adequately and clearly to express his views without their being drawn out of him, and in this matter the Deputy has experience in these matters, enabling him frequently to get at the kernel of the matter and see that the kernel of the matter is properly brought before and considered by the Department official <Col N="61" /> concerned.  That is a duty and function which it is right and proper Deputies should exercise.</P>
    <P>All these things mean that the work of a member of this House, or indeed of the other House, is entirely different from what it was 20, 30, or 40 years ago.  As the Minister has clearly said, the primary duty of a Deputy is to deal with legislation and it is essential that Deputies do that, and they are doing it.  The fact of their being swamped in other regards in the manner in which I have indicated, does mean that the calls on their time are so many that it is essential to consider the matter from an entirely different angle from that of 20, 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, a Deputy cannot seek employment in the same way as an outside person because no employer will regard it as easy to fill the gap if the man concerned has to be away suddenly to act on a deputation, to transact business in the constituency or to attend this House, though I must confess I deprecate the other reference the Minister made in his statement.  I should not like it to be thought that increased payment was necessary in relation to honouring the memory of one's friends.  Be that as it may, however, the fact is that if the person who seeks the suffrages of the electorate is one likely to seek employment, he is debarred from that employment by being a member of the House.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, professional people are undoubtedly subject to heavy disabilities in the same way.  The Minister, I feel sure, was aware of that when in Opposition and I and my colleagues on these benches can bear witness to it in the same degree. It is an undoubted fact that the Deputy who does his work and his business properly certainly makes nothing out of being a Deputy.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, he loses pretty heavily.  That has been the general experience through the years.  Those who have other income, be it earned or otherwise, are aware that the Revenue Commissioners will see to it that the amount of the increase given in Oireachtas cheques by this measure will be more than suitably diminished. <Col N="62" /> It is a correct principle that once we have moved from the reimbursement of expenses under the old system of Deputies' and Senators' allowances of 40 years ago, we should equally move to the basis that what we are paid in this House is now subject, as are salaries outside, to income tax and other general taxation.</P>
    <P>These are things that must be considered in their proper perspective in relation to the Bill and I wish to put on record categorically that I do not pose at all as a Deputy who does more than his fair average share of work but that I am aware the amount of work I do as a Deputy would far outweigh even the increased allowance given in this Bill if I were free to give the same amount of service to my profession.  I know that is equally the experience of all of us who are professional people in any way.  It would not be in terms of this figure that one would be thinking if it were a question of reimbursement for what one takes away from one's profession by taking the part we are proud to take in the public life of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the House will have to consider in the future whether, the way things are going, with the work here becoming more and more a completely wholetime occupation, the assessment will ensure that Deputies are able to maintain their position in the constituencies <i>vis-à-vis</i> people who wish to spend their entire time going to funerals or endeavouring to persuade their constituents that nothing can be done without their intervention and who believe that that sort of thing elevates public life.</P>
    <P>I think I speak for the majority on my side of the House when I say that sort of thing degrades public life. Deputies should be at the service of their constituents where service is needed and should not try to claim an electoral advantage from services that are not needed.  After all, grants, blue cards, whatever they may be, are given to the people as of right by the legislation and by the appropriate orders of the various local authorities, and it should not be necessary for Deputies to intervene to see that people get those rights.  They are entitled to them <Col N="63" /> as of right, not as of favour.  The more that is stressed, the more it will inure to the benefit of public life as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not think the payments proposed for the Taoiseach and to other Ministers are excessive.  On the contrary, provided a Minister is worth his salt, provided he is a good Minister and is working properly as a Minister, the salaries payable under the Bill will not in any way be excessive.  I need hardly say there are certain people at whom I look on the benches opposite &mdash;I avoid being personal to anybody opposite&mdash;and who are not worth their places as Ministers; and just as a bad Deputy may perhaps be overpaid and a good Deputy underpaid, so too the bad Minister may be overpaid and the good Minister underpaid.</P>
    <P>It is proper also that the allowance given to the Opposition Parties should be increased because those allowances are utilised in so far as we are concerned&mdash;I do not know about other Parties&mdash;for the purpose of paying the staff it is necessary to retain to run the parliamentary Party and assist Deputies in their work in it.  That staff have properly been given increases and this amount must be added in order to meet it.</P>
    <P>There is something to be said for a suggestion the Minister threw out, without saying on which side he stands himself, that we have an official in various parts of the country.  As I understand it, that is another way of referring to what is commonly known, after the Swedish example, as the ombudsman.  It is a matter of some doubt whether that is the solution for our problems, but it is one everybody is anxious to consider at some time or other.  Whether it is the final solution is entirely another matter.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly a fact that, even with this increase in the salary or allowance, the Deputy who endeavours as far as possible to understand legislation and to answer the legitimate calls on him by his constituents certainly will not be overpaid, but far from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party agree with the proposals in this Bill.  In his <Col N="64" /> introductory speech, the Minister gave a fair and accurate description of the duties of Deputies, as apart from Ministers.  Repetition of what is said cannot be made too often in view of the misapprehension of some people in regard to a Deputy's work, both inside and outside the House, and in regard to the salary or allowance he is paid. When there was a proposal to increase the salaries of Deputies and Ministers, a certain section of the public were critical and cynical about it.  There has been no disagreement among the Parties in the House as to the merits of the proposals contained in the Bill. What the Minister is doing, and with which we all agree, is fixing a reasonable salary for Deputies.</P>
      <P>The idea should be dispelled from the mind of the public that Deputies are well paid.  At present a Deputy has £1,000 a year.  It is not for me to mention other trades and professions that have similar amounts, and, in many cases, more.  In addition to the £1,000, Deputies are told by some people that they also have their expenses. I shudder to think what would happen to the Deputy who makes his position as a Deputy a full-time occupation if he had to pay the various expenses a certain section would have him pay&mdash;expenses in regard to travel, subsistence and even postage.  Those who criticise proposals of this kind are those who seem to make the greatest demand on Deputies in a constituency.</P>
      <P>This proposal comes shortly after what has been described as the ninth round increase.  Although this proposal is not to be compared with any of the other rounds, as far as public representative are concerned, there have been only three rounds.  The Minister rightly said that we have been diffident in this matter of considering the increases that might be paid to Deputies over the past 40 years.  It is not pretended that this is compensation for an increase in the cost of living.  It can be described in trade union parlance as fixing the rate for the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about time this House and the country faced up to the fact that if public representatives are to be of a good calibre, there must be compensation <Col N="65" /> by way of a reasonable salary. As the Minister says, so far as public representatives here are concerned, the salaries offered to them are indeed the lowest in Europe.  Other people say that Deputies can engage in other occupations.  That may be true in respect of some Deputies who happen to be living in a certain area, or it may be true in respect of those who follow a certain profession or are in a certain business.  But from my experience of my own Party, the vast majority of them have devoted themselves entirely to the service of the people in their constituency and of the people of the country generally. How long would a man be tolerated in a job where he would tell the boss that he would give him a day's work this week or two days next week or that, when the Dáil closes down for the summer, he might be able to come back as well?</P>
    <P>There are many demands on Deputies, particularly in relation to Departmental work.  In recent times Deputies have had to concern themselves with very many more things, much more than ten, 20 or 30 years ago when the number of days the Dáil sat, I understand, was considerably less than it is now.  I believe, therefore, that the proposals in regard to Deputies, particularly, are justified.  I know Deputies will agree they are justified and that this is an attempt to fix a reasonable rate for a position which carries such responsibility both inside and outside the House.</P>
    <P>My Party also agree with the proposals in respect of Ministers' salaries. One cannot measure adequately the responsibility thrust upon the head of the Government and the various Ministers. To many of us it often seems peculiar that those employed, for example, in semi-State companies have salaries 50 per cent or 60 per cent greater than that of the Taoiseach.  No matter what we may think about them politically, all the Ministers have great responsibility and some of them have tremendous responsibility.  For example, the Minister for Finance has tremendous responsibility in the planning of his Budget.  On his proposals will depend whether we have progress <Col N="66" /> or lack of progress.  A decision to impose a tax may have tremendous effects on the economy and on various sections and individuals in it.  If a Minister has such responsibility, he should be at least paid a salary comparable with that paid to individuals who have much less responsibility than the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Industry and commerce and certainly the Taoiseach himself.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is the snide remark made by the cynics&mdash;whether they believe it or not&mdash;and the people who are generally critical of public representatives. They are critical not so much of their salaries but of the type of human animal they are.  When they talk about a salary of £1,000 per year, they are inclined to say to themselves or their friends: &ldquo;There is much more in it than that; these fellows can make a lot more money on the side&rdquo;.  I think every one of the 144 Deputies in the Dáil, and those who were formerly in the Dáil and are still alive, can repeat what the Minister for Finance has said, that the majority come out rather poorer than they were when they went into public life.</P>
    <P>I do not know what handouts and that sort of thing amount to in other countries but I know everybody in this House, particularly Deputies of my own Party and myself who have been in political life for the past 20 years, knows there are certainly no financial bouquets or handouts to public representatives in this country.</P>
    <P>As far as allowances to the Opposition Leaders are concerned&mdash;I do not know whether Deputy Dillon will agree with me or not&mdash;whether they are to the First, Second, or Third Opposition, they are far too small.  The Minister will know what I mean when I say that in reference to the allowance which is paid to the First Opposition and Second Opposition Party.  I believe the allowance that is given to the First, Second and Third Opposition Party could indeed be greater than it is.</P>
    <P>These Parties have to concern themselves with research into this, that and the other thing, trying to discover information <Col N="67" /> with regard, particularly, to the EEC countries and to conduct research, not alone in this country but outside it.  This research could not be paid for with the amount being provided for the Opposition Parties.  The Government say in debates, especially debates of an international character, that they have a very efficient research staff at their disposal.  They have the entire Civil Service at their disposal. I am not saying that such facilities as the assistance of the entire Civil Service should be provided for Deputy Dillon's Party or my Party.  When one has regard to the allowance that is proposed, it can be readily seen that not a very big staff can be employed.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, must have the advantage they have but I think consideration also should be given to Parliament as a whole and to the idea of trying to make Parliament effective by providing an allowance sufficient for any research work we consider necessary to keep us abreast of information which should be available to all public representatives. The Library in Dáil Éireann may contain a certain amount of information and we get from various Ministers, particularly the Minister for Transport and Power, a tremendous amount of information.  All that in itself is not sufficient.  I am not advocating this matter but in future the allocation of moneys for the purpose of research and general clerical assistance to Opposition Parties should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>I know, in my own case, one of the phrases that has been used and will continue to be used is: &ldquo;Those people in Leinster House are fixing themselves up again.&rdquo;  It does not make any difference what the criticism is: it does not make any difference to us at all. We have, in the heel of the hunt, to account to the people who elected us, whether we do right or wrong in Parliament.  Every four years approximately, I have to go back to the people of Wexford, the Minister for Finance has to go back to the people of Wexford, Deputy Dillon has to go to the people of Monaghan and my colleagues here have to go to the <Col N="68" /> people of Waterford and Meath.  Those people will tell us whether we have done right or wrong.  Every one of us &mdash;here I am talking about us as individuals&mdash;is elected by people who will ensure that we do a good job as public representatives.  Everybody will agree that the man who does a good job should be paid for the responsibility he has and the work he is prepared to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill to give increased allowances to Deputies and Senators.  The former Deputy Murphy, who was elected by the unemployed of Dublin, was an unemployed man who came in here full of hope and within a year he handed in his resignation.  He did this because of lack of money and nothing else.  At that time, as recently as six years ago, members of this House had £12 10s. a week.  Imagine a man like Murphy, who had no business, having to keep his home and children, pay the maximum differential rent and pay for a hall for the unemployed people who elected him out of his allowance. Murphy could not pay his grocery bill.  I know that because he spoke to me the night before he left.  He liked a drink but he was so desperate that he used to hide himself when he saw his friends.</P>
      <P>This House is not for gentlemen farmers and aristocrats.  It is for all types of employed people, working class people and all sorts of people.  In fact, James Connolly was the first to advocate a substantial allowance because he foresaw the future when the workers, to a large extent, would be public representative.  How could they become public representatives if they could not afford to keep their families? In the past, only aristocrats were members of Parliament.  Nowadays it is largely workers, and well-to-do workers, who are members of this assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Independents are concerned, we actually get less than the Party members because we have to pay all our own expenses at elections. That must all come out of an Independent's hand.  An Independent, in order to have any chance of being elected, <Col N="69" /> must also be a member of a local body.  Let nobody say we get in here easily.  An Independent must not only work hard but must pay his way in municipal and Dáil elections.  When you take all that into consideration, it does not pay us, but we love it.</P>
    <P>I love political life.  I know some bureaucrats outside have been sniping at us about getting £500 and they are only getting 12 per cent.  There have been nine increases since 1946 not only for all workers but for all civil servants and there have been only two increases for Dáil members.  Between 1947 and 1964, wages, calculated by reference to 23 industrial occupations, have increased by 183 per cent.  Skilled industrial workers have received an increase of 183 per cent since 1947.  It is because we pay ourselves that we shied away from doing it.  We acted in cowardly fashion.  Some of the leaders here thought that they would create a bad image among the begrudgers and they sacrificed some of their members, instead of ignoring the begrudgers and doing justice.</P>
    <P>However, we seem to have grown up and we are agreed now that justice should be done.  Actually, what members are getting is simply what they have been denied since 1947 but they are not getting as much as industrial workers have got.  If members of the House were members of a trade union and if it were some other body that gave us an increase instead of ourselves, and if we had representatives to make our case, we would probably be demanding, not merely the increase that others have got, but retrospective payment.  Do not forget that all other people&mdash;and I am not merely talking about workers &mdash;all the higher civil servants&mdash;got these nine increases.  Assistant principal officers, principal officers, higher executive officers, all the top brass of local government and the State, got the nine increases.  An assistant principal of a local authority gets £1,500. In local government, salaries rise to £3,000 or £4,000.  City managers get £3,000 or £4,000.  They have got the full money which Dáil Deputies were denied because some of the leaders thought they would lose a few miserable <Col N="70" /> votes because they thought begrudgers would be giving out.</P>
    <P>A small measure of justice has been granted, but not full justice.  If full justice were to be done and if we were members of a trade union, we would not merely be looking for what others have got, but we would be looking for it retrospectively, which we are not doing.  Although a small measure of justice is now being done, we are losing a substantial sum through having been denied the increase given to other people over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I am only making the case for the poorer Deputy.  I am visualising such people as the former Deputy Murphy. I should like to know that if the Deputy had no job, he could keep his wife and family and have a little money which he needs because he cannot ignore the public.  If he does, he will not be re-elected.</P>
    <P>I have listened to Deputy Sweetman talking about the lengths to which Deputies go.  The public force a Deputy to do lots of things he does not want to do.  In fact, I know some very able men, such as Seán MacBride, who cannot secure election because they do not go around working for the people. A Deputy has to do that.  Competition forces him to do it.  The most popular Deputies, those who get the best vote, apart from the brass, who will always get the No. 1 vote among the hard core of Party supporters, have to work hard, independent of the Dáil.  It is well known that it is those Deputies who are also local representatives and who work hard who will be re-elected. A Deputy does a wholetime job and competition forces him to do all sorts of work.</P>
    <P>While I know that certain promises are made that certain things will be done when they cannot be done, nevertheless, as has been said, Deputies know how to go about things and the public do not.  In that way a Deputy can help people considerably.  For instance, I get hundreds of letters from constituents seeking houses.  Very often they are denied a house due to their own ignorance.  They may have had another child or two children which would entitle them to a house and they <Col N="71" /> may not have conveyed that information to the housing authority.</P>
    <P>I am merely pointing out how Deputies can be helpful to the public. I do not want to enlarge on this matter. I say that justice is being done and we should ignore the begrudgers.</P>
    <P>There is one further comment I should like to make.  The members of this House ought at least to attend the House.  I am not suggesting that they should sit in the House all day.</P>

      <P>Our duties have been referred to here and the public have made comments.  I suggest that there should be some form of attendance record here and that Members should at least come in and sign a book to show their attendance.  I do not think it fair that some Deputies who may not be seen here for two weeks or more should draw their salaries like everyone else who has been attending and keeping this place going.  While I would make allowance for some period of absence, in the case of prolonged absence, there should be some deduction.</P>
      <P>Apart from that comment, I would say that as far as the Members of this House are concerned, this business does not pay.  It is a job of love as far as I am concerned.  Certainly, if I wanted to make money, I would get out of this House and resume the business I left, where I would make twice as much.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Sweetman that certain Deputies appear to take on more than they need, intervene where they are not required, and so on, and certain people appear to think that they will not get their legal rights unless they call on a Deputy. The peculiar thing is that my experience as a Minister is that that is prevalent in certain counties and not in others.  I would conclude from that that either the people in these counties demand that service from their Deputies or maybe I should reverse <Col N="72" /> matters and say that the Deputies in those counties offer their services to the people.  I do not know which.  But I would indeed welcome any suggestion, as thrown out by Deputy Sweetman, that would make it unnecessary for Deputies to intervene in that way and also try to convince people that it is unnecessary for them to go to the Deputy to get what is their legal right.</P>
      <P>It must be said, of course, that where a person is refused under some scheme, he generally believes that he has been wronged and, of course, he will go to somebody to try to get matters right and sometimes a Deputy does get matters right because he is a better advocate than the person himself and also because the Deputy may have some facts from the applicant that were not on his application form and therefore the Deputy may succeed where the applicant has failed.  That being reported in the district induces other people to call on the Deputy for intervention of this kind.  So it is a difficult problem to know what we can do about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish was able to support my statement that certain Deputies have to live on their allowance from the Dáil because it is not possible for them to get another job which would be remunerated.  I agree with Deputy Corish that there are cynics who say that Deputies have more than they get by way of remuneration, that they have other ways of making money.  There is an old Irish proverb which deals with people of that kind, which says &ldquo;Sás a dhéanta a chuimhnigh air&rdquo;&mdash; the person who thinks that has a bad mind and the person who has a bad mind is capable of doing the act himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the allowance to Opposition Parties, this, of course, was introduced some years ago&mdash;I do not remember exactly what year it was&mdash;but it was fixed at that time on what might be called an empirical basis.  We had no experience to go on.  We could only make a guess at what would be required by Opposition Parties to enable them to do their duties properly and, naturally, the Minister for Finance at the time did not want to make it too high.  There has been a certain number of years of <Col N="73" /> working.  We would have some experience to go upon and perhaps the matter should be investigated and examined with a view to seeing if this service could be improved in any way. That, I take it, will be a matter for another time, not by way of amendment to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few other points to which I should like to refer on this Estimate one of which concerns my constituency very much and it is the question of wheat.  The Minister in his opening remarks stated that, basically, the price of wheat in 1964 would be the same as in 1963.  If the Minister said that, basically, the price of wheat for 1964 would be the same as for 1957-58, I do not think he would be making any mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, in the Minister's and in the Government's mind, there is to be no seventh, eighth, or ninth round of increases for the growers of wheat. We have just been discussing a Bill here on which these rounds were discussed, and the various people who got them and who did not get them. The growers of wheat have not got any of these increases.  No wonder the acreage in 1963 has dropped to 132,700 acres, as against 480,000 in 1958.  That is, a little more than half the acreage of wheat grown in 1958 was grown last year.  What is the reason?  I feel the main reason is price.  The people are not getting the price.  They can be <Col N="74" /> stopped producing any crop by reducing the price.  The amount of money is the same as in 1958 but we must look at the value of money, which has depreciated in the meantime. Therefore, the farmers are not getting nearly the same amount of money per barrel for wheat in 1963-64 as they got in 1958.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>They have also, in the meantime, had to bear, through the levy, the cost of the disposal of the surplus millable wheat.  Owing to emigration, the estimated requirements now are 765,000 tons, as against, I think, 320,000 tons in 1958.  They have to bear the cost of disposal, so the Government have relieved themselves of that.  But they have also had to bear something much heavier.  When there is a bad harvest, or an extra amount of wheat grown, or where any surplus at all exists, the millers crack down on the amount of wheat taken into the mill.  In the past year 91 per cent of the wheat sent to the mill was rated as millable and was purchased on that basis.  That was easy when there was a reduced acreage of wheat and also a substantially reduced yield.  It is very easy when the quantity is in scarce supply to have a price, and have conditions of sale made easier.  But where there is a surplus of wheat, as in 1960-61 and at the same time a bad harvest, we all know the treatment the farmers got at the hands of the millers and we know the unsympathetic Government we had towards the growers.</P>
      <P>We expected that the Minister for Agriculture would be the one man who would see that the farmers of that time got their wheat disposed of.  We know how little sympathy these people got.  It is no wonder there is a reduction in the quantity of wheat grown in the past year.  I suppose they said they would have to take so many men off the land so that the people remaining could get a higher income.  Therefore, the policy of the Government as regards wheat has been to reduce the quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated on Thursday <Col N="75" /> evening last, when I raised the matter of the price of barley, that farmers were getting a 5 per cent increase in price.  The Minister said that was an agreed price with joint committees of agriculture.  I wonder is the price of wheat also an agreed price with joint committees of agriculture.  I doubt it very much.  I would appeal to the Minister, and to the Government, to review the price of wheat, in view of the increased costs to the growers.</P>
    <P>This week we have seen a substantial jump of 12 points in the cost of living over the past 12 months, and, to make allowance for that, I would appeal to the Minister, and the Government, to give a reasonable increase to those people who must at the present time grow this crop.  It is the only practical cash crop they can grow. They grow feeding barley even at the reduced price because, whatever happens, they will be able to sell the barley and will not have to go through the various tests, such as maltose and all the final tests, which have to be undergone in the case of wheat.  On any of these tests wheat can be turned down.  People have turned to barley growing, not because they get a return from growing barley, but because of the hardship they have suffered at the hands of the millers over the past number of years, and they want to be sure they will be able to get the price available, and not left as they were with the wheat.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to review the price of wheat and the price of barley.  Barley has been increased by 5 per cent.  Ten years ago the price of barley was 48/- as against 40/now. Still, farmers have to meet increased costs of machinery, and so on. Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister to give this matter serious thought.</P>
    <P>As I said last year, I disapprove of the assistance given by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the rationalisation scheme evolved by the Irish Flour Millers Association.  That rationalisation scheme meant a closure of six mills in the first instance and two later.  Two have been closed in <Col N="76" /> my constituency.  The owners of these mills have always given good service and have had good relations with the local farming community.  These relations meant a lot, especially when the harvests were not as good as they might be.  I regret the Minister's approval of this.  After all, without his approval I doubt whether that rationalisation scheme could have been carried out.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that the Irish Flour Millers Association is only an association in name.  Two combines have taken complete control and dictated to the whole industry.  The millers have been allowed by the Government to create a fund over the years which is now been used under the guise of compensation to close down the mills in the country.  This fund is being used by the larger mills. If we cannot beat them we will buy them, and buying them they are.  I understand that fund is still being very substantially contributed to.  I believe any miller exceeding his quota in the year has to pay 10 per cent per sack for each sack of flour milled over and above his quota.  Their accounts are subject to examination by the accountants of the Association.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and through the Minister, the Government, to have an investigation carried out into the activities of the Flour Millers Association.  As I have said, the two big boys dictate and the other millers have no say at the meetings.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I should like to refer is in relation to the old days when wheat was imported and no Irish wheat was grown until we got the newer types.  All flour milled in this country was milled from imported wheat and it was necessary to differentiate between the imported price and the home price.  Now, when 75 per cent of the wheat is being produced next to the very country miller's door, these people still insist that the differential should be maintained.  They insist that the people down the country should have to pay 2/- per sack more for their flour than the people in the big cities where the ports are.  The day for that should be gone.</P>
    <P>On the subject of land reclamation, <Col N="77" /> we all regard the Dillon Land Project as one of the finest schemes ever introduced in this country.  The Minister mentioned that it is going ahead at an active pace and that, during the past year, 90,000 acres were reclaimed. I am glad of that but I think much more could be done.  It is the general feeling that farming is under-capitalised. A lot of our farmers who can pay their way are afraid to raise debts fearing, as they have good reason to fear, bad harvests and other losses. Those people like to keep themselves out of debt.  They will not avail even of the credit facilities that are available. If they would do so, there would be increased production in general on their farms.</P>
    <P>The Government have dropped Section B of the Land Project.  Under Section A, the farmer contributes his share and the Government contribute their subsidy.  Under Section B, the Government paid the farmer's share but put it on his annuity.  That provided capital so that the farmer had not to finance the reclamation of his land and he was put into a better position to pay back the annuity over the years.</P>
    <P>Some farmers, even smaller farmers, would have to provide from £100 to £300 in cash and we all know that only well-off farmers could do that.  By cutting out Section B of the Land Rehabilitation Scheme, the Government have refused that credit to the farmers.  The Minister may think I am using this argument because I speak from the Opposition benches but it is a very important matter. I have here a copy of the <i>Kilkenny People</i> of Friday, 12th June, 1964.  In a news item headed <i>Waste And Wet Land A Shame,</i> we read what a supporter of the Minister's Party, Mr. J. Ryan, urged at a meeting of the Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture on the previous Monday.  The report is as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Ryan, at Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture meeting on Monday urged the reintroduction of Section B of the Land Rehabilitation Scheme.  Dairying, he said, was a most vital part of the agricultural <Col N="78" /> economy, and a year ago he moved a resolution asking that Section B of the Land Rehabilitation Scheme be reintroduced.</P>
    <P>He would also like to see a review of the grant per acre for reclamation, since pipes were going up every day, and wages had been doubled since the scheme was first implemented.  Having regard to the plan for economic expansion, he thought it a shame to have waste and wet land in the country today.</P>
    <P>Such land might not be suitable for tillage but it would be suitable for the cow, and for the dairy farmer, and he felt the section heretofore providing for grants for the drainage of such land should be reintroduced.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan said small farmers could not afford to carry waste land. It was impossible, and it was vital that his income should be maintained at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>Apparently there was general agreement about the matter at that meeting of the committee.  I add my voice to the plea of Mr. J. Ryan that Section B of the Land Project be brought back for the reasons I have stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should at the outset like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the simple and efficient way the Estimate was presented to the House.  If I sound any note against it, it is because I think two very important items have been overlooked.  There is the very important item of extensive drainage in addition to the Land Project.  I refer to the drainage of small streams and rivers which do not come within the ambit of arterial drainage or rural improvement schemes.  There is a great necessity for action to deal with these matters which are causing so much trouble particularly to some of our best land.  If this should be the duty of the Land Commission then the Minister and his Department should press to have a scheme devised to bring about the desired improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a total of 15½ million acres <Col N="79" /> of which over 10½ million are arable. Our land is a very valuable asset.  At the moment, the production figure is so ridiculously low as to be practically non-existent.  There is an over-all figure of £11 per acre for our arable land, whereas it has been shown that up-to-date farmers can get as much as £50 or £60 per acre.  A plan should be devised to achieve the maximum output from our land or to bring it to a reasonable standard so that those engaged on the land may get a reasonable living out of it and more people can get back to the land.</P>
    <P>A total of 383,415 males are engaged in agriculture.  Of these 294,367 are family labour and 89,048 are otherwise. The average over-all wage is £7 per week for these people.  If we could get the type of output from the land which we should get, it should be quite easy to bring that wage up to £10, £12, or even £14 per week.</P>
    <P>Consider the different Provinces.  In Leinster, there are 109,324 people on the land; in Munster, 127,257; in Connacht, 99,478 and in Ulster, 47,356. The output in Leinster, which has very little more people on the land than Connacht, is £67½ million, while Connacht has only £33½ million.  Ulster has £16½ million but there are only 47,000 people on the land.  If it were possible to increase the overall output by a further £10 an acre, it would give an increase of about 50 per cent in wages and, in addition, employ a further 50,000 on the land.</P>
    <P>On Monday week last, with the Kerry County Committee of Agriculture, I visited a farm run by the Institute in Herbertstown, County Limerick.  The land there is devoted entirely to grass, some of it old lea and some of it, about a quarter, is new.  It was ploughed up about two years ago. The experts there found that the old grass, heavily manured, is giving a much greater return.  They have, on 64 acres, 35 cows, 35 yearlings, 35 calves, and that acreage is providing their entire feeding in grass and silage.  Some extraordinary facts were revealed to us. We learned that the price of grass per ton fed to the animals off the land, <Col N="80" /> was £6, while in the case of silage, it went up to £15 and the cost of purchasing feeding stuffs as against that was £30 a ton.  Those figures certainly point to the great necessity for increasing our grass output&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the best and cheapest method possible and on the most modern lines.  This holding is laid out in small paddocks.  The calves are first put to grass for two days; the cows follow for three days; and the yearlings are put in to clean up for a further three days.  They are rotated from paddock to paddock and they get plenty of feeding from the 64 acres. Incidentally, this is ordinary land, not top-class land and not poor land but with a heavy type of soil off which the animals must be taken after the end of October as otherwise they would cut the grass to pieces.  No extra quality material has been put into the farm. The cows were ordinary cows purchased at the fair and the methods that every farmer is following up and down the country are followed there. It is a pity that we have not got any more of these places.  We could do with one or two in each county and they would set a great headline for our farmers and show them modern methods for getting the best out of grass and the best methods of managing their farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross value of our agricultural output amounts to £193 million from a total of ten million arable acres.  Of that, only some £110 millions is directly off the land, the larger part of the balance being made up by bacon production raised from imported material and material we grow ourselves. I have heard many references in this House to the decline in the population and these references point particularly to the west.  In Kerry, Clare and Galway, the actual reduction is approximately four per cent. Against that, Wexford, Tipperary and Laois have the same, whilst the balance of the midlands, Waterford, Kilkenny and Wicklow and the others, have 3½ per cent.  The only county which has retained much of its population is Offaly where the figure is 0.8 <Col N="81" /> per cent.  Some of the northern and north-western counties have a figure of six or seven per cent.  It is quite obvious that the drain from the land has come from the better farms, the better plains, if you like, and this will create a very serious problem in regard to the increased production we will get from good land.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that we will have to get 40,000 or 50,000 people back in the central plains if we are to get any large increase in agricultural output. We cannot do it without labour and I do not know what means we can adopt to get labour back on the land.  To my mind, the two reductions we gave in regard to rates were not a good step because that reduction certainly will not bring about an increase in production. It may have been an easement for the people concerned but I wonder if the millions involved would not have been better employed by using them as a form of wage relief; in other words, in the form of reliefs granted to farmers who employed extra labour.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais are doing an exceptionally good job, and as I stated on a previous occasion, I should like to see many more of their pilot schemes in operation.  I do not think any extra cost to the Exchequer would be involved.  The Minister should seriously consider an increase in this type of scheme.  People by and large are anxious to obtain the maximum knowledge and there is no greater education for a farmer than to be able to see what is being done.  This is certainly true of the growing of grass.  He would learn very quickly from the methods being employed.</P>
    <P>In Kerry, we are making fair progress and the Abbeydorney co-operative have made premises available, under committee instructors, for classes for young farmers between the ages of 17 and 21.  They are doing a great job of work and even in the short while this has been in operation the advantages gained can already be seen in the parish of Abbeydorney.  We are looking forward to extending that type of service to other parts of Kerry.  It is worth extending to other parts of the country.  The pilot schemes which have <Col N="82" /> been undertaken in our county by the Government to get smallholders organised into co-operative groups to improve their position out of the meagre means at their disposal should set a headline for the western seaboard. We are looking forward to big things and hoping this will develop into something useful.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the price of wheat.  In my county we believe the price paid for grain, particularly barley, which we are compelled to buy for the feeding of our stock, is much too high.  The price is higher than that at which it can be imported. The economy of Kerry and the entire western seaboard was maintained many years ago by the importation of yellow meal.  The smallholders were able to feed their stock on that very cheap feeding material.  If the smallholder in Kerry is to be maintained at all, so that he will be able to hold on to his bit of land, that cheap feeding material must be made available to him.  I would prefer to use the material that is grown in our own country but what is channelled to the western seaboard should be subsidised.</P>
    <P>We believe that the grain can be imported at as much as £2 or £3 a ton less than we are paying at the moment. That £2 or £3 would make all the difference to the smallholder and allow him to go in for a limited number of pigs.  If the bigger people turn out 400 or 500 pigs and make £1 a pig, they are doing all right, but if the smallholder who can keep only six to ten pigs makes a £1 a pig, there is not much of a living in it for him. Therefore, if home grown material is to be used, it must be made available cheaply to the people on the western seaboard or, alternatively, let them have the cheapest materials they can get to enable them to produce economically and to sell the produce in the world market at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a position which is regarded with some anxiety in County Kerry.  As regards our insemination centres, it would appear that as soon as the very good animals we have down there, are approved, they are removed from the insemination centre.  This has been reported <Col N="83" /> to me by some farmers and if this is the case, it is a very serious position. In some cases recently animals were removed to Dundalk and other parts of the country.  The very best animals, the very best strains, should be left with us because it will have a very big effect on our stock in the future. These animals should not be removed into other areas where people do not hold the offspring to the same extent as we do in the west.  I would ask the Minister, if the information I give him is correct, to try to have that position corrected.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Herbertstown farm, one statement that impressed us was that 3 cwt. of phosphate, 2 cwt. of potash, and 1 cwt. of sulphate was used in January-February last and that this was followed up in the month of April with 5 cwt. of nitrogen, totalling 11 cwt. to the acre to get a very large output of grass.  This would seem an extraordinary amount of material but it certainly got results at a very low cost and it is an item that should get plenty of publicity for the benefit of our farmers throughout the country.  In view of the fact that the Minister is satisfied that nitrogen is important as it would appear to be from the Herbertstown scheme, and if it will be used to a large extent a case could be made for a subsidy.</P>
    <P>I would impress upon the Minister the necessity, particularly in the mountainous counties, for an intermediate drainage scheme.  There are thousands of acres of land in Kerry completely under water.  There is an urgent necessity for the cleaning of the small rivers.  There is no scheme available at the moment and we would have to wait 40 or 50 years for arterial drainage to take effect.  I would ask the Minister to have a scheme inaugurated at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement is very well presented and is a most informative and helpful document.  I do hope that all of us have given information to the Minister and to his staff which will help to bring about better conditions for our farmers and for the <Col N="84" /> people generally.  They need a lot of technical assistance and advice at the moment.  If we can get them to channel their efforts together, I think we can make a better rural Ireland for the benefit of all engaged on the land and in agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is remarkable to hear a Fianna Fáil Deputy getting so enthusiastic about grass.  I remember when if you mentioned grass to a Fianna Fáil Deputy, he would swoon away in horror.  I suppose it is never too late for them to learn and so I listened with emotion to Deputy O'Connor expressing his admiration of the grass he saw in County Limerick on the Foras Tionscal farm. It is late in the day that he has wakened up to the value of grass to our farmers, but better late than never.</P>
      <P>This Estimate has been discussed with some acrimony and some scurrility by certain Fianna Fáil Deputies: that does not surprise me.  I was amused that some of the protagonists of wheat, notably Deputy Gibbons, were commenting adversely on the record of the Government of which I was Minister for Agriculture in connection with wheat, but facts speak more eloquently than theories.  In 1957, which is the last year in which I had responsibility for the Department of Agriculture during the sowing season, there were 406,300 acres of wheat grown in this country and incidentally every barrel of that wheat was bought and paid for by the millers and milled into flour.  In 1963, after seven years of Fianna Fáil enthusiasm, the acreage of wheat is 232,700 acres and a very considerable percentage of the crop for the past few years has been rejected by the millers, sold for feed and a levy imposed upon the growers in order to finance the sale as feed of the wheat rejected by the millers.</P>
      <P>Another thing Fianna Fáil Deputies might remember with emotion is that in 1957, 406,300 acres of wheat were grown here and there were no inspectors surrounding the ditches of the farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by that.  There were no inspectors, guards or bulldozers to break down farmers' gates.  More interesting was the fact that every barrel of wheat produced was bought and paid for by the millers and milled into flour, and there was no levy on the farmers who grew it to pay for what the millers chose to reject.  Even more interesting still, the price which was described as so grossly inadequate in 1957 is the price payable in 1963, although over that period the value of money has very materially declined, so that in fact the present price is substantially less from the farmers' point of view than what it was in 1957.  Such inconsistencies do not bother Fianna Fáil.  I often wonder how long they can persuade their supporters to believe the falsehoods on which they seek to feed them.</P>
      <P>In considering this Estimate, one of the most important facts to bear in mind, and a fact which is too often forgotten, is that with all the talk we hear about industrial exports, with all the money we pour into industrial exports, in the past 12 months our agricultural exports amount to £124 million while the total of industrial exports was no more than £43 million. I quote these figures for the purpose of recalling what is too often forgotten, that agriculture is our greatest industry.  It employs more people; it earns more money; and it generates more exports than any other industry in Ireland and all its output is based on the raw materials of our own land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is to be, as there must be, an expansion of exports, we must ignore no source of exports, however small.  We must stimulate every industry that will contribute to the total of our exports but it seems to me as plain as a pikestaff that the great potential for increased exports is in the land and in agriculture, and if we can expand our agricultural output, as I have often pointed out here before, we come face to face with the equation that inasmuch as the total output of our land heretofore has been divided from the point of view of ultimate disposal as to one-third consumed on the farm, one-third consumed in the towns and cities and one-third exported, if we increase the <Col N="86" /> total of our exports, since our people are one of the best fed people in the world, the prospect of consumption rising on our farms and in our towns and cities is relatively remote and the entire increase in our production will find its way into export channels. If you could increase the total output of the land by 100 per cent, you would increase the total of agricultural exports by about 400 per cent, and if you increased agricultural output by only 50 per cent, you would increase total agricultural exports by about 100 per cent or more.  That is a factor we should bear constantly in mind in preparing our plans for increased exports in future.</P>
    <P>What then do we need for increased output from the land?  I suggest we have available all the resources requisite to procure that increased output, if we would but employ them. We provided the new agricultural research institutes which was a very necessary basis for increased agricultural output.  But research is of no avail if the fruits of that research are not communicated to the farmers on the land.  I want to direct the attention of the House to a very significant fact, that is, the gross inadequacy of the agricultural advisory services.  Sooner or later this will be remedied.  I was in the process of remedying it when I was Minister for Agriculture.  The work I was doing in that direction the Minister is now in process of dismantling. My purpose was to supplement the existing advisory services supplied by the county committees of agriculture by additional advisory services based on parish agents under the direction of the Department of Agriculture itself.  I am sure I was right in that.  I know that the results achieved in the areas where parish agents functioned dramatically demonstrated what could be done if effective advisory services were allowed to function.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the comparison between the inadequacy of our advisory services and those obtaining in other European countries.  In Belgium they have one advisory officer for every 5,400 hectares of land.  In Denmark they have one advisory officer for every 1,200 hectares <Col N="87" /> of land.  In the Federal Republic of Germany, they have one advisory officer for every 6,500 hectares.  In Ireland there is one adviser for every 11,200 hectares.  In the Netherlands there is one agricultural adviser for every 1,900 hectares.  The only countries in Europe where they have fewer advisory services than we have here are France and the United Kingdom, but in the United Kingdom they had only 312 holdings per advisory officer, which shows that the average size of the holding in Great Britain is very much greater than it is in the other countries to which I have referred, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, we have one advisory officer to every 575 holdings.  In Denmark, there is one for every 255 holdings; in Belgium, one for 760 holdings; and, in the Netherlands, one for every 191 holdings.  It is quite obvious that one of the great obstacles to achieving the output potential of our land is the want of technical knowhow. Anyone who has any knowledge of rural Ireland sees that staring him in the face every day.  My experience was that those who most vigorously opposed the extension of advisory services in rural Ireland were those who stood most urgently in need of advice themselves or else were people who knew nothing about the land at all.  When one tried to provide technical assistance for farmers, large and small, one always came up against a certain element who were inclined to denigrate and speak contemptuously of technical men or agricultural advisers and, almost invariably, you will find that those who speak most contemptuously of such personnel are themselves the least efficient farmers in the area in which they live.</P>
    <P>I take the view very strongly that, even if we had adequate advisory services, giving advice, particularly to small farmers unless they can afford to take it, merely creates exasperation and I have not the slightest doubt that there is no more fruitful way in which we could use our resources at the present time than to say to the farmers that those of them who are prepared to plan for expanded production in <Col N="88" /> consultation with the advisory services would have made available to them credit free of interest up to £1,000 per holding.  I think the cost of that to the State would be relatively trivial.  I think it would be the certain means of persuading farmers who urgently need technical advice to avail of it and the Department of Agriculture could rest satisfied that they were not wasting their time offering advice to people not financially circumstanced to avail of it. I hope some day to have the opportunity of making these services available to our people and, when we do, they will of course ultimately be adopted in due course by Fianna Fáil who will blandly forget the long, weary struggle involved in educating them into a realisation of the necessity for such services and the necessity for such credit and the valuable contribution that such credit and services can make to the total output of the land.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if people fully realise what farm building still requires to be done if we are to expand our livestock industry as we ought to expand it.  I do not deride the Minister for his failure to realise the target that he set himself in 1958, the target of raising the cow population of the country by, I think, 1,500,000.  I think that was the figure.  That figure was missed by 150,000 but, as I say, I do not deride the Minister for that.  I think, however, that he underestimated entirely the building that required to be done in the way of cowhouses and shelters if a target of that kind was to be reached.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons apparently misunderstood what I said because at column 1205 of volume 210 of the Official Report of 11th June last he said:</P>
    <P>One of the first things I have ever heard in this House was Deputy Dillon saying that he had left the country in the position that there were more cows, more sheep, more cattle generally than at any time since the famine.</P>
    <P>That is not what I said.  I said the point of departure which I had to start with, when I became Minister for Agriculture, was that there were in <Col N="89" /> this country fewer cows, fewer pigs, fewer sheep than at any time since the famine but, when I left office, there were more cows, more pigs, and more sheep than there ever had been in the country in its previous history.</P>

      <P>It is not to the advantage of anyone to discuss the circumstances of the agricultural industry 30 years ago, because no one knows, and no one gives a damn, except the historians, what the circumstances were. What matters is what they are now, and what they will be in the years that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that the policy of one more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough, is as relevant today as it was 40 years ago.  We are all agreed on that now. We saw many acrimonious scenes in the House when that philosophy was preached from this or the other side of the House.  We saw Fianna Fáil Deputies burst blood vessels all over the House, and declare that such a proposition was high treason, that it meant the bullock for the land and the man for the road.  The fact that we are all agreed on this fundamental policy gives the agricultural industry a far better prospect than it had when Fianna Fáil, in their salad days, described it as being as daft as a halfpenny watch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should maximise our livestock population to the limit of the capacity of the land to carry it.  We must have regard to the fact that this will involve an immense investment in farm building. I put it most strenuously to the Minister that unless the farmers, and particularly the small farmers, are in a position to get credit on terms which they believe they can afford to pay, there is no prospect of getting farm buildings put up.  There is no use in sending in agricultural advisers to point out what Deputy O'Connor learned only recently during his trip to Limerick, that if a farm of 50 or 60 acres is suitably treated and properly fenced, it would be possible to double the cow population.  There is no use in doubling the cow population if the farmer has no place to put them.  The farmer may say: &ldquo;I have tying for only ten cows and what is the use of telling me to keep 20 or 25 cows if I have no place suitable to house them and no facilities for milking them?&rdquo;<Col N="91" /> It is possible for a small farmer to milk ten cows by hand, and if we induce him to increase his herd to 25 cows, it is impossible for him to milk them unless he has milking machines. He must equip himself with milking machines and milking parlours and that will involve a substantial capital cost.  He cannot increase the carrying capacity of his land without considerable capital cost and investment in fencing and fertilisers.  We must tell him that we are prepared to undertake&mdash;in consultation with the advisory service so that there will not be any wastage&mdash;that money will be made available to him, that it will not be a millstone around his neck, that he can pay it over 20 or 25 years, with no interest, because we want to get agriculture moving in the right direction, and keep it moving in the right direction, without the detestable prospect of another 70,000 people being swept off the land.</P>
    <P>The aim of agricultural policy should be to keep people on the land. I am convinced that can be done.  I believe all this cod of sweeping people off the land, of consolidating holdings, and altering the whole social pattern of rural life, is insanity.  It is being sold by the theorists who have no fundamental understanding of the way in which we live.  I heard the Secretary General of OECD recently make a very profound remark.  In the course of a discussion, someone asked him if such and such a course in economic policy were theoretically possible. After some moments' delay, he looked at his questioner and said: &ldquo;Many things theoretically impossible, in practice, can be done.&rdquo;  I turned to my neighbour and said: &ldquo;No dry-as-dust economist had the commonsense to know that&rdquo;, and my neighbour said: &ldquo;He is not that.&rdquo;  He was for six years Minister for Finance in Denmark, and he had learned in politics what the theorists never understood, that frequently what is theoretically impossible, in practice is relatively easy to do.</P>
    <P>One thing we should make up our minds to do without regard to the theorists is to keep our people on the <Col N="92" /> land, and to enable them to earn a good living on the land.  I say deliberately &ldquo;a good living on the land&rdquo;.  I do not say that it is within the range of practical politics, while full employment obtains in Great Britain, to secure for our small farmer an income equal to what he can earn if he chooses to become a salaried worker in an industrial enterprise in Birmingham, Coventry, Bolton or Glasgow, but we can secure for him on the land of Ireland a much better life, which I believe a sufficiency of our people will elect to prefer.  Of course, we cannot compel them, but I am convinced we can enable them to secure a much better life on the land of Ireland, and that a great many of our people will make that election, provided they get the help we are in a position to give them to use their land to the best advantage.  In that way we will be benefiting not only the farmers.  The export figures alone, without going into calculations about gross national product, gross national income, and so forth, demonstrate most eloquently that the nation will be greatly enriched by an adequate exploitation of the land.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Government are subsidising fertilisers.  We inaugurated the limestone scheme which was the most urgent fertiliser problem we had, and remains today a most urgent fertiliser problem, because without limestone no fertiliser can be used to full advantage.  We initiated the limestone fertiliser scheme which secured for our people all over the country limestone at, I believe, the lowest price available in any country in the world.  That scheme set a headline.  The Government are right to subsidise phosphates and potash.  I am not quite so sure about the wisdom of attempting to subsidise nitrogen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought you were. Then we are agreed.  The subsidising of potash and phosphates is prudent.  I think it would be a disaster if the establishment of a nitrogen monopoly resulted in an increase in prices.  It would be a mistake to absorb the available money in the subsidisation of <Col N="93" /> nitrogen when so much remains to be done in maximising the use of lime, potash and phosphates.</P>
      <P>There is one very urgent matter in regard to the phosphate situation.  I have the uncomfortable feeling that the entire output of phosphates in this country is falling into the hands of one monopoly.  If that is the case, a very dangerous situation exists.  We are subsidising the production of phosphatic fertilisers and the purpose of the subsidy is to reduce its basic price to the farmers.  If the whole phosphatic industry is to become a monopoly protected by tariffs and that monopoly is itself to become a subsidiary of a foreign combine &mdash; Imperial Chemical Industries&mdash;I think this country ought to look to its precautions.</P>
      <P>I shall be interested in hearing what the Minister has to say on that question, whether he agrees that the existence of a phosphatic monopoly is in itself inherently bad, that without competition, domestic or foreign, the production of phosphatic fertilisers cannot be allowed to pass into the hands of an industrial monopoly which is not controlled by the Government for the people, whether, if that course does not commend itself to the Government, then the domestic monopoly must be exposed to effective competition so as to ensure farmers will get phosphates at competitive and reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>I put it to the House that in addition to the matters I have referred to by way of advisory services and credit, there is one other essential if we are to keep our people on the land.  It is urgently important that we should seek to maximise output to keep the people on the land rather than seek to put the land on a quasi-industrial basis and we must make available to the land facilities through which will be available to the people on it adequate housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plain fact is that here families have lived in houses for generations and have got accustomed to them and do not realise how far their accommodation is falling behind the accepted standards of the generation in which they live.  There are thousands <Col N="94" /> of farmers' houses in much the the same structural condition as they were 150 years ago.  We all know by experience that they have been improved, but the general accommodation in these houses still bears no relation to the kind of accommodation universally available in the towns and cities today as compared with 150 years ago.</P>
    <P>I doubt very much if patching and &ldquo;foostering&rdquo; with these houses will make an effective impression on the conditions in which the people on the land live, and I doubt very much if our young people will continue to marry into these old, antiquated houses. I am certain it is desirable that farmers &mdash;I have in mind the relatively small farmers&mdash;should be in a position to get grants from the Local Government Department and subsequently to go to the Land Commission to seek to build new houses and be allowed to pay for them through their annuities.</P>
    <P>I suggest this is the ideal method because if there is to be any change in ownership, the house will still be there and it will be a proper charge on the annuity of the incoming tenant.  I believe, bearing in mind the character of our people and their extreme conservatism, that we ought to consider as part of the general programme of agricultural expansion a system of collaboration between the Department of Local Government and the Land Commission, something approximating to the National Housing Agency, so that the category of farmer I have in mind would be free to go to such a body&mdash; call it, if you like, the Rural Housing Agency&mdash;and stipulate that he wants a house of a certain type and that the agency would build him the house.</P>
    <P>I ask it for two reasons.  One is that if you leave it to the small farmer to build his own house, he will not get an architect's advice, and furthermore, unless the farmer is so circumstanced that he can build it himself, possibly through boys studying in the vocational school or something of the kind, it will be much more expensive on the individual farmer to build his own house than if an agency of this character <Col N="95" /> were charged with the responsibility of building hundreds of houses and were in a position to group them and let them to contract, avail of the best architectural advice and thus get the best value for money.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Crotty who referred to the closing down of Part B of the Land Project.  I suggest that was a great mistake, because it withdrew credit facilities from farmers who urgently needed them.  I know, as does everybody in the House, the conservatism of small farmers and how difficult it very often is to get them to make the kind of investment they ought to make to achieve expansion in their economy.  One of the important features of Part B of the Land Project was that it enabled a farmer to say: &ldquo;I know what is to be done; go and do it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a Deputy who does not realise a great number of small farmers appreciate that a great deal of credit facilities are denied them because of the withdrawal of this Part of the Land Project.  I suggest to the Minister that if there has been a dispersal of the machinery under this Part of the Land Project, a great mistake has been made, since it will mean the complete withdrawal of these facilities.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to transgress the general agreement as to the limitation of debate under the special procedure we are employing this year of allowing approximately half an hour to each contribution.  I should like, however, to say in conclusion that it is a source of dismay to me to find the situation obtaining in which the Minister finds himself constrained to limit the export of pork pigs.  I fully agree that once we have an agreement with Britain to accept a certain quantity of bacon, that must be of primary importance.  We must fill that undertaking because otherwise it would seriously prejudice our future negotiating capacity with Britain. However, it is a source of amazement to me how a situation could have arisen in which the pig population does not prove adequate not only to meet <Col N="96" /> whatever agreements we have abroad but to leave a certain surplus available to us to meet other demands.</P>
    <P>Before the war, we had a very valuable pork export market.  Now it appears it is not there.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister what his explanation is for the remarkable fact that we have markets available but have not got the pigs with which to supply them.  He represents Cavan; I Monaghan.  If there were two individuals in the country who should be especially concerned for pigs, it ought to be the present Minister for Agriculture and his predecessor.</P>
    <P>I should like to recall that in the days when I was there we substantially increased the pig population in this country.  It rose from a relatively low figure to 900,000.  It has since gone up to 1,100,000.  It puzzles me as to why we find ourselves under an obligation at present to reject market openings offered to us for pork pigs.  However, now that all sides of the House have gradually and reluctantly come around to the view that the policy summarised in the phrase &ldquo;one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough&rdquo; is the best policy for this country, I am not without hope that the present inadequacies may be at an early stage repaired.</P>
    <P>I confess I would not trust any Minister for Agriculture under the control of the Fianna Fáil Party to act sanely for any protracted period, but I have high hopes that we will be shortly delivered from the presence of Fianna Fáil.  For that reason, I am glad to draw a pen picture for this House of what we would hope to do when we are delivered from Fianna Fáil and participate in a sane Government in which sane policies operate: the expansion of agriculture, the maintenance of the people on the land and further stimulation of exports from the greatest industry that exists in this country, the industry that earns more, employs more and exports more&mdash;the agricultural industry, which is the hope of Ireland and the only enduring foundation on which any satisfactory and expanding industrial development can ultimately be based.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon always claims that he and the Fine Gael Party have a monopoly of agriculture and everything associated with it; but, if you start counting heads on the benches on either side, I think you will find more small farmers on the Fianna Fáil side than on the Fine Gael side. Deputy Dillon dealt at some length with the advisory services.  He spoke about the parish agent.  I am very sorry he did not give us his views on the county committees of agriculture. When he was Minister for Agriculture, he seemed to have lost faith in them. When he set up the parish agent, he completely ignored the county committees of agriculture, because these agents were outside their authority.  I think that was a mistake.</P>
      <P>It was ludicrous in the extreme to have an agricultural officer, an employee of the agricultural committee, with half his salary paid directly from the Department of Agriculture, and in the next townland to have an officer whose whole salary was paid directly by the Department.  I do not know how you could operate that arrangement in areas side by side within the one county.  That was the major defect in the parish agent idea.  At least, the officers of the county committees of agriculture were under the jurisdiction of the members of that committee and their CAO, while the parish agent could snap his fingers at the members of the committee because he had no responsibility whatsoever to them.  The only advisory body he had was the local Muintir na Tíre organisation or the local parish council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so much concerned about the number of agricultural science instructors as about the present functions of county committees of agriculture. With their functions at the moment, they contribute little or nothing to Irish agriculture for the amount of money expended on that service. Deputy Dillon speaks about increasing the number of agricultural, horticultural and poultry instructors.  However, Deputy O'Sullivan is well aware that we increased substantially the number of these instructors in Cork county, but it did not alter the pattern.  The same old pattern has still survived.  We have <Col N="98" /> more officers doing less work.  There is no overall plan.  If we could get in each county&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;some overall plan and could use the officers employed by the county committee of agriculture to carry out that plan, then we would be getting somewhere.  But the same structure has remained down in Cork.  In my early days, I was associated with the county committee of agriculture.  I left it because I regarded it as a waste of time being a member. We had a cottage prize scheme.  I do not think that contributed very much. We duplicated premium bulls in an area already covered by the AI service. We spread sea sand all over west Cork.  In the early days, I moved a resolution abolishing the sea sand subsidy. It was carried, but, after a canvass, reversed.  We had to wait until this year to see in a publication following a survey by An Foras Talúntais that west Cork is starved of lime.  What I had been saying ten years ago has now been proved true.  Yet we still pay a sea sand subsidy in Cork.  Of course, there is a vested interest: the boat owners, who collect the sand, and the lorry owners, who distribute it to the farmers as something that will improve their soils.  The taxpayers and ratepayers have been paying for this for generations.  We had to wait until the scientists made an extensive survey in 1963 to find out that west Cork generally is starved of lime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see why premium bulls should be distributed in areas where there is a complete AI service.  It is duplication and waste of money.  We have the same thing with boars.  At the beginning of every meeting of the agricultural committee, we all got up and proposed votes of sympathy to our bereaved camp followers.  That was item No. 1 on the agenda.  The next thing was another kind of bereavement, the obituary list of boars from the last meeting.  Often three or four boars would have passed away and we would have a proposal that the boars be replaced.  There was <Col N="99" /> never a post mortem.  A certificate was issued giving some reason or other for the death of another boar and he was just replaced.</P>
    <P>There was, of course, a scheme for the distribution of stag turkeycocks.  I remember a couple of months after I was elected to that committee a woman came to me and asked me if I could get her an Emden gander. I told her: &ldquo;I cannot but I can give you a turkey stag&rdquo;.  They were being distributed by the county committee of agriculture.  These were the functions of the committee and we sat down, debated and argued what person should get a boar in preference to someone else.</P>
    <P>It was said in Cork, at one stage, that the local county council always gave us election agent boars.  That was the accepted thing down in Cork.  I think that the time has come when it is not so much the number of instructors we employ as a revision of the functions of these committees of agriculture which should be looked into.  At least let us do something about their functions and alter them according to the farming pattern in each county.  There should be a revision of the functions of these committees and the CAO should have some responsibility for providing the county with an overall plan.  When we get that as a basis, then let us apply the graduates and the personnel to carry out the approved scheme which is prepared by the CAO over any period. That would be my conception of the functions of a county committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is no use duplicating scientific personnel in the kind of pattern of farming we have now.  They have nothing to do.  They have no plan to work to.  They have to call here and call there and advise people and the instructor falls into a groove even working to a plan.  He is being called here and called there to advise people on their problems but he has no overall plan.  When we have a revision of the functions of the county committees of agriculture, then we will have in time, I hope, an increased <Col N="100" /> number of agricultural science graduates and an increased number of horticultural graduates.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Agriculture brought in a Bill to reduce the number of elected members of the county committees of agriculture and to give a minimum of 50 per cent, I think, to non-elected or nominated members.  I can see no point whatever in that.  I can tell the Minister here and now that he has done something he may not realise he has done.  He has established a novitiate, a training place for future politicians.  If they are nominated to go into county committees of agriculture, they will go from there to the county council and finally we will have some of them in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Speakers from the Fine Gael side of the House have been talking here for days about credit.  Deputy Dillon spoke here about giving £1,000 to every farmer free of interest.  I wonder do the members of Fine Gael realise what the farmer's attitude to going into debt is?  The modern word for going into debt is getting credit.  It is a much nicer word but the word &ldquo;debt&rdquo; to an Irish farmer is not a very pleasant one.  The older people here can cast their minds back to the day when he was between the bank manager on one side, and the rackrenting landlord on the other.  Tradition dies very hard with the farming community. I think the worst possible thing we could have in this country is a loose credit system.  We have to be very careful of how we dole out money to any section of our community.  This business of saying: &ldquo;Here is £1,000 free of interest&rdquo; is a very bad thing. &ldquo;Free of interest&rdquo; may sound very pleasant but surely the only incentive we can offer to a man who contracts a debt is an interest rate.  When he knows he must pay interest, he will try to make some effort to reduce the bill.</P>
    <P>I know, and members of the Fine Gael Party know as well as I do, that the average farmer works first of all on seasonal credit.  He gets that seasonal credit from the hardware merchants, the seed merchants or even the co-operative society.  Those people <Col N="101" /> carry the overdraft for the farmer. When the harvest and the autumn come and the farmer sells his crops, he will pay off his debt.  That is what I call short-term credit and I do not know any reputable or industrious farmer in any county in Ireland who would be refused seasonal credit by the shopkeeper or the co-operative society.</P>
    <P>One would imagine from the speeches made by members of the Opposition Party that the farmers were starved for money.  I know quite well from my experience in my area, and I know it to be a fact, that any industrious farmer can go to any bank manager now and get a loan of £500 without security.  That is a well-known fact.  Any farmer who has the reputation of being industrious will get that without the need to get people to act as security for him.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of the area I know.  I do not think the position in relation to credit is anything like the impression conveyed from the Fine Gael Benches.  I would say this to the Minister.  We hear a lot of talk here about the small farmer.  Taking the Land Commission yardstick of two years ago, an economic farm was 30 acres.  Today we are told by the Land Commission that it is 45 acres.  That is an illusion.  Nobody can say what an economic holding will be because the yardstick by which that holding will be measured is the cash return for man hours worked as compared with the industrial worker.  That is the yardstick by which economics will be measured on a farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to investigate a matter that has agitated my mind for quite a long time.  As every Deputy knows, there is a considerable number of wealthy farmers in this country, people who are wealthy by any standards.  They are a highly organised and vocal group of people. They use the small farmer as the beggar woman uses the borrowed child to beg at a fair.  That is the attitude of a certain group of wealthy farmers.  Everything that is done is <Col N="102" /> done in the name of the poor farmer, the small man.  These people, wealthy though they are, collect from every scheme that is introduced to help the small farmer a disproportionate amount because, no matter what scheme is introduced, no matter what grants are given, they are contingent on the expenditure of certain capital. If the small man has not got the capital, he must stand on the sideline and cannot utilise or avail of the schemes which are introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>A close examination of the manner in which these schemes are operated will reveal that the greatest proportion of the money allocated is disbursed to the people who want it least.  The time has come when the small man cannot continue to be used as a front for these people or, as I have already said, as the beggar woman uses the borrowed child to beg at the fair.  The time has come when there must be a differential, when the small man must be taken into consideration, when we will be forced to abandon the idea of putting the 30-acre or 40-acre farmer on the same plane in relation to grants or State subventions as the man with 100 or 150 acres.  That time is long overdue.</P>
      <P>In regard to subsidised agricultural crops, it will be found, again, that the wealthy farmers collect a disproportionate amount because they are equipped to grow the crops most profitable to them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon complained about farmhouses&mdash;the famine shacks.  Many of them are famine shacks.  Why? Because their renovation or replacement must inevitably entail the investment of certain capital.  If a small man cannot produce the capital he cannot collect the grant.  The time has come when some Minister or Government Department must closely examine this position.  If the help is to be given where it is intended to be given a scaled system of grants must be introduced, whether on the basis of valuation or on the basis of the number of acres in the holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> I listened to a number of Fine Gael speakers.  I listened to Deputy T. O'Donnell.  Deputy T. O'Donnell repeated and re-echoed a speech which he made last year in relation to the dairying industry.  He is all against the introduction of anything like a rationalised system in dairying.  He wants to have the Limerick pattern continued, with struggling co-operative societies.  In Limerick co-operative creameries are seven miles apart, and 30 per cent are some few miles further apart.  Deputy T. O'Donnell wants that pattern to continue in Limerick.  If Deputy T. O'Donnell knew his constituency and the County Limerick and, indeed, certain areas of Cork County, he would know that, in the main, the creameries are now merely collection centres where the milk is brought, weighed, piped into tankers and then taken to the bigger creameries where there is manufacturing plant.</P>
    <P>Certain recommendations were made by the Commission which investigated this matter, which would seem to favour federation of these creameries. I gather that certain moves are being made by some of the smaller creameries towards federation.  The pattern that I have referred to cannot continue. In this competitive age we cannot have a creamery system based on the rotary churn and nothing else.  These creameries must be combined into groups.  Viable manufacturing centres must be set up for the manufacture of whichever milk product commands the best price at any particular time on the export market.</P>
    <P>It is useless to expect that the existing system could continue.  There may be opposition to the suggestion I have made.  I know there will be opposition from creamery managers.  We are all terribly jealous of our status.  If there were a federation of creameries, I suppose the status of a number of these people would be affected and they would probably resist it.  Commonsense must prevail.  Something must be done about the chaotic position which exists in the dairying industry in relation to the structure of small, struggling co-operative societies and small creameries <Col N="104" /> scattered all over Limerick and the adjoining county.</P>
    <P>We were speaking a few minutes ago about the operations of county committees of agriculture.  The county committees of agriculture are responsible for the distribution of boars in their functional area but I am and have always been very unhappy about the type of pig which is being distributed. There is nothing being done to help bring up progeny standards.  As we all know, there is a certain small group of people who are recognised breeders. They are the people who produce the boars and distribute them.  I am far from happy about the whole set-up in relation to the distribution of boars by the county committees of agriculture. I am convinced that form of distribution will not give us the improvement in pig breeding which we so urgently need.</P>
    <P>Again, I have noticed in the figures published that the western counties, where one would think the pig breeding population should, from the nature of their farming structure there, be substantial, have the lowest pig population of any one of the three provinces for which figures are given.  The report of the commission on this whole pig industry does not seem to be a very happy report.  It would seem to point out that we had failed from every angle in relation to our pig production.</P>
    <P>At the moment, there are developments in relation to the co-operative fattening of pigs.  I think if we are to increase substantially our pig production, that increase must be based on the commercial fattening unit.  The co-operative societies have an obligation. They are the people who are ideally suited to the job.  The creameries and the creamery societies should have a pig fattening unit as one means by which we could show some substantial increase in the number of our bacon pigs.  These pig fattening units should be based, of course, on the shareholders of the societies who could produce the store pigs for the fattening unit.  The fattening units could also operate breeding schemes. Bacon curing should be a function of many of these fattening units.</P>
    <P>Many of the small proprietary bacon <Col N="105" /> factories in existence at the moment are obsolete.  It is a well-known fact that they started as small businesses and were not interested in exporting bacon in a competitive export market. If we are to develop our pig industry, if we are to develop our bacon exports, it should be remembered we can only retain a market by keeping our products for 52 weeks of the year on the counters of the retailers in Britain.</P>
    <P>I remember a few years ago visiting a number of Danish selling centres in Britain and I was amazed at the huge organisation which they had developed there.  They had scattered all over Britain something like 52 selling centres.  Many of those centres employed over 100 people.  Their job was to keep Danish produce&mdash;not alone bacon but butter and eggs&mdash;on the counters of the British retailer, available to the British housewife for 52 weeks in the year.  They also had a function of receiving complaints in relation to any article of Danish produce and passing those complaints back to source for investigation.  On that particular point, I think we had 22 or 23 agents who have sold&mdash; dropped a lot here and there&mdash;and there was no such thing as this continuity of supply.  I think at one time we had four Danes employed selling Irish bacon.  I am glad to say there has been a marked improvement since the Pig Marketing Board was reconstructed.</P>
    <P>One of the things I noticed during this debate was that there was no mention of the much abused heifer scheme introduced by the Minister some time ago.  At that time I tried to argue for this scheme and I was told from the opposite benches that the £15 would be distributed amongst the big cattle men, and that the little fellow would not get anything out of it.  There is silence on this Estimate in relation to that scheme and it is the measure by which one can gauge the success of the scheme.  Last Thursday week I sold four heifers, 15 months old.  They were the culls of ten to 12 heifers and they were sold at £11 8s. 0d. a cwt, or £54 each.  I think I collared, in getting £54 for a 15 months old heifer, a substantial <Col N="106" /> part of the £15 payable.  Hence the silence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Medlar</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been admitted by all Parties that farm income lags behind that of industry throughout the western world.  I have often been inclined to ask myself why should that position obtain.  I believe those in authority throughout the western world have fallen down on their job.  I come from a grain growing area, where, 12 years ago, the price of barley and wheat was about £4 per barrel.  About one-sixth of our wheat is growing in the area from which I come.  Not alone was the price reduced by an average of £1 per barrel but about 20 per cent of it was rejected. Some years ago we had free sacks and free transport.  Therefore, we have to sell a superior finished article for much less.  My experience of the produce of industry is that while the price of the finished article has increased in some cases 500 per cent, the life span of the article, or machine, is reduced by about 50 per cent in terms of time.  I wonder what the position would be in any of those industries if they were to get the same terms as the grain growers.</P>
      <P>Naturally, Opposition speakers tried to criticise the Estimate.  Deputy Crotty maintained that we were attacking the millers and the shopkeepers and saying nothing about the small farmers.  Speaking as one of the latter, I fully appreciate that the Government have come to the aid of the small farmer.  They are now giving up to £900 by way of grant for the erection of farm houses. They give a much higher percentage towards the relief of rates than they do to the larger farmers and there are very good concessions under the health services.  Most important of all is the Land Bill which is being considered at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> I come from an area where the uneconomic holders are compelled to live by conacre.  Land owners in general have such confidence in the future of the industry that the purchase of even a 50 Irish acre farm is out of the question. The competition is with the very large farmers.  There is no hope of the uneconomic holder extending his acreage and such people must look to the Land Commission for that purpose.</P>
    <P>There are two sections in the Land Bill that will give the Land Commission more power to acquire land for the consolidation of the small farmer. The Fine Gael Party who profess so much sympathy for the small farmer are vigorously opposing these two sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="MartinMedler" hpid="Mr. Medlar Mr. Medlar">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Medlar</NameTxt>
      <P>Turning to wheatgrowing, I regret that the millers will not, apparently, accept the Hagberg test. Until recently, I had every faith in the sincerity of the millers.  However, if the future policy of this country is to have 75 per cent Irish wheat mixed in the grist, I cannot understand why the mills are being closed in the wheat belt and extended at the ports in areas where hardly any wheat is grown.  I have heard it said that the time is not too far distant when the mills in Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Dublin will be able to cater for all the supplies of green wheat from the farms.  If that is the ultimate objective, then I wonder what the outlook is.  We know the treatment farmers got from millers based in those cities.</P>
      <P>I know of wheat that was sent to Limerick from Kilkenny and was rejected and the farmers were treated with anything but courtesy.  The officials might even be described as arrogant.  The wheat was returned to Kilkenny and was accepted in Kilkenny mills but it took a week to come back by rail.  If millers look for grants to extend their mills, I suggest they should not be given for the extension of mills in those cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wheat is a perishable crop.  Why not put the mills in the centre of the <Col N="108" /> wheat belt rather than close them? With the objection to the Hagberg test and the tightening up and raising of the quality required by these millers, I believe the objective is to force the farmers out of wheat-growing and they are going out of it because of that situation.</P>
    <P>I acted as an agent for one of the largest ground limestone producing plants in this country.  I was paid to get in touch with the owners of farms with acid soil.  We offered them lime, delivered, at 1/- per ton but we could not get sale because the farmers had not a machine to spread it.  I know of farmers who availed of Land Project grants at the time.  With the addition of £3 or £4, their land was drained by manual labour.</P>
    <P>About 1948, when manures became available and there was a switch from horse power to mechanisation here, a survey was made of this country under the Marshall Aid Commission. The survey covered Europe.  In Italy, millions of acres were reclaimed.  A few brilliant men visited my part of the country and said that Marshall Aid would be a good investment and that the scheme would apply to Ireland.  Another man said that agricultural limestone is a very good investment.  One person with foresight invested in an agricultural lime grinding plant in 1943 or 1944.  Under Marshall Aid, we were supplied with machines for spreading the lime and subsidy was given for its transport. From then on, the spreading of lime became more popular day by day.</P>
    <P>We were the last in Europe to benefit from that scheme and there was not a country in Europe that was not thankful to the American taxpayer and the American Government for the grants.  That scheme coincided here with the election of the Coalition Government who claim credit for it. I submit that no matter what Government might have been in office here at the time, that scheme would have come.  There were two schemes, the A scheme and the B scheme, during the initial years and a great many farmers availed of both.  When Fianna Fáil were returned to office, they did away with the B scheme.  The Fine <Col N="109" /> Gael Party stated at the time that if they were returned to office, they would re-introduce the B scheme, but I noticed that in their election manifesto during the last by-elections there was no mention of the B scheme at all.</P>
    <P>I want to make a suggestion and it is that the grant for laying pipes for drainage be increased because the grants for the removal of scrub or bracken are altogether out of proportion to the grant for drainage and the result is that contractors all over the country are fighting shy of it principally because of the fact that labour is involved, plus the cost of pipes.  I would ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to this suggestion. My second suggestion is that an extra £5 grant per acre be given to the farmer who ploughs and re-seeds his land within a given period of years.  If that were done, it would yield very good dividends.</P>
    <P>Last year when I was speaking on this Estimate I said that agricultural scientists should have a target.  I suggested that a survey of the 26 Counties should be carried out.  The areas could be grouped; you could take the various altitudes, mountain bog over 1,000 feet above sea level and so forth, marginal land and so on, and the results of the survey could be indexed. If we were in the position in which some European countries are, a farmer should be able to go into the local agricultural office and ask: &ldquo;What should I sow in this field?&rdquo; and the local instructor should be able to tell him right away.  It would take years to do that because we are lagging so far behind but if we were able to do it, the farmer could be advised what manures he should use to bring his lands up to the recommended standards. If that were done, increased production would follow automatically and I venture to suggest that it would be doubled in one year.</P>
    <P>When I made this suggestion last year, I was aware of the fact that a new Land Bill was being introduced and that it would give rights to the Land Commission in regard to lands that were not being worked.  I suggest that before that is done, a survey should be carried out&mdash;this would take <Col N="110" /> years to do&mdash;and the farmers should be advised what to put on their soil and then, after so many years if they did not co-operate, that land could be handed over to the Land Commission. Co-operation between the scientists and the Land Commission is necessary. Other speakers have referred to matters about which I had intended to speak and therefore I will not delay other than to repeat my request to the Minister to consider a grant for land drainage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears as if I am going to get a quiet hearing and that, of course, is how I would wish it to be.  I am sure it is always a pleasure to every Minister to reach the end of the discussion on his annual Estimate.  I certainly always feel like that and this was not a very prolonged discussion because of the arrangement that was made to finish the business of the House; otherwise, I suppose it would have gone on for perhaps a couple of days more.</P>
      <P>I have introduced a number of Estimates here and I have made a number of Estimate speeches.  I often found that these speeches were fairly dry and that sometimes it was difficult to find in them the substance that one would like to discover and hear in a speech.  I thought that this year the Estimate speech was a good one.  I was terribly disappointed that the first speaker from the Opposition side appeared to take a different view.  I am not saying it was a good speech because I made it but it was a good speech because it recorded a number of very important facts which were clearly indicative of the course we are taking in agriculture and of the success we are gradually and steadfastly achieving.  At one time when speaking on an Estimate, I made the remark that it is not an easy Department in which to do the spectacular.  It is often difficult to see results because they are scattered over the countryside and as well as that, it sometimes takes two, three, four or five years to see the full effects of wise policies and decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disappointing thing about a debate on agriculture is that you often have to cover the same ground year <Col N="111" /> after year.  Perhaps it is that this repetition sounds more awkward in my ears than to many others but in any case even if I have to say the same thing, I like to say it in a different way from the way I said it before. The Leader of the Opposition is not like that.  He makes the same speech, as of course he is entitled to do and it is also right and proper that I should admit that if a man feels he has a good idea, it is no harm to repeat it.  While I am hesitant to cover this ground again, I do so in order that from my point of view also the records will be right.</P>
    <P>One of the matters to which the Deputy referred was the question of advisory services, and, I think, much more gently and remotely than on previous occasions he coupled with the discussion of that matter the question of credit.  He seems to have wonderful enthusiasm about what he calls parish agents.  I am in the Department of Agriculture for almost eight years and some of these agents have been in being during all that time.</P>
    <P>Shortly after I came into the Department of Agriculture, I knew it was my business and responsibility to make a clearcut decision on this whole matter. I think it was Deputy Moher who referred briefly to this subject but to the extent that he did he gave a fair picture of what my mind was in approaching that matter.  I realised we could not have these two methods running side by side.  I knew we could not have county committees of agriculture employing advisers and, on the other hand, the Department of Agriculture employing advisers who would be responsible directly to the officials of my Department.  I saw how that was working in a few cases.  I saw the turmoil that was arising here and there and I knew it was my duty to make a decision so as to clarify the position once and for all.</P>
    <P>I was aware that county committees of agriculture were not perfect.  I was aware that, perhaps in some cases, they were not getting the best out of the graduates and advisers they employed, and I said to myself: Even if there is some truth in these two <Col N="112" /> weaknesses, would the Government be justified in centralising the advisory services under the Department?  Was there any likelihood that if such a step were taken, the Department of Agriculture would achieve greater success in enabling these advisers, whatever you call them, to make contact with the farmers who apparently are difficult to contact and difficult to interest in the matter of how they should, to the extent needed, go about improving and fertilising their land?</P>
    <P>I had no hesitation coming to the decision that, weak and all as the committees' structure might be, it was better by far to try to strengthen and improve what was there than to wreck what was there just for the sake of producing something new and that would look bright for a while.  I, therefore, decided to pursue that course, bearing in mind always that the problem we, the Department, the committees of agriculture and the farmers organisations, have on our hands is to secure an interest in the work that is being done by the advisory services and a realisation of the tremendous advantages the advice, if taken, can be to so many of the farmers that every one of us knows.</P>
    <P>I would say I know as much about rural Ireland as any other Deputy here. If I were asked a further question as to how these men would succeed to a greater extent than they have in the past in making these contacts with farmers, I could not give a clear answer to that.  I could not give advice which I could be sure would be effective if followed.  Is there any purpose in saying that an agricultural graduate controlled direct from Merrion Street would be more effective in finding a solution for that one problem&mdash;and it is a major one&mdash;than an adviser who is employed by a county committee? The odds are in favour of meeting with success by operating through the committee. This decision was not made by me on any other basis or for any other reason.</P>
    <P>I have been told again something I believe already and have always believed. The farmers can increase production enormously if we can devise ways and means of reaching their ear <Col N="113" /> and establishing confidence between them and the advisers.  However, the problem is how it is to be done.  It is all very well to talk about figures and to quote how the Danes are doing, what they are doing in the Netherlands, in Spain or France, or give the number of farms or give the number of hectares and compare that with our position here.  Apart altogether from the accuracy of these comparisons&mdash;I hope to deal with that later&mdash;and even conceding as I do, the good work these men can do if their advice is sought and followed, we cannot take this step forward without tightening up and improving our organisation as we are attempting to do.  I see no good purpose being served by appointing double the number of advisers, unless we have a way of getting to the ear of a much higher percentage of farmers than we have been able to reach so far.  It is not a question of what this would cost.  I should have no hesitation in seeking whatever moneys might be necessary to enable county committees to expand in this direction as we have recently demonstrated in the assistance we have given to these 12 western counties.  It is a most demoralising thing for a public official to be loose on the countryside unless he has work to do and there is somebody to ensure that if there is any reluctance on his part to do it, he will be coaxed one way or another into discharging his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>When we talk of advisory services, officers and staff, we must remember that in ten years we have doubled them.  I do not contend that is enough but that this is a matter that cannot be accomplished overnight.  Although one Deputy on my own side did not seem to agree that I was likely to achieve much through what we have been trying to do, as the passage of a Bill through the House last week indicates, in hoping to tighten up, first, on the constitution of committees and, secondly, on the planning of the work, responsibility for the annual planning by the CAO for his advisers and how we feel that in the larger counties if he is unable to find enough time to supervise the execution of these plans, that he could get a deputy or an assistant, <Col N="114" /> whatever the title may be&mdash;that is largely my approach to advisory work. Nobody could truthfully say that as Minister I would be hesitant or have a conservative view on a matter of that importance: I have not, but there is an urge in me to try as best I can to get a solution for that problem.</P>
    <P>In our discussions, because there is largely little disagreement on fundamental aspects of agricultural policy, I think agricultural Deputies should see that this is a problem and they should try to contribute towards its solution.  I have all kinds of notions as to what I should do if I were an adviser.  We may talk about improving the quality of the land and how production would rise and what that would mean in exports and how it would affect the earning capacity of our exports but let us face the fact that if you could hire a plane in every county and if you had a deposit of a huge quantity of limestone and most fertilisers that are in common use and if you did all the land of Cavan and Monaghan at the rate of three tons to the acre with lime and five or six cwt. per acre with phosphates and perhaps some potash, you would not be making any mistake.</P>
    <P>When I hear people talking about the importance of research&mdash;and I am all in favour of research work of every type that will now or in the future, prove an aid to those working on the land&mdash;we must remember that there are those obvious matters.  We do not have to be told by research workers the advantages that would accrue from doing this sort of work; we know it. The Government have come to the rescue from the point of view of making these fertilisers&mdash;I would say not reasonably cheap&mdash;very cheap.  I want to get the advisory workers employed by county committees of agriculture to put that as No. 1 at the top of their programme.  I do not mind what any man says about another plan.  I maintain&mdash;and I shall part with the subject then&mdash;that is the problem. I believe my judgment to be as good as the next man's as to how it should be successfully approached and my bet would be that you are much more <Col N="115" /> likely to be successful through the operation of the machinery of the county committees of agriculture than by making that effort directly through my Department, through these remote controls that we all know are full of danger and should be avoided, if possible.</P>
    <P>On this question of credit, the Leader of the main Opposition gave us a glimpse of what he has in mind in regard to this interest-free money.  If I interpret him correctly, not only in relation to what he said on this year's Estimate but also in relation to what he said on last year's Estimate, then I have only this comment to make: I thought that the £1,000 offered to farmers, when the offer was originally made, was quite fantastic.  I do not believe that even the farmers took it seriously.  When I pressed the matter home, especially last year, I was told that it did not mean what I thought it meant at all.  It meant something else. It meant that the advisory officer would go to a number of farms.  He would come to my place, for instance, and say he was going to draw up a scheme for me, if I would agree to operate it, and, if I did, I would be helped to finance the scheme with interest-free money.  Suppose the advisory officer got half a dozen farmers out of 500, 600, 700 or 800 farmers prepared to do a very constructive job, what would be the attitude of the other 490, 590, 690 or 790?  What would be their frame of mind towards that sort of venture? They would see these six, seven or eight pets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know what pets meant to our advisory services in the past. That was the weakest of the services. There was a poultry station, a turkey station, a premium bull, a premium boar.  The advisory officer knew these places.  He called at them.  I am not blaming him entirely for doing that but I am certainly speaking the truth when I say it was that sort of thing that resulted in the build-up of hostility on the part of the majority of our farmers in any particular county. Secondly, when we talk about interest-free money, paying the interest on the money is another form of subsidising farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but that proposal is all cod, to use an expression that has been made respectable by repetition in this House, though not by me.</P>
      <P>I referred to the figures given with regard to the number of advisory officers in the Department as compared with other countries.  I said these figures could be misleading.  I said we had more than doubled the number here in ten years.  I said I believe in advisory work but I do not believe in employing people for whose services there would not be an adequate demand.  With regard to the figures for Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, these include non-graduates.  Here only graduates are employed.  The non-graduates in these other countries do certain work for which they can get a simple training. Picking out global figures makes the situation almost impossible unless an analysis is made of what exactly the situation is in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another of the hardy annuals trotted out was Section B of the Land Project. I am delighted to see the way in which this scheme is expanding.  I have some figures which are an indication of one of the items to which I referred in my introductory speech, from which I got <Col N="118" /> a good deal of satisfaction.  The amount represented by approvals in 1963-64 was £2,409,000; in 1954-55, the Section A figure was £1,417,000.  I admit Section B was there also, but Deputies will see that under the new order the volume of work being done is very large.  Again, in my opinion, it is being done on a far sounder basis.</P>
    <P>Ministers for Agriculture are anxious to see work done and progress made and I like to see work done and progress made on a sound basis.  My attitude was, and is, that there is no person we could employ who would supervise the execution of work by a contractor, or otherwise, as well as the farmer himself.  I suppose in the political world it is not unexpected to find oneself being accused of political narrow-mindedness for arriving at some conclusion such as the one on the Land Project, and the one to which I referred earlier.  No such thing ever entered my head.  I watch things throughout the country.  I travel a good deal, and I see a good deal.  I am not an engineer but I know a job that is well done.  I would see very quickly where weaknesses on the supervision side were all too apparent.  I would see weaknesses in any scheme that was being administered, even through officials of my Department, and contractors, on behalf of the farmers.</P>
    <P>When I am teased or taxed about making credit available to farmers who want land reclamation work done, I am sceptical about some of that, too, because I saw farmers putting in whole farms for reclamation, survey plans prepared, contracts entered into on their behalf signed on the dotted line, £12 per acre to be consolidated in their annuities and I saw quite a few problems arising out of that sort of approach in my Department for the past seven years.  We have not settled them all yet.  When the contractor had completed the work to the satisfaction of the representative of my Department and it had been certified, and when the contractor got his money, the question arose as to his willingness to allow this £12 per acre to be consolidated for the outstanding balance of <Col N="119" /> the purchase price.  This business of consolidating land reclamation work represents only one-third of the cost of the work, the other two-thirds being paid by the State, subject to a maximum cost of £42 per acre.</P>
    <P>Any of the lending institutions worthy of their salt will lend the necessary money.  Whether they be the commercial banks or the Credit Corporation they will give money to meet this £12 per acre if the maximum is reached in the estimate prepared.  I would love to see every acre of the country drained, but I think it is good to put some onus on the farmers and the land owners in that way.  If you talk in terms of consolidating the farmer's contribution in his land annuity, he then wants a house and you consolidate that, too.  These surely are all problems which responsible people should analyse closely before making all sorts of statements as to what can be done.  I still maintain that there is no reason why we should completely diversify the courses through which we are going to inject money into agriculture.  We have enough already if we had more money.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy talked about how cautious I was and how cautious my Department were.  I think it was on this whole question of milk production and expansion.  I had to laugh at that. A few months ago, the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was published and the target set for agriculture for the next two years.  I am not one of those who believe in setting targets without trying to achieve them.  I was reminded of the target set in 1958 and partially achieved in 1963.  I admit it was not fully achieved, but anyway it was a target.  Many of my critics during those five years were telling me in the House and outside that not only would that target not be achieved but that the cow population would decline as a result of our policy on bovine TB eradication and the removal and slaughter of cows under it.</P>
    <P>They were not right, surely.  I have the feeling that were it not for the <Col N="120" /> enormous number of animals, particularly cows and particularly in the south, that had to be slaughtered in the past four years, we should not have been so far off the target, if we did not reach it.  When we came to the Second Programme and the targets under it, the question of what we would try to do to implement it arose, particularly in reference to cattle numbers.  The question was very vital and I refer to it because of the allegations that we in the Department, from the Minister down, were cautious and conservative. The heifer subsidy scheme was the first step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Second Programme.  We discussed it at length.  It was very cautiously examined, very carefully vetted from the point of view of all the schemes that could be introduced.  Not only was it vetted in regard to all these matters but also from the point of view of the achievement of results, of increasing numbers.  When the matter of the financing of these proposals arose, the Secretary of my Department spoke to me in my office.  We discussed the details and I said to him: &ldquo;Yes, that will make a contribution all right.  The scheme will make some contribution but if I could secure from the Government an additional 2d per gallon on milk on top of that, I believe the two things combined would make a considerable impact on cattle numbers.</P>
      <P>Afterwards, when I discussed this question with my colleagues, I was anxious that whatever I would get from the Exchequer for the milk producers I should ensure it would not have the effect of increasing the price of butter, mainly because our consumption of butter is very high, the highest in the world, I think.  The export market for butter was and has been dull and poor.  Except in recent times, not only was the price a consideration but the availability of a market at all was in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, while perhaps giving a concession, when money is hard to find might be inclined to say: &ldquo;Why not put some of this on <Col N="121" /> the price of butter?&rdquo; I successfully resisted it.  It was not a very difficult thing&mdash;the Minister for Finance having been in the Department of Agriculture longer than I have been and knowing the problems of agriculture very well.  However, the Government in giving this increase, coupled with the heifer scheme, made a great contribution towards reaching the goal we have set ourselves for 1970.</P>
    <P>Because of the talk about the non-availability of sufficient milk to enable us to manufacture produce to sell on some of the world markets, one would be inclined to get the impression that that could be done very simply and very inexpensively.  I do not begrudge the expense in this matter.  People must be realistic.  Recently I replied to a Parliamentary Question showing the cost to the Exchequer of each of 12 or 13 countries per lb. of the sale and distribution of other milk products. I do not think people serve any purpose when they pretend to ignore these factors.</P>
    <P>I had to consider getting the money and imposing the necessary taxation. When people talk about conservatism in so far as going out into the milk world is concerned, they never think of the strides we have made in the past four or five years in the west and in the midlands.  On one occasion I spoke to the Secretary of my Department on the question of the establishment of this Committee on Small Farms in the West, and in the course of the conversation, I said to him: &ldquo;There is one thing which, if we could do it, would make a wonderful contribution to some of the problems in the west.  It is the introduction of a creamery system.&rdquo;  I had that conversation a short time after coming out of London with a quota of 12,500 tons of butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come to the stage where I do my best to hold a temper that is not always the best in the world, but Deputy Donegan is usually effective in subjecting me to stresses and strains.  I said I was giving consideration to the extension of the creamery system to the west at a time when the market prospects for butter and milk products were anything but bright.  After hearing my plea, my colleagues gave me permission to set out on the development of creameries in the west and in the midlands. Quite a number of creameries have been established there and others are in course of erection or are planned.  In Kildare recently I had the pleasure of opening a creamery in a district where one had closed in years gone by.  Although this creamery opened only five months ago, they had completely under-estimated the amount of milk they would receive.  When I hear people talk about the non-availability of milk, I look at the soaring figures for the last three or four years. Early this year the increase estimated for this year was 13 million gallons, but the most recent estimate will be nearer 25 million gallons.  I am proud of that.  These are not achievements of mine, but I have contributed substantially to them.  I am merely speaking of them now because of the thoughtless allegation that we are not endeavouring to provide the raw material for those who have the responsibility of selling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other matters I should like to deal with, but I prefer to talk about agriculture in a general way without going into details.  I never introduced the Estimate for Agriculture in this House with more pleasure than I did on this occasion, because I was able to show increased activity and increased expenditure in all the important agricultural services.  I was able to give a list of items that will make an important contribution to agriculture in the future.  I dealt with the items in which there were reductions. These reductions were victories. The reduction in my Estimate in the <Col N="123" /> case of bovine tuberculosis, for example, was due to the fact that, because of the extent to which we have mastered this problem, the Estimate shows a welcome decrease.</P>
    <P>These were the considerations that made me feel satisfied that we in the Department were well on to our job. These were the signs that make me feel in my bones, because of my understanding of the countryside, that agriculture is just in the mood to take tremendous strides forward over the next five or ten years.  This work is not spectacular.  You do not see a factory, where you can get a view of all those working in it.  It is not like a vocational school.  I see a growing confidence on the part of those actively making an effort to take the best out of their land and get the best living from it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry time does not allow me to deal with this question of population movement and the allegation that it is our policy to move people off the land.  Nothing could be greater nonsense. But it would also be nonsense if public men did not have regard to what was going on in every country and what were the results&mdash;whether we were likely to avoid it and whether policy decisions could stem it.</P>
    <P>Government policy here since the establishment of this State, one way or another, has been directed to protect the small farmer and to consider him.  The dice, as far as it could be loaded, has been loaded to achieve that.  Those who talk about that forecast as a policy decision are not being honest.  I should dearly love just to get one hour at that because I know my countryside.  I know the problems of a man on ten, 12 or 15 acres of bad land.  I know the difficulties in securing a living from such an area for himself and his family if he married and settled down there.</P>
    <P>I am looking at it all my life and living in the very heart of it.  I wonder do the people who talk about that and about agricultural policy take a look at the Six Counties, where they are getting British price supports, and see what is happening in many parts <Col N="124" /> there.  I think, with the exception of the industrial counties, the number emigrating from at least four counties is probably greater than from any part here.</P>
    <P>When you refer to these things, some people will ask you why not try to produce a different result here.  I believe in trying.  I believe in trying to stem this tide from the land because I believe, with Deputies on the other side, there is no comparison between the sort of living a man will find here, if he can get a reasonable living, by comparison with what he will get bringing up his family in some town or city in England, Wales or Scotland. That is a subject for another day. There are a lot of people talking about it but they are not, in my opinion, talking honestly.</P>

Taobh amuigh de bheith réidh chun dul san iomaíocht ar an margadh coigríche caithfidh siad iad fhéin a ullmhú le haghaidh breis iomaíochta sa bhaile, ag féachaint do chlár an Rialtais maidir le laghdú ginearálta a dhéanamh ar chánacha custam agus le sriantaí na gcuótaí ar allmhairí tionscail a scaoileadh.</P>
    <P>Tugann sé sásamh mór dom gur shroich ár gcuid onnmhairí figiúr buaice £196 milliún i 1963, is é sin le rá méadú £21 milliún thar an bhfigiúr le haghaidh 1962.  Tháinig méadú tábhachtach ar go leor onnmhairí tionscail, go háirithe innealra agus gléasra iompair, éadach agus coisbheart, snáth, éadaí, leathar agus déantúis leathair. Táim ag súil go leanfaigh an scéal mar seo, agus táimid ag méadú go maith i mbliana ar an soláthair le haghaidh Chóras Tráchtála lena chur ar a chumas breis cúnaimh a thabhairt dár onnmhaireoirí.</P>
    <P>San iomlán, mar sin, measaim gur cúis mhór misnigh dúinn an dul ar aghaidh a rinneadh i 1963, i gcúrsaí tionscail na tíre sa bhaile agus ar an gcoigrích.</P>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates, the net Estimate of £7,078,300 for the year 1964-65 is compared with a sum of £5,471,800 granted in 1963-64, including a Supplementary Estimate for £990,000, and shows a net increase of £1,606,500.  On 3rd March, 1964, too late for inclusion in the Book of Estimates, an additional sum of £185,000 was granted by way of a further Supplementary Estimate, bringing the total amount granted in 1963-64 to £5,656,800.  The actual position is, therefore, that the Estimate of £7,078,300 for 1964-65 is £1,421,500 greater than the total sum of £5,656,800 granted in 1963-64.</P>
    <P>The principal increases in 1964-65 are in the provisions for the Grant-in-Aid under the Industrial Research and Standards Act, £84,000 (Subhead F.1); Grant-in-Aid to Córas Tráchtála, £65,000 (Subhead H); Grant-in-Aid to <Col N="127" /> An Foras Tionscal, £1,815,000 (Subhead J); Technical Assistance, £101,000 (Subhead L.1); Grant-in-Aid to Irish National Productivity Committee, £29,000 (Subhead L.2); Grant-in-Aid to An Cheard Chomhairle, £22,500 (Subhead M), and care and maintenance of St. Patrick's Copper Mines £49,990 (Subhead R.).  Increases in other subheads amount to £28,621, bringing the total to £2,195,111.  To this must be added the decrease of £13,843 in Appropriations-in-Aid which brings the total increases to £2,208,954.  The Book of Estimates shows a gross increase of £2,393,954 for 1964-65 compared with 1963-64, but when an adjustment is made for the Supplementary Estimate for £185,000 taken in March, 1964, the actual increase is £2,208,954.</P>
    <P>The principal decreases in 1964-65 are in the provisions for Additional Laboratory Equipment, £24,000 (Subhead F.2); New York World's Fair, £94,000 (Subhead N) and Shipbuilding Subsidy, £660,000 (Subhead P).</P>
    <P>Decreases in other subheads amount to £9,454 bringing the total decrease to £787,454.  As I have said, the net increase in the Estimate for 1964-65 compared with 1963-64 is, therefore, £1,421,500.</P>
    <P>The pace of industrial expansion increased perceptibly in 1963, particularly in the second half of the year. The provisional index of volume of production in manufacturing industry (to base 1953=100) was 151.9 for 1963 as compared with 142.5 for 1962 and 135.0 for 1961.  This represents a volume increase of over 6½ per cent during 1963, reflecting roughly a 5 per cent increase in the first six months and 8 per cent in the second half of the year.</P>
    <P>The average number of workers engaged in manufacturing industry rose to an estimated 167,000 in 1963&mdash; an increase of 5,500 or 3.4 per cent over 1962.</P>
    <P>In the case of projects involving a capital investment of £10,000 and upwards. 44 new industrial undertakings or extensions to existing industries came to notice as having commenced <Col N="128" /> production in the year ended 31st December, 1963.  The total capital investment in these undertakings is estimated at almost £9 million, and the estimated employment potential ranges from 2,100 in the initial stage to 6,300 at full production.</P>
    <P>Apart from projects which had reached the production stage, there were, at the end of the year 1963, 32 new factories in course of construction. It is anticipated that these projects will provide employment for about 8,600 workers when full production has been attained.</P>
    <P>Industrial proposals before my Department and the Industrial Development Authority which had reached a fairly definite stage of development at 31st March, 1964, numbered 55.</P>
    <P>The year 1963 proved to be a most successful year so far as the efforts of the Industrial Development Authority to attract industry are concerned. During the year, 34 new industries with foreign participation went into production throughout the country. These new projects involve a total capital investment of over £7 million and have an employment potential of some 4,200 workers.</P>
    <P>A particularly pleasing feature is the wide variety of industries represented by the projects which commenced production in 1963.  These include clothing and textiles, plastics, porcelain, electronics, trout farming, fish processing, broiler hatching eggs, diamond cutting and polishing, filters, agricultural machinery, prams, mink, cheese, precision ballbearings, and chemicals.  Most of these industries are producing entirely for export.</P>
    <P>The Authority's promotional campaign is now being actively carried on in the USA, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, and additional resources are being provided for the Authority to enable the campaign to be intensified.</P>
    <P>Detailed surveys of 26 industries have been carried out by the CIO survey teams.  To date, reports on 18 of these industries have been published.  Reports on the remaining eight industries will be published at <Col N="129" /> intervals in the next few months.  In addition to survey reports on individual industries, four CIO interim reports, which are of general application to industry, have been published.  The first interim report dealt with the forms of State assistance to be granted to industry to adapt itself to meet free trading conditions; the second dealt with joint export marketing; the third with the creation of adaptation councils to promote measures of rationalisation in individual industries while the fourth dealt with industrial grants.  There has been general acceptance by the Government of the recommendations in these reports.</P>
    <P>One of my main preoccupations is to ensure that our industries take advantage of the guidance provided by the CIO reports, so that their modernisation and re-adaptation may be achieved in as short a time as possible.  As a further aid to industry, grants are available which will help substantially to defray the cost of re-adaptation and modernisation.  I am sure that Irish industry appreciates that a unique opportunity now exists for re-adaptation, and it would be extremely regrettable if any sector of industry were not to avail itself of this opportunity to gear itself to more competitive conditions and to achieve a greater degree of efficiency.  Any industries which fail to take advantage of the present opportunities would be seriously lacking in foresight, and I have no doubt myself but that eventually they will regret their lost opportunities.</P>
    <P>The CIO have emphasised in their reports the importance of undertaking adaptation measures as urgently as possible, and they have expressed the view that adaptation councils set up by the industries themselves would be the most suitable vehicle for carrying adaptation measures into practice.  The Industrial Reorganisation Branch of my Department, which I set up specially some time ago to deal with this matter, works in very close contact with industry with the object of facilitating in every way possible the speedy implementation by each sector of industry of the CIO recommendations for re-adaptation.</P>
    <P>The response by industry can be <Col N="130" /> said to be reasonably good.  Sixteen adaptation councils have now been established, and the majority of them are doing effectively the task assigned to them.  I regret, however, to have to say that a few councils have not been very effective up to the present.  I do not know whether this is due to the uncertainty of our trading position, <i>vis-à-vis</i> different international trading blocs, or whether it is attributable to an impression that competitive trading conditions are a matter for the distant future rather than the immediate present.  Whatever may be the explanation, I cannot urge too strongly on these sectors of industry and on any others which may be inclined to hesitate, the imperative necessity to modernise the structure of their industry. It would be fatal for firms to be so unrealistic as to think that major changes in international trade are not inevitable and that new competitive conditions are not already almost upon us.  Apart from the necessity for competitiveness in external markets, Irish industries must prepare themselves for more competitive conditions in the domestic market as a result of the progressive reductions in tariff levels generally and the loosening of the quota restrictions which protect a number of other industries.  The response by an industry to its obligations in the matter of modernisation and re-adaptation will be a relevant factor in my consideration of any situation affecting that industry in the future.</P>
    <P>The CIO has now almost completed the task for which it was established, and I think that the committee are to be congratulated on the fine work they have done in diagnosing the weaknesses and problems of our industrial sector and in prescribing measures designed to enable Irish industry not alone to hold its own but to expand in an era of increased competition.</P>
    <P>During the past financial year An Foras Tionscal approved grants amounting to £1,300,000 for projects located in the undeveloped areas, bringing the total provision for such grants to £7,700,000.  Of this amount, grants totalling £5,100,000 were paid to 31st March, 1964, leaving outstanding <Col N="131" /> commitments of £2,600,000. The total capital investment involved in the approved projects amounts to over £19,000,000, and it is expected they will give employment to over 12,000 persons.  One hundred and eleven projects assisted by An Foras Tionscal are in production in the undeveloped areas, and there are 25 other projects for which grants have been promised and which are in varying stages of development.  Of the 136 projects in the undeveloped areas for which grants have been approved, 65 were promoted entirely by Irish interests, five were sponsored by Irish interests in association with foreign interests, and 66 were promoted solely by foreign interests. A substantial number of these projects will produce mainly for export markets.</P>
    <P>As regards grants by An Foras Tionscal for industries outside the undeveloped areas, during the year ended the 31st March, 1964, grants amounting to nearly £1 million were approved bringing the total grants approved for such projects to £6,700,000.  Of this latter sum, grants totalling £3,300,000 were paid to 31st March, 1964, leaving outstanding commitments of £3,400,000.  The total capital investment in these projects amounts to almost £29 million.  It is estimated that these projects, which are mainly in the export field, will employ about 16,000 persons.  Forty-six projects assisted by An Foras Tionscal are actually in production in areas outside the undeveloped areas, and there are 30 other projects for which grants have been approved and which are in various stages of development. Of the 76 projects established or being established outside the undeveloped areas for which grants have been approved, 23 were promoted entirely by Irish interests, 14 were promoted by Irish interests in association with foreign interests, and 39 have been sponsored entirely by foreign interests.</P>
    <P>In February, 1963, the Undeveloped Areas Acts and the Industrial Grants Acts were amended to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of special grants to assist industries in expansion or <Col N="132" /> adaptation programmes in order to enable them to become more efficient. Up to 31st March, 1964, 282 applications for these special grants had been received.  At that date, grants of over £3½ million had been approved in respect of 130 applications which will involve a capital expenditure of over £19 million.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Government's desire for greater industrial efficiency and productivity, an increased amount is provided for the Technical Assistance Grants Scheme to cater for the increasing demand for these services. Separate provision is made this year for a grant-in-aid to the Irish National Productivity Committee.  The committee was formerly financed directly from the Technical Assistance subhead.  Provision has also been made in the Technical Assistance subhead for a grant to the Irish Management Institute.</P>
    <P>Under the Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. Act, 1960, and the amending Act of 1963, Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. was authorised to increase its share capital to £6 million, to be subscribed, as required, by the Minister for Finance. The final stages of the company's development plan are now approaching. All the civil engineering works have been completed, and new major plant installations, including the new extended merchant mill, the new section mill and the merchant bar mill, have been brought into commission. The oil-fired open-hearth furnace has also come into operation, and the new soaking pits and blooming mill have been brought into production.</P>
    <P>There remain to be completed and brought into commercial operation the wire rod mill and sheet mill.  Arrangements are well advanced for the installation of these units, but it will be some little time before commercial production can be commenced.</P>
    <P>Nítrigín Éireann Teoranta was incorporated on 3rd October, 1961, as a private company under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1959, having as its main object the acquisition, erection and operation of a nitrogenous fertiliser factory in Ireland.  Construction of the Arklow factory by the contractors, <Col N="133" /> is advanced to the stage when mechanical erection can proceed.  While the main factory plant is of German design, inquiries for equipment have been made in Ireland and orders have been placed with Irish firms whenever possible.  Employment on the erection of the factory has been steadily increasing and is expected to reach about 600 during the early part of the summer. This will include the men engaged on civil engineering and mechanical erection and the supervisory staff.  The factory is expected to go into production in the first half of 1965.</P>
    <P>Min Fhéir (1959) Teoranta, the State-sponsored company which is carrying out a project to produce grassmeal from bogland at Geesala, in the west of County Mayo, has now succeeded in resolving some unexpected difficulties encountered in regard to building and equipment and is in the concluding stage of its development programme.  Some trial quantities of grassmeal have already been successfully produced, and production on a commercial basis will commence during the 1964 season.</P>
    <P>The outline which I have given of the trend of industrial development in 1963 augurs well for the achievement of the industrial targets set out in the Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  As Deputies will know, it is envisaged that industry will almost double its output during this decade by annual volume increments of 7 per cent and will increase its exports of manufactured goods by 150 per cent in the same period.  An overall increase of 86,000 in the number of jobs in the industrial sector is expected to derive from yearly increases of 3 per cent in employment. This expansion, coupled with an annual increase of almost 4 per cent in productivity, is expected to contribute the larger part of an annual growth of 4.14 per cent in gross national product.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the National Industrial Economic Council, following a detailed examination of these targets, has reported that the industrial aims of the Second Programme are capable of being achieved and that the sectoral targets provide a realistic starting point for discussions with industry. <Col N="134" /> These discussions with the principal functional and other organisations concerned have already commenced.</P>
    <P>Our industrial programme has also been the subject of favourable comment by the OECD which has indicated in its recent report that, in its view, given a continuation of the Government's vigorous growth policies and favourable external conditions of trade, the planned industrial expansion, although ambitious, is not unattainable.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to dwell at any length upon the matter of price increases.  This matter has been debated in the House on a number of occasions recently, and Deputies will be aware of the measures I have taken to secure that there should be no unnecessary or excessive increases in commodity prices or service charges. The Prices Section of my Department has been reorganised in order to secure the enforcement of the Retail Price (Food) Display Order, 1963, and to assist in the investigation of complaints about price increases.  While I am happy to note that the measures which I have taken, backed by consumer resistance and the work of the Fair Trade Commission in preserving fair competition, have curbed excessive price increases, I assure the House that the provisions of the Prices Act, 1958, will continue to be used to prevent any excessive price increases.</P>
    <P>The position regarding our application for membership of the European Economic Community remains unchanged. It is our wish that negotiations on our application will be resumed when circumstances permit. In the meantime we have succeeded in having established a procedure for maintaining contact with the EEC under which meetings, at official or ministerial level as appropriate, take place from time to time with the Commission of the EEC for the purpose of exchanging information and considering matters of mutual interest, particularly the question of maintaining and developing our trade with the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Action on our application for membership of the General Agreement on <Col N="135" /> Tariffs and Trade was suspended when a decision was taken to apply for membership of the EEC.  Following the breakdown of the UK/EEC negotiations, consideration of the applications by this and other countries for membership of the EEC was suspended. The Government have been reconsidering the question of joining the GATT and have now decided to revive our application for membership.  We have, accordingly, requested the re-opening of discussions on our application, and the negotiations in connection with our accession are likely to take place within the framework of the GATT trade and tariff negotiations known as the Kennedy Round which commenced on the 4th May, 1964.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for our participation in the New York World's Fair have proved very satisfactory.  The site area of about 12,000 sq. ft. which was leased for our pavilion is in an extremely favourable portion of the Fair grounds, directly opposite the United States Federal Pavilion and on a corner of the Avenue connecting the Federal Pavilion with the focal point of the Fair, the Unisphere.  We felt that this was an area which would attract a great number and variety of visitors and this is already proving to be the case.</P>
    <P>The display consists of a national exhibit of a prestige nature, and the objective is to present in an attractive way an honest image of the industrial, commercial, cultural and social life of Ireland and its people.  The exhibit highlights Ireland's economic development, its tourist attractions, its contribution to world literature, its missionary influence and its contribution to the development of other countries, particularly the United States.</P>
    <P>It is always very difficult to assess in advance the tangible benefits of exhibitions of this kind.  It may be expected, however, that positive benefits by way of increased trade, tourism and industrial investment will result. From what I have seen on my recent visit I feel confident that the display will effectively achieve the objective of presenting a realistic image of Ireland and the Irish.  The effect of the entire <Col N="136" /> exhibition is to present an impression of a small but well-ordered and well-balanced country which, while looking to the future, maintains continuity with its past.  Our pavilion and the exhibits have already attracted considerable attention and have been the subject of most favourable comment by visitors.</P>
    <P>The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards continues to develop on satisfactory lines.  Its existing Departments, notably the Science, Engineering, Building and Technical Information Departments are being expanded on a considerable scale, and additional staff is being recruited.  In addition, it is proposed to establish two new Departments, one for chemical engineering, the other for electronics. It is intended, also, to extend the policy of forming divisional boards within the Institute to look after the interests of particular industrial sectors.  The field advisory services in engineering and textiles are being strengthened, and similar services are being initiated in applied chemistry and the building industry.</P>
    <P>In the field of labour/management relations, it is encouraging to note, in recent years, the increasing readiness of both sides of industry to meet at the national level to discuss their common problems.  As I have intimated on previous occasions, the question of improving and bringing up-to-date the existing statutory industrial relations machinery, provided under the Industrial Relations Act of 1946, has been under review in my Department for some time past and, as that legislation was an agreed measure, it is my hope that, before finalising any new proposals for amendment of the legislation, I shall have the benefit of agreed proposals from the employer and labour interests in the National Employer/Labour Conference.  However, in suggesting that there is need for the review of the 1946 Act in the light of experience gained over the past eighteen years, I do not intend to imply that the Labour Court, as now constituted, has failed to achieve the objects for which it was established. On the contrary, the court has an impressive record in the settlement of <Col N="137" /> the trade disputes which have been brought before it.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that 1963 was a comparatively quiet year in employer/ worker relations, it is notable that, even in this situation, the extent to which the Labour Court was availed of as a means of settling industrial disputes continued to grow.  The number of trade disputes dealt with by the court during 1963 was 366 and was a record for any year since the inception of the court.  Conciliation conferences were held in respect of 337 disputes as compared with 300 in 1962. When it is remembered that the 1962 figure itself represented a record compared with previous years, the importance of the conciliation services of the Labour Court will be evident.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that employers and workers are becoming increasingly aware of the desirability of exploring to the utmost extent the possibility of an amicable settlement of matters in dispute.  I am extremely pleased with this development which offers a sound basis for the hope that this method of approach to the solution of industrial disputes will, in time, be adopted generally.</P>
    <P>An Cheard Chomhairle continues to push ahead with its proposals for more effective arrangements for the recruitment and training of apprentices.  It has now established statutory schemes of apprenticeship for the trade of motor mechanic, the trade of electrician and the trades in the furniture industry.  Apprenticeship committees now regulate the recruitment and training of apprentices in these trades throughout the State.</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle recently carried out a statutory examination of apprenticeship in the engineering and metal trades, and, as a result, these trades will shortly be brought within the scope of the Apprenticeship Act.  An Chomhairle has announced that it is undertaking a statutory examination of apprenticeship in the building industry, and statutory control is likely to be applied to that industry later this year.  It is hoped early next year to tackle apprenticeship in the printing industry so that by the end of its <Col N="138" /> first five year term of office most of the important industries where apprenticeship is the method of training for skill will have been brought under statutory control.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the Fair Trade Commission completed their survey of certain aspects of the supply and distribution of medicinal and toilet preparations.  The Commission then made Fair Trading Rules with the object of preventing collective restrictions in relation to proprietary household remedies, infant and invalid foods, non-alcoholic health drinks and toilet preparations.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of the turnover tax, a number of complaints were made alleging collective action by traders to fix prices for certain commodities contrary to the provisions of the Restrictive Trade Practices (Groceries) Order, 1956.  The Commission carried out investigations in more than 60 towns throughout the country in November, December and January last.  They reported that, with the exception of less than a dozen cases, there was no evidence of collective action to fix prices.  I directed that proceedings be taken against the traders who had offended.  However, later investigations by the Department's inspectors in the towns concerned showed that the efforts to maintain fixed prices had not been successful, and that trading conditions had reverted to normal competitive levels.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that it has been brought home to traders that they could not be allowed to take advantage of the turnover tax to manipulate prices in a manner detrimental to the public interest, and accordingly, I have decided not to proceed further with prosecutions against individual traders.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the need for raising productivity in industry.  It is also necessary to pay close attention to the services sector of the economy.  The distributive traders are a very important part of the services sector and the efficiency or otherwise of these trades in handling the output of the production sector can have a very marked affect on the prosperity of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> In view of these considerations, I have created within the Commerce Division of my Department an efficiency of distribution unit which will be specially charged with ensuring that the maximum potentialities of the distributve sector of the economy are employed towards the realisation of the aims of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  It may be that the unit will arrange for the setting up of an advisory committee on which appropriate interests would serve and whose views would be taken into account in the consideration of measures proposed for the assistance of the distributive trades.</P>
    <P>I have also arranged for the formation under the auspices of my Department of the General Council on Commercial Consideration of Freer Trade Conditions.  The Council has been formed to consider the problems which will arise for industry and for the distributive trades in the movement towards freer trade and to encourage the distributive trades to support Irish products.  The Irish National Productivity Committee has also turned its attention to productivity in the distributive trades and after a recent seminar on the subject it is giving consideration to the establishment of a productivity committee for those trades.</P>
    <P>It is very gratifying to be able to report that our exports for the year 1963 amounted to the record figure of £196 million, which represents an increase of more than £21 million over the export figure for the year 1962. Apart from increases attributable to agricultural products, there has in this period been an important increase in our exports of machinery and transport equipment, clothing and footwear, yarns, fabrics and made-up articles, and leather and leather manufactures. The increasingly important role which industry is now playing in relation to our export trade is a source of great encouragement.</P>
    <P>Export achievements by industry over the past number of years are very impressive and must be a source of great encouragement to both old and <Col N="140" /> new industries which are contemplating export development.  Irish industry has sometimes been regarded in the past as a form of economic development capable of existing under conditions of protection and concerned solely with meeting the requirements of the domestic market.  Whatever may be the validity of this viewpoint&mdash;and I am not to be taken as subscribing to it &mdash;it is plain that a transformation has taken place in the attitude of industry itself in relation to competitive marketing.</P>
    <P>It has now been established that, over a wide range of products, Irish industry is capable of meeting keen competition in external markets and of overcoming that competition, notwithstanding the existence of external trade barriers which have to be surmounted. We are now exporting the products of our factories in ever increasing quantities and varieties to foreign markets.  This is a most dramatic and encouraging development. It has now become evident that industry will have a much more decisive role to play in the future than in the past in relation to our external trade, and there can be no doubt as to its ability and willingness to meet the challenge of competition in foreign markets.</P>
    <P>The year which has passed has been a year of steady progress and consolidation. It has witnessed the establishment of new and important industrial manufacturing units with a considerable export potential.  Industry has continued to provide a satisfactory level of employment which will increase further in the year which lies ahead. Industry, generally, has become more conscious of the necessity for re-adaptation and reorganisation with the object of increasing its competitiveness not only in the domestic market but in external markets as well.  I feel that we can look forward with confidence to a further expansion of the economy based on the practical achievements of the past 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> One of the facts which presents itself to industrialists or persons who wish to start or expand an industry is the multiplicity of bodies dealing with industrial matters.  It may well be that the time has arrived when a general review of the number of bodies dealing with industrial matters is necessary. It would appear from experience and from the Minister's speech on this and other occasions that too many bodies exist.  We have the Industrial Development Authority, An Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Credit Company, all of which have separate functions.  While all are contributing in one way or another to industrial development, the position is that any person wishing to start or to extend an industrial project has to visit and consult all these bodies.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which arise from this multiplicity of bodies is the delay, which indeed in some cases arises from the mere fact that a number of organisations or boards and their different staffs have to deal with these matters.  Sometimes these delays appear unnecessary to industrialists and very often frustrate efforts to proceed with plans for development. The fact that so many bodies are involved also causes a good deal of additional work for those concerned as well as for the staffs of these undertakings. While these bodies have played a very effective role in promoting industrial development, the question of reducing in some way the number of such bodies is worthy of consideration, and after the experience of a number of years, the matter might be examined again.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement on the need to plan industrial development and for the provision of State assistance to help industrialists expand and develop.  The picture given in the Minister's review and the statistics on employment and exports indicate that the main increase in employment and the main contribution to any expected increase in the future must come from industrial expansion.  While agricultural production may expand, the prospect of increased employment in agriculture is nil.  In fact, the whole effort will be <Col N="142" /> to ensure that those already employed in agriculture will remain in employment. It is significant that despite the increase in employment which the Minister mentioned in his speech, there are today some 70,000 fewer persons in employment than seven or eight years ago, so that allowing for the normal movement to manhood and womanhood by those seeking employment in the future, we will also have the problem of absorbing those who will leave the land and leave rural employment.</P>
    <P>We believe that economic progress is not possible except by careful planning and in this endeavour the Government must not merely provide the various necessary incentives but must in addition take the lead in spearheading this movement and in securing the co-operation and assistance of industrialists, workers and all who play a part in this national endeavour.  The necessary measures to achieve this objective can be adopted and implemented in conformity with our great belief in individual freedom and our universally accepted Christian principles.  This is a matter which has been the subject of investigation and study in other countries.  In Europe and in those countries which are our competitors, as well as in Britain, one of the problems which have been the subject of investigation is the extent to which State or semi-State planning can be undertaken, whilst at the same time ensuring that individual initiative and freedom are allowed adequate play.</P>
    <P>In the April-June issue of <i>Political Quarterly</i>, this year, a careful study of this problem, Planning and Persuasion in a Mixed Economy, is undertaken and there are many relevant comments. Although it deals primarily with conditions in Britain, there are many aspects which may well be somewhat similar to ours at any rate to the extent to which we have a mixed economy.  There is in the article a phrase which I believe epitomises the answer and sums up the problem and it is this : &ldquo;Obviously a balance must be struck somewhere between efficiency and flexibility&rdquo;.  That precise balance is the problem which Governments <Col N="143" /> and those directly concerned with the problem have to face.</P>
    <P>In this country the State companies and other large organisations have little difficulty in planning ahead and over a reasonably long period they can set well defined targets.  Indeed, in most cases these targets are fixed a number of years in advance.  The same applies to non-State companies of size and experience.  Where the difficulty arises is in the case of small undertakings in respect of which, because of their size, lack of adequate market research facilities and the lack of up-to-date information on future prospects problems will arise.  To that end the State, through their various agencies as well as the assessments that have been made in the CIO reports, can play an effective and practical role in supplying these smaller firms with the necessary data and providing them with technical knowledge and the experience which is available to larger organisations and which the committees set up by the CIO have.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate in that regard to pay tribute to what has been done by these committees.  As the Minister said, many valuable studies have been made and one case in particular comes to mind, that is, the committee dealing with footwear which has provided practical benefits for the trade in general.  If these reports are carefully analysed and studied and if the recommendations made are implemented, then such implementation will encourage and assist particularly small firms as well as, of course, larger ones, in the planned development which is necessary in reaching either the targets which have been set by themselves or the general targets for development in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>I have long held the view that the trade agreements existing between this country and continental countries require to be revised, and the statement by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Speech that the Government have decided to reopen the discussions on the terms of our admission <Col N="144" /> to the GATT was generally welcome. The existing trade agreements between ourselves and continental countries have in most cases now been in operation for a number of years.  They were, in the main, negotiated shortly after the War but the circumstances were entirely different from what they are today.  In the years that have passed, the general pattern of trade with continental countries has been heavily adverse, to such an extent that the pattern now in most cases is that we import from them about four times what they buy from us.  If it were possible to get a multilateral trading arrangement which would govern our trading relations with the various European countries, it would obviously be the most satisfactory agreement possible.  However, in default of such an agreement, it seems to me the time has arrived when the bilateral agreements should be reconsidered and revised in order to take account of the changes which have since occured.</P>
    <P>The revision of these agreements might not have been necessary if we had become members of the EEC or if there seemed a reasonable prospect we would become members in a short time.  With the breakdown last year of the negotiations for a wider EEC membership, the need to reconsider our whole trading position has arisen. While, as I have said, we welcome the decision to reopen negotiations on the terms of our admission to the GATT, if these negotiations are protracted, and that would appear to be the likely situation, then we ought to take some further measures adequately to protect our interests in the trading arrangements we have.  I would be interested in hearing whether, and to what extent, consideration has been given to the possibility of a bilateral trade agreement with the EEC Commission.  I gather from the Taoiseach's reply in the course of his answers today to Parliamentary Questions that the possibility of that is one of the matters which is being considered.</P>
    <P>In considering trade matters and existing agreements, it is also important we should consider our trading position with Britain, which is our largest <Col N="145" /> market.  There is now a general recognition of the value to this country of the British market, but whether we are making the maximum use of that market is another matter.  Indeed, when we realise the immense trade advantages which certain preferences in the British market give us, it is well to consider whether our food exports to that country could not be increased. At present food exports from this country to Britain amount to approximately only five per cent of Britain's total food imports.  The fact that we are in such close proximity to Britain, with its very large industrial population, and that we have the ability to produce food of the highest quality and standard makes it obvious that this aspect of our external trade needs more attention.</P>
    <P>In no sphere of national affairs is there greater need for a more intelligent approach than in that of industrial relations.  To say that is not to reflect in any way on those concerned in these matters but it is important to try to devise means which will provide a better system for the discussion and settlement of all problems under this heading.  The growth and development of the Labour Court emphasises the anxiety of those concerned in these problems to utilise the machinery available for the purpose of discussing and settling the various problems which arise.  The establishment of the National Employer/Labour Conference was a definite move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>On these matters there is an advantage in looking elsewhere to see what has been accomplished.  To suggest that what has been done in other countries could be adopted here without modification would be absurd. Whatever arrangements are adopted or whatever system is put into operation must obviously take account of local conditions and circumstances, the character of the people and the background from which they evolved. Nevertheless, it is worth considering what has been done in other countries in Western Europe.  In Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands, the development of industrial relations has been quite <Col N="146" /> remarkable.  Sweden, for example, is notable for the fact that two major organisations have developed: the Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions and the Swedish Employers Confederation.  The fact that in Sweden these arrangements have worked satisfactorily has been referred to on many occasions and they have been held out as a model for other countries.</P>
    <P>In the past year, with two exceptions, industrial matters, particularly the fixing of wages and matters of that sort, have been dealt with by negotiation between representatives of employers and workers, either direct or under the auspices of the Labour Court or whatever other machinery was available.  However, with the advent of the turnover tax and with the effect of that tax on prices and the consequent substantial rise in the cost of living, the Government felt that direct Government intervention was necessary.</P>
    <P>In certain European countries, there is a tripartite representation of bodies dealing with wages and salaries, the State, the employers and the trade unions.  Heretofore in this country, it has been a matter, as I have said, for direct negotiation, but the intervention by the Taoiseach in the last round of wage and salary increases has marked a definite change in the State's attitude towards wage and salary adjustments.  Whether the departure from what has been normal practice is desirable or in the long run is in the national interest might well be open to question.</P>
    <P>The fact that a decision in the form of a direct intervention has taken place marks a break with past practice and a departure from existing arrangements. While a tripartite arrangement may have many factors to recommend it and may offer solutions to the problem involved, the haphazard manner in which the Taoiseach intervened in wage and salary matters by writing to the employers and trade unions may have consequences which have not yet been properly calculated or fairly or accurately assessed.  This decision, which in the normal way should be taken on economic or social grounds, <Col N="147" /> was undoubtedly influenced by political consideration.  Wage and salary adjustments should not normally be altered on the basis of political expediency.  The consequences of wage and salary adjustments made on the basis of political considerations rather than on economic or social considerations need no emphasis.  The repercussions of such a yardstick for settling or adjusting these matters might have serious reactions and might alter the whole basis of wage and salary adjustments.</P>
    <P>The prime reason for the Taoiseach's intervention in this matter was the substantial rise in prices effected by the introduction of the turnover tax and I was somewhat surprised that in the course of the Minister's speech he dealt in such a brief manner with the rise in prices.  I believe that experience has shown that price control is rarely effective except, perhaps, during wartime when compulsory controls operate.  Our experience during the war indicated that the prices fixed become the minimum prices and that generally competition is the most effective method of ensuring that the customer gets a fair deal.  While allowing for these general criteria to apply we seem, in the last six months or so, to have gone from one extreme to another and it is difficult to estimate how a turnover tax introduced at the rate of 2½ per cent can have had such a dramatic effect on the price range.</P>
    <P>The latest cost of living index figure shows that it rose from 159 in mid-May, 1963, to 171 in mid-May, 1964, and that since mid-February of 1964 it rose from 165 to 171 in mid-May. The Minister mentioned that there had been a number of price investigations but these have taken place behind closed doors and the results have only been made public on a limited scale. I believe a public inquiry is valuable at times if only for the purpose of bringing the searchlight of public attention to focus on the matter under discussion.</P>
    <P>The very steep rise in the cost of living is felt particularly by pensioners and others living on fixed incomes.  It <Col N="148" /> has adversely affected all sections of the community and, while Ministerial or Departmental action may not operate to reduce prices, at least the Minister's Department might act to ensure that price rises are not excessive. There is a general belief that the range of increases far exceeds the 2½ per cent, even allowing an adequate margin for the trade concerned and that the rise has been beyond what is justified by the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>This country lacks any great resources in raw materials and with the exception of our arable land we have very few raw materials capable of being exploited.  We have, however, a highly intelligent and adaptable people capable of being trained and equipped to exploit and thereby benefit by their talents and capacity.  When trained and equipped they can benefit not merely themselves but the nation. Recently great emphasis and considerable attention has been directed to the need for improved educational and training facilities and one of the satisfactory features of the educational system has been the vocational schools. The development of the Ceard Comhairle and the committees established under it indicate the further attention being given to this matter.  The Minister should collaborate with the Minister for Education in utilising to the full the facilities available in these schools to give our people the latest technological and scientific training which, when applied to industrial and commercial matters, will enable them to obtain better positions at home and assist those who are obliged to emigrate to have the knowledge and skill necessary to command better positions.</P>
    <P>The growth of industrial expansion is something in which the country as a whole may take pride.  The fact that we are developing our industrial arm much later than many of our competitors is no reason for feeling disheartened or disappointed with the rate of development.  We have people of considerable skill and ability capable of being trained and equipped to utilise their talents to expand industry and the potential of the country. If we make maximum use of the <Col N="149" /> technical facilities and assistance provided, if we plan our trade arrangements and industrial developments on the basis of our ability to secure a growing share of the European as well as the world market, we can offer more of our people employment in good conditions and in security in future, but to that end the combined resources of all sections of the community must be brought to bear in the most co-operative manner and in the way best calculated to achieve the results that all who are interested in the problem desire.  In order to achieve these results, the combined efforts of all must be directed towards expanding our economy and developing the resources of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully </NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Minister has put quite a new face on the approach of the State to industry. We all welcome the energetic way the Minister sets about his task.  Unfortunately, while the growth in national expansion has been quite good over the past 12 months, there seems to be something lacking.  From the Minister's figures, it would appear as if the increase in employment in industry over 1962 is a round figure of 5,500.  There still appear to be some 70,000 fewer people in employment than there were a few years ago and it looks very much, therefore, as if we are not taking up the slack.</P>
      <P>Agriculture seems to be able to get rid of people far faster than industry can find employment for them.  The Minister will have to do a great deal more in order to try to bridge the gap. In addition to that, over the past year, if we are to go by the figures supplied by the Central Statistics Office, the emigration figure has doubled and from 12,500 last year, the figure this year has increased to 25,000.  The Minister will agree that, if that is the correct figure, a great deal must be done to try to find employment for those people who will otherwise have to emigrate.  If industry is not finding employment for them, they must emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Right through the Minister's speech, I notice that, when employment is <Col N="150" /> referred to, the phrase used is &ldquo;the employment potential&rdquo;.  He and I crossed swords over this some months ago during Question Time here. Would the Minister say is this, in fact, the figure which industries seeking grants give to An Foras Tionscal as being the possible number who will be employed, because it would appear that very few of them have so far reached the so-called employment potential?  We find industries which were supposed to employ 500,600 and 700 men employing fewer than 100, and the 100 may be made up mostly of girls with a small residue of men. Would the Minister comment on that because, if we are to remedy the position, we must get down to facts? There is no point in saying that an industry will employ a certain number of people over a number of years if the history of the industries we have already helped to start is that they are not employing anything like the number they stated or thought they would be able to employ.</P>
    <P>I noticed today at Question Time that the Taoiseach had gone back again to the old story about the EEC. He was back on the &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo; line.  A few months ago, he made it quite clear to everybody that if Great Britain did not go in we would not go in.  That was a complete change from what he had been saying previously but I think everybody agreed, in view of the fact that Great Britain buys the bulk of our exports, it was the honest thing to say.</P>

      <P>He reversed engines. He was back again to the &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo;.  In matters such as this, it would be far better for the Government to come down on one side of the fence or the other.  Possibly the visit of the French Foreign Minister has created new enthusiasm for the idea of membership of the European Economic Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully </NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not comment on what he said.  Perhaps he said some rude things.  No matter how anxious we may be to enter the Community, it should be made quite clear that we are not going in unless our best customer is still available to us.  That, I think, is the sensible approach, and I suggest the Government would be much better off if they stated that bluntly and not have this dithering.  Whether or not it is a question of full membership, or what type of association we may have, or the correct term for the association, and the Taoiseach made great play on this at Question Time today, does not really matter.  What does matter is whether or not we are going in and, if we are not going in, then let us know where we stand.</P>
      <P>We are told in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> that we can easily reach the target. Everybody says we can reach it and, therefore, there should be no difficulty about it.  It is all based on membership of the European Economic Community by 1970.  We should, I think, be very careful about this.  If we do not go into the Community, are we still confident we can reach the target set in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion?</i> That is something on which the Minister should make a definite statement when he comes to reply.</P>
      <P>It has been said&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave referred to it and welcomed it&mdash;that the application for membership has been reconsidered.  Perhaps we could have some further information on that.  I know the Government cannot tell the House or the country every step they take but the members of this House should, at least, be taken as far as possible into the confidence of the Government. While the Government are the people in control, at the same time, every elected representative in this House is entitled to know if some important step is being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the balance of trade with other European countries has been mentioned.  The Minister should <Col N="152" /> attempt to do something about this question of countries which are flooding this country with various commodities and taking very little in return.  I mentioned this the other night to the Minister on a Bill.  The drop in the tariff barriers, which the Government have set as one of their declared policies, has encouraged this lack of balance between imports from and exports to certain countries.  I believe that exceptions should be made and countries which buy very little from us should not be treated in the same way as those which buy on a large scale.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech, there was a passing reference to the Industrial Relations Act.  I agree with the Minister that, taking the country generally, we have at the present time a better climate than we have had for a very long time as far as industrial relations are concerned.  That being so, is it not a pity that a Department of State should say to its employees: &ldquo;You cannot have the same type of treatment as any other type of worker&rdquo;? Is it not a pity that something cannot be done to prevent the continuance of a strike which has already lasted too long.  I do not want to go further with it, but I think the Minister might very well use his offices, because someone will have to intervene.  This is a matter on which I feel very strongly.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of industrial relations about which I think the Minister should be informed&mdash;I intend to write to him personally if he is not aware of the position&mdash;is that there are industries which are not prepared to recognise the right of their employees to become members of a trade union. As recently as last week, one such industry dispensed with the services of two employees who had committed no greater crime than that of acting as shop stewards of a trade union which had recently started to organise the workers in the industry.  It is shocking that in 1964, 51 years after the 1913 strike, 51 years after Larkin taught the workers of Dublin what they could do, and the employers what the workers of Dublin could do, we still have that type of approach.</P>
    <P>I am told this is not isolated.  I <Col N="153" /> am told that there are people who are prepared to accept industrial grants in a big way, such as the firm to which I have referred, who are under the impression that they can do so without allowing their employees to be members of a trade union.  The only reason any employer will object to his employees being members of a trade union is the fact that he does not agree with paying fair wages or giving fair conditions.  There is no other conceivable reason why any employer should attempt to keep his employees out of a trade union.  I intend bringing this matter to the Minister's notice personally and, knowing the Minister, I feel the necessary action will be taken, but it is as well to have it placed on the records of the House that 51 years after 1913, some people still have that mentality.  The people concerned in this case are not Irish. They have come in from another country, and I suppose they have a different point of view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave made a comment with which I entirely disagree.  He used an argument which has been used on numerous occasions, and wrongly used.  A number of speakers from both sides of the House have said that the Taoiseach fixed up the ninth round of wage increases.  That ninth round of wage increases was agreed on between the employers and the workers' representatives.  Let me repeat that the Taoiseach did not fix it up.  That ninth round of wage increases would have taken place, whether or not the Taoiseach gave the green light.  That cannot be said too often.  If anyone has any doubt about it, it is as well to repeat that at a critical stage of the negotiations, the Taoiseach said his advisers had told him that the most the national economy could carry was not more than an eight per cent increase.</P>
    <P>In fact, a 12 per cent minimum was agreed on between the employers and the trade unions which is 50 per cent more than the Taoiseach felt could be given.  How anyone, no matter from what side of the House, can claim that the wage negotiations were carried out by the Taoiseach, and by order of the Government, I fail to understand.  It <Col N="154" /> is only fair that that matter should be put on record so that we can know exactly where we stand.  I know what I am talking about because I took part in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I have said before, but let me repeat, that the one thing the Taoiseach did&mdash; and I give him credit for it&mdash;was that when a breakdown in the negotiations took place, the Taoiseach called the two parties together again.  I give him credit for that.  He did that, but before they met, he told both sides that he felt eight per cent was the most that could be given.  That was eight per cent flat. In fact, the increase was 12 per cent over £8 5s. 6d., and under £8 5s. 6d., it was a minimum of £1, which is much more than 12 per cent.  Those facts should be recorded, because we have heard the Government Party and the Fine Gael Party using that argument when it suited themselves.  I think it is right to try to clear it up.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a brief reference to price control.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of what has happened and what is happening.  A few months ago, I said that what was shown in the mid-February cost of living figure bore no relation to what was actually happening, and that the full effect of the price increases would not be shown until the mid-May figure was available.  How right I was, because, when the mid-May figure became available, it showed, no matter how it was covered up, that there has been a very substantial increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I know that certain sections of the community are trying to argue that we must have an increase in the cost of living because of the fact that the workers got a 12 per cent increase.  Is the Minister aware that some manufacturers are claiming they are entitled to increase the price of their goods by 12 per cent because of the fact that they had to give a 12 per cent increase in their workers' wages.  That argument does not hold at all, because if it did, the entire costs of the manufacturers went in wages, and we all know that is not so.  In many cases the proportion of the wages as against the cost of the products is as low as ten or 12 per <Col N="155" /> cent.  Despite that, some manufacturers insist on charging an extra 12 per cent to the retailers who, in turn, pass it on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the Minister for Finance is reasonably happy about the situation, but whether he will be so happy when the by-election is fought in Roscommon is another matter.  He is quite happy because every time the cost of goods goes up, the amount collected in turnover tax is increased. Therefore, he does not feel that anything drastic should be done.  Again and again over the past couple of months, and particularly over the past couple of weeks, members of the Labour Party have been trying to persuade the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do something serious about investigating prices.  The Minister said he was having certain investigations carried out.</P>
    <P>For weeks and weeks, an investigation was carried out into the price of soap, and the people who carried out the investigation came to the conclusion that there was no abnormal increase in the price of soap.  I do not know how that investigation was carried out.  As Deputy Cosgrave said, it was carried out behind closed doors, and there was no opportunity of finding out what evidence was produced, or was not produced.  Anyone who thinks an increase of up to 25 per cent&mdash;which is the amount by which the price of soap was increased early on&mdash;is not an abnormal increase, has something wrong with his thinking.</P>
    <P>The price of quite a number of other items has been increased, and the Minister said he was carrying out spot investigations throughout the country at retail level to find out if people were charging extra as a result of the turnover tax.  Price levels were increased fairly substantially after the first couple of months of the operation of the turnover tax, but the really serious increase in prices took place after 1st February, when the retailers and wholesalers felt the mid-February cost of living index figure could not be affected by it.  That is why such a <Col N="156" /> steep increase is shown in the mid-May figure.</P>
    <P>Despite what many people have said, I believe that price control is possible.  I am afraid I could not follow the reasoning behind some of Deputy Cosgrave's arguments.  He said it was not effective; he said the only way to keep down prices was through competition and that in present circumstances price control should be introduced because, he said, while you cannot reduce prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the Prices Body were in operation and when manufacturers went to increase prices, there was a special hearing.  I believe that was effective.  I am a trade union official and if I want to seek an increase for my members, I have to go to the Labour Court in public session and justify it.  If I do not, the Labour Court will throw the claim out.  We see no reason why manufacturers should be allowed to increase prices by as much as ten or 15 per cent <Col N="157" /> without any inquiry being held.  So far, with the possible exception of sugar, we have received negative results from all the inquiries held.</P>
      <P>One point on which I should like to question the Minister&mdash;he may say it has nothing to do with his Department&mdash;has to do with apprentices. Perhaps he would consider a system under which apprentices could be covered by insurance.  At the present time they are not insurable until they have reached 16 years of age.  There has been talk about increasing the school-leaving age.  That is all very well when it comes, but at the moment I suggest young apprentices should be covered by insurance even before they reach 16 years.  If they enter a trade to train in it, obviously the intention is that they will remain in that type of work for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>There has been reference to the care and maintenance of St. Patrick's Mines.  Would the Minister say whether the advertisement published recently resulted in any inquiries in this respect&mdash;is there anybody interested in the mines or are we likely to have to continue to pay substantial amounts for the care and maintenance of the mines for years to come?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the efforts being made by Minister Teoranta to get under way.  Will he tell us whether or not this industry, at present operating with the help of substantial State subsidies, is seriously affecting the future of existing grassmeal factories? Is the Minister aware that one such factory, which had been in operation for many years, has been forced to close down, that another one is on the way out and that a number of other similar undertakings are likely to go out of existence?  In order to clear the air, would the Minister let us know whether it is intended that the State should continue to subsidise the manufacture of grassmeal by this industry to the detriment of existing grassmeal factories?</P>

      <P>I did not know the Minister was a true blue socialist.  I <Col N="158" /> am glad to learn he is leaning in that direction.  We have always said from these benches that if private enterprise is not able to do the job, then the State should step in and take a hand. Here we have a reversal of it: the State is helping to put these industries out of existence.  I am interested in this mainly because one of these factories is in my constituency.  I should not like to have it closed down because it is giving very good, well paid employment.  I submit the Minister should take a long, serious look at this situation.  If it were only a question of assisting this industry to get under way so that it would subsequently complete in the normal way, there would be no objection, but if there is to be a continued subsidy for the purpose of undercutting industries that have existed for some time. I object to it as a very bad idea.  It is as well the Minister should know of our attitude to Minfheir Teoranta at Geesala in the west of County Mayo.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that some of the CIO subcommittees have been doing excellent work.  They set about a most unenviable task and have set an example which it would be advisable for a number of Government Commissions to follow.  They were given a job and they got down to it.  In some cases their recommendations seem to have been misinterpreted.  I refer again to an area in my constituency where a new factory was about to start, with Irish directors and Irish money.  Foras Tionscal were asked for a grant.  The grant was not a very big one, only £18,000.  If they had sought £180,000 and used a strange sounding name, they would have got a better hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being ordinary Irish people, they gave the facts and asked for £18,000. They had got a very substantial export <Col N="159" /> order for their products.  They went about the thing in a proper way and were engaging in a type of manufacture not already done in this country. I understand the CIO report was used as an excuse to prevent those people getting the grant they sought.  I made some inquiries and found the explanation was that CIO had said there would have to be some system through which these factories would be made more effective.  It was said that the export of produce of those factories would increase by 300 per cent by 1970.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether existing factories are supposed to be able to increase their production by such a percentage or whether there is to be a type of factory to manufacture this product, but since this firm had guaranteed that all their output would be exported, I consider it most unfair they should be refused a grant by Foras Tionscal.  This happened in a town where there is very little industrial employment.  I should be very glad, therefore, if the Minister would tell us if he agrees with the Foras Tionscal interpretation of the CIO report.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that even though they have a big export order they would not be able to export everything because, if they produce seconds, the seconds must be sold in this country.  I do not agree.  I am sure there may be a certain market for those abroad, too. That seems to be the only argument now made against them.  The extraordinary thing is that when the Minister was making his opening speech he referred to some industries which were doing quite well and had got a lot of money from the State.  One of the industries he mentioned as being entirely for export was that concerned with broiler hatching eggs.  I think I know the particular industry to which the Minister was referring.  They got a substantial State grant.  They are now supplying most of the broiler people in this country with chicks.  The Minister says it is for export only.  It looks as if what is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> If an exception is to be made in one case, it should apply all around.  It is very disheartening.  We find people able to get substantial grants on the guarantee that they will export all their produce, and yet they are flooding the home market.  Immediately afterwards somebody, who can, in fact, be forced to carry out the guarantee, is refused a grant.  The Minister should have a look at this particular application. The extraordinary thing is that if a grant is not available here, these people can go to Northern Ireland and not alone will they get a grant but they will get a factory.  From there they will be able to export to England and we will lose them.</P>
    <P>I am sufficiently worried about employment in my constituency to say that a matter of this kind should be dealt with in a different way from the way it has been dealt with so far.  We know that substantial grants have been given to industries that did not last very long.  I do not want to go into their history.  It should be sufficient to mention one such as Flatley's.  If my colleague, Deputy M. P. Murphy from west Cork, were here, I am sure he would regale the Minister at length on what was promised about west Cork and what came out of it.  A very considerable grant was given to that firm.  Where were those people before they got the money and where are they now?  It makes very interesting reading to find out what actually happened in that case.  We find people, who apparently have very little background anybody could be proud of, finishing up with £90,000 of the taxpayers' money and going out of business in a short time.  Yet we find people who are making a genuine effort to start a business being refused on what I consider to be very flimsy grounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the number of projects being started, the number under consideration, the amount of money involved and so on.  He seems to be basing his figures on the potential employment.  He gave us information concerning the grants made by Foras Tionscal for industries outside the undeveloped areas during the year ended the 31st March, 1964.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> Grants amounting to nearly £1 million were approved bringing the total grants approved for such projects to £6,700,000.  Of this latter sum, grants totalling £3,300,000 were paid to 31st March, 1964, leaving outstanding commitments of £3,400,000.  The total capital investment in these projects amounts to almost £29 million.  It is estimated that these projects, which are mainly in the export field, will employ about 16,000 persons.</P>
    <P>Again, this is the potential employment, which bears very little relationship to the true figures.</P>
    <P>Will somebody try to get an estimate of the number of people who have been actually employed in new industries over the past 12 months?  I know it is not an easy job to do so, but I think it can be done.  Last year a man who does a very useful job in Meath making hurley sticks, which are in very short supply, found he was not able to meet the demand and asked for a grant for the purpose of extending his business.  Do you believe me when I tell you he got from Foras Tionscal a letter asking him if he would be able to guarantee that he could export to Common Market countries the produce of his factory? I would love to see every country in Europe playing hurling.  I share the Minister's fondness for it.  But I think that was drawing the bow a bit too far.  The person who made that application was perfectly satisfied he would not be able to export hurling sticks to the Common Market countries.  He did not get a grant.</P>

      <P>I will give the Minister the original letter.  I am sure he will be as amused as I was.  But the man who got it was not amused.  He could not see the humour in it.  I have a second case of a man carrying on a substantial business in various types of timber work.  He employs about five people.  He had not the necessary capital for expansion and he applied <Col N="162" /> for a grant.  Again, he just did not get it.  They did not ask him to export field gates to the Common Market countries, but they did not give him any money.  I honestly believe that people who are making an effort to expand their business and give good employment should get more encouragement than simply the stereotyped reply saying that under certain regulations they do not qualify for a grant.</P>
      <P>As far as I am personally concerned, I find the Minister on top of his job. He seems to be able to answer most of our questions.  Maybe he does not answer them to our satisfaction, but at least he answers them courteously. That is the most we ask of any Minister of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>One is pleased to note that the Minister can record progress in his Department during the year.  Industrial activity has taken a great jump forward and export figures constitute a record.  In 1963, we achieved an increase of £21 million in the export of manufactured goods.  This has been a tremendous help, especially to our balance of payments problem. But, above all, there is the employment given to our workers.  I listened to Deputy Cosgrave's speech.  I expected, as a result of the recent Fine Gael Ard-Fheis, to have heard something more constructive.  Frankly, the speech was a very tame one.  One would have to search very hard to find any new ideas in it.  He referred to the number of Boards dealing with industrial development in this country and said that it probably could be dealt with in some different way.  I rather take the view that all of these boards come directly under the Minister for Industry and Commerce and they are merely departments advising people. Three, and possibly four, of them have that function.  That is very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would have expected some positive policy in the field of planning and control from Fine Gael.  We hear the word &ldquo;planning&rdquo; used quite extensively from the Fine Gael benches but there is no evidence outside that that they have any plans, good, bad or indifferent.  Indeed, I am not surprised <Col N="163" /> at this at all.  It would be quite a record, judging by the progress that the Minister's Department is making in the field of industrial development, if any Party in this House, or any Party in this country, could come in with something that would best what he is doing.</P>
    <P>The figure the Minister gives for industrial expansion and the rate of growth of gross national production in this particular field is quite good.  Last year it was something as high as 7 per cent.  That is no mean achievement in this particular field.  Deputy Cosgrave was not able to bring in any plan that would take the colour off that achievement.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Tully. Again, we hear from the Labour benches the usual spate of unfounded complaints levelled against every Department.  They are all without foundation.  We heard the remark that manufacturers said they would give the 12 per cent increase in wages but they would increase their products by 12 per cent.  This, of course, is completely untrue.  The very idea that anybody would even think of increasing their products by 12 per cent merely because they increased wages by 12 per cent is just laughable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully is quite glib at this <Col N="164" /> type of political remark at any time. They are not for the benefit of this House but for outside consumption and one can let them pass for that reason.  He went on to say that after the introduction of the turnover tax manufacturers increased their prices ten or 15 per cent.  Again, this remark was unsubstantiated and backed by no evidence, good, bad or indifferent. That is typical of Deputy Tully.  He takes the Minister to task for something vague, something unfounded, and expects the Minister to give him an intelligent answer.  That is an entire farce.</P>
    <P>One can remark on the lack of any comment by members of the Opposition about the Government's policy on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  There was no comment as to whether industrial employment would be found for some 78,000 people by 1970.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that I should have occasion to bring the Minister for Justice into the House at this late hour to hear what I have to say, but I would not be doing my duty if I did not raise this question on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I have received a deputation from a very responsible body, the Irish Countrywomen's Association in County Kilkenny, who, on learning that the Garda district headquarters at Callan was being changed to a district station felt that this change was not warranted, especially at the present time.  They represented that the town of Callan is an important town in Kilkenny and that its size warrants a Garda District headquarters, which it has had since the foundation of the State.  The Irish Countrywomen's Association feel that there will not be the same police protection as there has been down the years if this change is made.  It has been stated in the debate on the Minister's Estimate that crime has been increasing in the country.  The only way to combat that is to have an adequate police force.</P>
      <P>Callan also is situated on the road to Cork at a very busy junction.  As I mentioned in a supplementary question, in recent times a move was made to start a food processing industry in Callan.  Great credit is due to the people of Callan and the surrounding areas for their fine response to the appeal that went out to them at that time.  They felt if they could get a food processing plant going in conjunction with the Irish Sugar Company, they would be doing a lot of good for their native town.  People in such a town have a pride in it, just as people in large cities have, and like to see it going ahead.  They feel that this move by the Minister for Justice is reducing the status of the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no fault to find with the Commissioner in having put this proposal <Col N="167" /> to the Minister.  After all, that is his job.  He must find the most efficient service, and what he considers, from the point of view of efficient administration, the best service.  The Minister for Justice is the man who comes between, if you like, the official view and the ordinary people.  I feel, and the people of Callan feel, that the Minister should be very slow to give his approval to this move.  The Commissioner may have been asked for his observations, but we feel the responsibility lies on our Minister for Justice to see that these towns are maintained and that the Garda stations are maintained as they have been for the past number of years.</P>
    <P>It is peculiar that within the past year the Post Office authorities wanted to purchase a site for a new post office in Callan and, instead of going ahead with it and building a new post office, it was changed again to a sub-post office.  The Government should lead the people when they are anxious to improve their own towns, if the Government have the good of the people at heart.  We hear a lot of talk about decentralisation of private industry, and a lot said about the flight from the land.  The suggestion was that industries would be established where the people were inclined to leave the land.  The town of Callan has not got the benefit of that.  The opposite is happening in Callan, and instead of decentralisation, the stations are being centralised at the expense of Callan.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply on the Estimate said that the Garda were to be increased by 100 in the coming year. The people down the country hear that the Garda are to be increased and, at the same time, the force in the town of Callan being decreased.  In his reply to my question, the Minister said that this was being done in the interests of economy of manpower and economy in general, and he wanted to know whether I wished to waste money.  It is very debatable where economy comes in&mdash;where it starts and where it finishes.</P>
    <P>Five years ago, the Government thought they would start economy on CIE and would bring CIE to the point <Col N="168" /> of paying its way.  After five years, they discovered that did not happen, and the Minister for Transport and Power introducing a Bill recently asking for £2 million a year to subsidise the railways, stated he was sorry the Government made a mistake in the original estimates.  Instead of making CIE a paying proposition, or at least breaking even, they started closing the lines. There are now 691 miles of lines closed without any hope of return.  If the Minister for Transport and Power took that line of action in the interests of economy, I feel the Minister for Justice should have a second look at this matter of the Garda station in Callan before coming to a decision.  It can be proved by figures that there is an economy of manpower but, if there is a small economy, it is a false one.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the Minister now, but I would ask him to reconsider his decision.  The people feel that this is a first step towards reducing further the status of Callan. Throughout County Kilkenny, several stations have been closed during the past few years, and the people feel that the station at Callan should be maintained.  I have been asked by a deputation to bring this matter before the Minister to review the decision he has already taken and maintain the <i>status quo</i> in Callan.  I was asked the other day whether I wanted the quarters in Callan or Thomastown.  I did not raise that question at all.  What I did say was that Callan should be maintained, and as Thomastown was there, it also should be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Crotty for his courtesy last week in agreeing to leave this matter over when he was entitled to have me replying on the adjournment.  It was anticipated that I might be in the Seanad and Deputy Crotty kindly agreed to facilitate me and left this discussion over until this week when I would be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose any Minister likes to be brought up on the Adjournment. Apart from the fact that it keeps him here late at night, it is to some extent a reflection on the administration of his Department.  On this occasion my <Col N="169" /> reluctance to being detained was overcome by the fact that I was intrigued to know what line of argument Deputy Crotty would put up in support of his contention.  I thought, when I replied to his supplementary question when this matter was brought up at Question Time last week, that I had made the situation sufficiently clear and that I might possibly have satisfied him with regard to it.</P>
    <P>It is important, a Cheann Comhairle, that I should make it clear at the outset that there are two separate and distinct matters involved here: One has to do with the actual policing of towns and areas throughout the country and the other is the administrative structure of the police force as such.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Crotty, or any other Deputy wishes to come here and discuss with me the policing of a particular area, having regard to the population of the area, the size or the existence of crime in the area, or trends and developments about which he might happen to be worried at any particular time, that is something I would seriously have to discuss with the Deputy concerned.  Nothing of that nature is concerned here.  What we are concerned with here is the administrative structure of the force, and the Commissioner's proposal to me that two separate Garda districts be amalgamated, Thomastown and Callan.  In each of these two Garda districts, we have six stations.  Between the two districts we have 12 Garda stations.</P>
    <P>By any modern standard you wish to apply, that is uneconomic.  It is ridiculous to have a superintendent and his district clerk looking after six stations.  The Commissioner's proposals involved amalgamating these two districts&mdash;a hiving of three stations and leaving a total of nine stations under the control of one superintendent.  This is a reasonable economic unit from the administrative point of view.</P>
    <P>To have two superintendents and their clerks administering two districts of six stations each is sheer waste of taxpayers' money and something we cannot tolerate.  Therefore, the Commissioner very rightly&mdash;in pursuance of <Col N="170" /> his duty and his obligation to the Force, to the taxpayer and to the Oireachtas&mdash;decided that they should be amalgamated.  Then his problem was to decide which should be the new district headquarters.</P>
    <P>From the geography of the new amalgamated district, it was clear that Thomastown should be the new district headquarters.  That is all that is involved here.  There is no question whatever at this point of any reduction in the number of the Force available to carry out police duties in Callan. What is happening is that as a result of the amalgamation the administrative unit will be moved out of Callan which will become part of the new district with headquarters in Thomastown which will now combine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am talking about the district car at the moment.  It will now be based on Thomastown as the district car but, in effect, it will be available for the amalgamated district as a whole.</P>
      <P>From the police point of view there is no argument whatever against this move.  In fact, there is everything to be said for it.  It is a rationalisation. It will lead to greater economy in the use of manpower.  It will bring about a saving to public funds and it is desirable from every other point of view in that regard.  The only thing we can be criticised for is whether, by doing this, we are reducing in any way the status of Callan as a town or a city.</P>
      <P>I know as well as Deputy Crotty knows that Callan at one time was the most important town in the county of Kilkenny.  Indeed, I hope we will not ruffle any feelings if we recall that at one time it was almost certainly a bigger and more important town than the city of Kilkenny itself.</P>

      <P>I hope that at some time the town of Callan will succeed in re-establishing its former preeminence. However, I doubt if the status of the town or its economic development or its prestige will in any way be affected by the presence or absence in the town of a Garda district headquarters consisting of a superintendent and his clerk.  I am almost certain that if one asked the average man in the street in Callan, Thomastown or any of the surrounding towns or villages the whereabouts of the local Garda headquarters he could not tell it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we might get an opportunity of putting it to the test.  I want seriously to suggest that this is not in any way degrading Callan in either its status, position or prestige.  It is a simple administrative change in the structure of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> I want to give this undertaking to Deputy Crotty.  If he would like to say to me now or at any stage in the future that the strength of the Garda Síochána in Callan is not sufficient properly to police the area, then I shall have a serious discussion with him and will listen to anything he has to say.  If he can persuade me, I shall be very happy, indeed, to strengthen the numbers of the Force in the town with a view to ensuring that the town and the surrounding area is properly policed.  This is something real and something to which I must have regard.</P>
    <P>When I am simply acceding to the wishes of the Commissioner in bringing about a more efficient administrative structure in the Waterford-Kilkenny division, then I think Deputy Crotty cannot really quarrel with me, particularly when there is no question of its reflecting in any way on the status or prestige of Callan or in any way affecting its economic or social development.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17th June, 1964.</P>
