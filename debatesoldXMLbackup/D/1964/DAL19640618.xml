      <P>I should like to clarify what was said yesterday with reference to amendments to the Transport Bill when I complained that I had not received notification of the disallowing of certain amendments.  The letter was handed to me when I was in the House. I want to complain about the delay in notifying Deputies that their amendments are out of order.  When they are ruled out of order, they are not told until the debate commences.  It is unfair to Deputies that they do not receive this notification earlier.</P>

      <P>This, I think the Minister will agree, is one of the worst examples we have seen in a short Bill of legislation by reference.  It should certainly not happen in the case of a Bill in respect of which there is no question of having to go back over a long series of old Acts.  There is no excuse for legislation by reference.  We should go over to the Scandinavian principle as soon as we possibly can of having Acts dealt with on almost a looseleaf principle so that where there are perhaps four or five Acts such as this, they will be made available in a Consolidation Act instead of our having this type of legislation by reference.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (4), lines 34 to 36, to delete&ldquo;, in the case of a person transferred or seconded under section 14 of the said Great Northern Railway Act, 1958,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to extend to all CIE employees concerned the provisions of section 17 (3) of the Great Northern Railways Act Which enables the superannuation of employees to be increased where they enter the service after the normal age of entry.  It is a corrective arrangement <Col N="433" /> to ensure that all these people will be treated in the same way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am afraid of, that the Minister will treat them all in the same way.  Some of them are offered jobs 70, 80 and 90 miles away from home.  When they went there, they could not get the kind of accommodation they wanted and they had to give up hope of continuing their employment with CIE.  It is ridiculous for the Minister to bring men from outlying counties, where they have good cottages and a reasonable standard of living, into Dublin where they have to pay very high rents for flats.  According to the information I have, they have to pay up to £4 per week for one room and the use of a kitchenette.  It is all right for the Minister to say he wants to treat everybody alike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to the Minister for nearly two years and I cannot break through at all. The Minister never gives an explanation regarding anything, either on the Order Paper or in a question.  He never gives a proper answer, never answers what he is asked.  He answers another question and goes off on another line.</P>

      <P>What is Deputy Ó Briain muttering about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what steps CIE, or the Minister, propose to take to ensure that, when these men become redundant and are transferred, these transfers will be reasonable, and they will not be living 70 and 80 miles away from their place of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the matter to which the Deputy refers does not arise at all.  It has always been a condition of service of CIE on the rail side that men can be transferred from any part of the country to the other.  This is the position and it is accepted by the trade unions and the Board of CIE.  There <Col N="434" /> has never been any change.</P>
      <P>In connection with reorganisation which took place during the past five years, and before that, it should be pointed out that reorganisation takes place at all times at different levels.  It has always been clearly understood that employees of CIE are provided with transport from one region to another.  Redundancy compensation entered into the picture where, for example, a person is transferred from one area to the other when his position alters.  To give an example, if a person were a head ganger in Cork and was transferred to Ballybrophy and there was no position open to him except that of a minor ganger, and he lost certain provisions relating to travel allowance or other perquisities, or fringe benefits, he would be entitled then to compensation in cash.  That is a matter which is regulated between the trade unions and the Board.  I have no control over it.  It would be very wrong for any Minister to enter into such matters.  If the person is aggrieved, he goes to the arbitrator appointed under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to this as it arises frequently in my own constituency.  We are all familiar with the problems arising from redundancy.  These are very largely human problems.  You have a man who is working and living in Clones or Castleblaney.  The tradition was that there was no more stable employment in the country than railway employment.  Then there came this upheaval of redundancy.  Frequently, one finds cases where men in a certain grade had a right to free travel.  They had the right to travel on the train to and from their place of work.  In the new situation, they find themselves transferred to some other centre of employment and discover that that concession is now withdrawn and they are expected to pay for their tickets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have to get the picture in your mind as to what the situation is.  From the point of view of an arbitrator, when a man is transferred from Castleblaney to Dundalk, the arbitrator is <Col N="435" /> inclined to ask: &ldquo;Why do you not go and live in Dundalk?&rdquo; He is quite oblivious of the fact that a man in middle age to have to transfer his family from Castleblaney to Dundalk means the disruption of the whole pattern of his life.  He has no guarantee if he makes that radical change that he will live the rest of his days in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, it is a very common thing to find that when a railway worker resides in a small town, or in a town even like Clones or Castleblaney, he has a little shop in which he sells papers, sweets, and so on.  If the family home is moved from the centre where the family have built up a business, where their friends and neighbours live and where their children are at school, their whole life is disrupted.  When an individual gets caught in the huge machinery of arbitration and the general principles that have been laid down, you find cases where men have got all they are entitled to under the general scheme but where grave hardship remains.</P>
    <P>It has often occurred to me that in this process of adjustments which have been rendered necessary by this redundancy situation, it would be a human and rational thing to say, where people in the past had the right to free travel by rail to and from their place of work, that right should remain to them on whatever form of passenger transport CIE is now operating in the area. In Monaghan, there is the extraordinary situation in which all the railways have been torn up.  There are no railways there now and nothing but road transport in the whole county.  Yet, men are being asked to go from Castleblaney, or from Carrickmacross, to Dundalk to do their day's work.  In theory, they could move their home and their family to live in Dundalk; in practice, it is a very great hardship to impose on them.</P>
    <P>I wonder if it would not be reasonable and possible to say, even though it is not provided for in the general scheme, that a principle might be accepted whereunder, if people have to <Col N="436" /> travel substantial distances to their day's work, CIE might make available to them transport facilities which, after all, cost the company nothing&mdash; the buses are running and are rarely so packed that there is no room for one more man to sit into them&mdash;instead of requiring them to pay the return fare every day.  I think that if that arrangement were made, a good deal of the hardships that at present afflict individuals could be remedied.  But, so long as that amenity is denied, there will be individual cases of hardship throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to realise, when dealing with a broad question, how heavy a burden these hardships are in individual cases.  This is a situation which calls for a human approach.  It may not be possible to incorporate into a broad agreement with the trade union movement a scheme which will provide for every human contingency that can arise, but it would be a prudent thing if the Minister would recommend to the Board that wherever difficulties of this character arise they should lean heavily towards conceding this amenity to persons who find themselves in this difficulty, more especially in that it involves no charge on the Board's funds but is merely a permit to use accommodation in a bus that otherwise would be empty.</P>

Alternative employment was found in two companies in Dundalk for approximately 180 workshop members in 1958.</P>

      <P>The Minister will say, maybe later on, that he answered the questions he was asked here.  But, in his own inimitable style, he is able to distort things so much.  He got up there and gently said that employees of CIE were always liable to be transferred. That is, we will say, a kind of a fact.  We will regard it as a kind of a half-truth and maybe not even a half-truth.  The majority of the people who were transferred in, say, the good days of CIE were transferred on promotion.  They were transferred to better conditions, to better pay and to better housing or they would not accept the promotion.  There may have been the one or two cases where a man, for disciplinary reasons, was sent to a bog station.  Now the Minister is faced with the position that men who have served CIE well, who have good records and who should be in line, maybe, for promotion, are declared redundant and are sent to bog stations, or are told they are to go to bog stations and they surrender and walk out and the Minister, like Pontius Pilate, can wash his hands and say: &ldquo;I am finished with them, anyway.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> In the matter of free transport for the company's employees, I had a famous case that I brought before the Minister.  I shall remind him of it again because he forgets very quickly. A man living in Tramore was working in CIE in Waterford.  He had a privilege ticket on the Tramore railway for about only 11/- a month.  This man did not take home £7 a week at that time.  He had not a great job with CIE in Waterford.  In spite of the fact that the Minister's predecessor guaranteed that the alternative service would be equal to the one he was doing away with, this man then found that he had to travel by bus to Waterford North, in from Tramore, and that it was costing him three times as much.</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of things we have to come up to the House with. When the Minister brings in a Bill, these are the kinds of things we must take the opportunity to speak about here.  These are the kinds of things the Minister and his colleagues would criticise and say: &ldquo;Look at what they are bringing up on a Bill here&mdash;this small item of one man.&rdquo;  But it is the Minister's fault and I charge him with it.  If he had answered the Parliamentary Questions put down to him at that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of compensation for those who are redundant, I am concerned with the problem which affects people who are transferred from rural areas to Dublin. The problem is illustrated by the case of a man down the country who has a house and a garden at a rent of £12 a year.  He is transferred to Dublin and the only accommodation available to him is a flat at a rent of £3.10, £4 or £5 a week, with no garden, and perhaps only one or two rooms for himself, his wife and two or three children.  Quite clearly, if such a man is at an identical point on the wage scale, he suffers a colossal reduction in his living standard if he is removed from a house and garden for which he pays 5/- a week, to a one-roomed flat in Dublin at a rent of £3.10, £3.15 or £4.  I am drawing the attention of the Minister to this matter, and I want him to endeavour to persuade the Board of CIE to do the right thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that in Inchicore where there is a considerable estate of railway houses, built in the last century &mdash; good, solid, stone houses &mdash; a number of those houses have been lying idle.  Some time ago I was told that five houses were lying idle for a considerable time.  It seems outrageous <Col N="441" /> that railway houses should be lying idle when CIE employees are compelled to pay £3.10 or £4 for flats in parts of Dublin when they are transferred from the country.</P>
    <P>There was an enlightened social policy in the 19th century when houses were built for railway employees and let on reasonable terms.  Perhaps CIE propose to sell them.  Whatever their policy is, in the frightful housing situation in Dublin today, they should facilitate their employees and make these houses available by letting them or by selling them.  If a man had to borrow 100 per cent of the capital to buy a house, he would pay less in mortgage repayments than he would have to pay for a one-roomed flat.  This is a very serious and grievous matter, and the Minister should use whatever influence he has with the Board to see that these vacant houses are made available immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have done in this connection is to encourage all State companies to have the most up-to-date and perfect communications for their workers, not only in the form of the usual trade union relationship, but through the trade union relationship to have matters of human and technical interest discussed at all levels.  I pointed out the very urgent necessity, even though it may take some considerable time, of breaking down the sort of invisible wall that exists because of historic circumstances in that regard.  CIE has established a great number of social industrial councils throughout the country which meet at regular intervals, at which workers can bring before the management side not only such matters as upgrading or down-grading, rosters of work during different periods of the day, matters relating to the progress of CIE, and productivity, but also human conditions.  The question raised by Deputy Ryan could probably be dealt with by the joint industrial councils.  The less I, or any Minister in charge, intervene while this process is continuing the better.  Of course, if I felt it was a matter of general interest, in the sense that the trade unions were failing fundamentally in some aspect, I would reconsider the <Col N="442" /> matter, but I have no information which would lead me to believe that the trade union organisations in CIE are not capable of dealing with such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how it is that five houses have been lying idle?  To my knowledge, one house has been lying idle for a couple of years and my information is that five have been lying idle.  Whatever the reason may be, it is quite clear that the proper steps are not being taken to make them available.  I do not think this is a trivial or a light matter.  I agree with the Minister that it would be better to have the negotiations outside the parliamentary or the executive level.  It is a crime against humanity to have houses lying idle in Dublin, and the crime becomes grievous when CIE will not make its houses available to its employees on transfer from the country.</P>

      <P>The section deals with the development of land by the Board.  This section is the cause of and to the whole CIE setup.  It says that the Board may retain any part of their land.  I have no objection to the Board taking steps to develop any land they own or to the Board acquiring land in the discharge of their proper duties.  The point I am interested in is how Deputies are to know about these things.  They could not be defined as day-to-day administration.  For instance, CIE owns land in Dublin. That land is valuable and CIE might decide to use it for purposes to which people would of necessity object.  In Dún Laoghaire, CIE went into the East Pier.</P>

It might be year-to-year administration and we should have some method of ascertaining in advance what CIE intends doing with it.  What usually happens is that we read in the morning papers about protests by large numbers of citizens in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or some other built-up area where these lands would be very valuable.  This brings us back to the old bone of contention: how are Deputies to know?  Would the Minister again promise us he will be prepared to give us information if we ask him for it, or is this to be another blank cheque to CIE?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on the attitude of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in relation to legislation.  I am willing, and it will be my duty, to give to the House a description of what the general policy of CIE is in relation to land disposition.  There is nothing contentious in it at all.  Under existing legislation, when CIE abandon railway land, they can dispose of it by private treaty to adjoining land owners.  That is purely a private matter between CIE and land owners concerned, and unless there is multiple abuse of a national character, it would be a delegated power to CIE.</P>
      <P>CIE may dispose of land to local authorities, public utility undertakings or any tenant on either side of the line, or by private treaty to the Commissioners of Public Works or the Land Commission.  Any other land they have to dispose of must be put up for public auction.  There are regulations in regard to the abandonment of a railway and the disposal of the land and any effect it may have on the maintenance of drainage or fencing.  I have answered questions on this matter in the Dáil and if Deputies want the information, they can examine the Dáil reports.</P>
      <P>In connection with land in Dublin, Dublin Corporation would be interested, I feel certain, in relation, particularly, to the Planning Act of 1963.  Obviously CIE could not auction land publicly, or would they undertake any private transaction in regard to the sale of valuable extensive lands in Dublin where it would have such a vital bearing on town planning without consulting the planning authority. Deputies can be convinced that under the new or even the old Planning Act, there would be a very definite interest in the user of any such land.</P>

I think the Minister's attitude is most unreasonable.  I put a reasonable request to him: if valuable land belonging to CIE is to be developed&mdash; the proposed development might only come to my ears or to the ears of some other Deputy by accident; the development might be and probably would be perfectly all right&mdash;why should we not be told?  Why should it be kept a secret?</P>

CIE is not a State Department and it is therefore under the control of the 1963 Planning Act.  As far as I am concerned, there is no more to be said about it.</P>

All I am saying to the Minister is&mdash;it is perfectly reasonable &mdash;that, if any Deputy is informed that CIE is about to do some kind of development on land in the centre of the city, and nobody knows what kind the development will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said, it will probably be the right kind of development, but why should we not know? Why should there be such a secret about it?  Would it not be better for the Minister to say in such a case that he is prepared to tell the House what CIE intends to do.  Down through the years, the selling and letting of lands and property held by CIE has always been done by public auction.  Sometimes, of course, CIE uses its powers to put on a squeeze.  I have in mind a man who disposed of a good deal of property for CIE over the years, a man who acted as their estate agent over a big area, settling many of their claims, and settling them well.  In a case where a man claimed £200 for the loss of hay which, he alleged, had been destoyed by sparks from the engine, the claim was settled for £10.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What does arise is the fact that CIE will put on the squeeze where development and the disposing of their lands are concerned. I have just said that a man was <Col N="449" /> engaged in disposing of land for them for years over a large area.  I was the man.  I got the squeeze.  They can keep their agency.  They thought that by taking it from me they could muzzle me.  Is that the proper line for a State body to take?  Maybe the Minister will stand over his Board.  From the day I started objecting here to the action of CIE in relation to certain matters in my constituency, I was cut off.  I heard an official of CIE say at a function&mdash;I did not want to take advantage of it at the time because there were quite a few people around&mdash;&ldquo;Well, of course you said such a thing about the Board and the company.&rdquo; That shows the advantages the Minister's officers can take.  That is the advantage they will have in the development or sale of their lands. They can indulge in Tammany Hall tactics.  They can put on the squeeze on anybody they have in their employment or on anyone they may employ as their agent.</P>
      <P>For the last time, if it becomes known in this city, for instance, or in any built up area in which CIE hold valuable pieces of land, that development is about to take place on that land&mdash;I do not say it would not be the right kind of development&mdash;will it be possible for Deputies to get information from the Minister with regard to that proposed development?  There is the question I am asking the Minister.  Will the Minister answer that question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister has misunderstood the question.  As I understand the query, it is this.  If it comes to the knowledge of the public or of a public representative that development of a parcel of land in the ownership of CIE is contemplated, is this a matter on which a question can be addressed to the Minister for Transport and Power in this House, on the understanding that the information will be forthcoming by way of question and answer?  The Minister may say no, that that is a matter for the Board to which the Deputy should address himself, or the Minister may say yes. But surely it is a legitimate question and one to which we are entitled to expect a categorical answer.  It is a very simple one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I already made quite clear yesterday, in the course of a lengthy debate, the general attitude I hold in regard to the delegation of authority to CIE.  Deputies will be able to read my observations and also two very complete statements I made on previous occasions.  The answer to the Deputy is covered by those statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is covered, is it not the very quintessence of Committee debate that, if there is any ambiguity in any Deputy's mind and he formulates a categorical question in respect of a restricted matter which may have been covered by the wide statement of the Minister and says in regard to this restricted matter that this is a Parliamentary Question being addressed to the Minister, as distinct from the Board, we can look forward to a reply?  The Minister may say: &ldquo;In my statement yesterday and on previous occasions, I made it clear this is not a matter on which the Minister would be prepared to give the information wanted&rdquo;.  Is it not, however, reasonable to ask for that information? Parliamentary debate becomes extremely difficult if the Minister simply says: &ldquo;I have said all I intend <Col N="451" /> to say and I will not answer your question&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister this?  As I know the position, it is freely admitted that CIE is losing money and is likely to continue to do so.  If CIE decides to develop a certain area and I get representations from people in which it is pointed out to me that it is an uneconomical proposition, or I get further representation from people who say the structure they are going to erect will be a public nuisance to the residents in the area, my only function as a parliamentary representative is to come into Dáil Éireann and place those facts before the Minister.  I am citing those as two particular instances in the abstract of what might occur.</P>
      <P>What is my position then?  Am I to put down a question telling the Minister I consider CIE are developing such-and-such an area and I am informed they are creating a public nuisance by so doing, or can I say from what I have been told I consider what they are doing is an uneconomical proposition and that they will lose more money for the State?  I conceive our duty as parliamentary representatives is to see that public money is expended to the best purpose.  Those are two clear-cut cases in which I might come to Dáil Éireann and feel constrained to ask those questions, not only on behalf of my constituents but in the national interest.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister kindly indicate if he would answer those questions or refer me back to the Board?  If I am referred back to the Board and if the Board have taken a decision to do whatever it is, they are not likely to take the slightest notice of me.  That is an accepted fact.  If the Board make up their minds to do something, they will do it.  The only &ldquo;comeback&rdquo; there is for a public representative is to ask a question.  It seems to me to be eminently reasonable that the Minister should accept such a question and answer it.  That would hardly be day-to-day administration, but would seem to be an overall policy decision by the company subject to parliamentary endorsement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a most complicated question to answer.  I have already answered it in great detail. The question of whether questions are to be answered is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle.  It is impossible to answer a hypothetical question of this kind.  In regard to this piece of hypothetical land the Deputy speaks of, the edifice on it might be ugly and undesirable. In that case he should go to the Wexford County Council under the Planning Act, 1963.  In so far as he believes that CIE, by developing a piece of land, is further increasing its losses, if he asks a question and the Ceann Comhairle feels it is quite clearly a matter of day-to-day administration, it would still lie within my responsibility to find out for myself whether such an accusation was true.</P>
      <P>I indicated clearly and at great length how we deal with complaints coming to us, not only from questions that may be ruled out of order as matters of day-to-day administration, but letters that come to the office in regard to CIE and other companies.  If it is an entirely trivial matter, we send a letter to the State company involved and simply ask them to reply directly.  If it is a matter that seems of more importance, we ask the State company for their reply to the question.  We keep files of these letters to see if there is any trend in regard to matters which, individually, might not be of any importance but which, collectively, would be of importance in so far as the proper running of the company was concerned, for example, if we had a great number of complaints about overbooking on Aer Lingus planes over a short period, or if we had a number of complaints of the kind mentioned by the Deputy, where people seem to think that all over the country CIE were planning development of a kind that simply could not be economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to look at this thing pragmatically. It has been looked at pragmatically by successive Governments. It is impossible to make absolute rules. I think I can satisfy the Deputy in this way.  If I felt on the face of it that this looked like something which required <Col N="453" /> investigation, I would certainly investigate.  I think I made a perfectly fair statement anybody in the House could understand.</P>

What I asked him was: if a Deputy were approached and told that CIE was about to develop lands&mdash;I have not said whether this development was a wrong kind of development that could be stopped by the Planning Act of 1963&mdash;have we any right or any way of getting information regarding that land?  Can we come into this House and ask the Minister if it is the intention of CIE to develop the land in such a place or to develop the land behind such a street?  That is not a matter of day-to-day administration. There are sections of land in the centre of this city which are owned by CIE and they should be worth £100,000 or £200,000.  This would be a matter where a decision has to be made by the Board.  CIE might not have any intention of doing anything about the land.  Have we any way of finding out what the Board are about to do?</P>

He could come in next month and we would be ruled out of order if we asked a question and told it is not the Minister's function.  This is a very simple thing.

The Minister has just said if he considers it is not a day-to-day matter, he will answer the question.  If any Deputy asks him a question about whether there will be development on land owned by CIE in Dublin which may be worth £50,000, £60,000, £100,000 or £200,000, will he get an answer?</P>

      <P>The Deputy should know there are all sorts of difficult problems in regard to property disposal. The answer to the question is that some people might make very large profits if they knew that adjoining land in their area was to be developed.  I cannot answer a Parliamentary Question about something like this when arrangements have not been completed.  I could be making a fortune for a lot of people out of their property.  The Deputy would be the first person to say I was acting in an improper manner or making profit for those people.  The Deputy knows all about leases of property.  I would lack all reasonable propriety if I disclosed information before final arrangements had been made.  The Deputy must leave it to my commonsense and the decision of the Ceann Comhairle on questions of this sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister wants to keep secret what this development <Col N="455" /> might be so that nobody in the area would be able to make anything out of their own property. Would it not be better to let people living on land in the area know about it rather than to have some slickers getting information and making a profit out of it?  That is the danger in this.  The property owners around an area which is to be developed should be able to make money out of their own property instead of letting the slickers come in and do so. The Minister should not be allowed to go on in this cloak and dagger fashion. We know all about the ruling of the Chair.  If there is to be a development here in Dublin on CIE land, there is only one way to do it.  If CIE want to purchase another piece of land alongside it, let them do it but it should be possible then, and it would be to the Minister's advantage, for any Deputy to come in here to the House and ask the Minister if there is any intention to develop this land.  The Minister could get up and say that there was going to be development in that area and the people whose property had appreciated by the fact that the development was going to take place would know where they stood.</P>
      <P>The Minister wants to keep us in the dark.  I do not say a leakage would occur through the Minister because I do not think he is that kind of man, but the leakage could occur and some slicker could come in and get the land.  It would be better for the Minister to say here and now if there is any question regarding development by CIE and what the development will be.</P>

The Deputy has raised a very important question.  Under the Town Planning Act when developments on land are to take place, the plans must be deposited with the local authority.  My belief at the moment is that it would be most <Col N="456" /> improper for me to disclose any intention of CIE regarding the development of land.  It would not be proper for me to do so unless I had no confidence in the Board regarding this matter.  As I said, when we come to Report Stage, I shall make references regarding the dispositions of CIE property.  I shall let the Deputies know what would be the right and proper thing on Report Stage regarding this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the purpose of a Committee debate is to review so predominantly important a question. If we had machinery such as an ordinary commercial company has which would provide an annual review by the shareholders or their representatives, at which the directors of a public company can be called on to account for their stewardship, many of these problems about getting information would not arise.  Public representatives would be content to raise these matters at the annual review and to discuss them there.  We do that in respect of every Department of State.  We delegate to the Public Accounts Committee the responsibility of calling on the accounting officer of each Department and we get from him all the information we want.  That Committee have power to send for people and documents and it is noticeable that the Chairman of that Committee is always a member of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>No analogous machinery exists with regard to public companies.  When we reach the stage at which we are being asked to vote a very large sum of money annually for the next five years and find that we are asked to agree to this provision:</P>
      <P>The Board shall have power to develop its land either alone or in conjunction with another person in such a manner as it may think fit,</P>
      <P>it is necessary for the House to insist that this power which it is proposed to give to the Board be controlled by the ordinary parliamentary machinery of question and answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I freely concede that this problem of providing machinery for control of public companies has been considered by previous Fianna Fáil Governments, by the inter-party Governments, probably by the present Fianna Fáil <Col N="458" /> Government, by the British Government and by the Governments of various other countries.  Nobody has found an entirely satisfactory solution to it and this is a dilemma with which we are not alone in wrestling.  I suggest to the Minister that the objectionable and evil words in this section are &ldquo;in such manner as it may think fit&rdquo;.  Those words mean a declaration on behalf of the Oireachtas that we withdraw from Dáil Éireann any power of interrogation in regard to matters that fall within this section.  It would then fall for the Minister to say that this was a matter to be determined by the Ceann Comhairle.  The Ceann Comhairle looks at the terms of the statutes passed by this Oireachtas and he determines in the light of those and in the light of Standing Orders what is relevant and what is irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the words in line 29 &ldquo;in such manner as it may think fit&rdquo; are a virtual declaration by the Oireachtas that this is a matter absolutely in the discretion of the Board and therefore would not be open to parliamentary debate and that out of those words the ruling would come from the Ceann Comhairle that questions arising in relation to matters in section 11 of the Transport Act of 1963 were specifically excluded from the discretion of the Ministers and therefore were not to be the subject of question and reply in Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he will examine the whole matter of answering questions in regard to the development of land.  What I suggest to him is that when he is making that examination, he might consider the appropriateness of deleting from subsection (1) of section 11 the words &ldquo;in such manner as it may think fit&rdquo;.  If he does that it will operate to bring matters relative to the development of the land, either alone or in conjunction with another person, within the ambit of a Parliamentary Question and it would meet the point raised by Deputy Lynch.</P>
    <P>The Minister is mistaken if he does not realise that there is a growing atmosphere of public uneasiness about the difficulty of getting information in regard to public companies.  I think an <Col N="459" /> analogy can be drawn.  I do not think I have ever heard a question addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was responsible for the ESB that was not answered.  The Minister frequently went through the form of saying &ldquo;I have inquired from the ESB and they have given me the following information&rdquo;, but I do not ever remember him saying that this is a matter within the discretion of the ESB and therefore I decline to answer the question.</P>
    <P>I put this question to the Minister: Does he ever recollect answering a question here in regard to the ESB in the same terms as he feels it incumbent upon him to answer a variety of questions in regard to the public transport company?  I suggest to him if he will make a comparison, he will realise how legitimately concerned we are about the apparent reluctance of the Minister to furnish information in regard to the public transport company.</P>
    <P>I believe if the Minister became less sensitive on this score and more communicative to the House, he would very readily find that if Deputies habitually addressed inappropriate questions to him as to why one of the servants of the company was transferred from one station to another, the feeling of the House would quickly correct that. Instead of finding a constant atmosphere of irritation and frustration, he would discover that Deputies, who abused the right to raise matters appropriate to Parliamentary Questions and Answer, and that Deputies who continued to raise matters which are manifestly inappropriate to this form of inquiry, would lose the sympathy of the House and the Minister would find the House would swing to his side and support him in all rational attitudes.  There is no doubt that he has allowed the situation in regard to the affairs of CIE to grow on him which has created a particularly undesirable atmosphere.</P>
    <P>There are many decisions by the Board of CIE with which I disagree. As I have said on a previous occasion, I regard the Chairman of CIE as a man who threw up a relatively easy <Col N="460" /> job to take up a very difficult one, whether I agree or not with him.  I have no doubt he is doing his best according to his own lights.  I have no reason to believe that the Minister and the Board of CIE are not doing their best according to their own lights.  I am fairly certain if the Minister became less sensitive in this matter and took us more into his confidence, he would find the whole problem greatly simplified.  I suggest he might consider taking the first step to that end between now and Report Stage by deleting the words &ldquo;as it may think fit&rdquo;, and thereafter the rulings of the Chair as covered by section 11 would approximate very closely to what all Deputies desire.</P>
    <P>The Minister would find himself under no greater difficulty in answering questions about CIE than he, or his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, have found themselves in answering questions relative to the ESB.  That would be a development which would be eminently desirable and which would greatly expedite the dispatch of public business in this House, if it came about.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that is not so.  I have not consciously altered the pattern of answering questions or the general trend in regard to answering questions since I took over my office in the Department of Transport and Power.  There has been no change and the attitude of the Chair has not changed.  Naturally, more interest is taken now in the affairs of the company over which I have general supervision because supervision is <Col N="461" /> now the responsibility of a separate Department.  Previously it was merged with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I have not changed in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Dillon, I should like to say he has put the whole case in regard to State companies very succinctly and I agree with him there has always been controversy over this.  At this stage, I would simply say that I think he should read what I have already said about this matter.  It would be unnecessary for me to repeat what I have spoken of in great detail.</P>
      <P>In regard to this section, I do not believe the alterations suggested by the Deputy would make any difference. I think the matter of answering questions under this section would be covered by the general provisions of section 16 of the 1950 Act.  As I have already said in regard to this section, I shall say more about it on Report Stage and about the very great difficulty that would attend the giving of information <i>ad interim</i> in regard to the use of property by State companies. I might add there are other companies besides CIE that have power to dispose of land and development.  I shall speak about that on Report Stage because it goes beyond the question of what is a day-to-day matter.  I have already indicated some of the difficulties.</P>

The Minister answered questions in regard to Aer Lingus on 14th April on the price and specification of aircraft and he refused to answer questions in regard to the price and specification of CIE coaches.  You mentioned here, Sir, that you were anxious that the business of the House should proceed.  You have accused Deputies here of repetition.  I feel <Col N="462" /> guilty of repetition.  I had to repeat myself and had to do so continually so that the Minister would get the information and bring it to me on Report Stage.  It is the Minister's fault, Sir.  We are asking the Minister to do reasonable things.  If he would only answer questions and in a simple form instead of going into Acts or referring us to arbitration or conciliation, or referring to the Act of 1963 and if he would say that he would be prepared to answer questions, that would be something.</P>

      <P>There is an amendment in the names of Deputies Casey, Corish and other members of the Labour Party.  What is involved in this connection also arises on amendments Nos. 21, 23 and 24.  A suggestion has been made and I hope it will be agreed that Nos. 17, 21, 23 and 24 be taken together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.17:</P>
      <P>Before section 12 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 35 of the Act of 1950 is hereby amended by the substitution for subsection (2) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(2)  (a) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, entry to the clerical grades of the service of the Board shall be by means of open competitive examinations in accordance with rules made by the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Every open competitive examination held in pursuance of this subsection shall, subject to <Col N="463" /> paragraph (f) of this subsection, be open to all persons who are ordinarily resident in the State or who are Irish citizens or the children of Irish citizens and who pay the fees (if any) and possess the qualifications (if any) as to age, health, character and education prescribed by the rules relating to the examination.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Board may by special rules provide that such proportion as may be approved by the Minister of the vacancies in the clerical grades of its service shall be filled by means of limited competitive examinations, and where an examination is so limited only persons in or who have been in the employment of a dissolved company within the meaning of the Act of 1944, a dissolved undertaker, the Board or any other transport undertaker whose undertaking has been vested in the Board under this Act or any subsequent Act or the children of such persons shall be admitted thereto.</P>
    <P>(d)  An open competitive examination shall consist of the following types of test namely:</P>
    <P>(i)  a written examination;</P>
    <P>(ii)  an oral examination.</P>
    <P>(e)  Irish shall be a compulsory subject at every competitive examination under this subsection.</P>
    <P>(f)  The foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not apply in relation to the entry of staff, for employment in a temporary capacity, to the clerical grades of the service of the Board.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this subsection &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; means employment in the nature of holiday or casual relief.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment the acceptance of which will delete section 12 of the Bill.  It can be described as a section which we are asking the House to accept in substitution for the one proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This section contains what we regard as a highly objectionable and <Col N="464" /> undesirable innovation in a matter of staff recruitment, in as much as it opens the door quite obviously to all kinds of possibilities in regard to the appointment of staff and the handing out of jobs in CIE.  It has long been accepted in this House and in the country generally that the fairest method which can be adopted in recruitment for any position is that of open competitive examination.  It is a method which, while not absolutely perfect, at the same time approximates to fairness in so far as it affords the various applicants, no matter from what area of the country they may come, no matter what their background, regardless of whether or not they are related to anybody, an opportunity to enter the competition and if they have the ability and brains, to secure the vacancies.  That has always been accepted as the proper way to fill positions, particularly clerical positions, in public companies.  Here we have initiated the proposition that this must be changed.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will look at subparagraph (d) of section 12, they will see that it reads as follows:</P>
    <P>A competition shall consist of such one or more of the following types of test as the Board may specify in the rules relating to the competition, namely:</P>
    <P>(i)  a written examination;</P>
    <P>(ii)  an oral examination;</P>
    <P>(iii)  an interview;</P>
    <P>(iv)  any other test or tests that the Board considers to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of consequential qualifications as well, such as that Irish shall be compulsory, and so on.</P>
    <P>I, and those associated with me in the Labour Party whose names are appended to this amendment, wish to bring the attention of the House very forcibly to the fact that here we have for the first time to my knowledge, a provision written into the law to enable a public company to appoint people to clerical positions purely as a result of an interview.  It is stated specifically here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> The purpose of our amendment is to safeguard the existing method, which has been accepted over a long period of time, of filling vacancies by open competitive examination.  The Minister was at pains here yesterday to suggest the awful and dire consequences which might flow if members of this House are enabled to ask questions which might relate to the day-to-day administration of CIE.  It is evident sometimes when he is talking on these matters that he considers that &mdash; in the main, at any rate, and certainly in so far as the Opposition are concerned &mdash; this House consists of venal people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing attention now to the possibilities of venality there are in this proposal by the Minister.  It does not require much imagination for us to think of what can happen when public funds are at the disposal of a Board which has the right to fill well-paid jobs &mdash; as clerical posts are in CIE &mdash; purely as a result of an interview.</P>
      <P>We have seen in other public companies the results of such activities. People find themselves in positions, although they are not fit for them, purely by virtue of their association with a political Party or, it may very well be, by virtue of their blood relationship with a politician or a member of the Board.  These things have happened and do happen and they are a subject of public comment daily throughout this country.</P>
      <P>We know very well that nepotism is rampant in some of these institutions. Here we have a proposal which will open that undesirable avenue much wider than it is at present.  The people expect, when we are disposing of public funds, that Members of the House will do all in their power to ensure that these funds will be employed for the good of the entire community and that if there are positions for the payment of which these funds will be used, then that such positions should be on offer to all the citizens of this country on an open competitive basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the principle that <Col N="466" /> entry into clerical posts in the national transport company was written into the 1924 Railways Act.  Here, we are going back and undoing the work and experience of the past 50 years by including this provision.  It is perhaps the most undesirable aspect of this Bill. We want to know why it is there.  What is its purpose in being there?  Who suggested that it should be there?  Is it the Minister's idea?  It would seem to me to be highly doubtful that it is.</P>
    <P>Where did the suggestion come from that this provision should be put in the Bill and what does it mean?  It means simply&mdash;from what I can read into it &mdash;that CIE wish to be put into the position that they can appoint whomsoever they like without applying any test save that of an interview.  That is something we shall not accept and it is something we shall put to the issue in this House.  We want to label it for what it is.  If it were allowed to slip through, it would be a very serious mistake.  God knows, the Board of CIE are already sufficiently intoxicated with authoritarianism.  If they were to get this as well, as a present, how do we know the manner in which they would employ it and how do we know what the end result would be?  The House should seriously consider the matter and the Minister should eliminate this undesirable provision from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact, the section of this Bill follows in all its essential features the arrangements for competitions by the Civil Service in section 15 of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956.  So, civil servants of this type&mdash;clerical officers&mdash;can already be appointed with one or more of the following tests, namely, a written examination, an oral examination, an interview, a practical examination and any other test or tests considered by the Commissioners to be appropriate. The section provides that where a competition consists of more than one of the types of tests specified in subsection (3)&mdash;which I have already read out&mdash;not more than one of the tests need be competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is plenty of precedent for this within the Civil Service.  No other State <Col N="467" /> body coming within my control has any statutory restrictions in regard to the recruitment of clerical staff.  I might have recommended the complete annulment of the section and it would still place CIE only in line with other State companies.  In fact, we are still maintaining rules and regulations in regard to the competition which are not in any other statute governing State companies under my supervision.</P>
    <P>In the case of Bord na Móna, the clerical staff are appointed on the basis of qualification, on leaving certificate or intermediate certificate and an interview. The same applies to the ESB, Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus.  For the superior scale, the higher grade of clerical officer, leaving certificate with honours is required, and after that there are intelligence and aptitude tests and an interview.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from information.  In fact, CIE are finding it difficult to compete with other State-sponsored bodies in the recruitment of clerical staff of a certain kind.  The reason for the amendment of the law is the use of office machines of all kinds.  In fact, a written examination given to a candidate who already has an educational qualification is not the modern way of assessing aptitude.  It is not done in a great many companies. There are aptitude tests and interviews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you have five or six candidates for the position of clerical officer&mdash; and I might add that it is getting more and more difficult to get them&mdash;they might all have the leaving certificate qualification, and only one might know how to use the machine to which he would be appointed.  He would be the person to be chosen, and there would be an oral interview to see <Col N="468" /> whether he was satisfactory, having got references from his previous employment, or from the priest, the clergyman or the manager of the school.  We are modernising the practice. I will not yield one single inch on this section which puts CIE nearly on a level with other State companies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I said the Civil Service Commissioners Act provides the same type of examination regulations for persons entering as clerical officers as are now provided in this section.  I think it is reasonable.  I do not think it can be said there is any sinister objective on the part of CIE if they virtually copy a section of the Civil Service Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not anything sinister in the Labour Party amendment. What the Minister has said is a reflection on our system of education. In the main, the amendment proposes that there should be a written and an oral examination.  It is all very well to talk about the practice in other semi-State and State bodies.  It is all very well to talk about what happens in the Civil Service.  The Minister must remember&mdash;and this has been running through the debate since it started yesterday afternoon&mdash;that while the Dáil does not appear to have any worthwhile control over the policies pursued by CIE, the Dáil has control over the activities of civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment, Deputy Dunne is trying to ensure that there will be equal opportunity for every boy and girl when they come to the age at which they might qualify for a job as clerical officers in CIE, or any State institution.  The Minister talked about the difficulty of recruiting staff able to operate the complicated computing machines.  There is nothing in this amendment which would hinder the Board of CIE in recruiting whatever staff they want.  Surely it is not unreasonable to expect CIE to recruit staff, and clerical staff in particular, by <Col N="469" /> way of written examination?  Are we to discard the importance in which the intermediate certificate and the leaving certificate are held?  Surely they must be of some significance.  They are the certificates which every boy and girl seek to obtain.  They are the badge of a certain standard of education, academic at least.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne did not suggest that the person who came first in the written examination should get the first appointment.  This amendment also includes an oral examination.  If the Minister wants to ensure that people are competent in the use of the machines to which he referred, that could be discovered by way of oral examination.  It is not appropriate to make vague or wild allegations of favouritism or influence in obtaining posts with CIE, the ESB, Telefís Éireann, or any State or semi-State body, but so long as there is a suspicion in the minds of the public that influence will get one a job in any State company, I do not think the Minister is doing himself justice, or is being fair to the country.  Boys, girls and their parents should know that merit, and merit alone, will get a job. For that reason the amendment suggests that there should be a written examination, and those who qualify can be interviewed on their aptitude and ability.  Let that be tested by oral examination.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister suggested the Civil Service had power to appoint staff without written examination.  I do not know whether that is a regulation, but everyone knows there is an open competitive examination for posts as clerical officers and junior executives. It is also true that there is an interview and an oral Irish examination.  To suggest, as the Minister has suggested that CIE, which is subsidised by the taxpayer, should employ any method it wants to recruit staff is something we cannot swallow.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of section 12 provides that:</P>
    <P>A competition shall consist of such one or more of the following types of test as the Board may specify in the rules relating to the competition, namely: <Col N="470" /> (i)  a written examination;</P>
    <P>(ii)  an oral examination;</P>
    <P>(iii)  an interview;</P>
    <P>(iv)  any other test or tests that the Board considers to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (iv) is the worst: &ldquo;Any other test or tests that the Board considers to be appropriate.&rdquo;  That could mean anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one very obvious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We could think of many examples of what it could mean. By accepting this amendment, the Minister should indicate to the country that so far as State and semi-State bodies are concerned, everything is open and above board in the recruitment of staff, and that merit and merit alone gets the job.  I do not suggest that there are unscrupulous members on the Board at present, but if there were such an unscrupulous member, he could use paragraph (d) (iv) to do whatever he liked.</P>
      <P>Children now studying for the intermediate and leaving certificate honestly believe that to get positions in these semi-State bodies it is necessary for them to qualify by way of written examination, accepting, of course, that it will be necessary for them to attend an interview and to pass an oral Irish test.  What ambition can they have to a post as clerical officer in any semi-State body if they do not know what recruitment method will be employed&mdash;if they do not know whether it will be by way of interview or whether they will be subjected to a test to determine what political Party or sporting organisation they belong to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been abuses in the past and the Minister knows of the criticism levelled at the method of recruitment to a recently established State body, Telefís Éireann.  I hope we are not to have the repetition of that.  I trust the Minister will insist that as far as the CIE Board are concerned, the only qualification will be a demonstration of a certain standard of education by passing a written examination.  It is <Col N="471" /> too thick to propose to give to CIE the right to conduct any kind of examination or interview they like, which is what this subsection proposes.</P>

On one occasion years ago, a member of this Party wrote a letter in respect of a person applying for a post in Aer Lingus and that person was disqualified. When a condition like that in respect of canvassing is inserted in the conditions of application for appointment, it is not put in for fun.  I do not see any danger in the system the Minister proposes to adopt.  It is no different from the system in operation.</P>

      <P>We shall now deal with the amendments before the House.  We were getting along fine before the interruption.  The Deputy might have referred to the fact that CIE advertisements bear the caption that canvassing will disqualify.  I am aware of a State company in respect of which canvassing was also supposed to disqualify. The minimum qualification for one appointment to that company was an honours degree in economics.  Several first-class honours graduates in economics applied for the post, but the person who got the post was a person who had a pass degree, second attempt, appeal, in philosophy.  I am sure there was no connection with the fact that he was particularly friendly with a brother of one of the men in the company concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This thing of writing in &ldquo;canvassing will disqualify&rdquo; will not serve very much purpose when you have the Fianna Fáil Mafia at work, who can bedevil all rules and regulations as far as applications for posts are concerned. There is a considerable difference between the Civil Service, over which this House has control, and a State body over which the House has <Col N="473" /> absolutely no control.  The system of interview may be all right for posts at a certain administrative level, but for the ordinary clerical classes, the pen-pushers, it is ridiculous to think their suitability for the position can be adequately determined by interview or &ldquo;any other test the Board considers to be appropriate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it not strange that we have had to wait until 1964 before deciding to change the system?  We cannot accept this is being done for the good of CIE. I do not think there is anything wrong with the present staff of CIE, or are we to be told the Board have not confidence in the existing staff?  If not, what is wrong with the present system of staff recruitment?</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is mistaken if he thinks there is nothing more to be said.  Surely it is a revolutionary proposal that we should claim that appointments to the staff of CIE should be made subject to a certain procedure which, it is suggested, provides that merit alone will be the criterion and then to provide that the competition shall consist of any other test, or tests, that the Board considers to be appropriate.  What is the point of providing subparagraph (d) of subsection (2) of section 12 if you offer the alternative of a written examination, an oral examination, an interview, or any other test, or tests, that the Board considers to be appropriate. If we leave the whole thing out altogether, what difference does it make?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he presumes it will apply to a typing speed test.  Surely what the Minister wishes to provide for is much wider than that.  If the Minister wants to have &ldquo;or such test of technical skills as may be appropriate to the vacancy,&rdquo; I could very much more readily understand that, but he does not himself see that subparagraph (4) in fact operates to negative all the other controls which the other paragraphs purport to introduce.  What is the use of saying that appointments are to be subject to written examination, or oral examination, or interview, if you go on to say &ldquo;or any other test the Board considers to be appropriate&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that the Board will do the incredible but the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> is useful for illustrating the potentialities of a section of this kind.  According to subsection (4), the Board could lay down a test that you must have red hair. Manifestly none of us means that but we do not think the Board ought to have the power to provide some utterly irrelevant test of that kind, and the moment we realise that the words we are using would give authority to such attempts, surely the case is copper-fastened either for deleting the words or radically changing them.  If the Minister has in mind that there are certain skills which cannot be tested by a written examination, which cannot be tested by an oral examination, which cannot be tested by an interview, then let him say &ldquo;or in respect of certain technical skills by an examination appropriate to determine the candidate's degree of proficiency&rdquo;, or some phrase of that kind.  I suggest to the Minister that, if he were to take out (3) and (4), and leave the provision that all appointments should be by written examination, or by oral examination, he would thereby provide all that it is appropriate to provide in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> There is in the Civil Service code, I think, a provision which provides that, subject to certain settled procedure, if a Department of State wishes to recruit a particular person with a particular skill, the Minister for Finance can make a specific order exempting that person from the usual procedure for entry into the Civil Service and he is recruited, for all the world to know, as a special entrant.  If any abuse exists, then the matter can be raised in the House here.  It is quite true that, in operating a large enterprise such as Córas Iompair Éireann, the situation might arise in which, if somebody had a specific skill that the Board felt would be of great value to the company and that the person was not the kind of person who could do either a written or an oral examination. Is there any reason why we should not follow the existing rule and provide that in such circumstances the Board should adopt a special procedure and declare that they propose to appoint this person outside of the ordinary machinery for the recruitment of staff?</P>
    <P>I see no difficulty in that, but the section as it stands will create a widespread feeling that there is no real equality in appointment to the staff of CIE.  The Minister would be wise to recall to his mind that Deputies represent a fair cross-section of the people and he ought to see that these things create misgivings and that in association with a matter of this kind misgivings of that character are highly undesirable.  I admit we are again in the dilemma that we are dealing with a State company.  If one is dealing with a commercial company, which is the property of the shareholders, one can afford to use a very much wider discretion.  If jobbery or improper conduct arises in connection with appointments, the annual general meeting of the company can sack the directors.  In any case, the matter can be raised and publicised.</P>
    <P>Here we are dealing with a semi-State company, subject to no such review but, as we are all fully aware, subject to considerable political pressure and I think it very important therefore, that we should fortify the <Col N="476" /> board of a State company by putting it in the position that political pressure cannot operate because they are required by law to have a written examination or an oral examination and it is in accordance with the place obtained in that examination that appointment or rejection depends.</P>
    <P>Mark you, I think we have got to face the fact that examinations are not always the best way of getting the best staff.  However, we are not living in a perfect world.  We are living in a very imperfect world and what we have to try to do in regard to State companies and the Public Service is to avoid to the utmost of our capacity any suggestion of a corrupt preference being shown to an individual.  That is the justification for the competitive examination system.</P>
    <P>In regard to the grades of staff for which this procedure is envisaged, by and large, a written or oral examination will probably produce a vast majority of candidates competent to discharge the duties of the office to which the examination will entitle them.  We all know, however, that you come across oddities in life, with a genius for passing examinations but no good at all in the day-to-day work of an office.  I think it is much better to bear with the possibility of an examination throwing up occasionally such an oddity than to leave ourselves open to a procedure which is calculated to create the impression in the public mind that all is not open and aboveboard. Does the Minister himself seriously believe that, if the Board of CIE are entitled to appoint people to the relatively low grades contemplated in this section by means of any other test or tests the Board considers appropriate, that will reassure the public mind that nothing but merit will count in an application for employment by the Board of CIE?</P>
    <P>I suggest he must himself see, after the relatively short debate that has taken place here in regard to this subsection, that it is quite manifest it does not provide reassurance for the average kind of person and that the last two paragraphs, referring to an interview and any other test or tests the Board <Col N="477" /> considers appropriate, are wholly unacceptable to a great many Deputies.  What problem will it create if the Minister drops it and provides that these appointments are to be on foot of a written and oral examination?  I cannot see any difficulty at all.  If the <Col N="478" /> Minister does see a difficulty in relation to a typewriting test or something of that kind, I am proposing a third alternative which shall be confined to persons whose technical skill in some particular job the Board are concerned to test.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 46, to delete &ldquo;Board&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These two amendments are an effort to bring this matter back into the control of the House.  Subsection (2) (a) of section 12 says:</P>
      <P>... entry to the clerical grades of the service of the Board shall be by means of open competitions in accordance with rules made by the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> Paragraph (c) of this subsection states:</P>
    <P>The Board may by special rules provide that such proportion as may be approved by the Minister of the vacancies in the clerical grades of its service shall be filled by means of limited competitions.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of the subsection sets out tests which the Board may specify.  We object to the possibility of tests by any other means than by interview, written or oral examination. We want to bring this back under the control of the House, where the Minister has to make the rules.  That is the purpose of these amendments.  The Minister may make certain rules and if complaints are made, they can be questioned in the House.  If the Board makes the rules and if this legislation passes, then we will be back again to the old situation where the Minister can say he has no function and that the Board have made various rules and exceptions. I want to bring the matter back to the control of the House.</P>

The legislation in connection with CIE is being amended in the form I provided for in this Bill.  In fact, as I have already indicated, CIE have followed the lines of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956.

We would not have to spend half or quarter of the time here on this but for the Minister's evasion.</P>
      <P>I would ask him again to accept this amendment.  He mentioned invisible walls this morning.  There is a wall between this House and Kingsbridge and it is greater than the Berlin Wall as far as this House is concerned. It is only through subterfuge or by trying to cut our way through the barbed wire or climbing over the wall that we are able to find out anything about Kingsbridge.  I think the Minister should meet us on this.  It would give him an opportunity of getting up here and saying that he has changed his mind.  Would it not be much better for him to be in the position of getting important information from CIE?</P>

      <P>Deputies who have reached a certain age will remember a controversy started many years ago by the late Mr. Moran who was editor and founder of a paper called <i>The Leader.</i> He waged a vigorous campaign with regard to clerical appointments, first in relation to certain banks and, secondly, in relation to clerkships in the Great Northern Railway.  He was eventually successful in this campaign and got tremendous public support in it.  There were, in the first place, certain banks which had limited examination and appointments were made by interview which meant personal pull.  As a result of this campaign, there was substituted in certain banks, and particularly in the Great Northern Railway, a system of competitive examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> That was open to suspicion and the then editor of <i>The Leader</i> condemned the type of subterfuge examination that was held in order to comply with what had been forced on these people by public opinion.  His line was that he did not want entry to certain banks or to the Great Northern Railway to be such that these bodies would become Freemason associations.  He wanted to have entry to these institutions open to the natives of the country who were not willing to join certain secret societies and he wanted these people to have a right to compete for entry to these organisations.  He won on that.</P>
    <P>Are we back now to the point where we are to have the clerical services of CIE under suspicion of being a Fianna Fáil club?  It is only a change of what is the nominating body.  The Minister says he has every confidence in the Board.  That may be, but what is wrong with having the Board brought under examination from time to time and having their activities justified? The Board are going to make rules and make exceptions to these rules and the proposition is that the Board could amend every part of this legislation including paragraph (h).</P>
    <P>The Minister takes the analogy of the Civil Service Commissioners but that is an entirely different matter. They operate in regard to the recruitment of the Civil Service and there are several alert and energetic associations who keep a watchful eye on the occasions on which there are limited competitions.  If the Minister looks at the Civil Service Commissioners Act, he will find that there are two types of occupation which are exempt or scheduled occupations, and are free from competitive examination.  These are very limited and only last for very brief periods.  If any person gets in under the exempt or scheduled occupations, gets in by the back door, so to speak, and wants to go higher into a permanent post, then he has to stand something in the way of a competitive examination.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commissioners may decide on certain types of competition and it is their choice to decide whether there will be one or more of these <Col N="482" /> tests and what they will be.  The Civil Service Commission is an entirely different matter and the Civil Service is a very important body in the State. They may have many associations and, I know as a lawyer, these associations are very alert in challenging things the Commission may do.  They have operated from time to time against some of the things which the Civil Service Commission have tried to do.</P>
    <P>We are now accepting that CIE is no longer an economic or business concern.  It comes now within the definition of the social welfare classes and it is most important to see that whenever there may be an exclusion of certain people from clerical posts, that matter should be open to discussion in this House.  We do not want to be faced with the Minister saying that the Board has done this or that, that it is a matter for the Board and that he will not discuss that matter in the House.  It is that arrogant and dictatorship type of mind that we object to and which is evident in this measure.</P>

      <P>I find it hard to think that this is an error made by the printers.  In the Acts of 1944 and 1950, we find the phrase &ldquo;national territory&rdquo; is used.  Section 35 of the 1950 Act says:</P>
      <P>Every open competitive examination shall be open to all persons who are ordinarily resident within the national territory.</P>
      <P>In the 1944 Act, we find again:</P>
      <P>Every open competitive examination held in pursuance of this section shall be open to all persons who are ordinarily resident within the national territory.</P>
      <P>Quite clearly the Minister took a deliberate step in altering &ldquo;national territory&rdquo; to &ldquo;the State&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We have a situation now where Ministers are running away from their responsibilities.  The Minister does not accept responsibility for mistakes of his Department.  He cannot have it both ways.  It seems strange when the sections are so similar in the 1944 and 1950 Acts, where the words &ldquo;national territory&rdquo; are used.  Somebody made not a mistake but a deliberate act to change that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá a fhios agam nach inné ná inniu a cuireadh an dúngaois seo&mdash;an teanga do shábháil&mdash;ós comhair ná ndaoine.  Tá sé á leanúint againn sna scoileanna le breis agus 40 bliain anuas&mdash;na bunscoileanna, na ceard-scoileanna, na meánscoileanna agus na h-iolscoileanna.  Is fíor a rá, mar sin, go bhfuil an teanga, a bheag nó a mhór, ag gach duine a fhreastal ar na scoileanna sin i rith an ama sin.  Ní dóigh liom gur mí-réasúnta é coinníoll do leagadh síos ag éileamh go mbeadh an Ghaeilge éigeantach i gcás daoine a théann faoi scrúdú chun post d'fháil sa Státseirbhís, sna gardaí, nó in aon phost eile faoin Stáit.  Sin mar is cóir don scéal a bheith.  Más fiú post do thabhairt do dhaoine atá faoi bhun 40 bliain d'aois is cóir go mbeadh orthu úsáid do bhaint as teanga na tíre agus is gá coinníoll den tsaghas sin do chur isteach sna rialacha le h-aghaidh na scrúdú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do bhí an Teachta Ó Riain ag caim <Col N="487" /> i dtaobh an Aire agus ag iarraidh a chur ina luí ar an dTeach nach raibh an Ghaeilge aige.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine sa tír seo nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu.  Nílim chomh simplí agus a cheapadh go bhfuil an Ghaeilge go líofa ag gach duine atá ós cionn 40 bliain d'aois.  Ní raibh deis acu an Ghaeilge d'fhoghlaim mar ní raibh an teanga dhá múineadh sna scoileanna. Rud eile, bhí a lán acu ag troid ar son na tíre agus ní raibh an t-am acu aon staidéar a dhéanamh ar an dteanga.  Do bhí orthu na Gaill do ruagadh as an dtír agus Rialtas dár gcuid féin do chur ar bun.  Ní dóigh liom gur deas an rud é an Ghaeilge do dhéanamh éigeantach i gcás duine ar bith meánaosta, ach tá a fhios againn nach bhfuil leithscéal ag na daoine óga.</P>
    <P>Sé tá sa leasú seo ná iarracht ag Fine Gael chun cúis na Gaeilge do lagú.  Ní maith liom sin.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil roint daoine ar bhinsí Fhine Gael atá go dúthrachtach agus go díoghraiseach mar gheall ar chúis na Gaeilge ach, faraoir, le roint bliain anuas tá daoine ina measc nach raibh riamh ar thaobh na Gaeilge nó ar thaobh an náisiúin.  Tá siad ag iarraidh a dtuairimí féin do chur i bhfeidhm sa Dáil.  Im thuairimse agus i dtuairim mórán daoine eile tá Fine Gael ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge do chur ar cheal in gach scrúdú agus ag iarraidh a rá leis na daoine go mbeadh saol níos fearr acu.  Do chuir siad an dúngaois sin ós comhair an phobail nuair a bhí toghacháin ann agus fuair siad freagra dearfa, géar ó mhuintir na hÉireann. Bí cinnte, nuair a chuireann siad dúngaois den tsaghas sin ós comhair mhuintir na hÉireann arís, go scriosfar Fine Gael ar fad as saol polaitiúil na hÉireann agus, má déantar sin, ní bheidh brón ar bhunáite na ndaoine ach oiread.</P>
    <P>Sílim féin go bhfuil leasú seo an Teachta Ó Riain suarach agus mímhacánta. Molaim gan glacadh leis. Tuigim fá a mholta.  Dá nglacfadh an tAire leis an leasú ní dhéanfadh sé aon mhaitheas do chúis na teangan, don tír ná don náisiún.  Nuair a bhéas tairiscint ós comhair na Dála chun <Col N="488" /> Gaeilge éigeantach do ghlanadh amach ar fad as gach scrúdú sa tír seo agus nuair a éiríonn leis an dTeachta Ó Riain é sin a dhéanamh, ní bheidh a thuilleadh náisiúntachta againn.</P>

      <P>I simply wish to state that notwithstanding the remarks of some of the Deputies opposite, there is no antagonism to the Irish language in this Party.  Some of us may not be as fluent at the language as Deputy Ó Briain apparently is, and proud of it, and more power to him. However, I do not think it is right for a Deputy who is fluent in the Irish language in any way to jeer or jibe at members of the House who are not.  We believe that is the kind of thing that <Col N="491" /> is killing the Irish langhage, that it is that kind of compulsion which the Minister is incorporating into this subsection which has done no good whatever during the years to the cause of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>We in the Fine Gael Party have spoken more than once on the Irish language and have said that this kind of compulsion, ramming it down people's throats and making it obligatory for securing a job in a State company, is the kind of policy that does harm to the Irish language.  This measure should be dealt with as a Transport Bill.  I do not know what possessed the Minister to incorporate this type of section into it.  It has nothing whatever to do with the functioning of the transport system of the country.  It is an inflammatory subsection to those who wish to see some progress made as far as the language is concerned.  We want to see progress made, we want to see people take the same pride in the language as does Deputy Ó Briain.  We want to see people take pride and joy in learning the language and we do not believe the attitude of the Minister and the Government, as evidenced in this subsection, will achieve those results. What has the Irish language to do with the proper and efficient running of a transport system?</P>

      <P>Tá mé sásta. Bhí mé ag foghluim Gaeilge le blianta.  I suppose Deputy Ó Briain is right.  I can talk Irish but I cannot think in Irish.  I believe a great deal of fraud is carried on by Deputies in this House who stand up and pretend they can speak as fluently and comprehensively in Irish as they can in English.  I will not speak in public in a language in which I cannot think. I make no secret of that.  I was learning Irish 40 years ago when there was no money in Irish.  I was learning Irish at a time when there were no rewards for Irish.  I was learning Irish at a time when it qualified you <Col N="493" /> for no preferment, no job or advantage of any kind.  Those learning Irish with me at that time learned it because they loved the language, and those who learned it at that time have kept the language.  I put it to any rational Deputy: how many people of succeeding generations who learned the language in order to qualify for a job have kept it, or use it?  How many people do we know in our own personal acquaintance who studied a bit of Irish in order to get a job and have never spoken a word of Irish since, do not want to speak it, and look back on it as an ordeal through which they had to pass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the simple case that if you tell young people that in order to earn their living in their own country, they must stew up sufficient Irish to scrape through an examination, you are certainly not helping the transport company. You may believe you are helping the cause of the language revival. If you believe that, I want to urge that far from helping the language revival, you are associating in the minds of young people the learning of the language with an ordeal through which they have to pass in order to get a chance to earn their living in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to rational people that those who compete for vacancies in the clerical grade of CIE are not ordinarily people in very affluent circumstances. Their families have made certain sacrifices to keep them in school to get the degree of secondary education which they can afford. When those young people are put forward for qualifying examinations for a job in the technical grade in CIE, the parents know that their child will <Col N="494" /> do well in mathematics and a variety of subjects, but simply is not linguistically gifted.  The child has never known an aptitude for mastering a second language.  The parent knows that children are going in for that examination who have not a tithe of the general ability of their child, but who have got a certain facility for picking up a smattering of the language.  They see their child, who they are honestly convinced has superior qualifications for the employment he seeks, rejected, not on merit, but on a linguistic deficiency from which he suffers, and everyone knows that that linguistic deficiency will never interfere with the due performance of the job he will be called upon to do.  I have had experience of this.  I want to tell the House of my experience of the proviso that Irish should be a compulsory subject to qualify for a job.  When I was Minister for Agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom an scéal a insint arís.  Creidim go bhfuil cead agam é sin a dhéanamh.  When I was Minister for Agriculture, part of my responsibility was to appoint professors to the Veterinary College.  I knew perfectly well that when I appointed professors to the Veterinary College, I was making provision for veterinary education perhaps for three decades ahead.  Accordingly, the appropriate advertisements were published and the qualifications were set out.  The rules of the Civil Service required that one qualification should be a queer form of words&mdash;I think it was an adequate knowledge of Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a competent knowledge of Irish.  Several candidates presented themselves, and finally it transpired that a young research graduate of very considerable distinction had far outstripped any other candidate who presented himself.  When the list was presented to me, showing this young man quite outstanding in the technical qualifications for the professional <Col N="495" /> duties he would be called on to discharge, I said: &ldquo;This is quite simple. We appoint him.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you cannot appoint him.&rdquo; I asked: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&ldquo;Because now the next step is that they must present themselves for an examination to establish that they have a competent knowledge of Irish and in that examination they will receive marks which will have to be added to the marks their technical examination has already given them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I said: &ldquo;If that is the regulation, that is the regulation, and let it be carried out&rdquo;.  The list came back to me after a short time.  The research graduate was now in second place and the first place was now a young chap who had just graduated from our own college but who happened to come from a county where, if he was not a native speaker, he was the next best thing to it.  He was an excellent young man but no more competent to discharge the technical duties of the post than I myself, so I said I could not appoint him: &ldquo;It is quite manifest we are not appointing the best man and this man will be a professor passing through his hands all the veterinary students of this country for the next 30 or 40 years.&rdquo; I was told I had to appoint him.  I said: &ldquo;There is no power in this country that can command my hand and my obligation is to appoint the most efficient man we can find to lecture the students in the Veterinary College, and I will not appoint anybody else.&rdquo;  And I never did.  I went out of office before that matter was finally resolved and I think the ultimate resolution was that another examination was held. Was I right or was I wrong?</P>

I ask Deputies what service does that do to the language revival?  Would it not be infinitely preferable to provide that any candidate for employment, who is in a position to qualify in either language shall be entitled to get his livelihood in his own country?  I have before me, or I had up to a moment ago, five men whose livelihoods are largely teaching young children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In each of these examinations, Irish is required so it does not involve any great difficulty for these people to enter CIE, since that is the qualification.

I think we have all experience of the working of Córas <Col N="499" /> Iompair Éireann and I wonder how often are the clerical grades in that company required to speak in Irish. How often does the situation arise in which they cannot efficiently discharge the duties of their office without an exhaustive knowledge&mdash;a competitive knowledge&mdash;of Irish?  It is manifestly a test strictly related to an illusory principle for the revival of the Irish language.  If it made a very material substantial contribution to the restoration of the language in the country as a living language, it could be argued on its merits.  The whole basis of our contention is that to turn it into an instrument of victimisation in this way does a very great disservice to the language movement.</P>

      <P>There seem to be few more emotive subjects than language in this and many other countries, and it is with positive trepidation that I intervene in this discussion at all.  I think the time has come when people who have not taken an active part in the revival movement over the years but have simply learned the language because they felt they should&mdash;people who have a love of the language for historic reasons&mdash;should try to introduce some measure of reasonableness into the national debate being intensified at the moment and which will eventually come to fruition in the course of time.</P>
      <P>I have always abhorred the idea of compulsion.  I believe the whole history of our country must breed into our personalities a resistance to the idea of compulsion.  It is true if we go back in our history we find we were made to speak the English language and that an attempt was made to impose on us a religious view we did not particularly want.  The odd thing is that one succeeded and the other failed.</P>
      <P>An attempt is being made by half-truths to suggest there is not compulsion, but economic compulsion is used by many people who want to see Irish spoken much more widely than it is spoken at present.  I personally dislike the idea of being compelled to do anything. Any free individual living in a free society has exactly the same instincts.</P>

      <P>The Unemployment Assistance (Employment Period) Order 1964 covers a period of 34 weeks from 11 March to 3 November, 1964.  The corresponding order covered 32 weeks in the years 1954 to 1957 inclusive and 34 weeks in the years 1958 to 1963 inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the order in question is to exclude from the receipt of unemployment assistance occupiers of land exceeding £4 rateable valuation <Col N="503" /> who reside outside a county or other borough, urban district or other incorporated town.</P>
    <P>The number of applicants &ldquo;with means&rdquo; for unemployment assistance fell by 2,802 between 7 and 14 March, 1964 and by a further 1,101 between the later date and 6 June, 1964 the latest date for which data are available. The Employment Period Order in question was clearly the dominant factor in the first mentioned decrease, but this fall did not involve a corresponding decrease in the total Live Register at that period, since between 7 and 14 March, 1964 the number of &ldquo;applicants for credits&rdquo; on the Register rose by 2,219 and these include a number of persons who were excluded from receipt of unemployment assistance in virtue of the order. Between 14 March and 6 June, 1964 the number of &ldquo;applicants for credits&rdquo; fell by 1,369.  It is not possible to determine precisely what proportion of these changes are ascribable to the operation of the order in question since over the interval many other factors were in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The increase in the price of many commodities that followed the ninth round of wage increases has tended to level off.  The increase in the Consumer Price Index of 6.53 points between mid-February and mid-May, 1964 represented an overall increase of less than 4 per cent on the commodities taken into account.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question by Deputy Corish on 2nd June, 1964 Vol. 210 No. 3 Columns 302 to 305 of the Dáil Debates when I stated that I believe that tree competition provides the most effective means of controlling prices.</P>
      <P>Where I have considered it necessary and practicable, I have used the powers given to me by the Prices Act, 1958. This Act does not empower me to freeze prices as suggested by the Deputy and I do not think that such power is necessary or practicable except possibly in times of scarcity that would require rationing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say this, that the upward movement of some prices which took place after the 12 per cent increase in wages appears now to have <Col N="508" /> levelled off and it appears reasonable to expect that as a result there should not be any significant further upward movement in prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

On the contrary, it is hoped that modernisation and adaptation will help to maintain existing employment, and possibly to increase employment in a number of industries.</P>
      <P>If what the Deputy has in mind is the progress made in regard to the inter-Departmental Committee on retraining and resettlement and the Committee set up by the CIO to consider the question of redundancy arising from conditions of freer trade, the position is that I have received the CIO report only recently and the report of the inter-Departmental Committee is still under consideration.</P>

It has not been the function of the Post Office to provide public telephone kiosks for emergency purposes.

      <P>Amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputies Ryan and Clinton is related to amendment No. 2.  The two amendments may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 11, after &ldquo;dump&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;canal, cliff,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 1 we are dealing with the definition of dangerous places and these amendments are designed to ensure that as many hazards as the public may face are named in this measure.  In this connection, after the word &ldquo;dump&rdquo; we insert the words &ldquo;canal, cliff,&rdquo;.  Equally so, we have river, dock, pier, quay, landing slip or wharf.  Loss of life owing to the existence of dangers or traps of this nature ought to be the responsibility of someone.  If this is the only legislation which will deal with this matter, <Col N="520" /> then someone should be given the duty of protecting members of the public from death.  In view of the fact that provision is made in subsection (5) of section 2 to recoup the local authority for expenditure, I suggest that the Oireachtas ought not be deterred by any fear of rising rates in this connection in making the measure as comprehensive as possible.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree it is necessary that there should not be any loopholes left in regard to the number of hazards which the public face.  Experience has been that over the years we have had quite a number of tragic occurrences in places which are not mentioned in this definition. We had, within the past year or two, a very tragic occurrence in Cork when the entire occupants of a car were drowned.  In other cases, there were very lucky escapes when cars went into canals or rivers at dangerous unprotected points.  We want to ensure that there will be an obligation on some specific body to deal with this matter and we also want to define the hazards in so far as we may be able to foresee them.  For that reason, I urge the Minister to accept this amendment in regard to the definition of &ldquo;dangerous place.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We feel that the words used may not be sufficient to cover places such as cliffs adjoining the sea. In Dublin, the canal is frequently held to be nobody's baby.  There are plenty of opportunities for legal wrangling as to whether or not Dublin Corporation have responsibility.  Rather than permit that situation to continue, as well as serious loss of life and so on, we feel it is better to insert these words. If the Minister accepts the amendment, it will make clear beyond doubt that local authorities are empowered to look after such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words in amendment No. 2&mdash; canal, river, dock, pier, quay, landing slip or wharf&mdash;are necessary.  A question may arise as to whose responsibility these places may be.  I am surprised that &ldquo;river&rdquo; did not appear in the draft Bill.  Why has the Minister confined it to &ldquo;stream&rdquo;?  There is a <Col N="521" /> very significant difference between a stream and a river from the point of view of the application of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  It should be made clear beyond all doubt that a local authority such as Dublin Corporation are empowered to place necessary safeguards to prevent accidents of the kind which have occurred recently.  Take, as an example, the provision of a telephone kiosk at Howth at a spot where unfortunately there have been two fatal accidents in recent years.  I raised a question at a meeting of the Streets and Town Planning Committee of the Corporation. Inspection is to take place soon.  I consider that it would help the Corporation if this amendment were incorporated in the Bill so that the onus is on the local authority to provide all the necessary safeguards in such places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the spirit of these two amendments I am in full agreement.  However, I am fully assured that what is sought by the amendments is covered by the provisions of the Bill and that the inclusion of these further matters, by name and designation, will not in any way add to the strength and the power of the proposed legislation.  I am assured that so far as canals, docks, and so on, are concerned, we would merely raise unnecessary conflict by suggesting, for instance, that the whole length of a canal throughout the country should be treated as a dangerous place and that the entire docks of any city or port should likewise be treated, whereas only certain specific dangerous parts should be looked after.  For that, we have sufficient and adequate power in the Bill.  If I thought for one moment that that is not so, Deputies would not have to put down this amendment.  Therefore, I am with the Deputies in the spirit that motivated the amendments.</P>
      <P>My advice is that we have the power to do the things that those who sponsor and support the amendment wish to do; that the amendment would not be of any assistance; and that, in fact, its insertion might weaken rather than strengthen the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to <Col N="522" /> the Minister's interpretation in this matter, it seems extraordinary that &ldquo;dangerous place&rdquo; in the definition section means an excavation, quarry, pit, well, reservoir, pond, stream, dam, bank, dump, shaft or land that, in the opinion of the sanitary authority in whose sanitary district it is situate, is or is likely to be dangerous to any person.  Why was the definition not continued to include a most dangerous situation which has arisen over the years in regard to built-up areas?  It seems extraordinary to take the very odd ones where accidents do not happen so readily and to exclude the ones which have caused the major loss of life.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the Minister's statement that he thinks there is sufficient cover in the Bill for the points we have raised.  I want to suggest very seriously that it does not seem to make sense to name a number of the lesser hazards and to exclude the major ones which, in our opinion, have caused the greatest loss of life.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to accept the amendment.  There may be other hazards, I agree, but you have, then, the global definition &ldquo;is or is likely to be dangerous to any person&rdquo;.  Surely the hazards mentioned in the amendment are not alone likely to be dangerous but have positively been proved to be dangerous to life and particularly to the life of young persons. We ought to ensure at this stage of the measure that anything we can do will be done.  I could accept the Minister's assurance if the definition section did not mention a number of lesser hazards.  The Bill mentions a number of hazards but has not named the major ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself compelled to support Deputy Jones again in this matter.  Under the ordinary rules of interpretation, it may be said that the Oireachtas having given in considerable detail the type of place it considered to be dangerous, had excluded other places, and the other places which might be ruled out under the ordinary rules of interpretation might include a canal, a cliff, a river, a dock, a pier, a quay, a landing slip or a <Col N="523" /> wharf.  It could be argued that because they were not specifically mentioned, it was not the intention to include them.</P>
      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;stream&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;river&rdquo; would appear to suggest that it was not intended to apply this section to a waterway of larger dimensions than a stream.  It strikes me now that a further word which should be included is &ldquo;lake&rdquo;.  It may be said that because a reservoir is a man-made lake, and a pond is a natural hole in the ground containing water, a large lake is not included.  I suppose so long as a lake was situated on a river, it could be regarded as part of the river, but there are mountain lakes into and out of which a river does not flow, and they might be outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's advisers saying that it might weaken the Bill if we put in some more words. Indeed, we may have weakened it by putting in so many.  If we provided that &ldquo;dangerous place&rdquo; meant any quantity of water or land and left it at that we would be covering everything, but having put in 11 particular hazards and left out so many others, it could be said that the Bill was intended to apply only to those particular hazards. Unfortunately, we have come to expect a number of fatal accidents on Howth Head and Bray Head every summer, and perhaps some in Powerscourt at the waterfall.  It could be argued by the owners that those places do not fall within the definition of &ldquo;bank&rdquo; or &ldquo;land&rdquo;.  It could be said that they are sea cliffs and do not fall within any description here.  I think the general understanding is that the word &ldquo;bank&rdquo; would apply to an amount of land away from the water, or perhaps a bank along a river, but not a sea bank.  I should prefer to see the word &ldquo;cliff&rdquo; put in.  The Minister agrees with the purpose of our suggestion and I would ask him if he is not prepared to accept it now, to consider the matter again between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This list of specified hazards is probably misleading.  The same thing struck me when I first looked at this section.  I thought we <Col N="524" /> had left out some obvious hazards.  We included in this Bill all the hazards which were named in the 1907 Act and we added two further specific hazards, a quarry and a shaft.  By and large, they are clearly identifiable specific types of hazard as distinct from a wharf, a dock, a canal, a river, and so on, which could lead to confusion as they are not clearly identifiable.  For instance, only part of a wharf would require the type of attention which we hope this measure will enable the local authorities to give.</P>
      <P>As I say, we took the list from the 1907 Act and we added two others which are identifiable in a specific way, whereas the ones proposed in the amendments are not identifiable in a specific way.  Furthermore, the words &ldquo;or land&rdquo; are held to be coverage for all and any hazards that may exist or may arise which are not specifically covered in the original section.  By adding further to this list we would almost need to set up a special commission lest anything would be left out. To my mind, we should leave in what we have on the specific grounds I mention, and I am advised that &ldquo;or land&rdquo; covers fully any of the hazards mentioned in the amendments, and will probably cover hazards not mentioned in the amendments or in the Bill.</P>
      <P>If I were not satisfied I would probably have the same approach as Deputies have adopted in these amendments. I would probably have brought in some similar amendments myself, but I am quite sure the situation is as I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>One point occurs to me. I am sure the Minister will appreciate that the intention is that the local authority, or the sanitary authority, will carry out inspections of places to determine what will be classed as dangerous places where dangers already exist.  From that point of view, I should imagine that the part of a dock or a canal which would be classed as dangerous would be readily identifiable. Naturally some parts would not be dangerous, and some would be readily identifiable as dangerous.  I should have thought the sanitary <Col N="525" /> authority would have no difficulty in so far as their investigating officers were concerned in identifying the canal, or dock, or portion of one proposed to be classed as dangerous.  I do not want to be doctrinaire on this amendment.  Ultimate responsibility rests with the Minister and if he thinks our fears are groundless, I am prepared to withdraw it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (1) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) A sanitary authority shall within five years after the passing of <Col N="526" /> this Act or such longer period not exceeding five years as the Minister by regulation may allow carry out a survey in their sanitary district to ascertain what places are dangerous places in their district.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The section says that the sanitary authority &ldquo;may, if they so think fit&rdquo;. We wish to have that amended by inserting a new subsection to provide that the authority shall do certain things.  As the Minister mentioned, a number of the hazards mentioned in this Bill have been brought in from the Health (Amendment) Act of 1907. Under that Act, local authorities have powers similar to those contained in this section.  It was optional for the local authority to adopt those powers. Section 54 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act of 1948 applied all these powers to the local authorities and one might ask at this stage what the local authorities did to protect the public as a result.</P>
    <P>With all respect, it is not much use leaving it to the option of the local authority to do certain things when one considers the failure of the local authorities under certain statutes as, for instance, the Town and Regional Planning Acts from 1934 to 1939, to which reference was made when a later measure was going through the House. The local authorities did not fulfil their statutory obligations.  They may have adopted an Act but, possibly with one exception, they did not make planning schemes.</P>
    <P>That is the reason for this amendment. It is no reflection on the elected members of local authorities.  The real authorities in these matters are the executives charged with the responsibility&mdash;county managers, county secretaries, county engineers and so forth.  I should like at this stage to draw the Minister's attention to the Civil Liability Act of 1961 in which provision was made that a local authority should, within a period of six years, carry out a certain operation.  In section 61 of that Act, it is laid down that the provision should come into operation on such a date not later than 1st April, 1967, as may be provided for by order of the Government.</P>
    <P>If we impose on a local authority an <Col N="527" /> obligation, say, to make roads, we should equally fix an obligation on them to ensure that inspection of such works, where there may be hazards, shall be carried out within a reasonable time.  That is the request in the amendment, and I suggest it is a reasonable one&mdash;that the local authority should be compelled to do it.  At the moment the section says &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to say, in a broad sense, is that this pinpoints the situation generally in so far as any Minister for Local Government is concerned.  Our system of local government as operated throughout the country is almost exclusively carried out through enactments which are permissive.  They do not put a very definite obligation on our local authorities, and if and when they do, there is little if anything the Minister can do, short of abolishing the council, to ensure that orders laid down are carried out in a satisfactory manner. Attending to matters under this legislation, whether it be dangerous places, buildings or what you will, any single instance of neglect or near-neglect by a local authority could scarcely be regarded as sufficient reason for the removal of the entire body of elected members.</P>
      <P>For that reason, there is a matter which I feel is worth thinking about between now and the time I come to the House later with a comprehensive Sanitary Services Bill.  It is that there may be in that new legislation a section empowering the Minister, whether or not with some safeguards through one or both Houses of the Oireachtas, actually to direct in certain cases the local authority to do certain things and empowering the Minister, if they are not done, to go in there and have them done, charging the local authority their appropriate proportion of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense, this matter in its own way reflects what I regard as a considerable weakness in operation of local authorities.  Everything practically is permissive.  At the moment we have no power except, perhaps, to abolish a council which for small isolated things would not be justified. <Col N="528" /> The Minister and the House may have agreed that something should be done. A council may not carry out the matter in that way and, short of removing that council, there is no way in which the Minister or the House can ensure that what they intended here by legislation is implemented in the interests of the common good.  It may be premature to mention this to the House but it is, as I know, a general defect and, while the remedy may be regarded possibly as worse than the defect, all I seek to do at the moment is to put it on record so that it can be discussed at a later stage when the general Sanitary Services Bill comes before the House.</P>
    <P>It is the local authorities who have been seeking the powers we propose to give them in this short measure. Insisting that these bodies make a survey within five years and list all the potential danger areas will not effectively ensure the protection of those dangerous places unless and until this House is prepared to say that, if they do not carry out this work, someone else must go in and do it for them.  It is in response to the prompting of local authorities that we have introduced this short Bill to enable them to deal with dangerous places and dangerous buildings.  They are the real sponsors of this measure.  It is they who have engendered urgency into it.</P>
    <P>The important thing is to get the work done.  Listing dangerous areas and dangerous buildings will achieve nothing.  It will not ensure that these places are properly safeguarded. Indeed, the hazards are so obvious that one does not need any list.  We all know they are there.  Local authorities are aware of them.  It is because they know the hazards that exist that they are seeking the powers we propose to give them in this Bill.  A survey and a list would achieve no useful purpose whatsoever.  They would have no meaning.  It is the actual power to deal with the situation that is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think one has to resort to the radical step of abolition <Col N="529" /> of a local authority for failure to carry out their duty.  Any citizen or any body can bring <i>mandamus</i> proceedings against a local authority.  It is no harm to spell the obligation into the Bill and then, if it is found that a local authority are not discharging their functions, proceedings can be instituted. It is a matter of regret that the public were not aware that the Dublin Corporation were not executing their statutory duty to inspect and keep a list of dangerous structures.  Had the Corporation done that, there would have been no crisis last year because the list would have been there and would have reminded the Corporation and their officials of the immense task to be performed.  There would have been a sense of duty and a sense of urgency all the time.</P>
      <P>There is the danger that unless an obligation is imposed, a certain amount of indifference will inevitably arise.  It is admitted that the commonest dangerous areas are known now but there are places which might disclose potential sources of danger, of death or injury, which are not at present known.  These places should be listed and steps should be taken to make contact with the owners of property to obtain their goodwill and voluntary effort, in the first instance, and, if that is not forthcoming, to use the compulsory powers available, subsequently recovering compensation from the owners in question.</P>
      <P>I think it is desirable to impose this obligation of inspection and the preparation of a list.  Doing this would not cost the local authority anything because the cost is recoverable from the owners.  The sooner this problem is tackled the better it will be.  The more strict we are about the time in which hazards should be remedied the more likely it is that those responsible will take effective steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suburbs of Dublin from which there is an urgent demand for remedial action, the existing hazards were scarcely known to exist five or ten years ago.  I refer to these water-filled quarries.  There are three or four within a few miles of my own house.  These have been one of the <Col N="530" /> principle reasons dictating this legislation, the quarries in Crumlin, Walkinstown and Perrystown.  Ten years ago, nobody bothered about these places because there were not many children in the area.  There were no houses except odd farm houses.  Now the area is covered with houses and, instead of half a dozen houses ten or 15 years ago, there are thousands of houses today.  Now, had the local authority anticipated the danger, steps would have been taken in time.  In future, when new housing estates are being developed, the location of danger sites in the area should be listed so that, when building plans are submitted, the local authority can hold up approval of the plans until remedial action it taken to remove the danger. That is the kind of thing that could flow from the preparation of a list such as is suggested in this amendment.  I respectfully ask that the matter be dealt with sympathetically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The carrying out of this survey by statutory obligation could of itself cause a holdup in the eradication of existing known danger spots which have not been dealt with for some reason.  A comprehensive survey will have to be done, not just a casual look around.  It will have to include not only what can be seen from the public road but anything which might be accessible to children and even though it may be on private property.  Because of the growth of population and the growing up of new families in an area, it is possible that places which might not be regarded as dangerous when the survey commenced might be a source of danger a few years later when children were growing up around the place.  What would happen in that case?  Would the survey have to go back on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the idea is good, and the analogy drawn with a list of potentially dangerous buildings in Dublin which might have avoided certain happenings is good, I do not agree that such a list would be necessary or that it would add anything to the real purpose of the Bill, which is to facilitate the making safe of places which <Col N="531" /> are obviously dangerous at present.  If we concentrate in carrying out proper remedial work on these places, it is obvious much time cannot be spent on seeing what might be regarded as dangerous. In the ordinary way, I would hope to seek from local authorities their plans under this legislation to see whether in different areas obvious danger spots are being protected.  In that way I think we might get as much information as we would by imposing a statutory obligation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating the Minister's point of view, I take it that what will happen is that the engineering sections of local authorities will be in a continuous process of determining what these hazards are.  In the Civil Liability Act, 1961, section 60 provides that a road authority shall be liable for damage caused as a result of their failure to maintain adequately a public road.  In subsection (5) of that section the Act defines what a public road is. Anybody would think that a public road would be understandable to the ordinary individual but the Act was very specific.  It mentioned all these other ancillary things as any bridge, pipe, arch, gully, footway, pavement, fence, railing or wall forming part of the road.  The elected representatives in any area could not be expected to know where failures of this kind might exist.  In my local authority area, I am aware that engineers, gangers and overseers are in a continuous process of bringing to the notice of the county engineer, who is the responsible executive officer, various hazards of this type.  By legislation, we imposed on them an obligation to do this within a certain period of time.  It was not made permissive in that case but responsibility was fixed on the local authority for damage if anybody could show that the local authority had been remiss in their obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the amendment suggests is the placing of an obligation on the local authority, taking into account that the Minister says he will be bringing in a wider Bill to cover various matters. Until such a measure is brought in or, indeed, if the Minister did not find himself in a position to introduce it at <Col N="532" /> all, what would the position be?  Would we go on in the same way without imposing an obligation that these things be done within a specific period? It is not the elected representatives but the executive body of the local authority who will have the responsibility.</P>
    <P>I should like to be assured that steps will be taken to discover these hazards. In the built-up areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford people will know very readily where they are.  As I said on Second Reading, I would hope the public would co-operate fully in this matter and that anybody who might become aware of such a hazard that could prove dangerous would bring it to the notice of the local authorities.  If this is done in a voluntary fashion, well and good.  But we ought to be sure that everything is done to protect the public from these hazards.  If you allow it to be permissive, somebody might say they did not have to do it.</P>
    <P>I agree fully that the local authorities are as much concerned about the safety of the public as we are but the obligation is on the Legislature to ensure in the circumstances at present prevailing, in so far as possible, that the responsibility is put on somebody to do what is required.  The responsibility to this House is on the Minister in regard to legislation which provides for the safety of the public.  I want to suggest to the Minister that he ought to put, fairly and squarely, on the local authority the obligation to ensure that what he has in mind for the protection of the public would be carried out within a reasonable period of time.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider this matter in that way.  Amendment No. 5, if I may say so, deals with somewhat the same thing, without putting in a specific period of time.  At least, it would put the obligation on the local authority.  I should be very much obliged if the Minister would reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>Reverting to the suggestion that it would be just as well if I were to ask local authorities what they are doing about certain things and what their programme is, may I say <Col N="533" /> that on the specific question of unprotected quarries, I issued a letter to all local authorities on 3rd January last setting out what we would do for them, what help we would give in this legislation that we were proposing to introduce and, in conclusion, asking that I be furnished on or before 29th February, which was six or seven weeks later, with a report by each sanitary authority on any works carried out by them, the cost thereof, and so on.</P>
      <P>That letter related only to quarries. We got a good return from a very widespread section of local authorities. Discussion and negotiation followed and contact has since been maintained with them.  I feel that that type of thing applied to the broader field covered in this Bill would be as effective and would not have all the tags attached to it that a statutory obligation to do a certain thing within a specified time would entail.</P>
      <P>If the final responsibility is on the Minister in this matter there is not much point in the Minister saying at any time to the local authority: &ldquo;You must do this by the law of the land&rdquo; if, as would be the case under this legislation and every legislation that I know of, no power is given to the Minister or to this House to do other than say: &ldquo;You must do it&rdquo;.  There is no effective way in which the Minister can ensure that it is done if any local authority for any peculiar local reason do not do a particular job which this House thinks should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several matters in respect of which we said it must be done but we could not follow that up.  That is why I proposed earlier this evening that on a suitable occasion, which probably would be in connection with the general sanitary services codification Bill which will be coming in, there should be a special provision inserted so that the Minister, on the direction of or with the acquiescence of, the House, by some formula or other, would be able to pick out something that the local authority were not doing, although the law says it should be done, and whereby the Minister, on <Col N="534" /> behalf of the House and the Government, could see that it is done if it is not being done.</P>
    <P>Until we get around to considering that broad general principle, the placing of a statutory obligation on a local authority to do something will not attain the end which is in the mind of Deputy Jones and in my own mind in relation to these matters.  The request made in connection with quarries a few months ago has given a good return without any of the tags that would attach if a statutory obligation were imposed as proposed in the amendment. I would suggest, on that account, that we should wait until we get a look at this other idea and consider in a reasonable way whether we might require to take specific power to ensure that the things this House says ought to be done are, in fact, done and if the local authority fail to do them after a reasonable warning or after discussion with them, there might be power taken to see that some agency on behalf of the Government was empowered to do it for them and charge them the appropriate share of the cost when the work was finished. I would prefer to leave it this way until we get a chance of looking at that overall situation.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, line 49, to delete &ldquo;may, if they so think fit&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the section is drafted at present, it says that the sanitary authority &ldquo;may, if they so think fit, give a notice to the owner&rdquo; and we want that changed so that they shall give a notice to the owner.  In this we are dealing with the property rights of people.  That is the first point.  Secondly, a livelihood may be involved as livelihoods are involved in some of the smaller buildings in this city which require to be demolished.  Thirdly, a dwelling may perhaps be in question as dwellings are at present in this city.  In this connection, I might recall, that Article 44 or 45 of the Constitution says that the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be entered save in accordance with the law. Therefore, the least any person is entitled to get is a notice so that he may have an opportunity of defending the stand he takes in regard to his property.  If we leave it &ldquo;may, if they so think fit&rdquo;, we are leaving the discretion solely to the local authority, but I suggest that where the rights of the property-owner or the person who occupies such premises or the person whose home is being invaded, it is not a question that they ought to get this notice but that they have a right to get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I read this amendment at first in a rather different way from the way Deputy Jones now puts it to the House.  He feels that the amendment proposes to give the owner some right that he had not enjoyed up to the present.  I do not think that is actually so.  Subsection (1) of the Section says that they &ldquo;may, if they so think fit, give a notice to the owner who occupies or is entitled to occupy a dangerous structure&rdquo; and <Col N="538" /> so on, &ldquo;within such period specified in the notice as the authority may consider appropriate.&rdquo; If they do not get a notice, they do not have to carry it out.  The idea of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; really confused me.  I feel there is a different approach from what is intended.  It is only after they have got this notice that these things should be done and if the authority did not wish them to be done, then there would be no notice. As I say, I am rather confused by the manner in which the Deputy has approached this amendment.  It does not seem to add up to me but I have put a different interpretation on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a period during which they must leave the notice before they proceed to take down the structure?  I believe in any case that the sanitary authority or the local authority should be given all possible powers to ensure that dangerous structures will be removed.  I do not know what saver there is, but as far as I can read it, the owner who is entitled to&mdash;even though he does not&mdash; occupy the building must have the notice served on him.  If it is obligatory on the local authority to do that and they cannot find the owner, then in the event of great danger, the structure may have fallen down by the time they have found them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1890 Act was also permissive and said that the Corporation &ldquo;may make a complaint to a justice&rdquo; about a dangerous building.  I think this is part of the problem that has reached crisis proportions in this <Col N="539" /> city, the fact that it was permissive and the Corporation did not avail of the permission to take action in relation to dangerous structures.  It is important that we should make it obligatory for the future, and Deputy Jones is quite right.  It is true to say that for the past couple of years, while an effort was being made to overcome this problem, it has now reached crisis proportions and the Dublin Corporation and other local authorities may be acutely aware of the moral obligation that lies on them to avail of the permission, but after that the situation may well arise where there is a dangerous building and the Corporation do not use the power given to them.</P>
      <P>It should be open to any occupier concerned about a dangerous building, or to an adjoining occupier to take action by bringing <i>mandamus</i> proceedings against the Corporation to compel them to use the power in this Act to serve the necessary notice on the owner and set the necessary machinery in motion.  We ought to learn by our mistakes, and the mistakes that have arisen are that local authorities have not availed of the permissive powers in relation to matters where they should not be given discretion at all but where the obligation should be to move and to move in time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Against what Deputy Corish says, section 18 (2) provides:</P>
      <P>Where the owner of the place or structure to which a notice under <i>section 2</i> or <i>3</i> of this Act relates cannot be ascertained or found by reasonable inquiry, the notice may be given to the owner by posting it at or near the place or structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That should be sufficient.  The notice can prescribe the time which the technical experts believe is the maximum which can be allowed and if the owner does not move&mdash;it may well be, if he does not, that he has not read the notice but unfortunately that is something <Col N="540" /> he will have to bear&mdash;either because he is absent and by his absence has allowed the danger to arise or is present and has reglected to prevent the danger arising, I think it should be sufficient to post the notice up on the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of attempting to evade responsibility in the matter or trying to delay the process. This can involve a person dwelling in a place like this.  It could be a small shopkeeper whose premises it is proposed to acquire.  It could be a person with a property right.  Therefore, before the local authority proceeds to do certain things, they should give him notice of their intention to do so.  Here it is permissive.  We are asking that, instead of its being permissive, they &ldquo;shall&rdquo; give him notice. This could concern a very old person living in a tenement room who would find that somebody was about to demolish part of the building.  It is because of these considerations that we put down this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest that the section as drafted is misconceived. Subsection (2) authorises the sanitary authority to demolish a house if, in their opinion, it is necessary to do so. The sanitary authority can do that without a court order and then there is the right of appeal to the court provided in subsection (5).  Before such an appeal takes place, the sanitary authority has already demolished the building.  They can lawfully do that under subsection (2).  All we are asking here is to put the horse before the cart again by providing that when the notice is served, the aggrieved party can then appeal to the court and the court can decide the matter at that stage.  The amendment does not take away any of the powers of the sanitary authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is just the reverse of the procedure we propose here.  Where a person is uncooperative <Col N="542" /> in regard to any of these matters under section 3 which could be quite urgent and in regard to which time might be the essence of the whole operation, we feel it is only reasonable that the local authority be presumed to have the power to do these things, unless and until the owner of the property says: &ldquo;No; I will not allow you to do this, that or the other&rdquo;.  At that stage we provide that without any more delay the local authority may prosecute their case in court and the person who did not co-operate in order to avert this danger which existed as a result of the condition of the property must defend himself as to why he would not co-operate. This is preferable to the dangerous delays which could be caused in certain specific cases through the amendment which Deputy Jones proposes. That is the net difference between the two approaches.</P>
      <P>Considering what we wish to have done under this proposal, I believe we are entitled to allow the local authority, on whom the onus is really placed, to do these things.  They should be presumed, as it were, to be active in the interests of the common good and that it should be rather for those who oppose that effort to defend their action than to put in the dock those who are going ahead to do something which we feel we should give them power to do and which is in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister heard me on this point. What use is the right of appeal to the court provided in subsection (5) if, before the appeal takes place, the sanitary authority may lawfully, under subsection (2), have demolished the building?  Under subsection (5) you say that a person on whom notice in regard to a dangerous structure has been served may appeal to the court but under subsection (2), the sanitary authority may lawfully enter and demolish the building if they think that requires to be done.  The individual on whom the notice is served has the right of appeal within 21 days but when that time is up, <Col N="543" /> he may find the building already demolished.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest quite reasonably that at least a person should get an opportunity of defending his rights, whether he is a dweller in the building or has property rights or is employed there.  I am sure the Minister will agree that on occasions people who have been in hospital, for instance, have come back to find their premises disconnected by the ESB.  It would be too bad if a person who might have a genuine right in a case like this were to find there would be no use in going to court to sustain his rights to a building already lawfully interfered with by the sanitary authority under this section. What we want the Minister to do in this amendment is to reverse the process, to serve a notice giving the person an opportunity of going to the court and then getting the sanitary authority to deal with the matter as the court has decided.  This is not taking away from the sanitary authority to deal with the matter as the court has decided.  This is not taking away from the sanitary authority the powers that are being conferred on them by the section but it seeks to reverse the order in which things are done.  Would the Minister consider that between now and the next stage of the Bill?</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) should be considered as standing on its own which is what it undoubtedly is, and to imply that operations under it would seem to nullify any other safeguard that may be enshrined in other sections is not to take full cognisance of the purpose of the subsection.  It is an emergency section which really only comes into operation when there is immediate danger to life.  Obviously, we need such a power.  Its use, of course, is governed pretty strictly by the terms I have mentioned&mdash;immediate danger to life.  If such a situation exists, we cannot await the normal procedure that might be held to be necessary in regard to private property in ordinary circumstances.  This is an emergency provision and I would ask Deputies to bear that in mind.  In fairness, it should not be allowed to confuse us in looking at other parts of the section.</P>

      <P>We all understand the human anxiety that exists in relation to dangerous buildings but it must not be allowed to continue&mdash;a panic operation like that carried out in the past year.  Last week I was accused by Deputy Timmons, on loan to the House from the <i>Irish Press,</i> of making wild, exaggerated statements when I said the whole process of the law in relation to dangerous buildings was ill-used and abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stand on what I said last week and give as my authority the decision of the learned President of the High Court this morning who made absolute an order of <i>certiorari</i> against Dublin Corporation in respect of premises against which the Corporation moved about a year ago, as far back as July <Col N="545" /> 1963.  Those premises have since been mentioned twice in the district court. They are the subject of circuit court proceedings; they were mentioned on five different occasions in the High Court.  One conditional order of <i>certiorari</i> in respect of them was made several months ago.  That order was made absolute.  While those legal proceedings were going on the Corporation brought other proceedings against the premises in the district court in an attempt to get another order against them.  That order was made and now after over a year of legal wrangling, the learned President of the High Court this morning supported what I maintained here last week, a contention for which I was pilloried by Deputy Timmons who must have had great pleasure in seeing his accusations enshrined in the newspaper.</P>
    <P>At the end of it all, it gives me very little satisfaction that I was proved right by the learned President of the High Court.  I do not think we should lightly deprive persons of rights of this sort.  Of the 71 shopkeepers who have been evacuated from allegedly dangerous buildings over the past year, 71 received no compensation.  I know of only one who had an opportunity and means to have the matter challenged and his is now a test case for the others. But their rights have since been extinguished. Whatever chance they had of preserving or maintaining them before, they are gone now.  I think I am right in asserting that the whole process of the law is being used in a panic way to obtain objects which were never intended and that rights are being obliterated which should never be obliterated.  Therefore, I think Deputy Jones is quite right in pressing for maintenance of the rights of owners and occupiers in relation to property.</P>
    <P>There have been many of those cases where only a portion of the building was considered dangerous, but, as I said last week, the Corporation insisted upon getting orders condemning the whole premises.  They did so, despite the fact that their own experts had said only portion of the buildings was <Col N="546" /> dangerous.  If the Deputy wishes, I can make one of these orders available for his inspection, where they insisted on getting the whole premises demolished, despite the fact that only portion of it was considered dangerous. These orders were made for demolition of the whole premises, despite the fact that they would wipe out the rights of the shopkeepers who had been there for 25 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones is asking that the person may within 21 days apply for the right to have the matter examined in the district court.  We have no reason to be unduly alarmed about any possibility of danger in the future. I do not think we are likely to have a repetition of the collapsing of buildings. We are not likely in the future to wait for them to be in a grievously dangerous position before taking action to have them inspected.  As soon as the possibility of approximate danger arises, the necessary steps will be taken to have the premises condemned and ultimately demolished.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, 21 days should not give rise to the type of collapse or danger which the Minister has in mind.  Deputy Jones's amendment in that regard is well worth accepting.  I give no less authority for our submission in this regard than over a year of litigation cases in different courts and under different judges.  Instead of having that involved legal process in the future, we ought to have the safeguard which Deputy Jones proposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see the Deputy wants to have this both ways.  We want this legislation very badly.  There are certain things we need to do.  In that event we have presented here ways of requiring owners of property to do certain things. If the owner fails to do them and does not agree with our decision, we can compel him.  We are asking the local authorities to ask him to do certain things in a certain way under this Bill. If he does not do so, they bring him to court.  The penalties set out are not imposed by anybody but the court. It is only when the person is brought to the court and it has been indicated clearly that he has not carried out this <Col N="547" /> work that the penalties operate.  They are operated then only at the discretion of the court.</P>
      <P>I cannot see anything whatever wrong with that approach to these matters, nor do I see that we are in any way taking away the rights of owners of property or private individuals, or putting them in an unduly difficult position.  The owner of property is asked to do these things by the local authority only when they are necessary to be done for the purposes of this Bill.  If the owner does not do them&mdash;he may refuse to do them&mdash;he is brought to court by the local authority who ask him to do these things.  That is where the penalties are outlined.  He is asked to do this work and if he does not do so, penalties are imposed.  It is again the court who apply the penalty and it does not follow that it is the result of any action or decision by the local authority.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to that, if these works are not carried out, the court has discretion and power to enable the local authorities to do these works themselves.  I do not see why any exception can be taken to the general particulars in this section.  Subsection (2) is an emergency subsection and it is not to be confused with the general operation of the section as a whole.</P>

      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Ryan says in relation to statements made last week when he states here that the Dublin Corporation officials got court orders for the demolition of entire buildings. He made a statement here last week, and repeated it today, that on receipt of a demolition order, they had the entire premises described as dangerous and had it demolished.  I do not want to go from this House without saving that that is not so.  If Deputy Ryan was at one of the meetings, he would have heard Mr. Culleton, the supervisor of the dangerous building section, when he outlined the steps taken by the Corporation in this grave matter. I do not accept that they go into court to seek complete demolition orders. <Col N="548" /> They do not do so unless they are necessary, on the basis of their technical experience and the professional advice which is available.  Secondly, I want to refute the charge that the Corporation failed in their obligations in relation to this matter.  They dealt with it in the best way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit I was in error in saying the Corporation failed to do anything for 15 years.  That was an understatement on my part.  If Deputy Timmons went to the trouble of reading the report which he got seven months ago covering the period 24th June 1963 to 5th July 1963, he would see on page 22 of that report:</P>
      <P>It emerged from the inquiry that Dublin Corporation had never complied with section 29 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931. This section provides for inspection of its district by a local authority with a view to ascertaining whether any dwellinghouse therein is unfit for human habitation, and provides that for that purpose it shall be the duty of the local authority to comply with such regulations and to keep such records as the Minister may prescribe.  Regulations were prescribed by Statutory Rule and Order, No. 5 of 1936, the Housing (Inspection of Districts) Regulations, 1936.</P>
      <P>If we take the year 1936, we find for 27 years Dublin Corporation failed to fulfil their statutory obligations.  If that is a wild and exaggerated statement, it was made by the inspector who sat at the sworn inquiry last year.  Deputy Timmons may want to pillory the inspector of that inquiry as well as the learned President of the High Court in their views.  They join with me in making these statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Timmons has not been present at many of these court cases but I have heard evidence given on orders made by the Dublin Corporation in which they clearly state this, that and the other portion of a building is dangerous.  In evidence, they state the other portions of the building are not dangerous but the condition always has been there.  This condition has <Col N="549" /> been upheld by the High Court.  The condition always has been that the order had been made in respect of the whole premises.  Those orders in the hands of people like the Dangerous Buildings Section of the Corporation were used only to remove the danger. When those orders were made available to other owners, through the insistence of the Dublin Corporation that the whole building be condemned, the private owners of buildings used them to demolish the whole building, including the shops, which were safe for the people living there.</P>
    <P>I can understand this problem as Deputy Timmons does not.  This is not meant as a personal criticism of him. This is a distinction which can be seen only by people who have seen the operation of these orders.  The Corporation used these orders to remove the danger in the buildings and they were made fit.  The danger in most cases was only in the upper storey and when they removed that, they invariably left the shop premises there if those premises were considered safe.  That was not what was happening in many cases where these orders were made available to the owners by the Corporation and where the Corporation insisted on getting an order in respect of the whole structure where a partial order would have been sufficient.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Timmons doubts me, I will make available to him a file containing affidavits galore by both the Corporation and the people involved. He will see where orders were given by the district court condemning the whole building and he will see the whole history in which the owner of the property tried to use that order to remove portion of the building which was not dangerous but where there were tenants whose rights to compensation the landlord tried to deny.</P>
    <P>You are not going to make a bad situation any better by applying bad law.  It is only by acknowledging the rights of ownership and the rights of tenants to compensation, if they are disturbed, that you will have better legislation in the future.  If this House does an unjust thing, the poor people will not be able to bear the cost or the <Col N="550" /> anxiety of court proceedings, but in some cases persons of some small substance may be able to do so, and we will be back in this House in another year or two arguing for remedial legislation. It would be better now to do the just and proper thing and make legal remedies available to people who may be hurt by local authorities.  That is all Deputy Jones is asking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has spoken of section 2 as an emergency section. In section 2 (a), we set out the power of a sanitary authority to carry out such works as will, in the opinion of the authority, prevent the place from being a dangerous place and to do certain things in the interests of the safety of any person.  Perhaps it would have been better if we had said &ldquo;where a danger is imminent in respect of any such building&rdquo;.  What I seek in this amendment is that before subsection (2) we put in another subsection to give the right to a person on whom a notice is served in respect of a dangerous structure that if he is aggrieved, he may, within 21 days of the service of the notice, go to the district court and ask to have the notice annulled or varied.</P>
      <P>There are three alternatives then set out which the court may decide to operate.  I said briefly when moving the amendment that there was not in it any lessening of the powers which the sanitary authority would have.  The first alternative is that the district court may, by order, direct the person to carry out, within such time as the court may consider reasonable and shall in such order specifically limit, and authorise the sanitary authority, if the person does not comply with the order of the court, to carry out, such works as in the opinion of the court may be necessary to prevent this structure from being a dangerous structure.  The second alternative is that the court may authorise the sanitary authority to carry out such works and the third is that the court may prohibit the use of the structure or any part of it for such purpose or purposes as may be specified in the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That bears out what Deputy Ryan has been saving as being decided in the courts this morning.  What we are <Col N="551" /> trying to do by this amendment is to ensure that the legislation will not be wrong in this respect.  I again urge on the Minister that he should consider the acceptance of this amendment. It is a very reasonable and fair one and does not weaken the powers of the local authority in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I have to say is that the proposals in the amendment would actually weaken the position as we have it.  The Bill is being brought in to strengthen powers which we already regard as being too weak and my advice is that this amendment would weaken these powers rather than strengthen them. I have looked at this amendment in a very sympathetic way.  I have been looking through all the amendments to see whether any of them would be acceptable and up to this point have not found one that is acceptable.  This amendment would not help the present position: instead it would weaken it.</P>

      <P>I must accept what the Minister says when he states that he has considered the amendments sympathetically but we consider that the rights of the individual <i>vis-á-vis</i> the local authority are of very great importance. The fact is that there could be a miscarriage of justice if a person who was aggrieved found himself in the position that he would have no redress in the matter because of the fact that certain things had taken place.  Bearing in mind the anxiety of everybody to give the sanitary authorities all the necessary powers, at the same time, I feel there is an obligation on this House to protect the rights of any individual who may be aggrieved. Would the Minister consider this matter between now and Report Stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (7) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) This subsection shall apply to a person who:</P>
      <P>(i) is tenant of a dangerous structure or any part thereof and is required to vacate such structure by reason of the service of a notice under subsection (1) or paragraph (a) of subsection (9) of this section or by reason of a Court order made under paragraph (b) of subsection (9) of this section,</P>
      <P>(ii) was not by virtue of his tenancy under legal obligation to prevent the structure from becoming a dangerous structure,</P>
      <P>(iii) became tenant of the structure or any part thereof not less than six months before service of a notice on the owner under subsection (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (7) we are dealing with costs and expenses in relation to proceedings in the district court which are called by the sanitary authority under the section and where they are not paid by the owner of the structure within 14 days.  The local authority may claim the amount together with the rate of interest and they may <Col N="553" /> recover it by sale by the local authority of any material resulting from works carried out or by a simple contract debt.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to deal with the position of a tenant who might be entitled to some kind of compensation. In this case the authority might move in and take over from a person who is the owner of a property. I mentioned here on Second Reading that there was a danger that a person on whom an order might be served by reason of a structure being deemed to be dangerous, or about to become dangerous, might very well say at that stage that he was not in a position to do certain things.  Therefore, the local authority might move in and do these things for him and charge him with the amount for doing the work.  In fact, as set out in the subsection, they might, being unable to recover the costs from him, proceed to sell any materials which they might salvage from such a building or use them.  The position then is that, in regard to a person who is a tenant of a dangerous structure which the owner has demolished, or whom he is required to get out of this building as a result of court proceedings, or where the local authority has carried out these works as a result of a court order, there is an obligation to provide the tenant with compensation.  These things have been defined, and according to these definitions, in this subsection, he must be the tenant of this building. Secondly, he must not have been liable for maintenance of the structure in the tenancy agreement and, thirdly, he must be a tenant for six months.  These things are laid down in the subsection. The compensation which is proposed in the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960, paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 29 are the same as those in section 23 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>Views have been advanced on this under financial stringency whereby the owner can be relieved of his possession of the building and it is the same as vacant possession.  There is a further case under the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, where the landlord required the premises because it would not be proper for the tenant to remain in possession. <Col N="554" /> In this case we often have premises being occupied as a business premises.  In paragraph (c) we have the kind of case where the premises were used for business purposes and where the premises on the granting of a new tenancy would not be subject to the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>In all of these cases, under the Rent Restrictions Act of 1960 or under the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931, the financial circumstances of the landlord were not the prime consideration. Where the landlord regained possession of the premises, the presumption is it is always a valuable asset to him.  We can have, in the case I mention, the position arising that you can have a landlord availing of the use of the local authority for the repossession of valuable sites.  It would be manifestly unfair either to the local authority or the tenants.  In the first instance, it would be unfair to the local authority who had to do the work which the landlord would have to do, or, in the second case, it would be unjust to the tenant who will suffer as a result of the repossession of these buildings.</P>
    <P>If the property is of the slum type, and has been cheaply obtained, some people might say that the amount of compensation payable in these circumstances might be beyond the resources of the landlord.  In any event, the compensation would be related to the rent which is paid.  If the rent is small, the compensation paid is small; if the rent is large, there is no reason why the compensation paid should not be fair and reasonable.  I have heard it said that it might be unfair to property owners to expect them to provide an amount of compensation in cases like this.  Under the provisions of the various Acts I have quoted, it is laid down very clearly what would be paid.  If, for instance, a person paid 1/- weekly or 1/6 weekly on foot of the tenancy of a building, the compensation payable would be certainly under £12 at the present time.</P>
