      <P>The Donegal County Council have forwarded a statutory request to the Local Appointments Commission for the selection and recommendation of a person for appointment as medical officer for the District Hospital at Dungloe.  The conditions of appointment relating to this post and a number of similar hospital posts are now being settled after necessary consultation with the Local Appointments Commission and the local authorities concerned and it is hoped to have the posts advertised in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that there are many cases in Dublin of children who, after their parents apply for their admission to hospital to have their <Col N="622" /> tonsils extracted, have many months to wait before being admitted to hospital for operation; and if he will take steps to shorten the waiting period between application and operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of the children on the waiting lists of Dublin hospitals for tonsillectomy operations would be cases first detected at school medical service and child welfare clinics run by the Dublin Health Authority.  Such cases are referred to the specialist out-patient clinics operated by the voluntary hospitals.  The hospital specialist may prescribe treatment and defer a decision to operate, pending completion of the course of treatment.  On the other hand, he may consider that it is desirable to operate without delay and in that case he would arrange for the early admission of the patient to hospital.  In many cases, however, where a high degree of urgency does not apply there is some delay before admission to hospital can be arranged.  Altogether 16 hospitals are involved.  The extent of the delay varies considerably from hospital to hospital, but my inquiries show that in the majority of them patients are usually admitted for operation within a month of being seen at the specialist clinic.</P>

      <P>I have had no request from the promoters of this project to assist it financially.  Indeed, when His Grace, Most Reverend Dr. McQuaid, Archbishop of Dublin, who is Chairman of the Hospital, very courteously informed me on 19th instant of the intention to undertake this research, he stated that the beginnings <Col N="623" /> would be modest and would be financed by voluntary contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will define the responsibility of a health authority regarding the provision of shelter for people and families awaiting permanent housing accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Health authorities have no specific responsibility to provide shelter for anybody merely for the reason that such person is awaiting what I infer is meant by the phrase in the question &ldquo;permanent housing <Col N="624" /> accommodation&rdquo;, that is a house or flat provided by a housing authority. This matter of shelter is governed by section 54 of the Health Act, 1953, under which a health authority have the duty to provide institutional assistance, that is, shelter and maintenance, for persons in their area who cannot provide these services for themselves or their dependants.  I do not feel that the Legislature ever intended that the section should be used to relieve persons whose financial circumstances would permit of their paying for the accommodation they need for themselves and their families of the responsibility of seeking and providing temporary accommodation independent of local authorities until such time as the housing authority were in a position to provide permanent houses for them. Housing authorities seek to allocate the accommodation under their control on a basis which is equitable to all applicants and the claims of the many families housed in substandard accommodation and awaiting, some for long periods, improved accommodation from the housing authority should not be overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the situation that is arising in Dublin at present due to the failure of the housing authority to provide sufficient houses for these families?  The Dublin Health Authority are being called on to house them.  At a recent meeting they failed to get agreement: the housing authority hold that it is the responsibility of the health authority and the health authority feel that it is a normal housing authority responsibility.  I should like very much if the matter were cleared up finally.  It is becoming a real embarrassment for the health authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand how embarrassed the health authority may feel in the situation that is arising in Dublin, but the Deputy asked me to define the responsibility of the health authority.  If he likes to put down a further question, I can give him information.</P>

      <P>Site investigation at Kilronan, Aran, County Galway, has been carried out but study of the results by the Office of Public Works engineers has not yet been completed. In particular the most suitable and economic from of foundation for the proposed extension must be determined. When the design has been completed, a report with detailed estimate of costs will be furnished to Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Progress with the preliminary work has been slower than expected. The engineer dealing with the <Col N="626" /> case, I regret to say, died suddenly last week and arrangements have to be made to re-assign his work.  His successor will have to familiarise himself with the scheme and there will necessarily be some delay in furnishing the report with estimate of cost to Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>(a)  Approximately 40 acres of land.</P>
      <P>(b)  Six.</P>
      <P>(c)  Under section 12, Land Act, 1950, the selection of allottees is an excepted matter reserved to the Land Commissioners.  In deciding as between applicants, the Land Commission have to take a variety of items into account but I would not wish to comment on, or openly compare, across the floor of the House, the private and, perhaps, personal matters of individuals.</P>
      <P>I can say, however, that the limited area for disposal in this case comprised eight scattered plots situated in an area of intense congestion.  There were upwards of 50 eligible applicants within a mile of the lands.  In the circumstances, only a small proportion of deserving claimants could be accommodated and it was inevitable that some disappointment would result&mdash;either because applicants were unsuccessful or because their allotments did not measure up to their expectations.  I am satisfied that the lands were allocated by the Commissioners as equitably as the prevailing conditions permitted.</P>
      <P>Efforts by the Land Commission to acquire other lands in this district are continuing: in fact, an area of some 28 acres is currently the subject of proceedings which, when concluded, will result in a further measure of relief for the locality.</P>

      <P>I have not yet decided to what counties it is proposed to extend the national schools' reference library scheme in the years 1964 and 1965.</P>
      <P>There are 18 works on the basic list of books to be supplied to each school; the optional list contains over 200 titles and will be expanded as more suitable books become available.  Particulars of these books are given in a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to have included in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Should it be decided to erect the new Dublin Dental Hospital on a site other than the one already purchased for the purpose at Peter's Place, which is the property of the Dublin Dental Hospital Board, it is intended that the Peter's Place site will be disposed of by the Board and the proceeds applied towards the cost of <Col N="643" /> the new building.  There has been no delay in coming to a decision on the siting of the new hospital.  As I indicated in my reply to a previous question from the Deputy on 8th April, 1964, the newly constituted Board, which came into existence on 17th July, 1963, is not yet in a position to make a final recommendation in the matter.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.  &mdash;Deputy Crotty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned last week, I was making reference to the increasing number of letters which are going astray.  How much of this is due to malice on the part of the Post Office and how much is due to general incompetence, I do not know, but it is quite clear that in recent times, since the introduction of the postal district numbers, an increasing amount of correspondence is not finding its way in proper time to its destination.  One appreciates the purpose of introducing the postal district numbering system, which is to expedite sorting, but it should not be used as a justification for deliberately delaying, mislaying or setting aside correspondence which does not bear a district number, particularly as the Department has not yet furnished in the telephone directory, which is a handy book of reference, district numbers for all entries in that directory. We have been promised by the Minister that this will be done in the next issue of the directory.  I hope it will not be like so many other indications from the Minister, just so much wishful thinking, with very little beneficial result in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasised earlier, as did Deputy Crotty and Deputy Governey, on the Fine Gael benches, that we were not at all satisfied that there was need to increase postal charges in order to meet the increased outlay which wage adjustments have called for.  As an indication of the lack of capacity in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to use possible profit opportunities, I would draw the attention of the House to the growth of modern internal office equipment in the form of modern <Col N="647" /> telephonic systems of communication. Vast profits are being made out of the installation of modern telephonic equipment, particularly in modern offices, by private concerns.  Here is a clear example of where the Department of Posts and Telegraphs could have adapted itself to meet the demands of modern industry and business by providing these modern facilities.  Instead, the only telephone exchange equipment which the Department can offer is a complicated piece of ancient furniture which requires the pulling out or sticking in of plugs or the switching of levers up and down in a contraption which is more likely to go out of order and to create general chaos than it is to facilitate the passage of calls from the outside world through various extensions in a modern business office or industrial concern.</P>
    <P>I ask here now why it is that so many firms are getting rid of antiquated telephone exchanges and installing in their offices modern equipment provided by private concerns.  I do not have to look far for the answer because the answer is simple.  A modern system, although more costly, is more satisfactory and does not frequently go out of order and cause all kinds of disorder and chaos such as is the experience of people using the antiquated machinery which is the only form of equipment the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will offer.</P>
    <P>I speak from intimate experience of this.  For several years, hardly a week passed without there being something faulty with a number of different pieces of Department of Posts and Telegraphs equipment which were made available to my office.  No sooner did we get rid of all the contraptions provided by the Department than we had a perfect service, which we have had ever since.</P>
    <P>Here is an opportunity to earn income for the benefit of the community which the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has failed to make use of. That is only one small way in which <Col N="648" /> the Department has shown how grossly inefficient it is and how lacking it is in capacity to adapt itself to the demands of modern science and modern business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell and others in the course of the Budget debate have very rightly spoken of the colossal burden which will now be imposed upon business generally because of the savage and unnecessary increases in postal charges.  Last night, scandalous personal comments were made about Deputy Dockrell and other members of this House suggesting that they had no wish to see the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs paid properly and suggesting that the only way in which they could be paid properly was by increasing the cost of stamps and that, if we were opposed to the increased cost of stamps, we were opposed to decent wages.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is so trite and so despicable when it is an accusation made against persons in this House, honourable persons in this House, that I do not think there is any need for me to chase that particular type of personal slander very far but what is particularly nasty is when that type of comment is made about some members of this House who are noted for the very good conditions that they provide for their workers and for the fact that in many cases they pay their workers well in excess of the trade union rates.  Good wages, good working conditions are not synonymous with overcharging the public for service performed.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the expectation that the increased charges will yield about £2½ million and said that, in arriving at that figure, allowance had been made for loss of traffic which would result from the increased charges.  My concern is that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs over the years has been losing traffic, and profitable traffic, because of the growing weight of excessive charges for relatively simple services.  The Minister suggested that the justification for increased postal charges was that in some areas in the country the population was so sparse that the cost of <Col N="649" /> delivering letters far outran the cost of the postage on the particular item.</P>
    <P>One can certainly understand that if a postman has to travel four miles up a mountain side to deliver one letter, on which there is a 5d stamp, that is not a profitable activity, but, against that, we are aware that in cities and towns throughout the country, in a street of perhaps 50 houses, there may be 200 offices or business concerns or private residences which may yield to the Department anything from 400 to 500 letters per day and in many cases in one short street the number of letters delivered daily may run into several thousands.  The effect of increasing the postal rate for a simple letter to 5d will be that many more firms will abandon the use of the postal services for the delivery of correspondence in the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Even before the 5d charge was announced, many Dublin business houses did not use the service of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for the delivery of correspondence within a radius of one or two miles of their firms.  The effect of raising the charge will be that many more firms will abandon the use of the Department's service for the delivery of correspondence within the city because they will find that if they have any reasonable amount of correspondence they will be more disposed to pay a man an extra couple of pounds a week for a few short hours each day during which he can deliver the correspondence within the city limits.  Indeed, any firm with a big amount of correspondence could pay a man fulltime and have the job done more efficiently and at far less expense.</P>
    <P>This most profitable of the whole Post Office services has been lost to a substantial degree in the past and will be lost to an even greater degree as soon as the 5d levy comes into operation. I do not think the Minister can have made a sufficient allowance for the loss of revenue almost certain to follow when a levy of 5d is imposed for the delivery of an envelope within the city limits.  I am quite certain that what I say in relation to Dublin will apply also to the larger firms <Col N="650" /> throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>Wherever you have poor labour relations, be it in private or public business, you will invariably have a low rate of wages, a substantial amount of discontent which translates itself into inefficiency.  This inefficiency will even show itself outside the labour field.  Earlier this year I asked the Minister to state the number of outstanding unresolved employment differences in his Department. We found from his reply that some of the differences between the Department and the unions involved are of two, three and even four years' duration. That indicates a very poor degree of labour relations in the Department.</P>
    <P>If the matter were ever in doubt, the fact that there is most inadequate labour machinery in the Department was proved beyond all doubt in the Minister's remarks in the course of the past year on the sub-postmasters' dispute. He used language in the course of that dispute which we thought had been silenced in the nineteenth century and certainly if not then at least in the strife that occurred in this city some 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister denied all consideration of either arbitration or conciliation for sub-postmasters and indicated that it was his notion, and the view of the Government, that all civil servants, be they temporary postmen or others, had a duty to work for the State and appeared to have little or no rights at all.  This indicates a most unhealthy approach in a Department which is the biggest employer of labour of all Departments.  Unless there is a radical change of heart on the part of the Minister, and of the Government in general, in relation to their workers we will have growing discontent and growing inefficiency in a Department which ought to be relatively simple to run and which, if run on a modern commercial basis, would be capable of yielding not the loss which the Minister forecasts but a substantial profit.  It is very small consolation to be told by the Minister in the course of his statement that he is now, in this <Col N="651" /> year of grace, to start an efficiency campaign in the Department.  We are now told there is the possibility of working out economies&mdash;the possibility of saving through the cutting out of wasteful and unnecessary expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are plenty of opportunities for making a profit.  If I were not so busy at my public affairs it would give me the greatest satisfaction, and a fairly good profit, to organise say, for the City of Dublin, a letter delivery service at what would be, I feel sure, less than half what the Department charge for the delivery of letters within this city.  There is a substantial profit available to anybody who cares to organise such a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel sure the Minister and his Department know that.  The effect of his cure for the losses on the postal service may well be to stimulate some <Col N="652" /> enterprising person or persons to engage in such a service.  If that happens, the Minister will have only himself to blame.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to lay my hands on the text of the Minister's promise of reform but there is no doubt that the general tenor of his remarks indicated this reform was only now to take place.  If it has been going on for 15 years why has it not yielded better results?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1959 there was a great hullabaloo during the Budget debate to the effect that there was to be a drastic overhaul of the whole Civil Service.  We were promised amazing reforms.  We are still awaiting them. Four from 15 leaves 11, and perhaps we shall wait another 11 years before any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will announce another reform.  The telegraphic minimum charge of 5/-will bring about a situation such as I heard described last week.  Instead of sending wedding greeting telegrams, people will find it cheaper to send gifts. Whatever losses there may have been in the telegraphic service&mdash;and my information is that they are there&mdash;they are not likely to disappear overnight because of this new impost.  Surely the Minister must realise there will be less traffic and, therefore, that the loss will be more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not care about a White Paper.  I do not care who produced it.  One of our functions is to <Col N="653" /> criticise.  Is it the suggestion that we are to accept everything that some clatter of so called experts produce, whether its colour be green, yellow or white?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the implication in the Minister's remark: it is in the White Paper; therefore, it cannot be contradicted.  If one has a telegraphic service, one must have personnel in the exchanges to receive the telegrams. One must have boys with motor bicycles to deliver the telegrams. Except for the cost of petrol, it is hard to understand how it costs any more to use the service.  If the telegraph service were used ten times more than it is now, I presume it would not be losing, or is it the Minister's argument that it would lose ten times as much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

      <P>I have just come from celebrating the centenary of a school in Dublin run by the Christian Brothers.  When I was in school there, I learned that two and two make four and one and one make two.  That applies to the telegraph service.  There is no need to commit it to a White Paper.  If you learned it in school, it sticks in your memory and in your practice for ever after.  Whatever crisis there is now in the service is due substantially to the fact that the use of it has been declining over the years. It may well be that the service is now over-staffed and over-capitalised <i>vis-àvis</i> its use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shied away from the television and radio service on the ground that he has no day-to-day responsibility for them.  We are grateful for that because, goodness knows, there has been plenty of evidence in <Col N="654" /> recent times of undue interference in television and radio on the part of the members of the Fianna Fáil Government. One of the advantages television can confer is to allow people to see public representatives in friendly argument.  It is a matter of great concern that the benefit of public political discussion is not available on television here because of the selfishness of the Fianna Fáil Party and their reluctance to go on television to meet their opponents.  Any time there is any ballyhoo, in the way of dinners or functions of one kind or another, the television cameras are there, trained on the members of the Government, publicising their words of wisdom, words of wisdom prepared by civil servants who are far more intelligent and experienced than we know the Government members to be.</P>
    <P>This situation means, of course, that we on this side of the House&mdash;we are greater in voting strength than the Fianna Fáil Party are&mdash;are deprived of the opportunity of presenting our views on either television or radio. This is giving a jaundiced impression of the country to the people.  I am quite certain this does not upset either the conscience of the Minister or the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is how they like everything to be, but it is an unhealthy situation at the best of times. When, however, the Press of the country is also substantially under their control and influence, then the situation is a very dangerous one.  I doubt if it will do any good to condemn that here.  I have spoken about this before and, though it goes against my inclination, I shall repeat what I said now: the day will come when there will be a change of Government; when there is that change of Government people may be tempted to follow the example set by Fianna Fáil and act in like manner. If that happens not all the gyrations of the <i>Irish Press</i>, the de Valera family newspaper, will be enough to keep the Party alive.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir, but it does not affect the point except that it makes the matter all the more politically immoral from the point of view of the Fianna Fáil Party conducting television and radio in the manner to which I have already drawn attention.  I have no criticism to offer against most of the political discussions except to say that there are many experienced men in public affairs on this side of the House who are denied any opportunity of presenting their views on either radio or television. That is undesirable.  The situation is a very dangerous one.</P>
      <P>I feel that the proposal to increase postal charges has been in the Minister's mind for some time past.  I think that is the reason why the last of the special issues of fourpenny stamps, the Wolfe Tone issue, is in deep mourning. Presumably the black is worn in mourning for the disappearance of the fourpenny letter postage.  There never was a more depressing or more mournful stamp issued.  The Minister may seek consolation in a letter which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> during the week, written by an Englishman who designs British stamps.  The design is good enough.  The proportions are good, but the printing of a black postage stamp in this day and age indicates, first, that the Department is mourning the disappearance of the fourpenny letter postage and, secondly, that it is incapable of moving with the times.  The small burst of colour last autumn for the Red Cross stamp was apparently too much for it and it is now seeking to atone for its venial sin in lapsing into colour by plunging into deep mourning.  One hopes this recent experience will not be repeated in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, unfortunately, lost the notes I had last week and the Minister will, therefore, be spared more of my wrath. I shall conclude by referring once more to the tree to which I referred in my opening remarks.  The tree was killed because of the activities of the <Col N="656" /> Department of Posts and Telegraphs in four times exposing its roots, then finally taking it up and planting it on a mound of earth, and then planting it once more in a hole.  The tree died. Somehow it seems to be a symbol of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, which seems to be nothing more than deadwood.  That appears to be the main product of the Department.</P>
    <P>The service should be a relatively simple one to operate.  There is available to it a pool of loyal and experienced labour.  Because, however, of bad labour relations and bad management generally, all the skill and all the goodwill of the personnel in the Department are not being properly used.  If there is to be an examination of the possibility of making a profit instead of a loss, the Minister will not go far wrong if, as a first step, he does something to improve labour relations. Having done that, he should then proceed with an examination of possible new sources of revenue such as those I suggested today, making modern telecommunication switchboards and intercoms available to industry and commerce generally. With the continued expansion of business, with the continued amalgamation of existing business, with the growth of modern business in general, there is a vast field of revenue available to any enlightened Department.  The telephone service may have been considered advanced in the 19th century, but it is wholly unsuitable for the second half of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to support the Fine Gael motion and to reject the proposed increases in the postal services.  We regard them as unnecessary, as an indication of the failure of the Minister, his Department, and the Government in general, to make a profit out of the most widely used and largest of the public enterprises, that is, the Post Office.  If the Minister had been able to say they had done everything they could to economise, perhaps we might have found ourselves in a position of being able to agree with him but, on his own confession, that has not been done.  There have been 15 years of pretence.  Now there are promises that <Col N="657" /> something will be done.  That is not good enough in a State enterprise which costs £15 million or £16 million, to run, and is the largest employer of any of the Government Departments. That is why this motion is worthy of support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the approach of the Minister, the Taoiseach, and the Government, is somewhat different from that of the Labour Party to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We have never accepted the view of the Fiann Fáil Government, and we never will, that that Department should be considered as more or less a commercial enterprise. We believe it is a public service, and must be treated as such.</P>
      <P>It is fantastic that the Taoiseach should go on record as suggesting that if we are critical of the increases which are to be imposed on the people, we are opposing the just wages of the employees of the Department.  Everyone knows that such a suggestion is not only unjust, but fantastic.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs plays a large part in the lives of the people, and we believe it must be considered in the same light as the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Local Government, or any other Department of State, and if there is a loss, it must be accepted in the general overall pattern of the public services, and the accountancy of the Central Fund.  This Department provides a service to which the people are entitled.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to delivery charges and to the journeys some local postmen must travel to get to distant areas to deliver letters.  When Deputy Everett was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs there were some parts of rural Ireland which had only a three day a week service.  That was changed and was brought up to a daily service. Why should that not be so?  We in the rural areas will not agree to being considered second-rate citizens.  Whether it is a matter of a Minister of State, a Government, or a service, trying to economise at the expense of the people in those areas, it must be understood that it is a bit late in the day for such an approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> Mention has been made in this Chamber during the past few weeks of the tapping of telephones.  I know nothing about that mystery, but in many parts of Cork county the trouble is that when one dials, if it is automatic, or asks for the number if it is non-automatic, while waiting to get through, one can hear four or five other conversations.  One can hear four or five people discussing their problems or relating their sporting experiences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Sporting experiences&rdquo; is a nice euphemism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not wish to overhear those conversations and it is essential that that problem be checked up on.  Over the past few years when questions were put by Deputies from rural areas, the usual reply was, &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the provision of public telephone kiosks.  That is a pity, but I suppose it is part of the pattern of trying to make the Department a commercial concern.  The people in villages and, indeed, in some towns in Cork county, find themselves without any telephonic communication at night.  It is all very well to say they can go to the home of a person who has a private phone, but that is not always feasible.  The Garda barracks and the local post office are closed at a certain time, and the people are in a very difficult position in the event of illness.  This problem should be reexamined in the light of the serious difficulty that may arise from time to time through illness or fire if there is no kiosk in the neighbourhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The announcers of Telefís Éireann are a credit to the service.  Their approach to their work is very good. The same can be said of Radio Éireann, with the exception of one announcer many years ago.  I suppose television is a more attractive medium now for the news.  Deputy Casey drew attention to the fact&mdash;and, in my opinion, quite rightly&mdash;that some announcers, when speaking in Irish, are inclined to speak rather fast, not realising that it may not be so easy for some people to follow them.  However, that is a matter that could easily be <Col N="659" /> remedied.  I should like to hear a few announcers on the Irish programmes with the Munster blas.  I should like to hear the sound of Ballyvourney Irish. We hear the western, northern, and eastern blas.  Even though most Corkmen take a return ticket, I am sure there are some who could play their part on television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies in general to the <i>compéres</i> of the various shows.  There are, of course, two or, maybe three, exceptions, but on the whole they are very good.  On this I am expressing my own views, but they coincide with the views which many people in my constituency have expressed to me.  Some <i>compéres</i> are inclined to forget that they are being viewed by the public and that the public will judge them.  One <i>compére</i> is inclined to praise people who take up golf and such activities.  I do not want to pick out or name anyone.  While the majority of them are good, there are a few exceptions.  Telefís Éireann is a viewing medium for the public.  It is very important that the people announcing the programmes and the people acting as <i>compéres</i> should, if nothing else, be natural in their approach.  That would help us immensely.</P>
      <P>There is serious complaint about the canned programmes.  I shall not go into details about who may or may not be making money out of it but it would be better if the Minister shortened the number of viewing hours rather than present some of the canned programmes which we must endure. Nobody I think would agree&mdash;certainly not down the country&mdash;that &ldquo;Father Knows Best&rdquo;.  Very often, he does not know what is best at all.  We have not yet got back to some of the old Charlie Chaplin pictures which we saw when we were youngsters.  Perhaps they will come in time.  It is a pity the people have to put up with some of those programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very good talent in Ireland, <Col N="660" /> in the rural areas as well as in the cities, for the presentation of good television programmes.  It may be pointed out that it would involve a certain amount of money but I think most people would be prepared to make sacrifices in some directions and the general attitude would be that it is better to give local talent an opportunity than to have to endure some of the bad shows.  Some television personalities live quite close to Montrose and probably, because of their proximity, we see them quite often but there are many talented persons in other parts of the country who should be given a break.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister has no say in relation to television but he might ask the authorities to spread their wings a bit.  There is more than one parish in Ireland, despite what some people seem to think.  The television authorities should spread their wings a little and help people in the rural areas and also other people who would be a success on television, if given the opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated in his speech on the Budget and the Minister stated when introducing the Vote here that increases will be imposed in respect of postal charges, telephone charges, and so on, because the employees' wages are being brought up to rates comparable with those obtaining in outside employment.  It sounds good.  Naturally, we are in favour of the principle of good wages.  We stated so, when speaking on the Budget.  However, there is one section of employees in the Department who are not getting a wage comparable with outside rates and who are not being treated in the same way as people employed in outside concerns.  I refer to auxiliary postmen.</P>
    <P>It is most unjust for anyone to try to give the impression that the increased wages being given to auxiliary postmen represent part of the cause of the increased postal, telephone and other charges.  A large number of auxiliary postmen work about five hours a day.  I asked the Minister a question yesterday but he had not the information.  However, I have information in so far as it affects these men <Col N="661" /> in Cork.  Some of them start at 7 a.m. and finish at 1 p.m.  Some start at 7.45 a.m. and finish at 2 o'clock.  I do not blame the Minister but I am complaining that the practice still continues. I trust he will consider tackling it, amongst the other problems facing him.  It is a legacy of many years.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that, because these men are part-time, they can have other jobs.  What Minister or Deputy after getting up at 6 a.m., being in the sub-post office at 7 a.m., travelling many miles of rough country and finishing at 1 p.m. or 1.30 p.m., then going home and having something to eat, would feel like tackling another job and making more money out of it?  For a long time these jobs have not been available to these postmen.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to suggest that part-time jobs await such postmen when they return home.  There are men who check up on their letters at about 7.45 a.m., who start on the road at 8 a.m. or 8.15 a.m. and who finish at 2 or 2.15 p.m.  By the time they have eaten a meal, the evening has gone and yet they are considered part-time. There are men who, for six days a week, travel many miles of country. I have no sympathy with any Minister or Government in this respect.  Therefore, the Minister need not think I am picking him out as a target except that the practice still continues.  I know very well what I am speaking about in this matter.</P>
    <P>When there is a check on the time allocated to these part-time postmen &mdash;how many hours per day they are allowed&mdash;it is most extraordinary that, nine times out of ten, the postman has no letters for delivery at the end of his round on that particular occasion.  His route involves a certain mileage but, on that particular day, strange to say, there are no letters for the people living farthest away and to whom the postman has to deliver post.  I wonder if a little check-up is done in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere before these gentlemen decide to go out and at all costs keep the part-time postmen to the minimum number of hours.  Naturally enough, it pays in the Department to <Col N="662" /> adopt that policy, at the expense of the auxiliary postman.</P>
    <P>If an auxiliary postman has not 30 hours in the week as part-time postman, he is not covered by the month's sick pay.  If he has 29½ hours in the week, working six days in the week, he is not covered for sick pay.  Furthermore, when he is eight years in employment as part-time postman, he comes to his maximum and whether his service thereafter happens to be nine years or 49 years, he will get no further increases except those which the union may fight for and the general increases that may come up in employment rates.  There is no question of any form of bonus for him after 15, 20 or 25 years' service.  What it means is the postman keeps going until he is 70.  In certain circumstances they are allowed to continue a little longer.  Then they must retire.  At the mercy of those in charge, they receive only a miserable gratuity.</P>
    <P>That is not fair or just.  If they work five hours a day, there is no question of their taking a second job in the time left.  It must be remembered that local authority workers in Cork and elsewhere have a five-day week and the benefit of a pension scheme.  They may work 40 or 42 hours a week but it is a five-day week.  A postman cannot have Saturday to himself.  The local authority workers have a pension scheme and get the contributory old age pension at 70.  They can retire at 65, but the auxiliary or part-time postman must keep going until he is 70 to get the contributory old age pension. Aside from suggestions that the rural postman is part of the cause of increased charges&mdash;through giving him increases&mdash;it is about time these postmen were treated as human beings.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, if necessary, have the situation examined by a committee to see why postmen should not get the benefits their fellow workers get in local authorities.  Why not admit that the number of part-time postmen working five hours a day who can get alternative employment in the evenings is very small?  It is claimed that one or two may get such employment, and this may happen in isolated cases and a very few postmen may own a small <Col N="663" /> shop or be in a position to make money in some other way.  Because this happens in a few cases, it should not be maintained that they are all in the same position.  The majority cannot be treated on the basis of the one or two men in a county, perhaps, who have a second source of income.  I ask the Minister to have this matter examined.</P>
    <P>The recent wage increase agreement stipulated a minimum of £1 increase. The Minister may say that did not relate to part-timers, as he may wish to term the rural postmen.  They are not, in fact, part-time.  A large number of them did not get the minimum increase. I am not suggesting the Minister withheld it but I know from conversations with many of them, some have got over £1, many have got well under it and some got less than 14/-. This is based on the number of hours. I know men working five or five-and-a-half hours a day who have not got an increase of £1.  There is nothing in the wage agreement to prevent the Department from giving these men the minimum increase of £1.</P>
    <P>Whatever we say about television we can get on without it.  The higher civil servants are able to provide for themselves&mdash;and good luck to them&mdash; but it is time we recognised the importance of the rural postmen.  It is true that by going from house to house, they may share a meal and may exchange local gossip, keeping the neighbourhood cheerful, because they are clever enough to avoid anything that would lead to friction.  This makes them important people in the parish and that cannot be denied.  Unfortunately, that is forgotten when it is a question of deciding on a just wage for them.</P>
    <P>I know there is a move on now to introduce vans in many areas in the country for delivery of letters.  That sounds good.  The people will get their letters so much earlier but, if they do get letters five or ten minutes earlier, will it make a lot of difference? This will be at the expense of the employment of the local postmen.  I should like the Minister to check the cost of running the vans.  He should <Col N="664" /> realise that many of these postmen, so-called part-time, do four or five hours in the morning and come back in the evenings to do a collection-delivery service.  That ties them up completely for the day.  They should enjoy the same rights as those in comparable employment in local authorities. It is time they got a fair deal and the sooner we give it the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Desmond tells the House is news to me. I do not know why we have not given the £1 minimum to every class of postman. If as the Taoiseach claims, the Post Office seeks to be a commercial institution, then it should meet commercial obligations.  I do not believe the Post Office is making a set on part-time postmen by abstracting long distance letters on days of inspection any more than I believe as a deliberate policy they started out to destroy Deputy Ryan's trees.</P>
      <P>The Post Office is an old-fashioned institution marking the time when the State first went into business.  The quill pen atmosphere surrounds the Post Office everywhere.  All post offices here are temples of efficiency compared with the average French post office. But the Post Office is an inheritance from the 19th century and there is a slight aura of Dickens and Trollope surrounding the service.  That tends to defeat any effort at streamlining it and making it commercial in the sense of the 1960s.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Ryan has not, I think a proper conception of historical continuity because venerable institutions like the Post Office cannot move into contemporary conduct of their affairs overnight.  Reasonably good efforts now being made enormously to expand the telephone service have moved more quickly than I had hoped and I trust that other sectors of the service will move into the 1960s atmosphere reasonably soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Department could not hope to escape the effects of inflation.  Where we employ human beings and buy materials, we shall have to pay more and the bill goes up. <Col N="665" /> If the cost of running the State doubles in ten years, as it has done, we cannot expect the Department to remain outside the pattern.  There is a danger, I think, that the ordinary commercial practice of recovering increased costs from the consumer may not work in this case.  It may not produce a 100 per cent recovery of costs in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because I am certain that the law of diminishing returns will operate and the volume of partaking of the service that is available will decline.</P>
    <P>Postal charges are a very serious consideration for business people.  They are also quite serious for the ordinary citizen.  The postal bill for those engaged in business is a very hefty one. The tendency will be to economise and cut out on the unnecessary, slightly decorative or less immediate form of correspondence.  There is no doubt that the percentage increase from 3d to 4d two years ago&mdash;was it two years ago?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is now increased to 5d.  These increases are much greater than the percentages that would be warranted by any increase in wages, and such like, which other institutions have to contend with.  The result will be that there will be an economy in the use of the postal services.  I wonder has the Minister considered the effect of, say, only a ten per cent decrease in the use of postage stamps?  Of course, the same thing applies to telephones. Casual telephoning will cease and will be done without.</P>
      <P>As I said last week, on the Budget, I think the telegram will become a museum exhibit.  In fact I can quite see the end of the telegram system of communication.  Throughout many years of my life it has been regarded as a sickly bird.  The coming of the telephone has hastened its decline. I think the Minister is just getting out the chopper to finish it off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody would grumble at the proposal to spend £6 million on capital expenditure on the telephones if it meant an expansion of the existing services because the telephone network <Col N="666" /> up to ten or 15 years ago belonged to the early years of the century.  That network was sufficient for the early part and all through the middle of my life.  Now that the telephone has become such an important means of communication, it is obvious that the network which existed could not deal with the demands made on it.  The people of Ireland have now become telephone-minded.  If our networks are insufficient, we must pay up for the considerable disorganisation if new networks are being established all over the country.  I hope that what is being done will prove sufficient to deal with any possible expansion of our needs in the next few decades.</P>
    <P>I have not the same complaint as other Deputies seem to have about inefficiencies in the telephone service.  I can understand that breakdowns will occur in mechanical equipment of that kind and I assume that, because the main trunk line and the through dialling process are newly installed, these are teething troubles and we have to put up with them.</P>
    <P>Last week I had occasion to make a telephone call to Italy.  I did so with trepidation because I felt that the pronouncing of the Italian numerals was going to give me trouble.  I was astonished to get an operator on the exchange when I got on to Rome who spoke very fluent English and who put me at ease at once.  I wonder how the situation would have operated in reverse or whether we provide a translation or linguistic service for foreigners when they telephone this country?</P>
    <P>I was glad to learn from Deputy Noel Lemass's question yesterday that new plant has been acquired for the purpose of manufacturing and printing our stamps.  I am sure Deputy Noel Lemass was not inspired by the Holy Ghost to ask this question but I am glad to know that it is so and we can proceed to improve our stamps.  The printing of our stamps has annoyed me for 35 years.  When we were in office, I kept pressing our side of the House to do something with the printing of the stamps which we send all over the world.  I am glad the Minister has taken positive steps to do something <Col N="667" /> about it and that he has appointed an excellent committee, who are very competent, to provide us with a series of postage and franking stamps we could all be proud of.  I wonder have the committee made any proposals yet?</P>

      <P>I should love to see the time come when we put an end to the dreary look to which we have all become accustomed of our stamps.  A great number of interests, not the least of them the tourist trade, would be served by this, particularly because the work which other countries have done in this regard has been an advantage. I am sure, with the advice of the body which the Minister has set up, only first-class people will be called upon to work on designing our stamps.  I do not agree with what my colleague, Deputy Ryan, said about the Wolfe Tone stamp.  It was an excellent stamp. I do not think it is any harm to say we disagree fairly about things we disagree on.</P>
      <P>I am now moving into an area outside the Minister's normal control, but this is the only time of the year we can talk about the broadcasting service and the television service.  I will deal with the television service first.  I must confess quite frankly that when the Minister entered the Seanad some years ago, when I was a member of that House, with his Television Bill, I had no hope that the progress which has been made would be as good as it has been.  I want to congratulate the Minister, his advisers and the officers of the television service.  I think it is only fair to say that.  The verdict must be that Telefís Éireann has been very successful and has been a very useful addition to Irish life.  I believe the advent of the new Director is reflected in the programmes.  The programmes are very enlightening: there are very gratifying surprises in them and they are very closely related to the ordinary life of our people.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Kyne is enamoured of &ldquo;Mr. Ed&rdquo; I am not. Deputy Kyne will find himself in very grave disagreement with his colleague, Deputy Desmond, who has just spoken. about other programmes.  If we do not like the programmes, we can switch them off.  When you come to the end of the day, there is nobody who has not got one or two hours' good entertainment for his licence fee.  I must say I got very good value ten days ago in the Eurovision relay of Hamlet.</P>

      <P>The main thing is that a switch is very easy to operate and if you do not like the programme you can switch it off.  One will always get something one likes during the week.  &ldquo;Mr. Ed&rdquo; is not one of my favourite programmes.  We must have canned programmes.  We are doing very much more than any of us hoped would be done.  If I were to ask the Minister to give any advice to the Committee in charge of broadcasting, I would say that they should put on a bit more about travel, the arts, about people living elsewhere in the world and a bit of history.  Of course, we should keep a bit of Bat Masterson, too.  Personally, I like him, when I see him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that the work which we initiate ourselves here, the discussions which take place, sometimes on extremely contentious matters, on the whole are very well done and it is no harm to say it.  In fact, they are irritatingly well done sometimes.  The Irish material is very good.  I do not know if when particularly good programmes have been made, for instance, these solo programmes by Irish artistes, they are filmed or not.  If they are filmed, are they sold elsewhere?  They would have excellent selling qualities wherever the English language is <Col N="669" /> spoken.  These young people on the Irish stage who provide an hour's entertainment each week have a very high standard and this would be a profitable thing for the Authority to do and it would also indicate to the rest of the world the high standard of Irish broadcasting.  It would also be a great help to the young artistes who take part.  The whole thing deserves commendation.  It has proved that the Irish have an ability to entertain seriously and less seriously.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with any of my colleagues who think that there is any political bias in the station.  I believe that those who man Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann are composed of roughly the same proportion of political beliefs as you would find elsewhere and that they suppress them quite well.  The sound radio, of course, is the Cinderella of the service nowadays. The VHF broadcasting is going to be a very useful development not only because of its efficiency in giving a signal to places which are now getting a very bad signal, but because of the quality and sound of the broadcasts. It will lead to an enormous improvement in the broadcasting of musical programmes.  It must be quite clear, unless I am wrong in this, that considerable adjustments will have to be made to radio sets so that they will receive VHF.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should indicate how much this is likely to cost the average radio owner.  Before this comes into operation&mdash;I understand that it will be a year before we are broadcasting &mdash; the producers should be contacted so that reasonable costs for converting radio sets would be arrived at.  The makers of these articles have done well in the last few years.  Now that the first bonanza in regard to the supply of television sets has probably petered out the arrival of VHF will probably provide them with another market and we should ensure that they will convert existing sets at a reasonable price.  The person who lives in the remote area where reception has been bad deserves to be looked after by us so that we will <Col N="670" /> ensure that because he lives in a far away place he will not be burdened with very great cost.</P>
      <P>I want to speak now about another department and curiously enough the Minister is the only Minister to whom I can address these remarks.  I want to refer to the growth of interest in symphonic music.  In a very curious Irish way, we set about doing what most countries do&mdash;maintaining a symphony orchestra.  We did it through the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. This is a small country and probably that was the only way we could do it. We were fortunate that in such circumstances the head of the Minister's Department was a man of very wide culture.  He saw an opportunity for building up an Irish symphony orchestra which would serve the Irish broadcasting system, something without which we were a little bit less than other civilised countries.  Thus the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra was started.</P>
      <P>It had two notable conductors, particularly its present conductor, Tibor Paul.  This has become an orchestra of international quality and one in which we can all take pride.  It has led to a very large growth of interest in good music, helped by broadcasting and the long-playing record.  The fact that we had an Irish Symphony Orchestra to play for us, and not alone to hear it playing through records or on the radio, but to see the orchestra in various parts of the country, enriched our lives and provided something in which we had been lagging behind.</P>
      <P>Tibor Paul has shaped this into a splendid orchestra and we are very lucky.  In this regard Dublin is particularly lucky.  I do not want to be parochial about this but we should hear this orchestra much more frequently outside Dublin.  All the people support the orchestra and all the people should share in the pleasure not alone of hearing it but of seeing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The season before last the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra gave six performances in Cork and all seats were filled for every performance.  This season the programme declined to four performances.  I went to see the <Col N="671" /> Director-General.  He is sympathetic but he is hindered by administrative and financial considerations.  I agree that the expenditure on music is very substantial for a small country and we cannot fairly ask for more but, if the Minister examines the number of appearances of the orchestra in Dublin over the year and compares it with the number elsewhere, he will notice a most unreasonable imbalance.</P>
    <P>I know that pleading the cause of good music is unrewarding because more people dislike good music than like it.  Perhaps I should say more people do not know how richly rewarding good music is.  The process of education is slow and the occasional appearance of the orchestra in other centres outside Dublin would help enormously to stimulate interest in fine music.  I know that the Minister, since he became Minister, has become quite a keen concert goer.  He knows how much this adds to the richness of life and I would ask him to encourage an appreciation of music amongst the people, to convey his enthusiasm to the head of the Department who should pass it on to the Broadcasting Authority so that performances will be enjoyed by people who do not live in Dublin.  I want to thank the Minister for the many courtesies he has extended to me since last I spoke on this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Until a few years ago, the office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was considered something of a sinecure.  The Minister did not have to work very hard and it was one of the offices to which the less ambitious members of the successful political Party aspired to.  However, over the past few years, the position has changed and now the office is one of very great importance.  Let me say that my colleague from County Meath is filling the office in a very expert way. His task has been a difficult one.  While I disagree with him on matters in other spheres which are too numerous to mention, I must say that as Minister he is entitled to the tribute that he is doing an excellent job and doing it in a way in which the general public <Col N="672" /> realise that a difficult job is being well done.</P>
      <P>The staff of the Post Office and of the Department in general are people very many of whom come in contact with the public, the people who live in this country and tourists who come here, and it is very important that people who work in public offices such as those should create the right impression. Again, I am glad to say that that is being done.  Whether it is somebody behind the counter in a post office, somebody delivering letters or somebody at a telephone switch, we get nothing but courtesy from them.  It is only right that this fact should be placed on record.  Last week I dialled a number in Dundalk and got an answer from Monaghan where there is no dial phone.  These things happen sometimes but, when I explained the matter to the supervisor, she was most courteous and made the necessary adjustments immediately.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the Post Office staffs must be paid the proper rate for the job they are doing, from the Minister right down.  It is too bad that at this stage we should find people having to make a desperate effort to have their rates of pay adjusted so that they will be comparable with rates in outside employments.  We are glad that agreement has been reached with most of the Post Office staffs, the clerks in particular, and the subpostmasters who had to go further than some people thought they should have gone to get that to which they were justly entitled. I hope that the years will not now be allowed to drag on before further adjustments are made.  May we ask whatever Minister may be in charge to ensure that, as outside employments increase their rates, the same will apply to Post Office employees and that these people will not have to spend years looking for increases to bring them up?  In the intervening period, there is a big loss of hard cash to the people concerned, money which they should have got and which they did not get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when speaking on the Budget, took me to task and posed the question to me if I objected to the increases where these people <Col N="673" /> were concerned and were the Labour Party not prepared to agree to the money for them being found.  The Taoiseach is well aware that the Labour Party are elected here, in the main, for the purpose of watching the interests of the workers and we do just that.  What we will not agree to, and what I think the Minister is foolish to agree to, is the attempt that is now being made to say that the Post Office must show a profit, that it must pay its way and must be run as a commercial concern while every other Department of State can win or lose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not know that that is the policy of the Labour Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not try to tell me what the policy of the Labour Party is.  I have been complimentary to him and I do not want to go into his political ideas because I might not be so complimentary about them.  We are satisfied that the people employed by the Post Office, including the Minister, should be paid the rate for the job but what we will not agree to is that the Minister should come to the House and say that postmen, subpostmasters or clerks can have the finger pointed at them by the general public and be told that they are the people responsible for the higher charges.  That is a stupid, ridiculous argument and should never have been made by either the Taoiseach or the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister studies that argument, he must realise that if he follows it to its logical conclusion, it means that in a couple of years' time, if it is proved that the Post Office cannot pay its way, he will find himself in the position that he will either have to come to the House to look for a subsidy or lay off staff.  Should we have to reduce services to which the people are entitled because the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on its own is not paying its way?  This is a service to which the people of any civilised community are entitled and if the Minister wants money to pay the Post Office staff, we will support him in finding that money, but we will <Col N="674" /> not agree that these people should be held up to ransom and told that, unless they pay their way, they are out.</P>
    <P>Some of the most extraordinary things have happened in the Post Office in the last few years and in the case which I am going to mention perhaps I am taking the Minister to task for something for which he is not responsible.  I want to refer to the case of an auxiliary postman in the town of Monaghan who has been employed as a part-time postman there for four years.  There was an examination for permanent postmen which was open to part-time postmen and this particular postman sat for that examination, getting seventh place in the whole country.  He is a man of excellent character and health and was notified that he had got seventh place.  He was then notified that he could not be appointed.  There was no explanation.  Every effort made by way of question in this House has failed to elicit any reason for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not notify him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He was notified by the Appointments Commission that he had got seventh place.  The Minister is the Minister responsible for the Department and this man has been an employee of the Department for four years and was most satisfactory in his service.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the right in this or in any other case where employees of the Post Office are concerned to have the necessary inquiries made as to why a man who is excellent at his job and who has been doing that job for four years should be debarred from it by a certain body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has not got that right, the sooner he gets it the better for everybody concerned.  This <Col N="675" /> is a scandalous situation which reflects no credit on anyone.  Let me go further &mdash;this is where the Minister does come in&mdash;if my information is correct, it is quite on the cards that within the next ten weeks the temporary employment that this man has had for four years will terminate.  If that is so, the man will be out of a job and if he is out of a job because the Post Office will not employ him on a permanent basis, for some reason which somebody who is responsible for the employment knows, that man, who is married with family responsibilities, will be unable to find other employment. I do not care what Minister or what person is responsible for this situation but I would ask the Minister to do whatever he can to have this matter straightened out.  I am quite sure the Minister is as interested in it as I am.  I raise it mainly because I want to give the Minister an opportunity of pursuing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If somebody refuses to allow the Minister to employ a man who has been four years temporarily employed and who has an excellent record, as the Minister knows&mdash;his character, health and general work have been excellent &mdash; the Minister should find out why this is being done. I do not propose to say any more about it now.  The Minister should pursue the matter much further than it has been pursued so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of auxiliary postmen generally and the still scandalous situation, Deputy Desmond has referred to their pay and conditions.  I was a party to the negotiations for the ninth round of wage increase.  There were only three clauses in the recommendation. <Col N="676" /> One referred to male adults, who were to get 12 per cent with a floor of £1.  The second clause referred to females and juveniles, who were to get 12 per cent.  There was no question whatever, nor was there any recommendation, that auxiliary postmen employed by the Post Office should not get the floor of £1 but should, in fact, get 12 per cent.  The reason the floor of £1 was put in was specifically to protect the lower paid worker who, if that were not put in, would find himself receiving 12/-. 13/-or 14/- by way of increase, or perhaps less.  The Post Office took advantage of that and are, in fact, paying these people the 12/-, 13/- or 14/- instead of the floor of £1.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say that they are part-time people but in view of the fact that in the city areas the 40-hour week is commonplace and even in country districts the five-day, 45-hour week is commonplace, it is ridiculous to suggest that a person who works five or six hours per day for six days of the week is in part-time employment.  There is no reason why the Minister or his Department should try to wangle out of it by saying that these people are only part-time employees and are, therefore, not entitled to the floor of £1.  I say they are entitled to it and I would ask the Minister at this stage, before the matter goes too far, to have the whole thing reconsidered.  The rate at which these men are paid is a scandalous rate for the job they are doing.  If the employment position improves, the stage will eventually be reached when it will be impossible to find people who will be prepared to work for the Post Office in this job.  It would be a terrible thing if that were to happen.</P>
    <P>The persons concerned are a good type.  Most of them are excellent people.  Deputy Desmond put it rather neatly: they are the public face of the Post Office.  They are the people who go from house to house.  They meet the people.  If they are the right type, as most of them are, they give a good impression.  It is rather a pity that these are the people that the Department has decided should be <Col N="677" /> the Cinderellas and should be paid much less than anybody else.  I am sure the Minister realises that with the ninth round wage increase applied to everybody else, and a miserly 12 per cent applied to rural postmen, the rate looks much worse than it was a few months ago.  Perhaps the Minister will do something about it if he possibly can?</P>
    <P>The question of superannuation or pension schemes has been mentioned. There is nothing so depressing as to meet some of these people who have been 30 or 40 years in Post Office employment who want to tell one that they are nearing retirement age and consider it terribly unfair that after all their service they are not entitled to any type of pension.  In many cases they are not looking for a great deal. If they got a little they would be satisfied, something which, added to the old age pension, would enable them to live.  It is depressing to see some unfortunate old man who has been tramping around the country for 40 years retiring and getting nothing but a small paragraph in the paper indicating how many millions of miles he has walked on behalf of the Post Office.</P>
    <P>It is wrong in this day and age that that should happen.  I know the Minister has the interests of these people at heart.  He should have the courage to make the necessary arrangements in which these people would be included. Somebody has to make the break.  It may be said that it has not been done up to now and, therefore, why should it be done now.  It has to be done some time and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>Last year, or the year before, I referred, as did many other Deputies, to the question of the uniform worn by postmen.  Again, may I appeal to the Minister to have something done about the shapeless mess handed to rural postmen?  How they manage to appear neat and dapper in it, as some of them do, defies understanding.  It should be possible to have adjustments made in material and tailoring so that the uniform will show to better advantage. I have noticed that several young fellows who, for some reason or other, decided to join the Post Office staff at <Col N="678" /> that level, find it extremely difficult to cut any kind of figure in the type of uniform they get.  It would appear as if all the uniforms were made from one model and that the model was not too well made.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of regulations governing postmen.  The Minister has relaxed some of them.  I refer to the regulation about the use of motorcycles by postmen, smoking on duty, the wearing of a cap.  All these regulations should be brought up to date.  The Minister is the sort of person who can do so and should be prepared to do so.  These regulations are irritating rules which have remained for a number of years because nobody has bothered to do anything about them.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the stamp.  Two opinions were expressed. Deputy Ryan thought the Wolfe Tone stamp was bad and Deputy Barry thought it was excellent.  I do not claim to have the same taste as Deputy Barry but I cannot understand how anybody could consider that the stamp could do honour to Wolfe Tone or anybody else.  I think it was a mistake to issue the stamp if that was the best that could be produced.  I am glad to know that an effort is being made to get the necessary machinery for the production of more colourful stamps but the Minister should have waited for another few weeks and should have issued this stamp as the first 5d because it would about represent what the general public feel about that increase in postal charges.</P>
    <P>With reference to the increases for postal services, I think they have been far too steep.  They are based on the theory that, according to the Minister, the Post Office must pay its way.  If the Minister had considered for a few moments the hardship that would be imposed on people, particularly charitable organisations, who do a lot of their work by post, he would have realised that the imposts are very heavy.  There are two important points to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  One is the increase in the cost of sending a small parcel from 1/3 to 2/-.  I do not know where the idea came from but the increase <Col N="679" /> is out of all proportion.  It is the one increase that sticks most in the minds of the ordinary people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The second point is the increase in the telegraph charges.  Perhaps the higher charges for the telephone will be overlooked but it is true to say that the news of increased telegraph charges had quite an impact on the general public.  It may be said telegrams are going out of date and, with the growth of the use of the telephone, people will not use telegrams at all.  I do not agree.  For my business, I use the telegram very much because I find it to be an efficient way of getting in contact with people in the heart of the country who could not be contacted in any other way.  I am talking about people not sufficiently well off to have telephones and people who, even in improved circumstances, are at the bottom of the list.</P>
    <P>I regard 5d a word for telegraphic messages as quite an expensive way of contacting people.  In this case the Minister will surely find that he is putting a burden on people who cannot afford it.  Country dwellers who have not got telephones or access to them are being doubly charged now because they have not got telephones. The Minister should have another look at this charge which, I believe, will have two results.  I do not think it will bring in the revenue the Minister expects from it and it will most certainly cut down the use of the telegraphic service in the country.</P>
    <P>The increased charges on money orders will also fail to bring in the extra revenue the Minister hopes for. They will reduce considerably the number of money orders purchased and I suggest to the Minister that this will defeat the purpose of the new terms.  A modest increase might have been all right, and the Minister should reconsider the whole matter, even though it is only a few short weeks before the new charges are scheduled to come into effect.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister, and discussed with one of his officials, the possibility of taking down overhead <Col N="680" /> telephone lines which are not being used because of the installation of underground cables.  The Post Office staff have been making an excellent job of this.  It helps to beautify the country, but it looks a bit ridiculous when, if somebody in a road gets a connection, a 35-foot pole is erected right outside the door, stark naked.  Is there no other way of making a connection without leaving this monstrosity?  Surely, modern engineering could devise some other system.  If several people in a row get a connection, it seems necessary still to have one of these poles erected outside each gate.  I apparently did not make my point clear to the Departmental official to whom I spoke.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the efforts he is making to improve the telephone trunk line system.  Those awaiting telephones have been complaining&mdash;I have been relaying some of these complaints.  I appreciate we must have more trunk lines before we can have more local installations. We can see from the activity that an effort is being made to catch up and I hope this will have the effect of easing the position of people who have been awaiting telephones for a long time, particularly business people.</P>
    <P>I am told that quite a number of minor breakdowns, and at least one major breakdown, have been caused by leakage of water to the underground cables.  This may be a technical matter about which the Minister may know as little as I do, but if it is a question of the underground cable being put out of action by water, surely an effort should be made before the cable is laid to give all possible protection to it. It was bad enough to have single overhead lines blown down by the wind but the breakdown of all lines through water damage could lead to chaos.</P>
    <P>During the last Christmas period there was a tremendous volume of traffic through the Post Office.  It was handled in an excellent way and I submit that nobody can appreciate fully what the Post Office staffs did at that time to ensure that all got their mail in time.  Mistakes do occur, particularly where Christmas parcels are concerned, but last year these were at <Col N="681" /> a minimum and the staffs deserve our heartiest congratulations.</P>
    <P>I should like now to go on to our television and radio sections.  I agree fully with other Deputies who have said that the Irish television service is giving us much greater satisfaction than many of us expected.  The number of television programmes which members of the House can see is very limited but most of those I am able to look at are very enjoyable.  I regard Telefís Éireann programmes as being first-rate. I do not agree with people who decry the lighter type of production, whether it is canned American or not. I am a great believer in the saying that a little nonsense now and then does us all a little good.</P>
    <P>I suggest that an occasional light programme on either television or radio is something to which we should all pay attention because I honestly believe we get enough of the sordid details in real life, here and outside, without having to sit down and watch the same sort of stuff all over again. The light programmes being broadcast on both radio and television are not doing a bit of harm.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the outside broadcasts by Telefís Éireann are the finest of the lot.  The Authority are lucky in the fact that the programmes most people wish to see&mdash;racing, hurling or football&mdash;lend themselves so well to television presentation.  I should like to tell the Minister at this point that he is mistaken when he says that the Government's responsibility in regard to interference is limited to our own programmes and does not apply to interference with what we call foreign stations&mdash;transmissions from the Six Counties and Britain.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made by the Government to stop all interference, and I submit that the strictest regulations should be provided to do this.  In this respect, I find it reprehensible, if it is fact, that the Telefís Éireann station is so sited that it will interfere with or jam other stations.  That should not be allowed in any circumstances and the Minister should make every effort to see that those who pay £5 to <Col N="682" /> the State for the right to own television sets will get interference-free reception.</P>
    <P>Now I shall point out one or two of the things I think are wrong with Telefís Éireann.  Occasionally guests are invited to appear on some of our live shows.  On these shows, people are allowed to make the most extraordinary statements to the embarrassment of others appearing with them. On occasion, regular members of a panel have asked a guest what I consider impertinent questions. These shows should be treated in a different way because I feel that sometimes they go too far.  On occasion, some of our very excellent <i>compéres</i> have been extremely embarrassed by some of the panel, occasionally by some of the guests, or by some of the audience.  An effort should be made to cut out that sort of thing.  It does not do Telefís Éireann any good. It does not do anybody any good. Occasionally people make remarks on television about the unification of Ireland solely because they think it is the popular thing to do.  Would these people, who know nothing about Irish politics or the Irish nation, keep their opinions to their own family circles where, apparently, they can get away with that kind of thing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I can switch off if I want to but, if I am listening to a good programme, I do not want that programme to be spoiled by someone making stupid remarks about something he knows nothing about.  That is fair comment.</P>
      <P>I think Radio Éireann gives a wonderful service.  I drive a great deal&mdash;some people say I sleep in my car&mdash;and I have a radio in the car. I listen a great deal to Radio Éireann. One complaint I have to make is that people who attend the programmes seem to think they should clap everything. One gets two minutes entertainment and three minutes clapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Barry with regard to music.  I think there is too much highbrow music.  Possibly people will be educated in time to <Col N="683" /> appreciate such music, but, until they are, I cannot understand why there should be so much highbrow music. My idea of good music and Deputy Barry's are quite different.  I agree that if people want to hear the type of music he wants, they are entitled to have it, but the proportion of time given to it ought not to be as great as it is.  That is my only complaint against Radio Éireann, apart from the fact that the licence is 25/-.  An effort should be made to find out what the listening public want.  If they want a great deal of highbrow music, then they should have it, but I do not think a Gallup poll will indicate that that is the position.  I appeal to Radio Éireann to cut down on the highbrow music.</P>
    <P>There is another point on which I disagree with speakers here.  I believe, as many people know, that we should try to preserve the language.  At the same time, we should appreciate the fact that the majority of our people are not fluent Irish speakers.  It is most unfair that news items at certain periods should be broadcast solely in Irish.  There is nothing more ridiculous than Telefís Éireann covering a match in Croke Park, with a dozen people sitting around.  There is a transistor radio with the sound turned up while the television is turned down. Could we not stop making fools of ourselves?  If the programme is for general consumption, why not give it in the language understood by the majority of the people?  We do no good to the language or its preservation with the kind of carry-on to which I refer.  I trust the Minister will use whatever influence he has to put an end to it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that there are no politics in Telefís or Radio Éireann.  I grant you the position is improving.  I am sorry the Minister is not here at the moment because I want to draw his attention to one particular incident.  Both he and I were very embarrassed.  There was a recording of a function we both attended. The Minister and his party were carefully recorded.  Then the operator tied <Col N="684" /> up his little box and started to move off.  Someone belonging to this side of the House came on the scene and the Minister had to call the operator back and direct him to take a recording of the remainder of the statements.  It was very embarrassing.  It was also a waste of time because all that was used subsequently was the recording of the Minister's side of the House.  I was sorry the Minister found himself in that embarrassing position.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of thing which provides people with the opportunity for saying there are more politics than there should be in Telefís and Radio Éireann.  I believe that the situation is improving, though there are some news readers who still think that, if a Minister coughs down in some remote part of the country, that must be announced before the world news.  However, we are gradually reaching the stage where things are levelling off and it is generally accepted everyone is entitled to a fair deal on radio and television.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his Estimate. It shows a progressive trend.  It shows his officials are grappling with the problems thrown up by economic progress, particularly in relation to the provision of telephone services.  I appreciate there are difficulties in providing such a service all over the country. The Minister has pointed out that the policy of his Department is to ensure an adequate trunk line service first and, following on that, the linking up of subscribers.</P>
      <P>In relation to Dublin city, and Dublin north-east in particular, it is very hard to convince people on the waiting list as to why they have to wait. I do not know if there is any technical explanation but a considerable time elapses before an applicant is serviced, notwithstanding the fact that his neighbours have been enjoying a telephone service for some considerable time. Perhaps the Minister would deal with that matter when he comes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the increased postal charges.  These are inevitable and the public realise and are resigned to the fact that these services cannot be provided unless <Col N="685" /> they are charged for.  The Minister mentioned that his Estimate provides for a staff of 18,000.  His must be the largest Department in the State and the charges made for the services provided must cover the wages and salaries of this huge staff.  I am sure the public appreciate that.  While I say that, I find it hard to reconcile the scale of charges that has been determined. I find it hard to reconcile the fact that if I post a letter to a man a mile away, it costs me 5d and if I post a letter to a person in Cork or Donegal it costs me the same amount. I do not know whether the Minister could see his way to vary the charges. Perhaps it would be more equitable if a graded scale of postal charges were introduced, depending on the destination and the distance involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the programmes transmitted by Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.  I join with other speakers in congratulating both services on their programmes. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to view the television programmes or listen to the radio programmes very often because of the nature of my other duties.  It has been suggested to me that programmes are broadcast by Radio Éireann which could be televised. Some of those programmes have a high entertainment value.  There is also scope for televising some of our dramas, but apparently it is the policy of those in charge that they should be reserved solely for the radio programmes. That is a pity because we have some fine actors engaged in the sound programmes whose services should be utilised for the television programmes.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed that Telefís Éireann lost the services of their first drama director, Hilton Edwards, who has done so much to foster drama here in the City of Dublin.  I was told the reason he left that position was that he was not given enough scope for his abilities.  It was suggested to me that he was doing nothing. I do not know because I am not in a position to find out, but I do not believe that any number of dramas were televised for which he was responsible.  It has also been suggested <Col N="686" /> to me that another disturbing feature is the number of people associated with Telefís Éireann in executive positions who are leaving that organisation and no reasons are given. I do not know whether the Minister can deal with this point in his reply, but it suggests dissatisfaction or some other reasons of which the public should be made aware.</P>
    <P>In discussing this Estimate a year or so ago, I referred to the Savings Bank service.  It is gratifying to know that the amounts deposited have reached a new record of £100 million. When this matter was being discussed before, I asked the Minister to consider amending the regulations relating to the withdrawal of deposits. Depositors are required to give some notice before they can withdraw a sum exceeding, I think, £30.  Emergencies can occur and a person can be prevented from quickly withdrawing the amount he seeks.  The Minister should examine that aspect of the Post Office Savings Bank and see if some improvement could be made in the service.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that it is proposed to erect more sorting offices to meet the developing needs of the city, particularly in Raheny and North Dublin. The Minister and his officials should keep constantly in mind the necessity for providing adequate posting boxes. Now that so many new houses are being built and new communities developed, it is a fundamental requirement that they should be provided. The posting boxes which were recessed in walls in rural districts years ago, particularly in areas fringing Dublin county, should be replaced by bigger collection boxes.</P>
    <P>I should like to add my word of praise for the Minister, the officials of the Department, and the postmen who man the services they provide.  They are efficient and courteous services for our citizens.</P>

      <P>Now that they have had their bit of hanky-panky business, I will carry on.  Any reasonable person will accept these increases because the Department is being asked to hand out approximately £2 million extra, because of increased wages and improved services.  Reasonable persons would expect increases, unless they can tell us they know a big hole where the £2 million can be got.  I do not like the increases, and the people who are being charged extra do not like them. None of us likes them.  We all have a greedy nature in that way.  We like more, but we do not like anything to be taken away.  A millionaire would like £2 million, and an old age pensioner would like an extra £1.  Everyone would like something extra.  One person says it should be taken from the other fellow, and the other fellow says it should be taken from another fellow, and so on.  I do not know who the other fellow is in the end.  No one wants to pay.  Let us come back to reason.  I expected that there would be increases.</P>
      <P>A statement has been made that the Department should not act like a commercial concern and pay for itself.  In that case, the Exchequer would have to pay the £2 million, and the Exchequer would have to get that £2 million by increased taxation, so it makes no difference.  There would have to be increases in taxation to get the money. Any reasonable person would accept that, but, as I said, politicians are not reasonable.</P>

      <P>In fact, in no case now or in the past have the opposition ever stated who should pay.  They take the view &ldquo;Man has a greedy streak in his nature.  He does not like to pay.  Let us appeal to that low streak in his nature.&rdquo; That is hanky-panky.  There may be people with a chumpy mentality outside but there are not chumpy people in here.  However, like some madness, there is method in it and they have their own reason for that method.</P>
      <P>If the Department were not to pay its way, then the recent taxation we have heard about would have to be £9 million instead of £7 million.  There is no big hole and the money has to be got.  The money was got in the recent Budget, in practically every case, to pay increased wages.  The result is that people at large have a better standard of living.  Criticise what you like, the fact is that the working people are the people who benefit as a result of whatever action the Government took in the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crotty moved to refer back this Vote.  At the beginning of his <Col N="690" /> speech on 23rd April, 1964, as reported at column 408 of the Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider this matter&mdash;</P>
    <P>he was referring to increases&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;which will affect the poorest people, even the old age pensioner who writes a letter occasionally. Apart from the effect this increased charge will have on private persons. it will have a very adverse effect on business concerns.  A concern whose costs for posting are now £400 will now have to pay £500.</P>
    <P>In other words, Deputy Crotty, speaking for the main Opposition Party, sheds tears for the old age pensioner. He goes on to shed them, now, for the fellow who spends £500 a year on letters and telephones.  There are tears for the old age pensioner and tears for the millionaire and I am wondering what section he has no tears for. What section does Deputy Crotty suggest should pay the £2 million? Does he mean the working classes, the fellow who smokes and beers?  Does he mean that he should have to pay an extra 2d on the pint and 6d on the cigarettes so that the fellow with the £500 for postage, and so on, will be saved, or whom has he no tears for?</P>
    <P>That is why I say there is no reason for the criticism unless the Opposition can point out where there could be economies.  But, whenever they talk of economies, they are never specific. They are afraid of their living lives to be specific because if they say something should be closed down it often means that a number of people will get sacked and they want the votes of this little group as well as of any other group.  They do not want to offend anybody and they say nothing.  Therefore, nobody is mentioned when it comes to economies.  In some cases, in fact, where there might be economies if people were sacked, these people would have to get decent compensation and I suppose for many years there would be no great benefit.  Therefore, much as we all regret increases, the Minister has no choice and the Opposition have made no case to show <Col N="691" /> that he should not have decided on the increases, nor have they made any case as to who should have paid the increases if the increases which were made should not have been made in this way.</P>
    <P>In regard to Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann, this is the one chance we will get to open our mouths.  I should like to complain about interviews by people with a grievance on Telefís Éireann&mdash;people with a grievance against the local authority or against responsible people&mdash;without, at the same time, inviting those who are being attacked at least to have representation there in order to rebut, there and then, what is alleged by those who are complaining.  An example is that in the past year there was a case of people who complained about Griffith Barracks and there was no one there from the Health Authority. Those people may have made some truthful statements but they hid a lot of matter which could have put a different complexion on the subject and there was nobody there to rebut those statements.  For instance, in one case, a woman said she was evicted and got no dwelling.</P>

      <P>Regarding the telephones, I have this to say.  Recently, a neighbour of mine received abusive calls.  Not only was profane and abusive language indulged in but very filthy conversations were carried on for three whole weeks.  The person to whom those conversations were addressed is actually an invalid of about 20 years of age.  I am aware of this case because I helped to catch the culprit.  It took three whole weeks. The advice that this unfortunate girl got was to hold the person in conversation. So this girl and her mother had to listen to filthy talk on sex for the best part of three weeks so as to give the postal authorities a chance to catch up with the caller and to discover where the calls were coming from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Post Office authorities can do better than that?  For three whole weeks, this girl had to put up with dirty sex talk on the telephone, on instructions to keep the conversation going, because that was the only chance they had of getting the caller. Something better than that can be <Col N="693" /> done so I am drawing the attention of the postal authorities to it.  It occurred in my own neighbourhood. I get plenty of abuse but I do not care about anyone.</P>

      <P>I should have liked to dwell on the postal charges and the means by which this new Budget had been brought in, but the matter has been referred to so often that I shall, instead, deal with a subject adverted to by Deputy Timmons when he spoke about Irish drama and what has happened to it on Radio Éireann.  I would add my compliments to the Television Authority.  They have done reasonably well, but then this House has not been <Col N="694" /> parsimonious in its votes to Telefís Éireann and it is only right that there should be an accounting here.</P>
      <P>I should be a television addict if I had the time but, unfortunately, people in our way of life have to go out in the evenings on the business of their constituents very often.  Whenever I can, I watch Irish television.  The top programmes are good.  I could offer some criticism of them but I join with Deputy Tully in his expression of views about this fashionable business of bringing in any crackpot who is able to say anything regarding our Border difficulty and the Six Counties. We never have a decent or informed statement.  That happened only once when there was a Belfast Presbyterian of some note in the world of drama and he told them &ldquo;where to get off.&rdquo; That was Sam Thompson.  Then we have young people encouraged to come on that programme telling us we should march on the Border.  It is time that sort of thing was cut out.  Let us get down to something we can do ourselves.  I am constantly hearing people talking of our culture and our way of life and the national heritage&mdash; a lot of claptrap.  But we have a great heritage which came out of this city, that is, Irish drama.  We should take account of it.  This House has been generous in regard to Irish drama.  We subsidised the Abbey Theatre to the extent of about £300,000 for its rebuilding. It seems as if we are to make a present of it to the three directors. I was against that particular&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises now.  We buy canned programmes.  We had <i>Hamlet</i> from Eurovision recently and it was magnificent.  We could show the world some great plays and some great theatre.  As a boy and as a young man, I remember coming starryeyed to Dublin feeling happy that I was going to the Abbey to see and hear something worthwhile.  The lapse of years and recent events have shown us we cannot look for leadership there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Radio Éireann built up a symphony orchestra, a great conception for which <Col N="695" /> they deserve credit, and I should like to pay my tribulte, with Deputy Barry, to the Secretary of the Department because I am sure it was his idea. There is another job to be done now to save the Irish theatre, especially the national theatre in Dublin, and that can be done by Telefís Éireann. Hilton Edwards was employed by Telefís Éireann and we were told by Deputy Timmons that he had to leave it, that he did not appear to be doing anything.  It may be said they had no ideas.  Perhaps I, as a taxpayer, or as a representative of the people, somebody who talks about these things or somebody interested in them who thought it worth while to join with others to keep a theatre open, could suggest to Telefís Éireann that they could bring back people like Hilton Edwards.  Our great players like Cyril Cusack and Ray Mac An Ailli should be brought back from England and a great company formed in Telefís Éireann to present our great Irish plays.  We have plays that were performed in the Abbey down the years. They were epics and were played all over the world.  They were translated and went behind the Iron Curtain. Now we have our own television and we buy canned programmes from anybody and we show them!</P>
    <P>We have the people, the technique and the money, I have no doubt the House would vote the money and that if this policy were adopted by Telefís Éireann, the Irish theatre would take its place&mdash;I quote Robert Emmet whose words come to me now&mdash;&ldquo;among the nations of the earth.&rdquo; These are the things we should be at once idealistic and realistic about.  We are not thumping platforms now as were the men 60, 70 or 80 years ago when they had no money but only hope. We are here in an Irish Parliament with an Irish Government putting up the money for the Television Authority.  We have a national heritage of drama.  It is not a question of that drama being allowed to die but it should be seen all over the world and, first of all, it should be played for our people all over the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> There was an era in the life of the national theatre when the Abbey went on tour.  They went down the country.</P>

      <P>Might I remind the Deputy there is a separate Estimate covering the National Theatre Society, and if the Deputy wishes to criticise or praise them, he should do so on that Estimate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not criticising them.  That is the only way a real standard can be shown to the people of the country and that should be a very high standard because the amateur drama movement down the country is now something to be counted on.  I do not think the present Abbey Theatre could do that; they would be laughed at if they did.  If what I had in mind were done by Telefís Éireann, a great national theatre group formed and our great artistes brought back and added to those at home, who are not able to make a living in Ireland and are only able to hang on, I think television films could be made to show to the Irish people and to the world.  I would ask the Minister to consider that carefully. Even if he comes in here and says he has no function, I know if the Minister discussed this with his officials and said it was worth examination, it would be examined.  I have no doubt that the Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, a man of his standing in music and the arts, now that I have drawn his attention to it, will see to it that his Department will do in this case as they did in the case of the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra.  I should like to mention a lot of other names, and say I have seen plays put on by our own people.  We had a wonderful one by Frank O'Connor and the old one of Lady Gregory, &ldquo;The Workhouse Ward.&rdquo; We should pay attention to these things.</P>
      <P>The last time I mentioned traditional fiddlers here the Minister, I think, misunderstood me altogether.  I think he was under the impression that I did not like what they were playing.  I do like traditional music.  I claim to have been one of the first fans of the Clancy</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Brothers.  But I do not like traditional music being fiddled out as it is from Telefís Éireann, and sometimes on Radio Éireann, by people who are not able to play.  Neither do I like people who are not able to sing coming on singing traditional songs.</P>

The Deputy should lay off me about that.  I heard an old gentleman sing once and he was a magnificent singer. That was the first time I heard of him and it speaks badly for Galway that he was not better known.</P>

      <P>If we bring visitors to Telefís Éireann and if they are to be interviewed, surely it should not be part of the programme that they should be insulted?  If that is the kind of interviewers we have, we should ban these interviews.  The standard of interviewers is not good.  Telefís Éireann would want to cast around again and try somebody else.  There have been some good interviews here by the staff of Telefís Éireann, but the general standard is not good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the programmes from down the country are excellent and well done.  There was a programme &ldquo;Location&rdquo; which was supposed to be a good programme.  I was appalled to read that.  They went to Kilkenny, one of the most historic cities in Ireland and they brought us to a golf course there.  I was waiting to hear something about Kilkenny but most of the time was taken up by traditional fiddlers. We should get out of that kind of thing.  If we are to meet people from Kilkenny and Wexford, let us meet them, talk to them about their games and their lives, and let us see their <Col N="698" /> historical places and their historical treasures.</P>
    <P>If we went not to a place in my own constituency but, say, to Galway, we would be brought to a bar or a golf course and all the great history attaching to Galway and all the wonderful things in the streets would be passed by.  I am suggesting these things to Telefís Éireann because I think they are worth while.  We have something to show the people and, if Telefís Éireann come to places such as these, that is the way it should be done.</P>
    <P>Regarding politics on Telefís Éireann, we had the television service in here on the occasion when we had our greatest visitor, God rest him, but only the Government side of the House appeared on Telefís Éireann.  The Opposition were cut out and only the Government side of the House put on the record for all time.  There was no Opposition in Dáil Éireann.  That sort of thing has occurred in smaller ways. I have been looking at television when members of Dáil Éireann, the Government and the Opposition, were going somewhere, and only members of the Government were shown entering the plane.  In the later news, we might be told that the other people were there and had gone.  Perhaps they swam over.</P>
    <P>We should do something about news broadcasting.  We have very good newscasters on the radio but we get very few television pictures.  When we get the pictures, we are told that the Minister for so-and-so is opening so-and-so and we see him open the door and close it and everything is then shut off.  Then we see the newscaster again.  Are they afraid to show that the Opposition are present?</P>
    <P>I have to mention Kilkenny again. I was at the funeral of the late Bishop of Ossory.  It was a very solemn occasion and a great number of people turned up there.  The television coverage was not&mdash;I have gone into reverse now&mdash;any compliment to the Taoiseach.  He just appeared for a split second and then was cut off and we saw a lot of white surplices away in the distance.  They should have done better  <Col N="699" /> than that.  There was a horde of cameramen at very good stations and they did not seem to do very much.</P>
    <P>Whenever a film is shown in conjunction with Irish news, it is only on for a few seconds but if we are being shown something in Vietnam, Birmingham, Alabama, especially in relation to the news in Irish, we nearly get the whole of the people's lives.  We are shown the whole business.  That is not good.  I would exhort the Minister to ensure that a better news service is provided.  There was a very fine news service provided under the inter-Party Government and, of course, Fianna Fáil had to do away with it&mdash;anything anyone else does must be destroyed. I suggest to the Minister that some such service is needed.  In the first place, you need a news service and, secondly, good cameramen.  If there is a two-minute or a three-minute broadcast of some event that took place in the country which is worthwhile reporting there should be at least a similar period devoted to pictures to show what happened and then you can see the newscaster's face again.  What happens is that you get a three-second shot and it is almost gone before you see it and then you are back again to the newscaster.</P>
    <P>In regard to Radio Éireann, what do the listening public want?  The last time I asked the Minister that question it was a good few years ago and the information was not available but by an extraordinary chain of events, I discovered it was available and was published in an obscure Government publication. I obtained it and it really surprised me.  There was a lot in this Gallup poll or whatever you like to call it.  A lot of programmes did not get even one half of one per cent of people asking for them to be put on but they were being put on <i>in saecula saeculorum.</i> I believe something like that was done recently and I would be grateful to the Minister if he would make the results available.</P>
    <P>I have to get down now to fundamentals, to the humdrum matters of my constituents, to the question of <Col N="700" /> telephones that do not ring because they are not there.  The Minister has been very decent to me but I must take him to task about this.  At column 370, volume 209 of the Official Report, he said that it was found possible to connect 14,350 new subscribers. That is all right but what about the 13,900 that he did not connect? He told me that last week, that there were 13,900 people looking for telephones.  I know that some of them have been looking for telephones for the past three years.  But we get no hope.  This is the real Kathleen Mavourneen system.  When we ask the Minister about this, he tells us that it will be dealt with in the near future; on the next occasion when we ask, we are told it will be dealt with as soon as possible.  Then we are told there is a delay about that kind of thing and that it will be done within the next six months.  When a year passes and we ask again, we are told the matter is receiving attention.  We must have an accounting about this.  My information is that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been very busy laying main cables, putting in new switchboards and all the rest of it.  I have no doubt about that but I say to the Minister that he should recruit extra staff for that kind of work and not leave such an enormous number of people without the telephone, people who are storming Deputies on all sides seeking their help to get telephones.</P>
    <P>I was twitted about this when I raised it on the Budget and before I was ruled out of order and told I could raise the matter on this Vote, Deputy Meaney said that, of course, I was exaggerating and that it was because the people were so well off that they were looking for telephones.  I did not know at the time that Deputy Meaney was one of the real Brahmins and that he went to the Minister and was able to get the telephone in within 24 hours.  I have no fault to find with that because I consider a Deputy should be able to do that but he should not then have said &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack&rdquo; and to hell with the 13,900 people left at the post who cannot get the telephone in.  If the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had, say, relinquished the telephone service to <Col N="701" /> a private company, such as the Bell Telephone Company in New York, you would have had men going around the country knocking on the people's doors exhorting them to put in the telephone.</P>
    <P>The position in which we are here is that we have over 13,000 people looking for telephones and the Minister comes along and says: &ldquo;I am going to put a stop to these people&rdquo;, and he claps on £10 a head on anybody who seeks a telephone after 1st April.  That is his idea of putting on the brake on this.  The Minister and his Department should get ahead with these 13,900 applications.  There is no use writing back to me or to any other Deputy telling us that it would take five poles to go up to a certain man's house.  It will have to be done sometime and it might as well be done now.</P>
    <P>There should also be some priority for those people who have been waiting for telephones for years.  It is very hard on some of them.  There have been complaints made about cases where it was not difficult to instal a telephone.  I received a complaint in my constituency and I investigated it. A man moved into a building and took portion of it for an office.  He applied for a telephone and had been seeking a telephone for a year and a half and he could not get it.  I tried for him and other people tried.  Somebody then moved into the building and he was of the Brahmin class also and he had the telephone in within 24 hours.  That is not nice and it is not right.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Sherwin saying that the people he represents are the working people and they do not use the telephone or send telegrams.  I thought he was a man who was really in touch with the ordinary people.  He must know about the Irish workingclass mothers who often have to wire money to their erring sons in England to bring them home.  They are constantly making telephone calls, these ordinary, common, simple people, to their sons and daughters in England. I often see them standing at call offices waiting for the calls to come through and they are paying for the calls.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> It will be a nice situation now for any Deputy or anybody else who sees that some dear friend has died and finds that he is taxed to the tune of 5/- to send a telegram of condolence to the relatives.  The telegram has been taxed out of existence.  In my young days, there were not so many telephones and nearly all business, and very good business, too, was transacted by telegram.  The Minister is of about the same period as myself and he should know what I am talking about; the telegram was the way, but we have taxed and priced it out of existence.</P>
    <P>Now I come to a very important matter.  The Minister's Department usually employs a number of temporary postmen at Christmas. These may be unemployed men but they have to be a first-class type.  Most would be former Army men.  They are often people who have not got the kind of protective clothing needed because we do not have the best of weather around Christmas time when these men come on.  A general order should be sent to all post offices that protective clothing should be lent to these men while working.  It is very hard to see some of them delivering Christmas parcels and Christmas cards with only their own coats on them and they drenched to the skin.  If they had the regular protective clothing which is supplied by the post office, it would be another matter.  The Minister should make a note of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has some little guilt in the matter of telephones and telephone tapping, if there is any guilt, because it is sometimes necessary to tap the telephones.  That is something that must be done on occasion as in the case where a murder has been committed or where the State is in danger, but I would remind the Minister that it is, nevertheless, a very dangerous practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wish to say, with the greatest of respect, is that the Minister is in charge of the telephone exchanges and the Minister for Justice or his agents could not get into these exchanges without his permission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>What I was going to point out was something that was done not by the Minister for Justice but by the predecessor of the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I have it on the best authority that during the Emergency members of the Government were listening in to the conversations of Army officers and Army officers were listening in to the conversations of members of the Government. Somebody did not trust somebody else.  That is something that should never happen again and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should see to it that it will never happen again.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I will say to the Minister, not in any spirit of carping criticism, that there must be an immediate investigation of all the telephone leakages going on all over the country. Quite recently I dialled a number in Dublin and got through to a number in Meath and found myself listening to one man buying a bunch of cattle from another.  I knew who he was and tried to make the deal but it did not come off.  Last Monday morning I picked up the telephone and found myself listening to a man talking to his banker.  I rang off at once.  These are faults which must be investigated and remedied.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House as the last speaker, who, I feel, got up just for <Col N="704" /> the purpose of delaying, did.  I should like to pay tribute to the Minister and his Department for the Estimate they have produced which, I feel, is a realistic one.  I would like to pay tribute to the Post Office staffs in general, from the highest to the lowest, throughout the whole country.  These people are dealing with the public. They have a tough and strenuous job to do and they are doing it in an efficient manner.</P>
      <P>The question of the uniforms for the postmen should be dealt with at once. All the uniforms seem to be made to the same size, whether they are for tall postmen or for small postmen.  I welcome the decision of the Minister to allow the use of autocycles and motorcycles in certain areas.  Postmen have a strenuous time in bad weather and on bad hilly roads.  In certain parts of the country cycling is impossible.  If postmen can afford to use a motorcycle or autocycle they are entitled to do so.</P>
      <P>There should be more programmes in Irish and greater use of the Irish language on Telefís Éireann.  It has occurred to me in regard to Telefís Éireann that Benediction service is televised on Sunday evenings and it should not be beyond their capacity to have Mass also televised on Sundays. There are certain areas which are at a distance from a church and elderly people who have no transport are unable to attend Mass.  Their sons and daughters may have bicycles and they may not be able to afford to take a car to and from the church.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the increased staff and the increased Estimate, it should be possible to improve the telephone service in the next 12 months.  That improvement is overdue. People have been waiting for a considerable time for telephones. There are difficulties.  One is that the Post Office do not move out of an area until all the work in that area is complete.  That is one cause of delay.</P>
      <P>Last year I raised the question of the provision of a public kiosk at the docks in Galway to facilitate the public and fishermen landing fish.  If a fishing boat develops engine trouble approaching the docks, or on the homeward journey, the men would be able to contact by phone somebody who had transport, if they had to transport fish to Dublin or elsewhere. The provision of a public telephone kiosk is due there.</P>
      <P>A telephone service is awaited on the island of Inishturk, west of Clifden.  There are some fishing boats there which have been bought or are on hire from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. A telephone service is long overdue there.  I hope the Minister will arrange to have one installed in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Book of Estimates shows £15 million demanded of the people for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;nearly £2 million more than the demand made last year.  In addition, there is a Department Budget. We have been asked by Deputies on the other side of the House where are we to get all the money to pay the wages.  If the Estimate is increased by £2 million over last year's figure that should pay for the increase in wages. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs were ashamed to tack themselves on to the Budget.  They had to introduce one of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The postal charges of the 26 Counties as compared with those in the Six <Col N="706" /> Counties are a disgrace.  Deputy Geoghegan praised all the increases in charges and praised the Department highly.  There is a certain amount of praise due but I wonder if the unfortunate woman in my constituency who has to write to three or four sons every alternate week will praise the Department when she has to pay increased postage.  If she has to send a telegram, will she praise the Department?</P>
    <P>There is a standstill order in the form of an impost of £10 in respect of new applications for telephones.  The day when the phone was a luxury has gone.  The phone has become a necessity. The Department should consider the ordinary citizen.  This impost of £10 is merely to frighten off applicants so as to ease the burden on the Department. It is a very retrograde step.  It is an effort to frighten people from applying because the Department are falling down on the provision of telephones.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to let the 400 applicants he says are in Galway know when there is a possibility of their getting phones.  The provision of phones is an important matter in regard to Galway, which is a tourist centre.  The Minister should help tourism by expediting the installation of telephones in Galway and the west generally.</P>
    <P>I shall not add anything to what has been said about telephone tapping.  At the same time, I do not want to be tapped into somebody else's conversation. Recently, when I was telephoning a Department here, I found myself listening to two ladies talking about their cats.  Each time I put the phone down and took it up again the conversation was proceeding.  The ladies were entitled to talk on whatever subject they liked but I was entitled to get a different line, which I did not get for a long time.  I do not appreciate that kind of thing.  Lines get crossed but the matter should receive further attention.</P>
    <P>The phone is no longer a luxury.  In future, people will use the phone even more because it will cost them much more to write letters.  The increase in stamps represents a serious imposition.</P>
    <P>Radio Éireann is used for the purpose of encouraging savings.  It is easy, <Col N="707" /> we are told, to save once a start is made.  The Government should take heed of that slogan and cut out a good deal of the squandermania and try to bring in a few savings themselves.  The people need sincerity from the top.</P>
    <P>It is about time the Minister ensured that some privacy is provided for the small number of people who have a few spare shillings to put into the Post Office.  I am sorry to say they are very few and far between.  It is most embarrassing for them to have to stand in a public queue with their neighbours peeping over their shoulders to see what sort of money their sons or daughters in England are sending them or what the amount of their cheques is.  Some privacy should be afforded them.</P>
    <P>On the question of radio reception, there is very bad interference at times in all areas.  People say television causes it, while others say it will become worse as time goes on.  It is being forecast that Radio Éireann will be forced to get a new wavelength in the near future.  It is also said that many sets will become obsolete.  I hope the Minister will clear up these points.</P>
    <P>Today, I asked the Minister if he had received any complaints about the effect of television viewing on the eyesight and if he had any advice to offer. He had no advice to offer; he had received no complaints.  Of course, his reply was from one of the handouts he gets from his officials.  He said he had been informed that sustained viewing might cause temporary fatigue of the eyes.  I read a lot of the <i>Irish Independent</i> before I get tired and for a much longer period than I could spend viewing television.</P>
    <P>My attention has been called to the report of a doctor who examined a child for a sudden squint.  The doctor asked the parents if they had television and the parents said they had not.  It transpired, however, that the child had been visiting a neighbour's house where there was a set.  The doctor advised that the child should not be permitted to view television for <Col N="708" /> longer than a half hour each day.  The Minister says he had no such complaint. I am giving it to him now and I ask him to pass it on to the Minister for Health who may transmit it to his medical advisers for the benefit of the general public.</P>
    <P>Coming from a tourist area, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the frequency with which we are promised rain in the west by Radio Éireann forecasters.  God knows, we have enough of it, but I come up from Galway each week and I can assure the Minister I have seen more rain in Dublin during the past 12 months than in Galway.  I am glad to be able to say that, but I should like the forecasters to take greater pains to be accurate in a matter which is so important to a tourist centre.  Are they just chancing their arm?  We cannot afford to have people chancing their arm in matters that affect us so much.  It is bad enough to have rain without having cold water thrown on us as well.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the portrayals Fianna Fáil get on Radio Éireann and TE.  I have very litle time to watch television but when I do, these pictures of Fianna Fáil disgust me.  Between television, radio and the <i>Irish Press</i>, Fianna Fáil get in their plug one way or another.  They never miss a trick.  It is time to call a halt to this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>On the question of the transmission of canned films, I often wonder why the scissors is not used more widely on the long lists of names of producers, writers, make-up artists&mdash;who put on the lipstick on whom.  It means nothing to us.  Would it not be far more profitable to put on an advertisement or two, even if we do think there are enough of these already?  I suggest also in relation to these films, that there is too much of the criminal being portrayed as the hero.  It is not good for children.  On the contrary, television should be used to elevate the mind of children.  Could we not have more programmes on civics and first aid, for instance?  The latter type of programme is most important nowadays with so many accidents on the roads and in the homes.  These would <Col N="709" /> be far better for children, than the &ldquo;Have-Gun-Will-Travel&rdquo; type of production.</P>
    <P>I suggest we could play a much better part, through television, in the Irish cultural movement.  Surely it is not Irish culture to hear all the wailing and keening.  It would put you ten degrees under.  That cannot be described as Irish culture. A language is tagged on to it. Is it any wonder the people are turning against the language?  We hear some old fellow crying away to himself without rhyme or reason, without a note of music in his head. The Authority should not waste the money on his fare, apart altogether from the expense of putting a camera on him.  I often wonder where they get them.  They are called artistes.  I have a category of my own in which I would put them but I am afraid the Ceann Comhairle would rule me out of order, were I to specify it. I should like, however, to compliment Telefís Éireann on some of their productions of céilí and stepdancing. The producers are to be congratulated.  I suggest that more should be done along those lines.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy T. Lynch, I should like to refer to the visit of the late President Kennedy, go ndéanaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam.  When he came to address us here, we had the cameras beamed on the benches opposite, like big gun emplacements prior to battle.  We, on this side of the House, took note of things.  I went up to one of these gentlemen and I asked him: &ldquo;What side of the House are you going to film?  The Government side only?  Is that right?&rdquo; The poor man seemed to be very embarrassed.  He seemed to have got his instructions.  The cameras were ready for action.  I think that was pushing the image a bit too far.  I suppose the poor man would have been sacked if he had not done what he was told.</P>
    <P>With regard to decentralisation, like other Deputies, I feel we should have decentralisation of television shows. Why everything has to be produced in Dublin is beyond me.  The service could be described more accurately as Telefís Montrose instead of Telefís <Col N="710" /> Éireann.  There is plenty of good talent in the country which should be given a chance.  It is as good as, or better than, some of the stuff I have seen in Dublin, the Beatle types of production which are so loudly praised.  With regard to more television programmes from the country, no elaborate settings would be required.  The country is full of natural stage settings and we would welcome the cameras.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of room for the exercise of some imagination in television productions.  There seems to be a rut, with the same crowd up there all the time.  The same is true of Radio Éireann.  We hear the same voices and they grate on one after a while.  It is about time a visit was paid to the country and the country brought to the people.  The people are paying £5 a year for television and I believe they are entitled to more variety and more representation.  Telefís Éireann should give a fair crack of the whip to the country and bring local talent to the surface.  It is there but it is not playing the part it should in television.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on the Budget, I commented on the fact that the Minister for Finance had deliberately split his Budget into two parts.  When he announced that increased charges would be made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I do not think anybody on this side of the House realised for a moment that the charges would be so extensive or would have such an effect on the general economy.  It is somewhat amazing that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should now be regarded as being outside the Exchequer. Hitherto, all moneys coming into the Exchequer, including those from Posts and Telegraphs, were included in the Budget charges for the year.  There would be some alterations and some increases, but always of a minor character, and never of such a gigantic nature as these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased postal rates, telegram and telephone charges will have a very considerable effect upon business and even upon the poorer sections in the community.  These, of course, do not have to avail of postal or telephone <Col N="711" /> facilities in the same way as business concerns and, for some of the larger concerns, these imposts will be very serious.  I heard one interesting comment made by a very big businessman. He sends out his accounts with a fourpenny stamp.  In future, he says the accounts will go out with a three-penny stamp.  That will create a situation which could easily defeat the object the Minister has of securing a further £2 million in revenue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he has to carry out economies.  Surely, with additional charges, service should rank higher than economies.  The Minister has decided to close a number of smaller post offices.  I do not think he is keeping in mind at all the services that these offices render to rural communities. A great deal of money was expended in extending the phone to every rural office and the phone became a very important part of the communications system, particularly in relation to doctors, veterinary surgeons and so on.  When a post office is closed, what will happen to the telephone? Will a kiosk be put up outside the old office?  What will be the new arrangement?  I know offices that have been closed.  In one case there was such a local outcry that the people of the house in which the phone was placed said that, if the Minister so desired, they would operate the phone without charge because it was such an amenity and such an advantage to the people in the area.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says there is a post office within so many miles, five miles on one side and five miles on the other and, in his opinion, services in the area will be fully looked after and demands fully catered for, I do not think he is right.  I think it is important these offices should be kept open for old age pensioners and so on.  It is not easy for people to travel eight or nine miles.  That is what they will have to do now if they want to transact business in a post office.  The Minister should reconsider this.  The savings effected by closing even 500 rural offices could not be so extensive as to have any great effect.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider <Col N="712" /> this matter, and quickly, because difficulties will be created for the rural community, for doctors, veterinary surgeons and others.  The Minister may argue that they are very few.  It was argued that because there was so little need for helicopters, we should not get them, but we had to get them because of the few instances in which they are required.  I want to urge the Minister to reconsider opening the offices he has already closed, and not to close the ones he proposes to close. The increased charges in other directions will have a serious effect.  However, because of the loss of the purchasing power of our money, I suppose it is true to say that these higher charges are required.  I wonder what will happen to the many thousands of applications that are in for telephones? Will the applicants be notified right away that they will have to put down the £10 deposit?  Is that a condition of the application being considered, or the planning of the installation of the phone?  If the applicant realises that he will have to pay that charge, he might reconsider his application. Whether the applicants reconsider their applications or not, they should be informed at the earliest possible moment of this charge, and they should be given a rough idea of what the new charges are likely to be as compared with the existing rates.</P>
    <P>As has already been said here, the rural postmen provide a social amenity.  It is also true to say that if a rural postman is the secretary or chairman of the local Fianna Fáil club, he is a very useful fellow.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Tully that we should give them that freedom and let them rip away.  I am not grumbling about it. What I am saying is that they are a very helpful part of rural life.  They are the carriers of information and the gossip which makes life a little brighter. It would be a pity if their numbers <Col N="714" /> were to be reduced for the sake of economy, and the installation of more modern methods of delivery.  Let us hope that, if the new method is installed, it will be as efficient as the old one.</P>
      <P>The question was raised as to where the Minister would get the money if these charges were not imposed.  It is a well established fact that for many years a substantial balance has been surrendered after every financial year, but this year no credit whatever is given for any sum.  It is true that in his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance said there were claims outstanding that had to be met on behalf of civil servants and others.  When I suggested that three, four, or five per cent of that gigantic sum could be saved, he did not accept that.  He shook his head very violently and said that was not possible because of the other charges he had to meet.  That means we will have another little Budget at some stage.</P>
      <P>I feel that a substantial sum could have been saved and that the whole £2 million should not have been put on at the same time.  Half the charges would very probably meet it.  Like the Garda, the postal service is an essential service to the nation, and, in my opinion, whatever sum is required to meet that service, it should have been covered in the Budget and the Minister for Finance should have declared it.  He should also have kept in mind the need to ensure that it is within the capacity of the rural community to meet the charges and, if necessary, he should make a very substantial subvention to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to meet them.</P>
      <P>We have heard comments about Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann. Speaking of Radio Éireann first, I think it has rendered very great service to the nation.  We may complain now and again of some programmes but, broadly speaking, Radio Éireann has done well.  The orchestra which has been assembled is a pleasure to everyone who hears it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention will, I hope, be very brief.  The only purpose of it is to try to bring the debate back to what I think should be considered a fundamental.  The Opposition have roamed over a wide field of general criticism but I do not think I am doing them any injustice if I say they have not displayed any definite policy in relation to this Budget and have been able to do no more than to offer the type of criticism that it is so easy to offer and the type of criticism that I think can all too often be heard in this House.</P>
      <P>We should not lose sight of the concluding paragraphs of the Minister's statement.  He frankly and concisely said:</P>
      <P>This Budget, therefore, is intended to favour saving, to increase investment and to put a slight brake on consumption.</P>
      <P>And the Budget framed with that aim in view, was conditioned by the particular circumstances which we have at the moment and which were more fully dealt with by the Taoiseach in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach was constrained to say, as reported in the Official Report, volume 208, column 1787. that it appeared necessary to re-state some elementary principles in this matter. My purpose in rising now is to underline these elementary principles because even within the last few days we read in <Col N="716" /> the news of the conditions of things in Italy where remuneration was up by 14 per cent but prices and costs were up by more than ten per cent so that the net gain was very considerably less than the apparent gain and the cause was that the increase in remuneration had outstripped profitable productivity.</P>
    <P>There is a lesson in the very recent past and it is worth while recalling what the Taoiseach said.  I do not know of any more succinct way of stating it than the way he stated it as reported at column 1787 of the Official Report of the same volume from which I have just quoted.  Here is what he said:</P>
    <P>When national production is rising at an average annual rate of 4 per cent this is the maximum rate at which incomes can increase in real terms.  If nominal incomes rise faster than that prices will certainly move up to confine the real gain in incomes to what higher national production can support.  This is a mathematical certainly.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps even simpler than a mathematical certainty.  It is one of the very elementary primitive facts of economic life.</P>
    <P>At this stage, in a Parliament with 40 years' experience and where we have seen many Budgets, we should realise what these elementary facts are and at least base our criticism of Ministerial proposals in the light of these facts.  That, of course, the Opposition, in the present debate, have outrageously failed to do.  Surely we can grow up in this Parliament to the stage where we can get beyond the childish philosophy of trying to have your cake and eat it.</P>
    <P>The only purpose of my intervention here is to stress such a reality. We listened to Deputy McGilligan last night.  While I was sorry in one way because Deputy McGilligan has not been able to keep up, it was only too painfully evident, listening to him, that he was still thinking 15, 20 and even 30 years back.  What the justification is for what he did or did not do so long ago does not really matter in this <Col N="717" /> current context.  What we had to do is to face the circumstances of the present day.  But, having listened to a lot of what Deputy McGilligan said, I could not help thinking that, though he taunted other Deputies with not being long enough in the House to know, some of us who are long enough in the House to know have noticed the difference in the attitude of Deputy McGilligan as Minister and Deputy McGilligan in Opposition.  However, I do not intend to chase after that too far.  But I think it might be apt to quote him to drive home my point how Governments and how Ministers must have regard to what I call the facts of life and how the same facts of life are realities which must condition any responsible Government and any responsible Minister in the framing of his Budget.  I think I might just quote Deputy McGilligan on some of the things he said when he was Minister for Finance.  I will take his Budget of 1948 and I will quote from his Budget Speech as reported at column 1057 of the Official Report, Volume 110.  Referring to arresting inflationary trends and profits and rents in particular, he goes on to say</P>
    <P>The substantial wage and salary increases already secured by all classes of workers, with such further advantages as shorter hours, paid holidays, children's allowances and other increases in social services, have gone as far as is possible, in present circumstances, to meet the claims of social justice, and I would make a most earnest appeal to all employees not to seek further increases in monetary remuneration or improvements in working conditions, unless warranted by exceptional circumstances.  Recent experience confirms that the benefit of an increase in money incomes is rapidly swallowed up by rising prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am clinching my point.  Maybe Deputy O'Higgins does not like it.  As I was saying, Deputy McGilligan, the then Minister for Finance, was referring again to the problem of import prices and the necessity for balancing and he said:</P>
      <P>When what we produce for export does not go as far as before towards paying for our import needs we suffer, as a nation, a reduction in the standard of living we can afford. Increases in remuneration offer no escape from this unwelcomed development; indeed, they can only accelerate the process of inflation and cause social injustice as between those able to improve or maintain their position and those who cannot enlarge their incomes and are therefore forced to assume an undue burden of hardship.  For this reason, the Government ask for restraint in the putting forward of wage and salary claims and have taken measures intended to limit price increases to those justified by increases in costs.</P>

      <P>We know the measures taken.  I want to emphasise that that view of the facts is the only responsible view.  That makes it all the more reprehensible for a Deputy of the seniority of Deputy McGilligan to sail so far into the wind as to make suggestions that I can only characterise as incitement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan was back in the past.  We must deal with the present. We are concerned with Ireland in the present and the future and the building up of our economy.  Whether anybody likes it or not there has been, over past years, a definite expansion in productivity which is proved by facts and figures and reflected by a certain air of advancement, if I do not call it prosperity, apparent abroad and so marked indeed that sometimes the Opposition describe it as euphoria.  But there is real progress and it has been <Col N="719" /> achieved through these plans that have been derided and sneered at by Deputies opposite, the two programmes for economic expansion.</P>
    <P>What about this Budget?  The Minister and the Taoiseach in sober terms, terms essentially not different from those used by other Ministers who are not of this Party when dealing with economic matters, have pointed out the fundamental factors in the situation, particularly in regard to prices and remuneration.  We know from experience, if nothing more, from the experience of two Coalition Governments, what can and cannot be done in regard to controlling either factor. But, when there is a definite policy in Government and a definite trend established, progress can be achieved at the rate of approximately four per cent. That has been demonstrated here already and that progress has been maintained.  We must all agree that for the benefit of the country in the future that rate must continue to be at least maintained, or else we shall not be able to reach the stage of being confident that we have a viable economy.</P>
    <P>Surveying the present situation, I cannot see that the Minister could have approached his Budget on any basis other than that on which he did approach it.  With singular frankness, he has, in the phrase I quoted at the outset, clearly defined his aims.  It is always possible to argue as to the merits of these but I do not think the situation can be helped by the tactics that have been adopted and to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>There is no point in my repeating everything the Taoiseach and the Minister, or indeed, any other speaker said, as the debate is growing old, but I want to emphasise the lesson which has been demonstrated, and is being demonstrated, in Italy that there is a linkage between remuneration and output and if the proper proportions are exceeded, the compensation comes by prices catching up on remuneration. There is no more escape from that than from the natural cycle of life in other respects.  I should like Deputies to consider that after 40 years growing to <Col N="720" /> maturity, we, as a Parliament, with the responsibility we have to the people, should weigh these factors as well as the factors that, perhaps, may be more remunerative when it comes to making political capital but upon which, if we are not careful, the people all too often pay the interest.</P>

      <P>It has been said that the Budget debate which is usually a long one is largely futile because nothing can be achieved by it.  That is a point of view that we do not all have to accept, more especially when we know that we have a Government in power who change their mind and, in fact, make up their mind from day to day and hour to hour; a Government who have always failed to look ahead and make provision for any fundamental long-term future planning or development; a Government who have put a levy on milk today and when the pressure became hot, took it off and put it on cigarettes; a Government who on this occasion brought in a Budget and on the same night produced another Budget; a Government for whom the order of the day has been Supplementary Estimates and a Government also who have been guilty of retrospective legislation.  In these circumstances, it is fair to say this debate might not be so futile and that something could come from listening to the sound, solid reasoning of those on the Opposition benches.</P>
      <P>I believe that every day that passes the people are feeling more resentful and more bitter at the ever-growing load of taxation they are called upon to bear.  They are all the more resentful and dissatisfied because they feel the Government are collecting this money and misusing it and that the new benefits are either meagre or non-existent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must admit that any of the valuable national assets we possess are the result of the advanced thought and creative ability of the people who carried on the Government of the country when Fianna Fáil failed to secure office.  In support of this argument, I shall mention but a few things that I believe have been fundamental advances.  I shall start <Col N="721" /> with the ESB which did so much to enable the establishment and expansion of industry and has also done so much to provide amenities and comforts hitherto unthought of in the homes of our people.  I mention the Sugar Company, one of our biggest industries at present and it also has done much for the people of rural Ireland.  We all know the part played by the Industrial Development Authority. There is also the Land Project, the Agricultural Institute, the Local Authorities (Works) Act, the relief of taxation on exports, the 1948 Trade Agreement, the Whitegate Oil Refinery.  These are some of the important developments which come to my mind at the moment.  They are the result of advanced throught and creative ability and I would ask the members of the Government to contrast this with their own meagre contributions.</P>
    <P>I think any Budget, any worthwhile Budget, should give evidence and expression to the future thoughts and ideas for national development.  I believe the most efficient part of the present Government is their propaganda machine and ability to gull the people into believing that the nation is marching rapidly ahead under their inspired leadership.  It is a well-known fact that every Minister and every member of the Government who stands up to speak at any function never fails to mention the magic title, the Blue Book, <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> This, of course, is expected to arouse new hopes and expectations.  It has a sort of magic ring in it.  I think it would be a good thing if the Government gave up flapping their wings, got down to the hard facts about Ireland and gave up misrepresenting the people.</P>
    <P>Some of the hard facts are these. The 1961 census of population shows that the number of people working in all our industries was 164,567 fewer than it was in 1951.  I think any Government who have to face that record should bow their heads in shame, not only at their failure to increase the numbers in employment but even to maintain that standard of employment. It is quite obvious that the employment <Col N="722" /> opportunities provided by the Government are totally inadequate.  That, to me, represents absolute failure when we can go back 10 years and prove that, in 1961, there were some 164,000 fewer people in employment than there were in 1951.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the incomes of these people are higher.  I suppose if it is counted in the number of pounds, shillings and pence that they are getting it certainly is higher.  But I wonder is the real value of that income any better?  I think very few people realise that the man who, ten years ago, had a salary of £3,000&mdash;and there were not so many of them&mdash;today would need £4,000 to have the same purchasing power.  These are not my figures.  They are figures got here as the result of recent questions.</P>
    <P>Let us bring that down closer to the ordinary working man.  The man who, ten years ago, had £12 a week, would now need £16 to have the same purchasing power.  This reduced working population is now being called upon to provide twice as much money to run the country than was required, say, seven years ago.  In the present year they are being asked to provide £17 million in extra taxation, that is, the £10 million extra on the turnover tax and £7 million more on new taxation. Side by side with this, we will have a continuation of very heavy borrowing. All this additional borrowing has, of course, to be serviced and adds up to additional cost and additional taxation.</P>
    <P>What then is happening to this money? What are the benefits, if any, that the people are getting?  The Social Welfare beneficiaries are getting a halfcrown and everybody knows by now that this halfcrown is already eaten up by the increases in the cost of living.  I believe they were entitled to more and I think everybody believes they were entitled to more.  Many people would even be agreeable to bigger sacrifices to enable a higher increase to be given to the Social Welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The farmers are being given 2d a gallon on milk.  This, in my view, is already eaten up by the increases in the cost of production since they received their last increase.  There is no <Col N="723" /> incentive in this increase to the farmers of the country to produce milk of higher quality so that we could have greater diversification of our milk products with a view to finding a wider and more remunerative market.</P>
    <P>Then we have the increase in the price of grade A and grade A special pigs. This provides an inducement to producers of higher quality bacon.  I think that is a good thing.  But, due to the increase in the price of barley, which is small, but nevertheless is roughly 1/- a cwt, it leaves roughly about 3/- per pig profit extra.  Labour charges and other rising overhead charges nullify the effect of that increase.  Nevertheless, I think it would be impossible for the farming community to carry on if these increases were not given.</P>
    <P>There is the relief in rates as well. The Minister said, I think, the rates position as far as the farming community were concerned would now be back to the 1957 level.  He may not have put it in those words but the impression abroad was that they would have to pay no more in rates now than they did in 1957.  That is a wrong impression. It is probably true that on their lands they will not have to pay any more but on their buildings they will.  The cost of rates is rising rapidly every year; it is rocketing every year. All this increased taxation, the turnover tax and all the other taxes that have been imposed, has inevitably rocketed the cost of local government and, in turn, the rates.</P>
    <P>Still on the farming side benefit from this Budget, it has been termed the farmers' Budget.  I think that is a very wrong description to give it.  If it could be called a farmers' Budget I think the Minister should have come in here and said he believed in principle with the NFA statement in relation to the requirements of the industry in the future and that he was coming in this year to provide the first instalment for the very heavy investment programme that lies ahead if agriculture is to play the part I believe it is capable of playing in this country.  I think it is estimated in that document that to put it rightly on its feet would cost somewhere <Col N="724" /> in the region of some £300 million.  The Government were requested, between now and 1970, to subscribe something in the region of £100 million to that investment programme. There is no evidence that I can see in the Budget that that confidence is felt in agriculture and that need appreciated by the Government.</P>
    <P>No matter what is said in the Blue Book, nothing would contribute more to the expansion of our exports than if we got down and put agriculture into the position in which it will be able to contribute its full share, and in which we could develop it to its fullest extent. The matter that has been lost sight of over the years is the fact that the investment has been far too small and its potential has been very much underestimated.  Another part of the Blue Book stresses that the salvation of the country lies in the expansion of industrial exports.  I agree that it is extremely important that we should develop industry to the maximum, especially if we can base it on home-produced raw materials, but I know we cannot stick to that.  I have commented here before about the inadequacy of the machinery we have to deal with the establishment and expansion of industry generally.  The people engaged in this important work of encouraging and attracting industry are doing an excellent job.  They are first-class people but we have not got nearly enough of them and I believe that through protracted delays and due to the fact that we have not got enough people and authorities interested in the development of industry, valuable opportunities and valuable industries have been lost.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual to find that it is six months or perhaps 12 months before a proposal can be fully processed and either agreed upon or disagreed with and many people lose heart during that period and give up the ghost and say they have never experienced this in any other country. That is something the Government should consider seriously.  People engaged in this work are doing an excellent job but, in my view, they are overworked and are not able to attend to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> I spoke about the increases given to the agricultural community and it is only fair to comment on the timing of these increases.  The 12 per cent increase was agreed on and was paid to almost the entire population, from, let us say, 1st February, but the farming community had to wait until the Budget and the farm workers, the lowest paid section of the community, have to wait until 14th May for this increase.  I cannot understand the mentality of a Government who see justice in that type of treatment for a very important section of the community.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to some of the taxes imposed in the Budget.  I would agree with some of these taxes, provided there were corresponding reliefs elsewhere.  For instance, I believe that the increase of 3d on the cigarettes may be a good tax in so far as it may act as a further deterrent to people who smoke excessively and may further protect the health of our people.  The tax on Scotch whisky&mdash;I suppose I should say &ldquo;on imported spirits&rdquo;&mdash; looks a reasonable tax, although it is not a tax of 4d but of 6d because that is what the increase has resulted in.  Before that tax was imposed, an effort should have been made to induce the whiskey distillers here to produce a blend of whiskey that would be acceptable to the people who normally drink Scotch whisky.  I think the tax is premature and also that it is a fairly savage increase.</P>
    <P>I am completely opposed to a further tax on the pint.  I know that people in all strata of society drink stout but by and large it is the workingman's drink and indeed, in my view, it often represents necessary nourishment and certainly I would not have increased it.</P>
    <P>I believe the tax on petrol and diesel oil was a most unwise tax.  I know many people at present who have purchased their first car and they are finding it just as much as they can do to keep it on the road.  They just have a car to take their wives and families out at the weekends and I think that this tax will put them off the road.  It will also make our already inefficient and expensive transport system more <Col N="726" /> expensive.  It will increase the costs of that transport and add to the costs of industry and agriculture and eventually make us less competitive.  In the EEC countries, that is one thing they believe in, a cheap and inexpensive transport system.</P>
    <P>There is no adequate provision that I can see in the Budget for either education or housing.  I remember on one occasion when the Minister for Health was introducing a Budget, he said that expenditure on education was not really, in the strict sense, expenditure, that it was investment.  Of course any reasonable person would agree with him because, if we are to keep pace with modern developments and get where we want to get as fast as possible, education is the most important aspect of our economy on which we should spend money.  If we are going to get anywhere, we will have to embark on very heavy expenditure on the provision of very many more schools and on sufficient teachers to man these schools.  In this respect we have fallen down rather badly.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable at present to see so many secondary schools &ldquo;up to their tonsils&rdquo; in debt and no provision being made in the Budget to meet these debts.  At the same time, we see the qualified religious personnel teaching in these schools being taxed the same as single men in the outside world when we know that their salaries are going to pay off the outstanding building debts on these institutions.  This is a great neglect on our part.  We are fortunate that we have so many people with ability, service and dedication and on top of that, we expect them to spend what should be their leisure hours in running raffles and bingo clubs to pay these expenses which should be normally borne by the State.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I wish to say a word or two about housing.  There is something all wrong here.  We are not taking the position seriously.  A housing emergency should be declared, especially in the Dublin region.  There is too much expenditure on luxury building; State offices, semi-State offices and other unnecessary buildings are going up at <Col N="727" /> the present time to which the Government are contributing money when thousands of our people are without homes and have no prospect of getting them.  I say these buildings are unnecessary at the moment because we could wait for a slump period to tackle them.</P>
    <P>We have our skilled personnel engaged on these works when they should be engaged on the provision of homes for our people.  There is a state of gang warfare throughout the country at the moment and it is not unconnected with the fact that many of our young people have no prospects of settling down and getting married and no prospect of a home, if they were so inclined.  There has been no alteration in the money provided for SDA houses and there is no check whatever on the profiteering that I believe is going on.  I know from my membership of a local authority the enormous gap there is between a local authority valuation of a house and the selling price of that house.  That gap is so great that people buying a house have to provide anything from £400 to £700 out of their own pockets.  Consequently, these houses are out of the reach of many of these people.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that no money appears to have been provided for improvements in the health services. The fact that there is a Select Committee inquiring at the moment into the health services is no excuse for not improving the present position. The upper limit for qualification for services under the Act was last fixed in 1958 and there has been no alteration since.  Another deplorable omission is that there is no provision whatever for families who are unfortunate enough to have a mentally defective child and who have to face a lifelong burden with such a child if it has a normal expectancy of life.</P>
    <P>My main complaint against the Budget is that there is no long-term planning in it.  It is just providing what it is expedient to get by with at the moment but there is no real indication of a forward looking Government policy or of a Government prepared to <Col N="728" /> develop the resources of the country as they should be developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard Budgets as nothing but a farce and a brake on the progress of our country.  There may be some good reason for having a Budget in countries such as the United States or Russia but I see no reason for having one in a little country such as this.  I see no reason why the whole tenor of our ways should be upset every year by this exercise in mental gymnastics on the part of our civil servants.  There are well-known limited companies operating even in this country and on its borders who turn over more money every year than we turn over in this country and they do not introduce budgets or bring out statements such as we bring out annually.  They bring out accounts to show how they are progressing, what might be called housekeeping accounts, but they do not keep on jumping up and down every year.</P>
      <P>I do not see any reason why we should not have a deficit in this country for one, two or three years. As a result of the Budget brought in here last year, there was very little good reason for introducing this type of Budget this year.  Taking a long-term view of things, matters would have righted themselves anyway and we could have let things jog along.  The sooner we realise that this annual Budget racket is not essential and that it is little better than a waste of time the more progress we will make.</P>
      <P>I have to admit to nothing but sympathy for the Minister for Finance because he has an impossible task. Whether he is right or whether he is wrong, he is always wrong.  Last year he was wrong because, allegedly, he taxed essentials.  This year, of course, he is wrong because he taxed luxuries. He was wrong last year because it happened that he did not give, as far as I remember, any very substantial incentive to the farmers.  This year he becomes a farmers man because he did try to help them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That attitude towards the Minister for Finance does not make a lot of sense to me because I have to look at it in this way.  It is remarkable that <Col N="729" /> everybody here knows what is wrong but there is nobody here who is prepared to say what is right, nobody who is prepared to tell the Minister exactly what he should do.  Worse still, there is nobody here who is prepared to say what he would be prepared to do if he got power, because he will not give away secrets.  That is not a very satisfactory way of dealing with matters.  It appears that we want higher benefits but, of course, lower taxes; we want better times for all but no increased charges; we want to pay everybody but to charge nobody.  It does not appear to be a very satisfactory type of economics but it does appear to be the backbone of the Opposition's idea of economics.  We in this House will have to live and see. Whether the Minister is right or wrong, he will be attacked.  He is wrong in any case.</P>
    <P>A peculiar type of mentality is at present being propagated in the country.  To my way of thinking it is a rather irresponsible attitude towards our affairs but everything is being done to propagate that attitude.  Certain papers are at it.  They are trying to pervert public opinion and, in many cases, to slight public opinion.  In fact, certain papers throughout this country go out of their way to hold Deputies up to ridicule so that they will not speak in this House.  That is going on, as we know.  The same attitude is being taken, of course, towards the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to see certain papers throughout the country carrying on that type of campaign against Deputies and against Ministers and to see the newspapers trying deliberately to stop us from opening our mouths. There is not a lot we can do about that outside of taking advantage of the very doubtful laws of libel.  But, it is a very different matter when Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann enter into this and deliberately go out of their way to try to stop us from speaking. I agree that some of this may be more appropriate on the Estimate for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is fair enough. We can raise it on the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>Last week the financial expert of the Fine Gael Party, named Deputy Harte, made a most despicable attack on certain members of this House in the Budget debate.  It was quite clear from Deputy Harte's statement that he insinuated that certain members of this House had been subjected to bribery. I want to say here and now that from the first day I came into this House until today I have never discussed with any member of this House the way in which I was going to vote and any effort which was made one way or the other to pervert my method of voting was made by members of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>In all fairness, I think, Sir, I am entitled to read out Deputy Harte's statement of 16th April.  It is reported in column 1971 of the Official Report of 16th April.  It is a most reprehensible statement and there is no other meaning to be taken out of it than that certain members of this House were bribed.  The statement is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, speaking on the Budget, I said there was one thing I admired the Fianna Fáil Party for&mdash; the manner in which they have succeeded in gulling the Irish people. They have perfected the art.  They have held on to office by as little as one vote.  No Prime Minister in the democratic countries of the world would have stayed in office in such circumstances.  The housewives of Dublin protested publicly in the streets.  Every organised body in the country protested.  Putting Party before the nation, the present Government stayed in office on as narrow a margin as one vote.  It could not have been narrower.  Rumours circulated in the Lobbies in relation to certain vital votes.  While most of <Col N="732" /> us pay little attention to rumour, it was quite obvious that there were certain aspects of these rumours that could not be ignored.  I fully appreciate that if I were called upon to prove these aspects, my task would be a most difficult one.  Many things are difficult to prove, but they still remain facts.</P>
    <P>That statement is beneath contempt. That vote was either mine or Deputy Sherwin's and I want to say publicly&mdash; any man in the House who knows me can prove this&mdash; I never even had a discussion in the House regarding how I should vote, much less about the question of accepting some financial reward.  That comes from Deputy Harte from the beautiful constituency of East Donegal, the headquarters of the smugglers of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>He is too cagey to say it outside.  He is afraid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a despicable statement to make in the House. However, I would not expect anything better from the smugglers of East Donegal.  This Budget has been called a farmers' Budget.  It is a misnomer. It is possible to call it a big farmers' Budget but definitely it is not a farmers' Budget.  I think it is only fair to say that the big farmers will be the men who benefit substantially as a result of this Budget.</P>
      <P>If some Bill were introduced, or if other steps were taken to help out shopkeepers, I do not for one moment believe such a measure would be aimed at giving all the benefits to the big shopkeepers.  However, this Budget is, generally speaking, aimed at giving the main benefits to the big farmers.  Any system of aid to farming should be worked out on a differential basis whereby the small farmers, the struggling men, would get the main benefits from any allocation of State moneys. After all, it is the small man who requires it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me&mdash;I hope I am wrong&mdash;that the man who will get the greatest assistance from this Budget is the farmer who, if he operated his farm properly, would not and should <Col N="733" /> not get any benefit from Government sources.  If I am wrong I should be glad to hear it from the Minister who, I hope, will examine this position and see that the small struggling farmers get the main benefits from any concessions given in the Budget.  It is not the big fellow, the fellow who goes to the races, to the funerals and to the dogs who needs such benefits.  If this Budget is aimed at giving such a farmer the larger slice, the small fellow will be sent west and to the dogs anyway.</P>
    <P>The new social welfare allowances have not been by any means excessive. I suggest the Minister should have gone out of his way to increase these allowances further.  If he had done so he would have had the backing of the House.  It appears to me that in many cases the troubles of social welfare recipients are not by any means the making of the Minister, because the means used to investigate what some of these people have are the very same means used in 1916.  I suggest the Minister should alter that or should endeavour to get the Minister for Social Welfare to do so.</P>
    <P>A rather peculiar situation arises in regard to these allowances.  The Minister has given certain increases but it now appears&mdash;I should like the Minister to clarify it&mdash;that as a result of recent increases, allowances under the income tax regulations will not be available to certain people.  If that is so it makes anathema out of the whole thing.  I am informed also, I do not know with what veracity, that the 12 per cent increase in wages and salaries will put a great number of people outside the scope of the Social Welfare Acts and that consequently they will be worse off after the increases than before them.</P>
    <P>If that is true, it more or less makes a joke of the whole matter.  I have this information from people who have come to me and made statements. Whether these statements are right or wrong I cannot say.  I can say, though, that it is no use giving a man an increase in income and then discovering that he is worse off than he was before he got it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> There has been a great hubbub in industrial circles about the increase of 1d on the postage stamp and of the increased charges for telephones and so on.  I should not mind that outcry if it had come from the ordinary person, the person who has to write to England to ask his son, daughter or other relative to send back money. Every company account I have read since I was born has shown an increased profit, year in year out.  I have no sympathy for those people.  They can take up a whole page in each morning newspaper in the State practically once a week, very often daily, at a colossal price, and I fail to see why they should crib about the penny increase on the postage stamp.</P>
    <P>All my sympathy is for the poorer sections, for the man who has to go out into the bog and is often forced to pay income tax on his miserable wage, for the county council worker, but I have none for the big businessman who can juggle his accounts to avoid paying income tax or any form of tax.</P>
    <P>There has been quite an uproar about the alterations in the prices of drink.  I do not think anybody should take that very seriously, and I speak as a publican.  When we are in a position to import the enormous amounts of drink shown on page 28, No. 10 of volume 29 of the <i>Licensed Vintner</i> for March of this year, it is past the time for us to cry halt to these imports. Surely, in a country like this where water is our chief commodity, it is nothing less than a public scandal that we are not able to turn out enough drink for ourselves without being forced to import it.  The Minister should have done it long ago.  There should be a much greater differential, in my opinion, between the price of Irish drinks and their foreign counterparts. I am not on the side of our Irish whiskey barons who refuse to meet either our or anybody else's taste. They are just a gang making so much profit that they do not give two hoots about anybody.  On the other hand, any steps we take in relation to the taxation of drink, or anything of that kind, must be taken to help our Irish farmers <Col N="735" /> and give them a chance of having their products properly utilised.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about education, lack of expenditure on education and our general backwardness, perhaps, in education.  If we are to become a prosperous nation in the foreseeable future, able to hold our own, we shall have to do something about our present educational standards. In many cases, our schools are not fit for pupils at all.  Our outlook on education is much the same as it was 40 years ago when, if one did not know Latin and Greek, one was an outcast, and certainly not a person of standing.  Today, if one knows Latin and Greek, one is regarded as an oddity, and I think rightly so.  We must bring ourselves into line with modern trends.  We can no longer allow our people to leave this country with a pick, a shovel and a pair of navvy's boots.  We must do something to ensure that, when our people leave us, they are in a position to earn a livelihood and compete with those amongst whom they will move in foreign lands. I make no apology to anyone for saying that.  Money spent on education is money well spent.  Scholarships must be substantially increased, and as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a great divergence of opinion with regard to agricultural and industrial development.  With regard to future development, the position of our country is unlikely to be any different from that of any other country. Other countries are losing agricultural workers.  The same appears to be the trend here.  It is essential, therefore, that there should be some other type of work available.  No doubt the mechanisation of agriculture has made it possible substantially to reduce the number of agricultural workers.  Unless we make efforts in some other direction to provide employment for them, they will have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>No matter what Opposition Deputies may say, industrial development is the only solution.  It is only some days ago that Deputy MacEoin stated here that the big difference between Fianna <Col N="736" /> Fáil and Fine Gael was that the Fine Gael Party developed what were regarded as essentials while the Fianna Fáil Party developed what were regarded as non-essentials.  I do not know where they would draw the line because, when Deputy MacEoin was in power, one of his first actions was to close down Bord na Móna, the Shannon Airport, and put a stop to progressive industries in the country.  I should be very pleased if someone on that side of the House would state what they regard as essentials and what they regard as non-essentials.  I am sure many of the younger generation would like to have the answer.</P>
    <P>I note that in recent times the effort made some years ago to attract industry to the west appears to have slackened off.  I think that is a very grave error.  The potential in the west is enormous.  The main body of our emigrants come from the west.  They do well in foreign lands, even in highly industrialised countries.  It must be accepted that, if they can do well in these highly industrialised countries, they could do equally well at home if they had the opportunity.</P>
    <P>I am afraid&mdash;I hope I am wrong&mdash; that most of our Budgets now, and most of our efforts, too, are aimed at making Dublin a prosperous and progressive area.  I do not think for one moment that prosperity and progress should mean merely bigger crowds in the pubs and smoke dens of Dublin.  I do not hold that view at all.  All our efforts should be aimed at ensuring a well-balanced population throughout the country, a population able to earn a livelihood in its own locality.  That is very important, in my opinion.  I feel &mdash;I am sure others feel it also&mdash;that this is one aspect that has been completely overlooked.</P>
    <P>We should not be afraid to invest in our country's future.  We are a comparatively new State.  Those who have any experience of emergent contries, such as Nigeria, know the huge sums of money that are being thrown into the development of these countries, with complete confidence in the future of these countries.  We have here, perhaps, the best country in the world if we are prepared to take the necessary <Col N="737" /> steps to develop it.  We should throw away our conservatism.  We are far too conservative I would prefer a gambler's Government any time to a conservative Government and, the bigger the gamblers, the more I would be inclined to back them.  We are far too conservative and until we reach the point at which we are prepared to take a chance, such as has been taken in other countries, we will not make any remarkable progress.  It is unfortunate, but until we reach that day, I am afraid we will not see progress.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have told the Government that the Government are wrong, but they have not said what the Government should cut out.  Should they cut out the power stations, the airports, Bord na Móna, wheat production, or increased prices for milk? What should they cut out?  They have told the Government they are all wrong, but not one Opposition Deputy has said what they should do.  It would be wise for us to regard ourselves as a grown-up and responsible nation, and not just a number of excitable factions, as some people in this House seem to regard us.  At this stage in our existence, we should turn our eyes forward and forget the bitterness of the past.  We should not be afraid to invest in progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the statement made by Deputy Clinton in his approach to the whole question of the budgetary requirements of this country.  He said that Fianna Fáil as an organisation and a Party are adept at gulling the public.  It seems rather significant that in the quotation Deputy Leneghan gave Deputy Harte used the same words.</P>
      <P>I have listened to speeches denigrating Fianna Fáil and their achievements. Denigration is a poor substitute for a constructive approach to the problems that face the country.  In my opinion, the Budget is a reasonable and sensible approach to our financial requirements.  It is based on the principle of putting taxation mainly on non-essentials and, at the same time, it is directed to expansion on the national front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> The Taoiseach pointed out in the recent by-elections, and reiterated here, that the question before the country was whether the people wanted national economic development and social progress, in the full knowledge that they would cost more.  The electorate of Kildare and Cork, in very intensive campaigns, showed in a clear and unmistakable manner that they wanted further economic development and social progress.  They clearly indicated, by returning the two Fianna Fáil candidates, that they wanted more assistance for agriculture, a further expansion of the tourist industry, more incentives for industrialisation, better social services and improved educational facilities, in the belief that they are required for the future of the country, and in the full knowledge that they would cost money.</P>
    <P>As a city dweller, I know that some people fail to appreciate the necessity for laying emphasis on agriculture in the Budget.  If one is impartial, one must agree with the statement recently broadcast by the Minister for Agriculture, when he said that, if the farming community were in trouble, the rest of the country would be in trouble, and, if the farming community are prosperous, the rest of the country is also prosperous.  I accept that with just one reservation.  There is one class in the community who will never be prosperous, the old age pensioners.  I know that Fianna Fáil Governments down through the years have never shirked their responsibilities towards those classes and, on every occasion the economy permitted it, they have given them increases.</P>
    <P>I share in the disappointment expressed not only from the opposite benches but from this side of the House, with the amount of the social welfare increases.  I am also keeping in mind the small increases in Old IRA pensions.  In these days when there is an air of affluence in society generally, we owe a special responsibility to those classes and particularly to the Old IRA who bore the brunt of those glorious years, especially those Old IRA men who are incapacitated and unable to follow their former occupations.  I hope that <Col N="739" /> in future Budgets the Minister will not only make more generous provisions for old age pensioners, but that he will also keep in mind the claims of the diminishing numbers of Old IRA men.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the Budget to the injection into the economy of the 12 per cent wage increase.  I welcome that, and I feel it will help to maintain the level of commercial activity which has been a marked feature of the economy during the past year or so.  More money in circulation means more goods and more luxuries are in demand.  In that connection, I appeal to the manufacturers, who, as I know, are conscious of the need for developing their business, while concentrating on their export business, not to neglect the home market.  With the lowering of tariffs, more competitive goods are coming in here, and that may result in a lessening demand for home products.</P>
    <P>Public representatives, trade organisations and responsible interests have always stressed the value of Irish manufactured goods and have said they were as good as imported articles. We must remember that some of these imported articles have generations of skill behind them which our salesmen may find it difficult to counter.  I hope manufacturers of Irish goods catering for the home market will not neglect to watch that trend, and take the necessary steps to meet it.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the housing situation in Dublin and throughout the country.  I should like to point out that this Budget provides double the amount provided in 1957 for housing.  As a member of the Corporation, I know that the Corporation can proceed with their programmes for housing in the full knowledge that adequate moneys will be made available.  That is in marked contrast to the situation that developed here when the Opposition Parties formed a Government a few years ago.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to a sitaution which has arisen as a result of the exorbitant <Col N="740" /> prices paid for building sites in Dublin. Prices of up to £800 and £900 have been sought and obtained for building sites.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that would be a matter for the Estimates? It is a detail in the housing question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it arises under the Budget?  It arises in relation to profiteering in building sites.  I want to point out that because of this development people are being denied an opportunity of availing of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I do not know what steps can be taken to suggest a way to deal with it but I honestly think that in the public interest the matter should be dealt with. I urge the Minister to give it his attention.</P>
      <P>That is all I have to say on this important measure.  I congratulate the Minister on other aspects of his Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJOKeefe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have offered on a number of occasions now, since the commencement of this debate on the Budget, and it was always my intention to preface my remarks by saying that it is anything but a good Budget. Having listened to Deputy Booth yesterday evening one would get the impression that it is a wonderful Budget and that the Government should be acclaimed.  It is very fortunate for Deputy Booth that there will be no general election in the near future, or he might find it a difficult task to persuade the housewives of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area.  I think, by now, the people of this country must have lost all faith and all confidence in the Government, and particularly in the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twelve months ago, when the Minister introduced his Budget, he brought in a new form of taxation to this country in the nature of a turnover tax.  On that occasion, he said that one of the reasons he introduced this new type of taxation was that the old reliables of petrol, cigarettes, beer and spirits had reached saturation point as <Col N="741" /> far as taxation was concerned.  I feel the Minister was very sincere when he made that statement.  I feel the Minister believes at the present day that such is the case.</P>
    <P>I believe that the 2½ per cent turnover tax would this year have been increased at least to 3¾ per cent but for the strong opposition the Government met last year not alone from this side of the House but from the country as a whole.  The Minister thought it wiser not to increase the turnover tax but to fall back again on the old reliables of petrol, cigarettes, beer and spirits.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister anticipates an income of £14 million from the turnover tax during this coming year, he found it necessary to look for a further £7 million. Out of that £21 million he has found it possible to contribute £730,000 to the non-contributory old age pensioners&mdash;in other words, an increase of 2/6d per week or, with the present-day spending value of that amount, an increase of roughly 10d a week.</P>
    <P>We are asked to forget about the past.  We are asked to think of the present and to look forward to the future.  I have no doubt that the old age pensioners will never forget 1964 with the ever-increasing cost of living and their increase in pension of 2/6d a week.</P>
    <P>I would advocate a minimum pension of £5 per week for any old age pensioner and his wife.  I have no doubt that the taxpayer will not grudge paying extra taxes on luxuries if the extra taxation is devoted to giving the old age pensioners a little comfort for the remaining years of their lives.  I do not say that £5 per week will give them luxury.  I think it would barely give them an existence.  Those people who have worked all their lives as labourers or unskilled or even skilled workers but who were not in a pensionable position have contributed to the progress of the country.  For the remaining years of their lives, they should have at least enough to give them an existence.  I strongly appeal to the Minister to consider an increase to this class of people to a minimum of £5 per week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> I come now to the subject of petrol. An increase of 3d per gallon in petrol is, in fact, approximately an increase of five per cent.  This tax will cause widespread hardship.  Every section of the community will be affected.  The cost of collecting and delivering essentials&mdash;milk and all other food-stuffs&mdash;will be affected.  When we consider the amount of petrol consumed in the country, five per cent is a very big increase.  Taxi drivers are a very wonderful asset, in their way, to this country.  They have now to face an increase of five per cent in the cost of their fuel.  They should have been considered for exemption, like CIE.</P>
    <P>The Budget ought to provide greater incentive and encouragement for future economic development.  Unless confidence can be inculcated, our economic targets will not be achieved.  I suggest that a proper scale of priorities should be planned in order that investments may be made where best results can be achieved.</P>
    <P>If our economic growth is to continue, the assurance of markets for our agricultural and industrial projects is absolutely essential and here I think the Government have failed very badly.  I think that marketing is largely neglected by the Government.  Producers, agricultural or otherwise, must be certain of their markets.  Our traditional market is in England and the Government should explore every possibility of improving that market. It was always Fine Gael policy to negotiate agreements wherever possible. The Department of Industry and Commerce should form a marketing division as an internal measure. It is very important that something should be done to guarantee markets for our producers.</P>
    <P>While I am not a farmer or an agricultural Deputy, I have studied very carefully the demands of the NFA and I feel their demand for 4d a gallon was justified.  I thought they put up a very good case for it.  Although they have been granted 2d a gallon, from Friday morning, the Dublin housewife will have to meet a 4d a gallon increase, an eight per cent increase, in the cost of milk alone.  Over the past few years, we have been advocating <Col N="743" /> increased consumption of milk and now consumers must meet this eight per cent increase.  Up to this we have no idea how it will effect the price of butter.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need for further savings and any policy that will lead to that goal would be of great service to the nation.  Our percentage of savings, 12 per cent, is very low in comparison with other European countries which average around 18 per cent.  A better balance between savings and investments is required.</P>
    <P>The smaller businessmen in the cities and in rural areas expected some relief in this Budget, either in rates or taxes. They must be most disappointed by the Government's failure to give such relief.  That has given the green light to foreign multiples to come here and open supermarkets.  Eventually, it will only be a matter of time until the small businessman, the family groceries that have given valuable service over the centuries, will be obliterated.  By failing to give that section of the community some relief, the Minister has virtually told them: &ldquo;Your days are numbered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see the Minister gave some extra contribution to housing. Only we in Dublin know the housing situation where at present there are cases of up to 16 and 17 persons living in two-bedroom houses. There is nothing we can do to relieve that situation but I am glad the Minister has given some extra help to ease the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth boasted about the wonderful achievement of the Taoiseach this year in arranging the 12 per cent increase in wages which was accepted by the Congress of Trade Unions.  I do not think for a moment that, on the occasion of that agreement, Congress thought that the price of commodities and services would increase by so much in such a short time.  I cannot see how this 12 per cent agreement will last for two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amused listening to Deputy O'Keeffe.  I do not think he was serious.  Walter Lippman is a very shrewd political observer and he <Col N="744" /> said that politicians had a habit of seeming to say something they do not mean.  That applies to all politicians. I would agree with the £5 a week to pensioners which the Deputy suggested and I would vote for it, if he first tells us from whom the £40 million is to be collected.  We are told that the 2/6 increase costs £700,000.  In that case, 10/- extra would cost about £3 million.  If we jump from 35/- to £5, you must multiply by six and you get £18 million and &mdash;not forgetting the odd 5/-&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  That would mean an extra 15/-.  If it takes £700,000 to give 2/6, we must multiply that by six.  That applies only to the non-contributory class but if they get 50/-, the contributory class would have to jump also.  That would cost another couple of million.  You cannot give one class of social beneficiaries a substantial increase and ignore others.  One thing about this Government is that whenever they give an increase, they give it all round, but the Coalition Parties never did that.  If they gave something to the contributory pensioners, they did not give it to the non-contributory class, or if they gave it to the non-contributory class, they did not give it to the unemployed. Always, they gave it to only one or two sections and therefore they were doing it on the cheap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the best of my recollection, every time this Government gave an increase, it was an all-round increase, to pensioners, widows and orphans and unemployed and, even in the past couple of years, disabled persons.  You cannot substantially increase allowances to one section without doing the same for all the other sections.  No matter how you look at the suggestion, it would cost at least £10 million.  I accept that.  But on whom would you put the £10 million?  It is all right to say &ldquo;luxury goods&rdquo; but what luxury goods?  Would that put luxury goods <Col N="745" /> out of business?  Would anyone buy them?  Can they be exported?  Would it mean thousands unemployed?  I want to know what luxury goods, and I want to hear exactly and specifically what would be got on each specific luxury article.  If it were television sets, how much would be got?  What would you have to tax to get so much? That is how business is done.  It is no use seeming to say something and not meaning it.  If you say that £10 million more should be given to those people, I agree, and I shall vote for it.  That is the difference between me and the Opposition.  I shall vote for it but they will not.  I shall vote for all the taxation.</P>
    <P>I voted for a halfcrown this year and a halfcrown last year and if the Government put on 10/- this year, I shall vote for it, and if they put on taxation of £20 million, I shall vote for it, but the Opposition will not. There is no use in saying something and not meaning it.  It is all very fine talking and saying you will do this and you will do that.  I have strived for those people in my own way and I believe as an individual I have done more for them than anyone in Dublin or Ireland.  I go about the thing sensibly and intelligently.  I ask myself: who will pay for this and how much will it cost?  I reason out things.  Is it feasible?  I do not seem to say it and not mean it.  I mean it.</P>
    <P>Here in Dublin Corporation, I pressed hard to get certain reductions for a certain class of people by way of social benefits and, through hard work, I got certain decreases in differential rents.  I did that and they benefited by £13,500 per year.  I went about the thing sensibly.  I said to myself that the manager would not reduce the rents, but that he might reduce them for the old age pensioners.  I approached him and argued it out. He said: &ldquo;All right; I will not object to this for old age pensioners but it must go on the others.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Each year I do that.  I go my own way and I have managed to arrange that these increases in the differential rents do not apply to the old age pensioners in the Corporation.  I take the facts, work them out and get <Col N="746" /> results.  That is very different from merely saying that pensioners should get something.  The question is: how much is it and who will pay for it? What can be got on those commodities about which they are talking?  Will they get £1 million or £10 million?  Speaking for myself, if the Opposition make a specific proposal that certain goods should be taxed in order to give them 10/-, I shall vote for it.  If the Opposition, a month before the next Budget, decide that they will vote for increased taxation, I shall support them.  If the Opposition had sent a deputation to the Minister for Finance and if they told him straight away: &ldquo;We will vote for increased taxation if you give so much to the old age pensioners&rdquo;, I believe the Government would have accepted it.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the old age pensioners cannot get enough is that the Government are fighting the Opposition tooth and nail for every farthing they give.  Do not forget that.  Every solitary farthing the old age pensioners get every year, the Government have to risk losing a general election in order to give it.  To get the money to give the miserable&mdash;lousy, if you like &mdash;halfcrown, things have to be taxed and the Opposition vote against it. The Government have to face this.  In other words, the Government have to face murderous opposition every year and are in danger of being thrown out of office for every single penny they give those people.  They have to fight to get a halfcrown, or whatever it is, and they are taking a terrible risk.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that the Government have other responsibilities than just the old age pensioners.  They have never confined their benefits to the old age pensioners.  They have granted benefits all round&mdash;the unemployed, the widows and the orphans. The unemployed have done well and have admitted to me that they have done well.  Last year they got not only an extra 5/- but an increase in children's allowances.  People can spend money only in proportion to the amount they get to spend.  You cannot talk about the cost of steak and caviare when the fellow you are talking <Col N="747" /> about does not buy steak and caviare. You can only talk about the things he buys and the amount he has to spend. Therefore, if you deal with it in that manner you will say to yourself: &ldquo;He has 5/- to spend.  What did the 2½ per cent cost him?  &ldquo;It must work out that it cost him only a couple of bob.  What did he get last year between the 5/- and the children's allowances?  It worked out at 10/- or 11/-.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the old age pensioners do not get a lot, or so it seems. The fact remains that they got a halfcrown last year and a halfcrown this year.  That is 5/-.  The halfcrown last year at least covered the turnover tax, because, notwithstanding all the exaggerations, it did not cost more than three or 3½ per cent, even with profiteering.  By reason of the fact that a person has only a certain amount of money to spend, the turnover tax will cost him only so much, no matter how it is worked out.  So it can be said that, even if it is not a lot, the halfcrown this year is an increase of a halfcrown in the old age pensioner's standard of living.  If last year's halfcrown was absorbed by certain increases, at least this year's halfcrown is a halfcrown improvement. It is not a lot, but it is an improvement.</P>
    <P>One can argue whatever way one likes because, no matter what things cost, the old age pensioner can spend only 30/- &mdash;that is all.  Therefore, whether the turnover tax is 6d or 9d in the £1, out of the 30/- he has to spend, how can it cost him more than a bob or two?  He does not buy steak or caviare.  At least the 2/6 this year is an increase and I am hoping that there will be another increase next year.  I expect things will settle down. Arising out of the recent Budget, there may be increases here and there, but I expect that in a short time, prices will settle down and that next year with a balanced Budget, the Government will be a bit more generous.</P>
    <P>It is no use coming in here and talking foolhardily about giving people pounds unless it is said with honesty and said by people who know what they are saying.  I read a lot of tripe <Col N="748" /> in the papers every night, and see figures affecting one thing or another, by people who do not know what they are talking about.  A wise man said to me not to answer them for I would have to write every night.</P>
    <P>I want to make one thing clear.  I will vote for any extra money for the old age pensioners.  I say, and repeat it, if a deputation goes to the Minister one month before next year's Budget and says: &ldquo;Give those people an extra 10/- and we shall agree to your taxation; we will even allow that you need more money for other things besides old age pensioners,&rdquo; and if the Opposition agree to vote for taxation, the old age pensioners will be better off by 10/- or £1 next year. But will they do it?  They have never done it before.</P>
    <P>Let us come back to this business of talking about what they will give or what should be given.  The fact is that they actually fight tooth and nail against a solitary penny being given to old age pensioners.  They bitterly fight every penny of taxation and they work up the people who have to pay it so that they march around, as they did all last year, and the Government in giving a few shillings in reliefs risk their political lives.  Last year we were told that they should have had the traditional taxes.  This year, there is what are called the traditional taxes and still the taxes are all opposed. Whether we like it or not, the Government wanted £7 million.  I am not a farmer, but I understand that those people make a big contribution to the economy, and I understand that two-thirds of our exports consist of agricultural goods.  I believe the Government must have studied this matter carefully.  The Government do not give away money for nothing.  They must have found it necessary to give this money in order to boost the economy and encourage people to export, to engage labour and so on.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Government are in a position to know what they should do and if they think this is the best thing to do, then I accept it.  If they had to give £5 million, all right, but then they had to find another £2 million for other essential purposes.  There was a time <Col N="749" /> when there was very little taxation but that was at a time when the old age pensioners went into a poorhouse, when widows did not get anything, when there was little or no industry, no money to invest in industry, or to subsidise industry, and when there was a handful of well-to-do people and a mass of paupers.  In fact, from the day when more enlightened opinion decided on taxation, it has been bitterly opposed.  It has been fought on every rung of the ladder.  The first taxes were introduced in the Napoleonic period when income tax was introduced to pay for the Napoleonic wars.  That was bitterly opposed by thousands of marchers who marched around London and they have kept on marching down the years against every form of taxation. When the British Government decided in 1910 or 1911 to give the 5/-old age pension, there was murder in the Commons: people said the country would go bankrupt, that there would be a revolution.</P>
    <P>Every £1 of taxation is fought, whether it is honest criticism is another thing.  We all know, as I said before, that politics is a hanky-panky business and whether the Opposition believe in it or not, they are compelled by this form of Government, this form of democracy, to oppose.  If they do not oppose and if they do not put the Government in the worst possible light, they can never get back.  It is all very fine to do that and I suppose the Government will have to put up with it.  The Opposition had to put up with it when they were in power.  Last year, I listened to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, telling us about the misrepresentations of the Fianna Fáil Opposition and all the things they did on him when he was Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>That is why I suppose it does not do to become excited in here.  As my colleague, Deputy Barron, said to me: &ldquo;Don't get excited.  Develop a thick skin; you have to have it in this game&rdquo;. I suppose so, but it is amusing to think that we are regarded outside as being serious.  I do not take all these objections to the turnover tax seriously because they are all codology.  The <Col N="750" /> day we stop taxing people will be the day the country will go down.  Taxation means that somebody is being relieved, somebody is being helped; the country as a whole is being helped in an industrial sense.</P>
    <P>The remarkable thing is that despite all the talk, the country is doing well and everybody is happy.  Do not mind the odd moan.  In regard to the turnover tax, all the alarms that were expressed were just figments of the imagination.  The tax was a very small one and once the people received the 12 per cent increase, they reasoned that the 12 per cent was better than 2½ per cent and that ended the turnover tax. You can work it out what way you like, but I am satisfied that those who received the 12 per cent increase are still 70 to 80 per cent on the right side.  It is no use saying that this cost so much and that cost so much.</P>
    <P>If you take the new increases for postal services, you will see that it will cost the worker little or nothing.  I do not believe that a worker sends a telegram once a year or that the average worker uses a telephone once a month. If he sends a letter, it will be at Christmas or on an odd occasion to somebody in England.  These increases do not affect the workers at all.  They affect the people in business who write many letters daily and send telegrams for business purposes.  It was better to put these increases on that class of person than on the worker.  If we did not get the money, we should have had to increase the £7 million referred to in the Budget to £9 million.  Perhaps I have said a little too much about this matter.  We do not take ourselves seriously but the people outside do and that is the unfortunate thing.</P>
    <P>I like to read Deputy Dillon's speeches because, as Leader of the Opposition, he is supposed to represent the alternative Government.  He referred to an expansion of industrial exports.  That takes money.  The people engaged in that business have to be helped by subsidies of one class or another.  It means we keep people employed and help our balance of payments position.  He says that there must be better plans for agricultural exports.  Again that takes money and <Col N="751" /> the Government are helping those people.  Whether it is rich farmers or poor farmers who are getting the benefit, I do not know.  Politicians will break it down and they will have an argument about it.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Government knew what they were doing.  He says there should be more money for education.  That takes money; that there should be more for housing, and we have got more for housing.  All of the things to which Deputy Dillon referred require money and that means more taxation.  Deputy Dillon has a habit which surprises me because, as Leader of the Opposition, he is supposed to see things on a loftier plane.</P>

      <P>Yes.  He has a habit of asking small time questions, questions that relate more to a local authority.  Half the questions put down on the Order Paper are questions that could be asked of any city manager and thus time is wasted here.  He is always harping on the subject of houses falling down.  The houses that fell down were anything from 150 to 200 years old.  They were there in his time and if all those dwellings should have been demolished, well, he was in power seven years ago and he was in power for ten years from 1922-32.  He was in power on three occasions. Therefore it was as much the responsibility of his Government to have those houses demolished.  It could have happened that those houses could have fallen down eight years ago when he was in office.  I am making a point about all the small talk in which he indulges and tries to blame the Government or the Corporation because houses fall down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the hope of the Corporation that they would be able to tackle the problem of the big families on the waiting list and then tackle those dwellings but unfortunately some of them fell down and now we have to give all our time to dangerous dwellings. Deputy Dillon cannot understand that but, if he does not understand it, he should leave the matter to <Col N="752" /> his colleagues who are members of the Corporation.  They are the worst attenders there, but, even so, he should leave it to them.  Instead of doing that, he says things here in the hope that ignorant people outside will accept what he says.</P>
    <P>I want to quote here the minutes of the Municipal Council for 1957.  This was the year the Coalition Government were beaten and the present Government came into office.  Councillor Larkin was then chairman of the Housing Committee.  He was an active labour man and a member of this House and to a large extent he always dominated the proceedings of the planning section of the Housing Committee. If anybody is responsible for the work of the planning section, it is Councillor Larkin.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with his work, but, if Deputy Dillon is right, he is attacking Councillor Larkin who is an active labour leader and a good active member of the Corporation.</P>
    <P>It is recorded in the minutes of the Municipal Council on page 155 that Deputy Larkin wanted to know the number of dwellings under construction during the years from 1948 to 1957.  The last Coalition Government came into office in 1954 and went out in 1957.  In 1954, the total number of houses under construction was 2,638.  On 1st August, 1957, a couple of months after the Coalition went out of office, the number was 963.  That was the crash in housing development brought about by the Coalition during their three years in office and that is what started the big decline.  There is no hanky-panky business about it; it is there for everybody to read.</P>
    <P>Only 963 dwellings were under construction on 1st August, 1957, but on 1st August, 1954, 2,638 dwellings were under construction.  Taking the same date, the total number of men employed, skilled and unskilled, on 1st August 1954, was 2,378.  On 1st August, 1957, the total number of men employed was 925.  Does that answer all the questions?</P>
    <P>Councillor Larkin also asked a question about the number of men employed on site development.  That has to do with the period when Fianna <Col N="753" /> Fáil took over office because, if there was no site development, they could not build.  Site development is carried out years in advance.  On 1st August, 1955, there were 233 men employed and on 1st August, 1957, there were only 134 men employed on site development.</P>
    <P>There we see the whole momentum of housebuilding slowing down.  Where there was no site development we could not continue to build more than a certain number of dwellings.  In the same years, 1956 and 1957, all SDA loans ceased and all building of private dwellings ceased.  I am not blaming any Government for that.  The only thing a Government are expected to do is to see that the money is there but we never had any trouble about money until 1956 and 1957.  Then there was no money.  The banks would not lend us any money.</P>
    <P>There was no site development and later on our skilled personnel went to England.  There was not then so much need for housebuilding as many of our workers had gone to England but there was need for a lot of flat building. We could not build the flats because no sites had been developed. In 1959 and 1960, many of our people were going to England.  Half the people who had been engaged in site development were sacked.  We had houses for thousands of people but we did not have the flats we needed and we could not build them because of lack of sites.</P>
    <P>It takes years to gain momentum in housebuilding, to get the machinery and the men moving.  When the whole thing crashed and the men went to England, we found ourselves with practically no skilled men available. That is the reason for the present position, so let us hear no more about housing.  Things are said here by people who do not know what they are talking about.  I gather that Deputy Dillon gets his information from his supporters but they know very little about it as they are the worst attenders at the meetings of the Corporation Housing Committee.  I am surprised that he leaves himself open in this way but I wish I could get him on television, <Col N="754" /> with him on one side and myself on the other.  I would love that.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House any longer except to say that I will vote for increased taxation next year if the Government are prepared to give better benefits to the old age pensioners and other social welfare beneficiaries. If the Opposition want an extra 10/-a week for these classes next year, let them go to the Minister for Finance and give him a guarantee that they will vote for increased taxation and I believe they will get it.  Let them give up this business of seeming to say something which they do not mean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the effects of this Budget, there are a number of serious questions which we must ask and to which we expect serious answers.  For instance, I cannot understand the contradictory attitude of the Minister with regard to Irish manufactured goods, having regard to the protective tariffs that exist here at the moment and the moves made to reduce the tariff wall.  The Minister is setting about increasing tariffs, for instance, on imported spirits.  I cannot understand why the distillers, if you like, are being favoured in this connection and why other producers of Irish manufactured goods are not being favoured.  The Minister undoubtedly must realise that cloth manufacturers are suffering a great deal of redundancy, gradually, as a result of the breaking down of the tariff walls.  That being so, surely the Minister should have another look at this matter, particularly when he finds himself in the position of being able to take the action I have referred to in relation to imported spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, may I say that I agree with the idea of putting a tariff on imported spirits, because, if nothing else, it does display to all and sundry, an interest in the production of Irish goods.  But I do not believe such action on the part of the Minister should be one-sided because we do not seem to be in a hurry now about entering the Common Market or, at least, it appears that it can wait for a while.  I also want to point out that repeated representations have been made to the Minister's <Col N="755" /> colleague with regard to his reduction of tariff walls because of the heavy impact that has had on Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I want, at this stage, to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance for the manner in which he spoke in favour of a number of unorganised workers throughout the country.  I earnestly hope his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will take notice of what the Parliamentary Secretary said because, on previous occasions, when Deputies from these benches endeavoured to draw the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to what was happening to unorganised workers and to the fact that a considerable number of employers were deliberately contravening the Constitution, the Minister for Industry and Commerce refused to do anything about it.  We know, in fact, that the majority of catering workers are in a state of servitude almost, but nothing has been done in the Department, because the people who employ them are allowed to deny them the simple right to join a trade union.</P>
    <P>I must express disappointment that the Minister has not faced up to the problem of the housing situation, not only in Dublin but throughout the country.  I do not intend to enter into a discussion about the houses that fell down.  I want to make a few simple points in relation to the houses that are being built and in relation to the obstacles that confront some persons trying to obtain houses.  Take young couples intending to get married.  The Minister has done nothing up to the present time and he is doing nothing in this Budget to afford an opportunity to people to get houses by way of purchase, for the simple reason that he has neglected to do anything about the maximum of £16, above which income, even if it is exceeded by 1d only a person is not entitled to obtain a loan or grant from the local authority.</P>
    <P>While that most unfair situation exists, young couples intending to get married are being asked to deposit £300 to £400 for a house.  They might <Col N="756" /> as well be asked to produce £3,000. Nothing is being done in connection with that problem.  I deplore the fact that the Minister has not wakened up to that position.  I should have thought that the Minister for Local Government would have drawn his attention to it.  Surely, by now, the Minister must realise the need that exists for the extension of a total loan to such people and the need to prevent builders from exploiting them?</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the differential rents system and I do not intend to elaborate on it.  We know the effect the increase in the maximum differential rent has had on the people of Dublin.  They should be assured by the Minister that there will be no further increase in the maximum differential rent next year or the year after or, perhaps, until the next round of wage increases, and that might be before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has neglected to face up to the problem affecting people who have to pay rents.  Again we go back to the potential house purchaser.  There are a very considerable number of people who have saddled themselves with heavy rents and who have to face up to the taxation that is brought about, in the main, as a result of levying health charges which should come from the national Exchequer. Deputy Sherwin adverted to some statements made by Deputy O'Keeffe. I am not here to defend Deputy O'Keeffe but he did suggest that a case should be made for taxation and that people should see where the taxes go.</P>
    <P>If we levy taxes and find ourselves with a certain number of millions of pounds to disburse, we must ascertain who needs it most.  It is most ironical that out of £7 million taxation, the Minister has decided to devote only £750,000 to social welfare beneficiaries. I say that is loading matters against the people who really need help.</P>
    <P>I was shocked to hear Deputy Sherwin state, in referring to the 12 per cent wage increase, that the workers concerned were now better off to the extent of 70 to 80 per cent.  I know he did not mean that they had obtained a 70 to 80 per cent increase in wages but he was implying that of <Col N="757" /> the total 12 per cent increase they obtained, they required only 20 per cent to catch up and the other 80 per cent makes them better off.  That is absolute nonsense.  The smallest child in the street can refute that statement. It is perfectly obvious that Deputy Sherwin has not familiarised himself with the increase in the cost of living that has taken place.  I shall not refer at length to what Deputy Sherwin said about workers using the postal service. A considerable number of workers in Dublin, for instance, send home money to their relatives in the country every week.  They are not that neglectful. There are a very considerable number of people who write to each other. Families are not so estranged that they do not write to each other.</P>
    <P>There is another point I want to make in connection with social welfare benefits.  It demonstrates the Minister's inconsistency.  The people concerned did not get a 12 per cent increase.  Yet, there was a national agreement for a 12 per cent increase.  Employees of the State got increases in wages but those people on the lowest rung of the ladder, the people who could not defend themselves, the people who are unorganised, the social welfare beneficiaries, did not get 12 per cent.  They did not even get the Taoiseach's eight per cent.  These people got about 4d a day.  If Deputy Sherwin wants to interest himself sufficiently, he will realise that some of that money is already being eaten up in many ways and more of it will be eaten up.</P>
    <P>Then I come to public service pensioners. They get an increase of five per cent.  I wonder would the Minister prevail on his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, to do something for the existing CIE pensioners? Some of them have pensions of only 12/- a week.  We come then to the point I made originally: who needs it most?  Since the introduction of the Budget and, we are told, as a result of it, certain commodities have increased in price.  The Minister may contradict it, but there is no doubt that milk is being increased in price by a halfpenny a pint.  Can we be assured there will be no increase in the price of butter, in the price of cheese, in the <Col N="758" /> prices of the many other commodities made from milk?  We are entitled to get that information from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I should like to get from the Minister a positive assurance that there will be proper price control in the wake of this Budget.  It is no use suggesting that investigations will be or are being carried out.  We need a positive understanding now on price stabilisation.  Otherwise, the 12 per cent increase in wages and salaries, for which Fianna Fáil have repeatedly taken credit&mdash;unjustifiably, as everyone knows&mdash;will be quickly nullified and we shall find ourselves looking for further increases.</P>
    <P>That would be a most serious consequence when we take into consideration the Taoiseach's warnings that the country could just about afford a six per cent increase in incomes, that the highest we could possibly afford was eight per cent.  If the organised workers look for more, the blood is on the Minister's hands.  He must have a proper understanding with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on methods of controlling prices.  I am not one to give vent to rumours, but recently I was told that before the recent increase in drink prices the Minister for Industry and Commerce had a survey made of prices in this city.  I understand the result was that there were large profits. However, the report of that inquiry never came to light.  It went into the waste paper basket.  I suggest, therefore, that the Minister for Finance should keep a wary eye on prices following this Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget annually affords us an opportunity to pass judgment on Government policy and I rise tonight to comment on Government policy as illustrated in the Budget Statement.  I have been in the House for most of the debate and was unfortunate enough to have to listen to two contributions from Deputy Sherwin.  He seems to take it on himself to come into the House on all occasions and conduct himself as a lecturer addressing his remarks to the Opposition.  What heights Deputy Sherwin has attained that would <Col N="759" /> qualify him to become the lecturer he professes to be I do not know.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, we had fierce verbosity from Deputy Sherwin, made up in the main of complete nonsense.  This was carried a stage further in his contribution on the Budget.  He told the House he was an honest man.  I do not doubt the honesty of Deputy Sherwin as an individual but I take him to task on the honesty of his statements.  He used the privilege of the House during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I can take him to task on what he said some minutes ago on the Budget.  He came into the House to abuse the people from his constituency who wrote letters in the evening newspapers criticising his attitude in last year's Budget debate to the 2½ per cent turnover tax.  He said he did not consider it fitting that he should answer them, but he then came into the House to cover himself with its privilege to abuse these people who were only exercising their democratic rights.</P>
      <P>In discussing the Budget in general, I shall relate my remarks to the statements of four Deputies who spoke on it.  I propose first to take the statement of a friend of mine who originally came from my county, a man recognised as the spokesman for the Fianna Fáil backbenchers.  Before I make any remarks about his contribution, I should like to say I am glad to see him back in the House in good health.  I hope he will continue with us for many years.  We are all glad to see him back after his brief illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer, of course, to Deputy P.J. Burke.  He said, in his eloquent address to the House on the Budget, that this was not a farmers' Budget.  I could not agree more and I am particularly pleased to hear a Fianna Fáil Deputy say so.  Deputy McQuillan said the entire policy of the Government was aimed at removing the people from the <Col N="760" /> land of the west and replacing them with cattle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leneghan from my constituency said tonight that the Budget was not a small farmer's Budget.  With him I also agree.  Then we had Deputy Harte from Donegal, who said the country cannot afford Fianna Fáil.  I come from a constituency made up, in the main, of small farmers.  I preface my remarks by saying that in days gone by the small farmer was the backbone of the country.  In the west, the small farmers are in the majority. They survived hard and difficult times, including those of Cromwell.  I am satisfied they will survive the present Government and their efforts to destroy and annihilate them.</P>
    <P>I am not a practising farmer.  I make my living from commercial interests, but I concede, as must any businessman, that we derive our living directly or indirectly from the incomes of farmers.  We are facing increased emigration.  Small villages are disappearing and, if not already dead, small towns are dying, all as a result of the lag in the incomes of the farming community.  It is conceded by all economists that our basic industry is agriculture.  Our exports come in the main from agriculture.  The Irish farmer feeds not only the Irish community but his exports pay for the machinery and raw material of Irish industry generally.  The fact remains that the greater part of the £140 million of our exports last year came directly from the produce of the land of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We had hoped in the west that, as a result of statements made by the Taoiseach and responsible Ministers during the year, some effort would be made to set about solving the grave problem that exists in counties such as Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Kerry, and West Cork.  We had hoped that, if the Government were sincere in their efforts to put this country on a proper footing, some real, genuine effort would be made to put the small farmer on a sound economic basis.  The small farmer represents the biggest producing section in our community.  That stands to reason because you have a far greater number of small farmers than <Col N="761" /> you have of large farmers.  If we are to put agriculture on a sound, economic basis, is it not logical to conclude that it is the small farmer who must be put in a healthy position? If one removes counties like Meath, Westmeath, Kildare and parts of Wexford, the remainder of the Republic consists in the main of counties in which there are only small farmers.</P>
    <P>Last year, we had relief for the farmer in the form of rates relief, a contribution from Central Funds in the form of a subsidy towards agricultural rates.  I am a member of a local authority in County Mayo and I can tell the House that the rate relief given to the majority of my constituents was practically nil and the volume of money <i>pro rata</i> with other counties was insignificant.</P>
    <P>Again, this year, we had a similar effort made by the Government to bring the rates on farmers' land back to the 1958 level.  Many people, however, lose sight of the fact that in the past ten years, through hard work and out of their own savings, with some little assistance from Government funds, practically all the small farmers in the west have raised their standard of living and built new houses or reconstructed existing houses.  In an effort to expand agriculture from their own resources, they have improved their outoffices, their cowbyres, their piggeries and so on.  The Government, shrewdly and wisely, gave no rebate to the farming community in relation to that very important aspect of rating. In fact, it is accepted in my county that those who built new houses have had their valuations increased by approximately £5 on average and those who reconstructed dwellinghouses have had their valuations increased by approximately £1 and 30/- on average.</P>
    <P>In addition to Government taxation, we have had to stand in Mayo an increase in rates over the past two years of approximately 15/- in the £. Add that increase in the past two years alone and one finds that a farmer who built or reconstructed a house has to pay something in the neighbourhood of an extra £4 per annum in rates, irrespective of the relief he is getting on agricultural land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> Last year the Minister for Agriculture introduced the heifer scheme.  I said at the time that the scheme would not benefit the small farmer, that it would benefit the big farmer only, the farmer who could put in 40 or 50 heifers.  I said we would be fortunate if the average small farmer in my constituency drew one 15/- from this vast scheme.</P>
    <P>This year, the Government claim they have allocated increased aid to agriculture to the extent of £5 million.  I do not accept that figure as correctly showing State aid to agriculture because, if one subtracts from that figure approximately £1½ million that the Government have saved on the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, the net figure finding its way into the pockets of the farming community is something less than £3½ million.</P>
    <P>This Budget has wielded the axe on the small towns in the west.  We are badly hit because of lack of industry with vast numbers of our people leaving the country, compelled to do so by Government policy, leaving behind them locked doors.  We were hoping that the small shopkeepers, who derive their livelihood directly or indirectly from the hinterland population. would get some benefit in the form of rates relief.  There is no mention of any such relief despite the fact that the Taoiseach, when it looked as if we might have a general election, said in one of his after dinner speeches that the question of rates would have to be tackled at national level.  We hoped that these people in the small towns and, indeed, in the few big towns like Ballina and Castlebar, would get some relief from Central Funds to help them meet the problem of ever-increasing rates.</P>
    <P>This year the rate struck in County Mayo is one of the highest in Ireland. The small shopkeeper, the man who runs a garage, the private householder has to pay a rate of 67/- in every £ in this year of 1964.  If the Government are sincere in their policy of rehabilitating the country they must grapple with the real problem.  In my opinion the real problem is to ensure that agriculture remunerates those who derive their living from it at rates <Col N="763" /> reasonably equivalent to current national earnings in other industries.</P>
    <P>I spoke quite impartially on the Land Bill, despite its being introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I said I approved of the Bill because I believed it would benefit the areas most in need.  I come from an area which is made up, in the main, of congested, uneconomic holdings.  By no stretch of the imagination can I see any Minister of State making every uneconomic holding a 45-acre economic holding, because the land is simply not there, and statements to that effect do not impress me.  Neither do they impress the unfortunate people who have to live on these uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>However, I believe in giving credit where credit is due.  That is, perhaps, an earnest of the Minister's goodwill, but I want something more than merely an earnest of goodwill.  A little bit of help is worth more than too much sympathy.  If we are to put the small farmer on a sound economic basis, we must make use of every inch of every small uneconomic holding.  It is in this respect I find fault with Government policy because the small farmer cannot depend for a livelihood on what he produces on a small 20 to 25-acre farm or even, indeed, on a 30-acre farm.</P>
    <P>I know from my experience of the farming community that, if a farm is made up of 30 acres of land, the farmer must till a certain amount of land to produce potatoes for home requirements; he must till a certain amount for grain purposes and for feeding purposes; and he must retain a certain amount for putting into meadow or hay.  He has the remainder for grazing.  It must be deduced from that that the amount he has left does not afford him much opportunity for producing in large quantities.  For that reason Government policy, and our minds, must be diverted towards establishing a sound economy for the farmer in the form of pig production, egg production, poultry production, horticulture and vegetable production in general.</P>

      <P>I shall try to avoid going into detail.  I should like to refer in general to agriculture inasmuch as we rely upon it to keep our trade balance right, and the position we find ourselves in as a result of Government policy.  I do not wish to kick egg production around because it was kicked around many years ago, but I would say we have lost our place on the British market in regard to egg production.  Far be it from me, a young Deputy, to try to teach my elders, but I feel the day is fast coming when we will become an egg importing country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the Government told us they were imposing a 2½ per cent turnover tax because the old faithfuls, whiskey, stout, beer and petrol, had been taxed to the fullest extent, and were no longer able to <Col N="765" /> carry any additional taxation.  Indeed, we had Deputy Sherwin, in the very same seat, gesticulating with his hands, and being as vocal as his vocal chords would permit, saying the Minister had no alternative.  Indeed, I heard him mention the figure of 5/- despite the fact that he denied that today.</P>
      <P>At first the country thought the Budget last year was mild, but then they felt the full implications of the 2½ per cent tax.  When the results of the Dublin by-election became known, it was apparent to the Government that the 2½ per cent tax was neither economically nor politically good.  The Minister for Finance came back this year and made no mention of the turnover tax which he lauded last year.  He reverted to the old forms of taxation on whiskey, stout and petrol. I am not particularly bothered about the tax on whiskey, and certainly not about the tax on Scotch whisky.  I do not drink very much myself but, when I do, I prefer Irish whiskey.  I feel that whiskey drinkers should be able to pay the tax, but I have sympathy for the pint drinker.  It is nourishment as well as a drink for the poorer sections of the community who rely upon the pint.  I think it was unfair and unjust and I think it was imposed upon that section of the community which can least afford to pay it.</P>
      <P>I take exception to the 3d on the gallon of petrol, because I know the state of affairs that will result from that increase.  There will be increased fares and increased carriages.  The taxi driver who takes the poor old age pensioner living in a remote part of Mayo, Galway, or Roscommon, to Mass will have to increase his charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a terrible state of affairs that a Government, who indicated to this House that they were going to the left, should now give the old age pensioners a miserable increase of 2/6 per week. The small farmer and his wife who started work at approximately 20 years of age, and are now old age pensioners, got very little reward from the State in the past 50 years.  They are the people who built up this State.  The contributory old age pension is £3 10s. but the small farmer and his wife will get only 37/6.  The Minister will say that the <Col N="766" /> contributory pensioner has been in insurable employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>£4 7s. 6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister will say the man who has been in insurable employment has contributed, but is it not a fact that the small farmer has contributed equally but did not have the opportunity to be insured? I think it is wrong that the small farmer and his wife who have to remain on a small holding until they go to their graves should find themselves in that position.  I do not want to be personal&mdash;I am speaking generally&mdash;but the Minister for Social Welfare told us that an income of more than £127 10s. &mdash;that is £2 10s. a week&mdash;excludes a person from the full old age pension. I should hate any Government Minister, or any individual, to try to live on £2 or £2 10s. a week.  Yet the Government have indicated that an income of more than £127 10s. deprives a man or a woman of the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I think the time is ripe for the Minister to come into this House&mdash;I do not mind if it is next year&mdash;and say he will not increase the old age pension but that he will increase the income to £300. Any Deputy with experience of going to the Department of Social Welfare knows that the greater part of his time is taken up fighting the case of people he thinks are entitled to old age, widows' or unemployment benefits.  The time is now ripe for the Minister to make some effort to increase the income allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the Budget.  I had hoped for something in it which would alleviate the many problems that affect the people in my constituency.  I do hope the Government will get wise in the not too distant future and will establish for the small farmers something on the lines of Father McDyer's scheme.  I hope we shall see more State aid for sheep farming in the form of fencing and sheep dipping.  I hope more capital will <Col N="767" /> be made available for buying stock in the form of both sheep and cattle. I should like to see a particular effort to encourage small farmers to go into apple production.</P>

      <P>I have been in politics since 1916.  I know the people of my area.  I thought when I was coming in here that I would hear my colleague from North Mayo describe the &ldquo;penal Budget&rdquo; which he talked about down the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget has been introduced and the ordinary person may complain that petrol has been increased 3d a gallon.  If it has, this country is certainly one that has petrol cheap.  Beer has been increased by 1d on the pint. We are well able to pay that 1d on the pint, thanks be to God.  Cigarettes have gone up 3d on a packet of 20. Let us smoke one cigarette less a day and we will not worry about the 3d. That is definitely correct.  Let Deputy McQuillan smile as much as he likes. Doctors might say it is good if it reduces the number of cigarettes that are smoked and that we will have far less lung cancer.  Therefore, if the Government are introducing something that will make cigarette prices a bit <Col N="768" /> dearer and will make people smoke less, surely it is best for the nation?</P>

That is a big statement I am making and I am able to stand over it, thanks be to God.  The standard of living in North Mayo is better than it ever was.  The people have more money.  Business is better than ever it was and that is something good.</P>
      <P>I wonder what would the Opposition do if they got into power, not that they have any chance of getting into power. Fine Gael have as much chance of getting into power as, I would say, a Party that does not exist.  They have not the least hope of getting into power but they make speeches.  I thought I would hear about the &ldquo;penal Budget&rdquo; but all I could hear was that we had increased the price of petrol, beer and cigarettes and I will say that there is not a bit of harm in that.  I know my area inside out and I never saw times as good in my area as they are now. I especially say that when I consider that the small town of Crossmolina from which Deputy Browne came was never better off than it is now.  Never were the villages in North Mayo as well off as they are now.</P>

We realise that the farmers there are small farmers.  We realise that they must get some help and assistance.  We realise that the new Land Bill introduced by the Minister for Lands will help the <Col N="771" /> farmers of North Mayo.  The farmers in North Mayo, the people of North Mayo, never had better times.  I go through the country.  I have seen all the new houses that have been built under Fianna Fáil.

      <P>I want to speak about the hardship which, to my mind, the Budget imposes on our people.  It is all very fine for a Deputy like Deputy Calleary to speak as he has spoken.  Being a Fianna Fáil Deputy, naturally he could say nothing else. That is what he is schooled in and what he will say while he is here.  It is necessary for us as Deputies to come in on occasions such as this and point out to the Government and the Ministers concerned the conditions that prevail in our constituencies.  When I speak for Sligo-Leitrim, I feel I am speaking for almost all of the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> Let us examine what the Budget does for our people to see if it improves their lot.  Why are our towns and villages almost stripped of their population if the great prosperity we are told about exists?  Where are the people who were there when we were young?  Where is the bright, lively little village that we entered ten, 12 or 14 years ago?  Today the air of activity is gone.  When the people go, the heart and soul of the countryside go and that is the position that prevails in my constituency. We have no employment whatever.  Everything that must be bought is taxed to capacity.  In the name of God, how can any fair-minded man say this is a really fine Budget?</P>
    <P>It is necessary to tell the Ministers these things because the Ministers do not go to these areas to see for themselves. We Deputies meet them at functions organised when a new hospital or school or something of that kind is being officially opened.  They attend functions where a fine lunch is served and Deputies and councillors and others are invited.  That is about as far as Ministers go.  They never see for themselves as we do who have to convass for votes.  They never meet the constituents.  They do not see the position of the people as we see them.</P>
    <P>If we had employment, we would not be here tonight complaining about increased taxation.  We would be satisfied that the people could bear some increase in taxation but, instead, we come from rural areas, towns and villages, where there is not as much as the smoke from the smallest industry to be seen.  What is left for the boy or girl of 16 or 17 but to think seriously of going to England or getting some petty job in Dublin?  Often they get a job in Dublin and some might think they are getting security but the job is not sufficient to enable them to keep themselves decently.  They often have to get money from home to keep them in the boarding house or hostel. That is what drives our boys and girls across to England.</P>
    <P>They are going every day of the week.  Nine or ten left the other morning from the area known as Glenfarne. The only thing we can look forward to in my constituency is a few weeks' <Col N="773" /> work on the roads.  In the past, our people could anticipate a few periods of council work in the year but, again, new methods have been introduced and Roadstone, which has its parent place in Kildare, I think, moved down to those counties, set machinery in motion and reduced employment to the very minimum, with the result that those employed heretofore had to go to England.</P>
    <P>Let the Government remember also that the farmer who lived comfortably in the past cannot do so now even by making a greater effort because in the past the housewife kept the home going by bringing her eggs to the local shop. That day is gone.  The housewife today would scarcely bother going out to the shed to collect the eggs at this time of the year.  Somebody told me in February or March that eggs were being sold at 1/8d a dozen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another side to the question of increasing taxation. Many people are in receipt of pensions and in many cases these pensions give them no surplus.  These people are in very poor circumstances at present.  Every little increase in taxation means their cost of living goes up still further.  The fact that the price of petrol has been increased means that the extra cost will come back eventually on the customer who goes into a shop as he will have to pay more for his goods because the shopkeeper has to pay more for his petrol. He has to pay more for his cigarettes and many other things.  Somebody said that this was not the small farmers' Budget.  Certainly it is not.  The subsidy towards the relief of rates and the increase in the price of milk apply <Col N="774" /> only to the bigger type of farmer.  In the west of Ireland, milk production is millions of gallons lower than in County Cork, which means that the west stands to gain very little.  The individual farmer will gain very little. The same holds in the other milk-producing counties such as Limerick, Tipperary and the other southern counties.</P>
      <P>The subsidy which is designed to bring rates down to the 1957 level will not be of great benefit either.  I can assure the Government that rates will have to be kept at a certain level because we are reaching the time when our small population will not be able to carry the huge burden being imposed on them through the rates.  In Leitrim, we struck a rate of 57/- in the £, or almost £3, which is a shocking rate in an area where there is no employment, no industry and very little money circulating other than the social welfare benefits.  Those are made available for the sole purpose of keeping people alive.  I would stress the need for increasing the old age pensions and other pensions as well.</P>
