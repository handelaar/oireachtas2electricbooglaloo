    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <P>Before section 4 to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of sections *, * and * of this Act, `land' means `agricultural land'.&rdquo;&mdash;Deputy O.J. Flanagan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Minister has not given the House a satisfactory explanation as to why the register cannot be compiled in the Land Commission.  It would be extremely easy to establish such a register and the Minister for Lands has informed the House that there is in existence such a register which would give this information.  Perhaps he would give the House the nature of that register, all the details contained in it, how long it has been kept and <Col N="352" /> how the Land Commission get the information contained in it.  Perhaps he would also say whether this is the type of register to which the Minister for Transport and Power referred when he spoke in Castleblayney on New Year's Day.  On that occasion he referred to new legislation that was being introduced and everybody took it to mean that it was this Bill, but when the Bill was circulated there was no mention whatever of the register to which the Minister referred.</P>
      <P>These amendments are very reasonable. Not only that but they will help to make this Bill workable when it becomes an Act.  The Minister has given no indication to the House as to why, deliberately or otherwise, there is no provision in the Bill or any reference to this question of non-nationals. He has not stated in the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill or in anything he has said inside or outside the House that anything was being done about the purchase of land by aliens or any effort being made to gather statistics on the matter.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for putting down these amendments is to find out the extent to which this is a serious national problem.  May I make it clear to the House that this Party, now or in the future, have no objection to anybody coming into this country, provided he is coming here for reasons of goodwill.  The fact that we have these amendments down will not interfere with the purchase of building sites. These will not be included in the proposed register.  There would be no need to include in that register lands purchased for industrial purposes.  It has been the policy of this Party and the Government to attract and invite foreign capital to the country for industrial purposes and to provide employment for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments refer only to agricultural land, land which can be used for the production of food for man and beast, land on which so many of our people are depending for their livelihood.  I am really surprised at the Minister when he says that this is not such a problem as would require <Col N="353" /> the compilation of such a register so that in future we could put these statistics before the country and the House.  I ask the Minister what was the register to which the Minister for Transport and Power was referring, to what new legislation was he referring and if there has been any change since New Year's Day in the terms of this Bill as first outlined by the Government. If we read accurately the speech of the Minister for Transport and Power, we find that there was definite mention of such a register.  What has happened since?</P>

      <P>I understood that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or you, Sir, ruled that in discussing these amendments, the House should not enter into a general discussion on the purchase of land by foreigners in that such a discussion would be more appropriate on another amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore I wish to deal with these amendments as they are and with what is proposed in them. In actual fact, this House has already refused to accept these amendments which are simply lifted from a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill introduced in 1961 on this issue.  These are the very same proposals as those rejected by this House on the Land (Regulation of Acquisition) Bill, 1961 when that Bill was debated here.  Speaking on that Bill at column 1693 of the Official Report of 4th May, 1961, I had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to inform the House now in more detail, following the statement of the Minister for Finance, of the measures proposed to be taken by the Government in the Finance Bill, which will shortly be before the House, to deal with this matter in so far as the Government, on the information before them at present, consider it should be dealt with.  I want to give in broad outline the steps we propose to take in relation to the acquisition of agricultural land by non-nationals. <Col N="354" /> The Minister for Finance announced that the liability for 25 per cent stamp duty will not apply to urban property.  It is, of course, intended to continue the existing arrangements whereby it does not apply to residential holdings containing less than five acres or to land which is used for industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>I went on to give the details about the proposals that would be contained in the 1961 Finance Bill to set up a register to deal with this matter and I said:</P>
    <P>Finally, the Finance Bill will include adequate provisions for ensuring the effectiveness of any new measures by imposing severe penalties for such matters as the furnishing of false information as to the ownership of land, the constitution of companies and so on.  As I said, under the previous law any type of declaration could be made.  Even the provision of the Statutory Declaration Act did not, in my view, apply to such declarations.  Outside certain penal provisions in respect of duties in case of any false declarations in deeds, there will be further provisions, including imprisonment, for any such fraudulent return or any such fraudulent declaration in any such document.  From the foregoing, it will be apparent that the Government are ready to implement effective measures to control the tax evasion which is the crux of this matter.  The Bill goes no further&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked:</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think tax evasion is the crux of the matter? My feeling is that it is the alienation of the land.</P>
    <P>I went on:</P>
    <P>I think I do.  I shall deal with that proposition when I finish what I have to say on this issue.  I suggest that the Bill is an innocuous measure that goes no further than to require the Land Commission to set up a register of information about alien purchases.  Under the Government measure, it is proposed that the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="355" /> shall keep the Land Commission informed of purchases by non-national interests.  In this way, the Land Commission will be in a position to assemble essential information about such transactions.  This will be achieved without the irritating and superfluous machinery proposed in this Bill.  Appropriate particulars will be made available to members of the House by way of replies to Parliamentary Question or in response to inquiries addressed to my office.</P>
    <P>Now, that legal provision, which I foreshadowed then, was duly enshrined in the Finance Act, 1961, and one of the relevant provisions of that Act dealing with this particular issue is subsection (12) of section 33 which provides:</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners shall furnish to the Land Commission particulars of all conveyances and transfers coming to their notice where stamp duty is chargeable at the rate provided for by subsection (5) of the 1947 section or where the case falls within subparagraph (i) of paragraph (c) of subsection (4) of that section.</P>
    <P>Again, subsection (12) of section 34 provides:</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners shall furnish to the Land Commission particulars of all leases coming to their notice where stamp duty is chargeable at the rate provided for by subsection (6) of the 1949 section or where the case falls within subparagraph (1) of paragraph (c) of subsection (4) of that section.</P>
    <P>In section 35, the following provision occurs:</P>
    <P>Where the Revenue Commissioners are of opinion&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  that the passing has resulted from any arrangement or arrangements the main or one of the main purposes of which was the avoidance or reduction of liability to stamp duty under the Stamp Act, 1891, at the rate provided for by subsection (5) of <Col N="356" /> section 13 of the Finance Act... 1947,</P>
    <P>the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
    <P>The provision then goes on to recite that where this attempt is made to avoid the penal stamp duty laid down under the Finance Act, 1961, section 35 comes into effect; and section 35 enacts <i>in terrorem</i> provisions providing what the Revenue Commissioners can do in such circumstances and the penalties that will follow for those who, by fraud, misrepresentation, or otherwise, have broken the law as laid down.</P>
    <P>Under the statutory provisions to which I have referred, the Land Commission get regularly from the Revenue Commissioners particulars of all transactions concerning the transfer of land to any alien.  Let me make it clear, because it has been suggested otherwise here, that not alone do the Land Commission get particulars of the cases in which the penal 25 per cent. stamp duty is payable, and has been paid, but they get particulars also of all other cases in which land for any purpose, industrial or otherwise, has been transferred to aliens.  The Land Commissioners have certain powers, with the Minister for Finance, to exempt in certain circumstances under their certificate from the penal 25 per cent duty.  Every single acre of land sold to any alien is duly registered.  When the transfer comes up for stamping, let it be under lease, under conveyance, or any other form, the Revenue Commissioners send particulars to the Land Commission and the Land Commission enter those particulars in their register.  The particulars registered comprise (1) the number of transactions involved; (2) the consideration or the purchase money which passed in respect of these transactions; (3) the acreage and extent of the lands; (4) the situation of the lands.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan and others are well aware that from time to time since 1961 I have regularly had questions addressed to me here asking for particulars from this register, the register <Col N="357" /> kept under the statutory provisions I have already cited to the House.  I have been asked to give the latest details or information as to the amount of land concerned in these transfers to aliens.  Deputy O.J. Flanagan knows quite well that that register is there.  Everybody in this House, everybody outside it, knows that that register is there.  I do not know how many times in this House, including the last two days, I have had to refute the Deputy's allegations that there is no register in the Land Commission and that nobody knows what amount of land is being transferred to aliens.  I do not know what the Deputy's purpose is.  Perhaps it is that, if he keeps repeating it often enough, some newspaper will eventually report it and, if it is not contradicted, then someone will assume that what the Deputy says is true.</P>
    <P>The fact is this House, in its wisdom, provided in 1961 for the setting up of this register.  Month by month we get from the Revenue Commissioners details of all these transactions.  If some people try to evade the law, and they are discovered, there are methods of dealing with them under section 35 of the Finance Act, 1961, and the other penal sections, just as there are provisions in the law to deal with lawbreakers of different sorts.  Those who allege that this register is not accurate, or that the law is not being observed, should give me particulars of the cases for investigation.  I have asked time and again for particulars and, at the moment, I have got some information about two particular cases in which I suspect the law may have been broken.  These are under investigation. That is not to say, however, that any legal device has been discovered to get round the law as laid down by this House under the Finance Act of 1961.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Fine Gael policy is on this matter.  Perhaps we shall have a more general discussion on what it is when we come to the Labour Party amendment dealing with land being acquired by foreigners.  Let me say in passing that in regard to a few of the larger deals I investigated of transfers of land to foreigners, I <Col N="358" /> wound up by finding that the vendors were members of the Fine Gael hierarchy.</P>
    <P>I do not accept for a moment the suggestion by Deputy Flanagan that stamp duty is being avoided by foreigners having children here and putting the land in their children's names.  There must be something salubrious about the Irish climate if a foreigner can arrive here and immediately produce a child in whose name he can purchase Irish land.  Furthermore, I challenge the Deputy's legal knowledge when he asserts that, if a Russian couple are grounded at Shannon for a fortnight and the Russian wife gives birth to a baby, that baby becomes an Irish citizen.  In drawing on his imagination as to how this 25 per cent stamp duty is being avoided, the Deputy had better think up a more acceptable proposition than foreign children being used for the purpose of evading it.</P>
    <P>The expressions of Fine Gael policy made by Deputy Flanagan, Deputy Donegan and Deputy Dillon differ vastly in so far as these Deputies have given their views on this issue.  Deputy Donegan assured us they had no objection at all to foreigners except where they bought land inside the congested districts.  He said that foreigners he knew buying land in his area were doing a very good job and giving a great deal of employment.  He was expressing Fine Gael policy on that issue.  Deputy Flanagan stated here today that he welcomed foreign capital and that Fine Gael had no objection to foreigners buying building sites and purchasing land for industrial purposes. On the other hand, both inside and outside this House, Deputy Dillon bemoans the influx of foreign capital into this country.  He suggests we would have a balance of payments problem here were it not that Irish land and businesses were being sold to foreigners.  He said there was foreign money coming in buying up old-established businesses and that was a very bad thing.</P>
    <P>However, these Deputies expressing all these different views on this issue conveniently forget that it was Deputy <Col N="359" /> Sweetman, their Minister for Finance in the inter-Party Government, who in a Finance Bill provided for the removal of the 25 per cent penal stamp duty on the sale of property or business with less than five acres of land.  It would appear, therefore, that the Fine Gael Party think this matter has changed drastically since Deputy Sweetman opened this gap to enable any foreigner to acquire an Irish business or Irish land comprising less than five acres.</P>
    <P>I do not know which is the official view of the Fine Gael Party on this.  I do not know whether they have changed their minds in regard to the 25 per cent stamp duty which they bitterly opposed when it was introduced by this Government and which Deputy Dillon described as another piece of Fianna Fáil codology.  My difficulty in regard to Fine Gael policy is, as in the case of the thimbles and the pea, to find out under which thimble the official pea is.</P>
    <P>These amendments are lifted directly from the Private Members' Bill which was introduced and defeated in this House away back in 1961.  For those who have any interest in the matter, let me say I went through that Bill at that time section by section including these amendments and pointed out how unworkable it would be and that it would be useless for the purpose it was expressed to serve.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of these amendments is to set up a register.  I have pointed out, first, that there is already a register there, set up under the law passed by this House in 1961, and I pointed out the details that are kept in that register.</P>
    <P>Secondly these proposals would not make one more acre of land available for the land reform programme.  That appears to be admitted and that point was made by Deputy McQuillan and others here last night.  Thirdly, these amendments would not increase the Land Commission's powers to acquire land; fourthly, every purchaser of land would have to insist on the vendor proving his nationality to ensure that he was not a non-national whose <Col N="360" /> initial purchase of land was void and of no effect; and fifthly, the proposals are indiscriminating inasmuch as one of these amendments covers property in a street.  I have already referred to the provisions made by Deputy Flanagan's Party for the relief of property purchased by aliens in towns or streets.</P>
    <P>Finally, the provisions about companies would be unworkable.  It would be a complete nuisance to companies with a large number of shareholders. When the 1961 Bill was before the House, I gave an instance of how impossible the situation would be for a firm such as Guinness who would be required to provide a list of their shareholders, and if they had a subsidiary for growing grain or for any other purpose, the same procedure would be necessary.  For all these reasons, these amendments are completely unworkable, would serve no purpose and I fail to appreciate any of the arguments used as to why the House should accept them.</P>
    <P>Let me say, although I suppose this will be more appropriate to the discussion of the amendment dealing directly with the purchase of land by non-nationals&mdash;that, as the Minister for Transport and Power has said, there are many sections in this Bill that will be of very important value to the Land Commission in dealing with non-nationals.  There is, for instance, the provision that I expect the House will pass &mdash; the residence provision.  The Land Commission can immediately move in in any case where the individual does not reside on or in the immediate vicinity of the lands and, under that provision, any of these people who, it has been suggested to this House, merely purchase land here and go away and come back once in a blue moon would be caught.</P>
    <P>Again there are provisions in the Bill enabling the Land Commission to buy land by public auction for any purpose, not for the restricted purpose that was the law before this Bill was introduced, but for any of their purposes. Again, there will be freedom under this Bill to purchase land for cash where such an operation is the <Col N="361" /> more desirable.  Where they hear of land for sale or where land for sale is reported to them that provision would enable them to step in quickly and lively before some of these aliens would have an opportunity of purchasing.</P>
    <P>There are all these other provisions that I will deal with more fully when we come to discuss this direct issue on an amendment before the House whereby this Bill will be of the greatest assistance to the Land Commission in dealing with that aspect of the problem in so far as it is a problem, as well as the many other aspects of the land congestion problem.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, for all these reasons and, in particular, because of the fact that in so far as we require a register we already have a register established by the law of this House, suggest that the House should reject all these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister go further on this?  I feel he can. Can he now disclose the identity of the register to which he has referred? He tells us that in the Land Commission there is a register in which full details concerning the purchase of land by non-nationals are entered. Can he now tell the House the exact extent of that register and can he tell us from that register the amount of land held by non-nationals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the first occassion on which the Minister has made reference to this register.  Can he go further? Can he give us an idea of the details concerning purchasers and the nature and quality of the land purchased as entered in that register?  On more than one occasion the Minister has told us that he has consulted this register and that this register has revealed to him that the nature and type of land so purchased by non-nationals is bad and of poor quality. Can he now tell us whether this register gives an accurate account as to whether the land is highly arable, mixed, suitable for tillage or grazing, of poor quality, suitable for forestry, turbary, whether it is suitable only for grouse shooting or game, or to what extent the register gives details of the <Col N="362" /> nature and type of land purchased, to the knowledge of the Land Commission, by aliens?</P>
    <P>To keep the names and addresses of non-nationals who purchase land written down in a jotter in the Land Commission is not enough, more particularly when the Minister now states that he knows of a case or two in which stamp duty has been avoided. We may take it that if stamp duty has been avoided, the names and addresses of the purchasers and details of the property are not entered in the register which the Minister alleges is in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister and to the House that there is practically no county in Ireland today which does not contain tracts of land which are in the ownership of non-nationals. Does the Minister seriously tell this House that every acre of land which is now in the name of a non-national or in the ownership of a non-national is entered in black and white in a register in the Land Commission?  A few moments ago he told us that the information he gets for the purpose of the compilation of that register comes from the Revenue Commissioners. Surely, if people evade payment of the duty and if the Revenue Commissioners have no knowledge of a transaction, it cannot be entered in the Land Commission register?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the possibility of a non-national putting land or property into the name of any of his children.  I do not know whether the Minister is trying to be funny or not. Children do not come overnight.  It is an established fact that an alien may be in this country for two, three or four years before becoming an Irish citizen and some of his children may be born during that period in this country.  That does happen.  There is nothing to stop such non-national, whose child is Irish by birth, and who has not under the Aliens Act taken out Irish Citizenship, from placing on deposit very substantial sums of money in the name of that child and transferring such sums of money for the purchase and transfer of property to be executed in the name of the child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> That is taking place and the Minister knows it is taking place.  Such a purchase of land by a non-national is not entered on the register to which the Minister has referred and cannot possibly be.  If the Minister has such great reliance on the accuracy of the register that he alleges is in the Land Commission, why does he not tell the country or this House, county by county, constituency by constituency, the exact extent of the purchase of land and ownership of land in this country by non-nationals as revealed by that register?</P>
    <P>If the alleged register is correct&mdash; which I doubt very much&mdash;the statistics obtained and circulated by the National Farmers Association cannot be accurate.  Yet, the National Farmers Association is an organisation representative of farmers of every townland and village in Ireland who were asked by their headquarters to complete a memorandum giving details of each townland in the Twenty-Six Counties of land purchased by non-nationals.</P>

      <P>On a point of order. I respectfully submit that this is not relevant to this amendment.

      <P>Perhaps it would be no harm for me to say at this stage that the Chair regards these amendments merely as machinery amendments setting up a machine called a register to register certain people who are supposed to acquire land in this country.  The extent or the limitation of the area of land or the people getting the land does not arise on these amendments.  It would arise more relevantly on the amendments referred to by the Minister. Therefore, the limitation of the area acquired by aliens or the limitation of the number of people does not relevantly arise on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we must get down to in this amendment. The amendments very clearly set out that in order to set up this machinery, we must define the full name of the purchaser, his nationality, his address, if any, within the State; his address outside the State at which he ordinarily resides; the townland, street, parish, barony and county in which the land is situated.  If we are to set up the machinery to deal with this problem, I put it to the Minister that the steps taken by the NFA to ascertain the townland, street, parish, barony and county are necessary to find out to what extent this is a national problem.  The details required, as set out in the amendments we have tabled, are absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>In addition, the area of the land, its rateable valuation, the consideration for which it is purchased and the nature of the estate or interest which the purchaser will take under the conveyance, transfer or lease are necessary details.  These are exactly what we are discussing in this amendment. The Minister for Lands, for some reason unknown to me, is deliberately evading the issues at stake in these amendments.  I have already asked the Minister, who has remained silent, whether he will give us an idea, without mentioning names if he does not wish to do so, what is the type of register to which he refers?  Does it contain the provisions outlined in my amendment?  If it does, we may take a different view of the situation.  But the Minister has not enlightened us.  I have quoted, and the Minister has read, the nine provisions of the amendments as set out for the purchase of land by non-nationals that we require in this register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully agree with the Ceann Comhairle when he says these amendments <Col N="365" /> are for the purpose of setting up machinery in order that we may accurately estimate the seriousness of this problem.  How will this House set up machinery to deal with this national problem when this Bill is passed and when it will be too late? Is it not the right time to do it when this Bill is passing through the House? Is this not the only opportunity we shall get of airing the necessity for the establishment of a register in the Land Commission for this purpose?  These amendments together provide the machinery for finding out exactly how much land is being bought by foreigners, the type of land and the places where it is being bought.  Has the Minister that information in his Land Commission register?  That is what we want to hear because it is of the greatest importance.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 provides that the Land Commission will establish a register to record every sale of land to a non-national.  Subsection (3) of the amendment is necessary because in subsection (2) of amendment No. 5 failure by a non-national to notify the Land Commission of his purchase would make the conveyance to a non-national void.  Accordingly, a person who would buy land from a non-national if the latter did not register would require to know from the Land Commission whether that non-national had registered his purchase with the Land Commission because if he did not register, the non-national could not convey good title to an Irish purchaser. I hope that is clear because it is the root of our argument, that is, the importance of having established by the laws of this House a register of the type we suggest.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of amendment No. 4, therefore, entitles an intending purchaser from a non-national to find out whether the non-national has complied with the new provisions.  That is a very reasonable request and I cannot see what serious objection the Minister, the Land Commission or this House can have to such a provision to safeguard the land of the country for our people.  These provisions are absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of amendment No. 5, <Col N="366" /> in effect, prescribes that persons and companies in the categories set out in paragraphs (1) and (2) do not have to register their purchases but all other persons and companies must.  That is very reasonable and we are not unreasonable in our anxiety to remedy this very serious problem.  Section 3 of the Aliens Act, 1935, with which the Minister is doubtless familiar, provides that an alien may own, take, acquire or dispose of land and personal property in the same way as an Irish citizen.  Subsection (2) of amendment No. 5 alters this position to provide that this equality of capacity which an alien has with an Irish citizen to hold, acquire or sell property will not apply to aliens, unless they furnish the Land Commission with the required particulars before they take a conveyance of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>There can be nothing simpler or clearer to tie up this matter properly in order to safeguard the interests of Irish purchasers of land.  Unless we set up by law the necessary register to tie up the matter in this way, there can be many serious results and we shall not have the machinery to deal with them unless the Minister accepts these amendments.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that any figures the Minister may have cannot be relied upon because even if he gives us the figures from the alleged register in the Land Commission, what information has he, or the Revenue Commissioners, or the Minister for Finance, on the numerous purchases of land where the 25 per cent stamp duty has been evaded?  Does the Minister not know very well that many non-nationals, who do not give a thraneen about the 25 per cent duty, make up their minds to come here and purchase land?</P>

      <P>The setting up of this register as set out in these amendments is necessary for the proper working of this Bill.  In fact, I cannot understand how the Bill will function successfully unless such a register is compiled and kept in the Land Commission. Any Minister for Lands <Col N="367" /> seriously interested in applying a suitable remedy to the land problem must have access to an accurate source of information down to the last perch of land purchased by non-nationals. That source would be the register we suggest in these amendments.</P>
      <P>We ask that in the case of corporations, companies or organisations coming in here to buy land, that the names, addresses and nationalities of the shareholders be entered in a register.  Companies coming in here may be very reputable but is there anything wrong in the Land Commission entering details about them in such a register? Today the Minister referred to a firm of world-wide reputation for its integrity and decency.  Why he picked on that firm I do not know.  We suggest that the Land Commission enter in the register the number and the nominal value of the shares held by each shareholder. Let us assume for one moment that we have the return of Paul Singer. Supposing he tries to come back here to purchase a large tract of land as the alleged director of a company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that people of that kind may at the moment come into this country and may describe themselves as managing directors.  They may not measure up to the rigid standards of integrity we would desire.  Surely it is right for us to ask such people for details concerning <Col N="368" /> their company and to have these details entered in a register?  In these amendments, we ask that particulars of the townland, street, parish, barony and county in which the purchased land is situated be entered.  I put it to the Minister that such details are absolutely necessary in regard to any such group of aliens coming into this country.  It would, in fact, help the Minister in that he would have to hand a ready reference to every perch of land so purchased; he would have information as to whether the land was unsuitable for the relief of congestion; he would be able to say whether the land was so poor that nobody in the district was interested in it and that they were, in fact, glad to see people from outside taking the land up.</P>
      <P>The most important feature of these amendments is the suggestion that the area of land so purchased be entered. Apart altogether from giving the Minister very valuable information about land purchase by foreigners, it would serve to keep an effective check on such purchases at any given time.  We also ask that the rateable valuation or, as it is called, the poor law valuation, be required to be entered in the suggested register.  Such information would help to determine the quality of the land purchased.  We also wish to have in this register details of the purchase price of the land.  In the absence of such a register, the Minister or the Government will not have details of the amount of money non-nationals spend on the purchase of Irish land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of interest, I should like now from the Minister information as to the amount of money paid by non-nationals for land in this country.  He will be able to give that like a shot if the register is functioning as he says. But I doubt if it is.  However, we will test that in a short time.  If he tells us he has not got the information, he may be able to get it this afternoon.  He has an army of officials who may be able to look into the register and have the information by 3.20 p.m.  If the Minister is right when he says he has this register with all the information, why is it being kept so secret?  Perhaps it is, as Deputy McQuillan said, a 2½d. copybook with the names and addresses <Col N="369" /> of aliens who may have purchased land.  That is not sufficient.  We want the details asked for in these amendments.</P>
    <P>It is part of the Minister's duty to tell the House to what extent the purchase of land by aliens is a major problem.  He should be able to tell us from this register that £x were spent on the purchase of Irish land by aliens, the exact acreage purchased, and whether it was purchased by individuals or companies.  It is easy for the Minister to assure the House of the existence of something of which we have no proof.  When we challenge the Minister to quote from it, he cannot do so; when we ask him to give us information from it, he cannot do so.  If the register is in existence and the Minister can give the House statistics from it, I believe those statistics will reveal a fantastic investment by aliens in the purchase of Irish land.</P>
    <P>What we require is the nature and extent of the interest in the land and whether the purchaser taxes it under a conveyance, a transfer or lease.  That is of the greatest possible importance. My information is that, in addition to the amount of land which has been purchased outright by aliens, who may or may not have paid the 25 per cent duty, there are vasts tracts of land leased to aliens for periods of years. It is generally believed in the areas concerned, even where the lands are only leased, that the lands have been purchased outright.  Can the Minister give us from the alleged register details of lands leased to aliens?  Has he any idea of the seriousness of that situation?</P>
    <P>Taking everything into consideration, I believe these amendments are necessary for the smooth working of the Bill.  I want to assure the Minister that there is nobody more anxious than those of us on this side of the House to see an efficient up-to-date Land Bill in order to help solve the problem of congestion.  We are not being obstructive or destructive in our criticism. We are trying to be helpful to the Minister.  We believe it is our duty as an Opposition to advise the Minister and to make recommendations to him as to how the Bill may be improved. Our criticism of the Bill is our contribution <Col N="370" /> towards making a more workable Bill, that will bring the greatest benefit not only to the people in the congested districts but to all small holders and deserving applicants for land.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  He cannot pick holes in the case we have made because it is based on fact.  This register should be set up and should by law render the title deeds of any property purchased by non-nationals as useless for re-sale unless the person is registered in this register.  Apart from whatever political bias he may have, I have always found the Minister to be a reasonable man to speak to outside the House.  Seemingly, he is bound up with his Party when he comes into the House.  I venture to say that, if I were to talk to him outside the doors of this House, he would say there was a terrible lot of commonsense and intelligence in my amendments.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the setting up of this register is most desirable, but he feels that if he agrees to establish it, Deputy Dillon could say: &ldquo;In 1961, I brought in a Bill proposing the setting up of such a register but it was rejected by the House at the time. Later on, however, the Government had to accept the full terms of the Bill.&rdquo;  These amendments would be gladly and readily accepted by the Minister but for the fact that he has such an amount of political pride that he does not want it said from this side of the House that the register outlined in my amendments was suggested as permanent legislation in 1961 by the Leader of the Opposition.  He does not want to have it said that Fine Gael forced this on the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I believe the Land Commissioners themselves feel that such a register is necessary and desirable.  In addition, in 1961 members of the Government expressed their approval of the Private Bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition.  If the Government were serious in dealing with this problem, they would have accepted that private Bill and have this register set up.  No matter how desirable the setting up of this register is, the one thing that will <Col N="371" /> defeat it is overweening political pride on the part of the Minister.  I suggest to him that he could come out with flying colours, and really make a name for himself, if he buried his political pride.  Let him say: &ldquo;We will do it, whatever we may think of Deputy Dillon.&rdquo;  I am sure the backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party think a good deal of Deputy Dillon, because he made most of them prosperous men when he was Minister for Agriculture. In so doing, the Minister would show a high degree of sincerity.</P>
    <P>I ask him very sincerely to reconsider his attitude towards these amendments. They were not put down for fun.  They were given very serious and prolonged consideration.  The necessity for them has been established by the wide contacts between Deputies of our Party and the NFA and their knowledge of the serious problems that exist in each barony, parish, townland and county.  For that reason I sincerely recommend the adoption of the amendments by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan has made a wonderful case for these amendments, and I appeal to the Minister to adopt them and establish the register.  I was very disturbed last week when I saw a report in the papers of a case in the High Court where a farm in my county was purchased by an alien who came over by chartered plane to purchase that farm for £30,000.  That person now says he bought it under false pretences.  There were some fishing rights with the farm.  I wonder was that sale registered?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchaser took over a company in Molesworth Street, and the person selling the land had another company in the same building.  A large farm in Kilkenny was sold by a company in one room in Molesworth Street to another company in another room in the same building.  Is that not extraordinary?  Is it not a case in itself for the establishment of a register?  Is it not extraordinary that that could happen?  A farm in my county was transferred from one person in a room in Molesworth Street to another person in another room in the same building. As I said, evidence was given that accurate particulars were not supplied by the person who sold the farm.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he has a register. I wonder is this sale on the register in the Department of Lands?  Before this section is put, I should like the Minister to state that this particular sale at Ballycallan for £30,000 is on the register.  I should like to know that. I think the register proposed in the amendments should be established. There is a necessity for a proper register giving particulars of all valuations and purchase prices.  The case for it made by Deputy Flanagan is very good, and it was borne out further by the case in the High Court as recently as last week.  We were all very upset that that could happen.  The purchaser came over by chartered plane, not ordinary plane.  He could not wait. He was in too much of a hurry to buy land in Kilkenny which could have been used to help uneconomic holders. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was making the case that one of the best reasons for accepting the amendments <Col N="373" /> was the amount of detail into which they went, the necessity for that detail, and the inadequacy of any simple list or register of aliens buying land.  I think that case has been made by other speakers this morning.  I was dealing with amendment No. 5 and with the position of a limited liability company. I said that you have a limited liability company with a small number of shares held by a person who is named for life as the governing director of that company.  In subsection (2) of amendment No. 5, the onus is placed on the purchaser to register.  The conveyance is null and void unless the person to whom the land is conveyed notifies the Land Commission at least seven days before the conveyance.</P>
      <P>If there is a grave divergence between the figures of the Minister's Department and the NFA who conducted a survey on the purchase of lands by aliens, there is something wrong somewhere.  I am not suggesting that the NFA are right in every figure, and that the Minister is wrong in every figure.  This Party are convinced that what is required is a detailed register and a detailed approach to the problem such as they have produced in these amendments.</P>
      <P>If you move to amendment No. 6, you will find that considerable detail is required.  Again, as between the purchase of land by an individual person and the purchase of land by a limited liability or public company, the purchase is dealt with publicly so as to ensure that the full details and all the necessary details in each case are provided and registered in this detailed register which is so different from any general register at present in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take amendment No. 6.  In paragraph (i)&mdash;again, the number of the section, if it were introduced, is something we do not know, but we can leave that to the draftsman afterwards &mdash;the details that would be inserted in this section, of whatever number, are very great.  For instance, we must have the full name of the purchaser; the nationality of the purchaser; the address, if any, of the purchaser within the State; the address of the purchaser outside the State at which he <Col N="374" /> ordinarily resides; the townland or street, parish, barony and county in which the land is situate; the area of the land; the rateable value of the land; the consideration for which the land is being purchased; the nature of the estate or interest in the land which the purchaser will take under the conveyance, transfer or lease.  That last point is most important.  We have heard Deputy Crotty tell of two companies in two rooms in Molesworth Street.  It is not too difficult to form a limited liability company dealing with large tracts of land.</P>
    <P>The movement of land by sale from one company to another can completely bedevil the general register which the Minister has and we can have this discrepancy between the NFA figures and the Minister's figures. On this particular point, we insist that the nature of the estate or interest in the land which the purchaser will take under the conveyance, transfer or lease shall be made known.  I think that is a very good safeguard.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (ii) of this proposed new section in amendment No. 6, we have the portion dealing with the purchase of land by a limited liability company.  We must get the names, addresses and nationality of every shareholder.  We must get the number, nominal value and class of shares held by each shareholder.  These are very important points.  We must get the townland or street, parish, barony and county in which the land is situated; the area of the land, the rateable value of the land, the consideration for which the land is being purchased and the nature of the estate or interest in the land which the purchaser will take under the conveyance, transfer or lease.  These are the things that, to my mind, are so important.</P>
    <P>We have been told of all the different methods and ways of avoiding stamp duty.  Let us face it.  You employ a solicitor today in your interest and within the law.  It is his job to do the work for you as cheaply as possible so long as he can draw his own fees. But his job is to get you out as cheaply as possible as far as payments to any outside individual of any kind are <Col N="375" /> concerned, as well as estate duties, and so on.  So long as he can keep you within the law, that is his job.  Therefore, the effort to avoid stamp duty&mdash; and, let us face it, to a certain extent quite a successful effort&mdash;on the part of aliens buying land&mdash;again, a legitimate effort&mdash;must bedevil the general register which the Minister has.  The value of this type of register is that if anybody wishes to conduct a detailed investigation, all the facts are there.  It might well be that, on examining, for instance, the purchase of land by limited liability companies and public companies, the person who wanted to investigate the matter could factually decide by and large within this register &mdash;even though, according to the register, it would be a sale of land to foreigners so long as there was a foreigner there at all&mdash;whether or not it was an Irish operation.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have no great fetish about this thing.  We are not hysterical about it.  We concede that to a certain extent it is probably true that this has not reached massive proportions as yet but it is absolutely necessary that a detailed register should be kept and should be available.  There are many cases where land which is not being farmed as it should at the present moment could give more employment to Irish nationals at higher wages if the amount of capital that some aliens seem to have to invest and indeed in certain cases the amount of knowhow could be applied&mdash;and this is a good thing: there is nothing wrong with it.</P>
    <P>The whole centre of this situation is that the amount of money being devoted to land division is nothing like the amount of money being spent in the sale and purchase of land during any particular year.  Therefore, we have not any fantastic effort in our mind to exclude everybody who is not an Irish national.  At the same time, we want to see that the register is kept as and from now and that this information is there in detail.  Then we shall be in a position to examine it and to see if the problem is to assume the massive proportions that <Col N="376" /> some people already assume it has. Perhaps they are half right.  Perhaps the Minister is half wrong or half right, whichever way you want to look at it. However, it does appear as if they are not both right all the way.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, the NFA figures for Louth and Meath are fairly correct. Whether or not that adds up to the same situation throughout the country I do not know because I have not at present the contacts to know about other Deputies' constituencies.  The Minister said he has dealt with these figures elsewhere.  In face of a serious amending measure here, he should deal with them again with us now.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The mere fact that the Minister has set up a register at all, ineffective though it may be in many regards, suggests that he accepts the principle of the necessity for it.  It may be, indeed, that originally when set up, it was not spontaneously generated in the minds of the Fianna Fáil hierarchy. It may be that the Private Members' Bill introduced here by the Opposition in 1961 and subsequent agitation up and down the country in the Press, in NFA circles, and so on, to a certain extent pushed the Government into introducing the 1961 Finance measure and establishing what they call the register.  It may also be that we have perhaps subconsciously in the back of our minds the feeling that the Government did that with a certain degree of reluctance and have not really put their heart into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, we are merely seeking to have a more ambitious register than the Minister has at the moment.  It is bad even for international relations that this continual public agitation should go on about the excessive purchase of land by aliens.  If the production of a more perfect type of register which would try to stop the gaps which appear to exist here and there would lead to a lessening of public discussion on this matter, then the Minister should turn his mind in that direction.  He mentioned that the <Col N="377" /> register did disclose certain information, the name in the transaction, the acreage and the site, but the great difficulty arises as between the figures which the Minister gives in answer to questions and the figures which other sources produce from time to time, chiefly the surveys carried out by the NFA.</P>
    <P>It is quite impossible for the average citizen to reconcile the great discrepancy that exists between the two sets of figures.  I do not know how the Minister will explain it.  He will probably say that his register is right, but at the same time he did admit to two cases which were under investigation.  The Minister is a lawyer and every lawyer will admit that there are loopholes in most Acts. Deputy Flanagan has mentioned one or two ways in which the purchase of land by aliens can be carried out without having to pay this 25 per cent duty.  Deputy Flanagan's amendment mentions names, addresses and the nationality of company shareholders and the number, nominal value and class of shares held by each shareholder. There has been widespread feeling that a little racket has been going on through some manipulation of the company laws and the manipulation of shareholding by which people who are registered as companies have secured land and have succeeded in evading the purchase tax.</P>
    <P>The rateable value, according to the Minister's statement, does not seem to be entered in the register which the Land Commission keep for the Minister. That should be a routine entry. In paragraph (g) in amendment No. 6, there is a reference to the nature of the estate or interest in the land which the purchaser will take under the conveyance, transfer or lease.  It has been stated time and again that a lot of land is being leased to aliens.  I would ask the Minister if he can reconcile the figures given by voluntary agencies such as the NFA and the figures given by his Department.  We are asking for nothing more, and it is a reasonable request, then, that a better type of register be set up.  Even if it never uncovered an illegal transfer of property, if it merely quietened public discussion and settled public <Col N="378" /> opinion, it would have achieved its purpose.  If, on the other hand, it does disclose grave abuses, then the question of whether the 25 per cent purchase duty should be increased may have to be considered.</P>
    <P>The people of this country are very sensitive about the purchase of land. Traditionally, it is about the only thing we ever had.  The Minister comes from a part of the country in which an agrarian dispute has a traditional tincture.  I am sure, as Deputy Flanagan says, that he is a reasonable man and that he will meet this request in a reasonable fashion, that he will not try to steamroll his Bill as drafted through the House and will not use a battering ram on every amendment put up by this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point I wish to make.  Before the passage of the Finance Act which deals with this matter, the Minister must know as a solicitor that certain people, not reputable people, were purporting to use a method of purchase which was in fact a breach of the law and this register would bring it to light, but nothing short of the register will bring it to light.  I refer to the purchase of post-1940 companies in respect of which the shareholders were Irish nationals.  They gave a blank transfer and option to the foreigners to purchase those shares.  Any conveyancing or other counsel will make it perfectly clear that once an option and blank transfer of that sort has been given, the person concerned is no longer in beneficial ownership of the company. Notwithstanding that fact, declarations were given that beneficial ownership was vested in an Irish citizen.  It was not.  The legal ownership was vested in the Irish citizen but the beneficial ownership was vested in the person who had the option, plus the blank transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his private capacity must have heard, as I have, a great many stories about that.  As I say, I am quite convinced that no reputable solicitor ever did give a certificate in those circumstances but no matter who dealt with it, there were a substantial number of cases and that is the only explanation of the considerable difference in the two sets of <Col N="379" /> figures which are given at different periods.  The register suggested by us will have the effect of bringing those to light and of making sure that where there has been any breach of the law in these respects, that breach will be ascertained and can be dealt with appropriately, as well as making certain that the register itself will be a complete record of transactions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments, calling for an accurate register allowing no loopholes, have been put down mainly because both the Minister and the Government have held very strongly that there has been no serious transfer of Irish land to foreigners. There is serious disagreement about this view.  We hold that the purchase of Irish land by foreigners has been fairly extensive in relation to the size of the country and in relation to the amount of congestion still remaining. We know that the opposition to and resentment of this traffic is widespread, especially among small farmers with uneconomic holdings and insufficient land and the sons of such farmers who, because of their economic circumstances, have to remain at home and give unpaid, sweated labour in working the land.  These people are well qualified to make the best use of the land and should not be denied the opportunity of doing so.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he has a register which tells him that there is no serious transfer of Irish land to foreigners.  The opposite view is held by many people and there is much dissatisfaction about the information in that register if it presents that picture.  These amendments call for an accurate register, giving every detail in relation to the transfer of land and I fail to see why the Minister is opposing them.  He has a register which does not give any such detail and why does he oppose the establishment of a register that will give him all the information?  If he wants to prove that there is no such serious transfer of land, surely there would be information in such a register to help him to prove that?</P>
      <P>The Minister has expressed the view that there is some confusion and difference of opinion in the minds of Deputies on this side of the House in relation to the transfer of Irish land to foreigners.  When it comes to a division on these amendments, and I hope there will be a division on them, he will have no doubt as to whether Deputies on this side of the House are at one in their opposition to the transfer of Irish land to foreigners so long as we have so many Irish nationals in need of that land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has in his professional way given quite an enlightening exposition of the situation.  He gave the exact method by which the Minister's register could be confused and the method by which certain disreputable solicitors do succeed in evading stamp duty and also in removing themselves from the Minister's general register.  We are trying to cure this situation and it is most necessary that we do so.  The figures in the Minister's register and those of the NFA survey show grave discrepancies. In the NFA survey, I know from my personal knowledge that 200 acres have been sold at Clonee, 200 at Kells, 150 at Trim, 600 at Athy.  I do not know this last case of my own knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has introduced the question of time.  The thought behind the amendments which the Minister is not disposed to accept is that there is disquiet in the country as to the purchase of land by foreigners. I have made it clear that our reason for putting down the amendments is that while we have grave suspicions about the matter, we really do not know.  We cannot know until a detailed register is kept.  Suppose there were changes, five, ten or 15 years ago, surely they are proof that a trend is developing of too great a movement of land to foreigners?  Who cares what happened five or ten years ago?  The general question is whether the trend is serious.</P>
      <P>As far as I know, there are occasions on which we would not mind land being bought and worked by foreigners. I know a case in County Louth where a foreigner came in and bought land and employed four or five times the number of Irish nationals as had been employed on it previously and paid them £10 10s. and £11 a week, with some earning more in piece work in picking brussels sprouts.  That is good. There is nothing wrong with that.  If we gave congests the acreage they have been getting up to recently, they probably would not make that much on it.</P>
      <P>We want to find out if there is such wholesale transfer of land to foreigners as would affect the operations of the Land Commission, as would affect the opportunities of the farmers' sons to get land in their own areas.  Apparently the Minister wants to put us in the position of not knowing exactly what the situation is.  I think Deputy Sweetman's intervention on one particular legal point has shown that there is some real reason for our disquiet. Does the Minister agree with Deputy Sweetman that this is a method whereby a disreputable solicitor could do this?  If he disagrees with him, he should say so but he probably agrees that this could be done and that it has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why the admittedly incomplete survey which I <Col N="382" /> have before me gives a list of transfers of land which seems to be much more accurate than that given by the Minister. This seems to me to be the best argument produced yet in favour of these detailed amendments.  Let us consider for a moment individual items in this list.  I know them well, and Deputy Tully knows every one I have mentioned as well as I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  There are 200 acres mentioned at Dunboyne.  As far as I know there are more.  At Dunshaughlin, 100 acres &mdash;again, I believe there are more; Trim, 300 acres; Slane, 100 acres.  These are a few out of the list that I happen to know personally.  I do not object to a great number of them but I believe that, if this trend continues, these mildly measured amendments will not prevent any reputable speculator or decent man, who wants to come in here and provide employment for our people, from doing so.  At the same time, we should know exactly how we stand, what the trend is, whether we are going.  If anyone thinks a detailed investigation is necessary, and not only necessary but desirable, then I think the Minister should really agree without further discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The NFA document does give a considerable amount of detail about these transactions, but it does not give anything like the full story.  I have not yet met these people who come along and give a great deal of good employment.  In fact, I have met quite a number of the other sort, the man who lines up the three remaining farm workers, after he has dismissed seven, gets a whistle and explains to the three the three different tones.  When he blows tone No. 1, No. 1 comes in; when he blows tone No. 2, No. 2 comes in and, on tone No. 3, No. 3 comes in, just like so many dogs. For that reason I am not prepared to follow Deputy Donegan's line.  I do not think writing their names down after the farm has been bought and giving all the particulars asked for in these amendments will do one darn thing to help.</P>

If the register contains the details we have in mind, then the Land Commission must have first-class information as to the seriousness of this problem.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us if there is a section of the Land Commission, known as the Aliens (Registration of Purchase of Land) Section, which does nothing except record purchases of land.  Would he also give us some information as to how the Land Commission are notified of these purchases?</P>

      <P>That final remark is typical of the statements made by Deputy Flanagan.  I have given particulars from this register since it was established in 1961 in reply to questions.  The Deputy knows that well.  I realise the Deputy has his instructions to hold this measure up as long as possible and, on a Committee Stage, he can waste as much of the time of the House as he likes. He is aware the register is there.  He is aware that the Land Commission must be notified under the law.  An individual form is supplied in each case by the Revenue Commissioners setting <Col N="385" /> out the property purchased by the alien, the money paid for it, and describing the property.  The poor law valuations are not given because it is not necessary to give them in a conveyance. In the case of registered land, the folio number is sufficient.  In the case of non-registered land or land in pure realty, the description is given, including the extent of the property and the price paid.  Having got those particulars, it is an easy matter for the Land Commission to check.</P>
      <P>It has been ruled that discussion on the NFA document is not relevant on these amendments and I do not propose to follow any red herring in that regard.  I shall deal with the matter on an amendment dealing with the purchase of lands by aliens.  It will be relevant then.  I have been asked if I accept Deputy Sweetman's statement as to what some alleged disreputable solicitors have done.  I have pointed out on several occasions in this House that, if anyone is prepared to commit a deliberate fraud, he can do so provided he is prepared to take the consequences.  The shop boy can continue robbing the till and falsifying the receipts until he is caught out. There is no difference in essence between that and the proposition Deputy Sweetman has posed here because if what Deputy Sweetman alleged occurs in any case, this is the position under section 34 (8) (a) of the Finance Act, 1961:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a person makes a false statement or declaration for the purposes of establishing that an instrument is not chargeable with stamp duty at the rate provided for by subscription (5) of the 1949 section, such person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of five hundred pounds, or at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
      <P>To deal with the specific case Deputy Sweetman poses about blank transfer forms of shares being executed for this purpose, I refer the House to sub-paragraph (b) of the same section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> Where an offence under this subsection is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been committed under the authority of, or with the consent or approval of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate, such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to have committed the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if anybody is prepared to make a false declaration, to swear a lie, for the purpose of avoiding this stamp duty, he comes within the provisions of that section.  I have not suggested at any stage that any law passed by this House will not be deliberately broken by somebody.  However, if people are prepared to commit a criminal offence, that is their business and they can take the consequences. I doubt very much if there would be many people, even a disreputable solicitor, who would chance that.  Outside whatever else might happen to the disreputable solicitor by way of going to gaol, and so on, he would be a solicitor no longer when this was brought to the notice of the Incorporated Law Society. These are the risks these people would have to take and these are the penalties to which such people leave themselves open if they engage in fraud of the type described by Deputy Sweetman.</P>
    <P>I do not say that there are not people who will be foolish enough to break the law in this respect.  It happens every day of the week in all walks of life.  However, I am quite sure Deputy Sweetman will accept and confirm to his colleagues over there that the position of which I have informed the House is, in fact, the legal position.</P>
    <P>Our people are not slow to bring such matters to official notice when they arise.  This is a small country, and by and large, outside the city of Dublin and across into rural Ireland, practically everybody knows everybody else and indeed everybody else's business. If fraud of this type occurred in some place, I should be surprised if it did not come to light before very long.  As <Col N="387" /> Deputy Donegan said, as the law stands, if it is a matter of a body corporate, one can very soon ascertain, by making a search in the Companies Office, information about any company.</P>
    <P>In our experience since the passage of the Finance Act of 1961, no such case as this has come to our notice. There is one case of which I heard where this type of transaction was suggested and inquiries are being made into it, as we would have to inquire into any such allegation about any of these transactions.  It is not correct for any Deputy to suggest that, despite the passage of the Finance Act, 1961, there is a genuine legal way of avoiding this stamp duty.  Certainly no such case has come to my notice nor have I heard of it through my Department or through contacts outside my Department.</P>
    <P>If these amendments were accepted, it would not in any way seal off the fraudulent transactions posed by Deputy Sweetman.  If people were prepared to swear a false declaration under the existing law for the purpose of avoiding stamp duty, surely they would be prepared to commit a further fraud if the particulars suggested in these amendments were required from them.  Deputy Sweetman has mentioned beneficial ownership and let me say that the expression &ldquo;beneficial ownership&rdquo; is not mentioned in any one of the amendments before the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan made some suggestion that whatever I said was in some way derogatory towards the firm of Messrs. Guinness.  I merely took Messrs. Guinness as an example of what would happen if the Deputy's amendments were accepted by this House and became law.  I gave them as an example when amendments were being discussed to the Private Members' Bill introduced by the Deputy's Party away back in 1961.  These are just lifted, as I have already said, directly from that and put down as amendments to this Land Bill.</P>
    <P>At that time, I said, at column 1703, Volume 188, of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Subsection (ii) (a) of section 4 provides that in every case the <Col N="388" /> purchaser within paragraph (ii) of subsection (2) of section 3 of this Act must furnish to the Land Commission the names, addresses and nationality of every shareholder. Messrs. Arthur Guinness would, therefore, have to compile a list of their thousands of shareholders and furnish it to the Land Commission. If they had a subsidiary under subsection (3), they would have to furnish a list covering their subsidiary, too.</P>
    <P>I said, further:</P>
    <P>If there were 99 per cent of the equity, as Deputy Dillon calls it, held by Irish nationals and one per cent held outside, a list containing the name of every shareholder would have to be furnished in addition to all the other information provided for in section 4.  That applies in the case of companies.  In the case of individuals, an obligation would be imposed not alone on the purchaser but on the vendor to investigate the nationality of any and every purchaser.  He would have to get his seed, breed and generation as far as nationality is concerned. If he failed to give this seven days' notice provided for in the Bill and if the transaction proved to be void, the purchaser would be entitled in equity to his money back and the duty would be on the vendor's solicitors to investigate nationality. The position would be that there could never be any finality, during our lifetime, at all events, to the closing of any sale.  This Bill&mdash;let me stress the point&mdash;does not take any positive steps to deal with the problem as we see it.  It does not deal with the pre-1947 company.</P>
    <P>On these amendments everything I said on that section of that Bill is equally relevant and if, for any purpose, in this country, Messrs. Guinness had one foreign shareholder, under the provisions of these amendments here, the whole register of Guinness would have to be supplied to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I gave that instance to show how unworkable these amendments are.  It would appear that Deputy Flanagan did not go to the trouble of reading <Col N="389" /> the debates on their own Bill which was discussed in 1961 or, otherwise, he might at least have tried to cure the sections he has put down in the form of these amendments.  The suggestions contained in these amendments are unnecessary, unworkable and will not in any way assist the work of the Land Commission or control the sale of Irish land to aliens.</P>
    <P>As far as Deputy Flanagan is concerned, I must keep denying assertions that he makes here.  It is all the same whether I inform him once that they are untrue or 100 times that they are untrue; he will still come back with them for the purpose of wasting time on this Bill.  But let me repeat that an alien in this country cannot acquire citizenship within seven years&mdash;I think that is generally the period&mdash;and unless he becomes an Irish citizen, his child would not, by virtue of the fact of being born here, become an Irish citizen.  Again let me assert that this allegation that children born here to aliens, people who are not citizens of this country, are used for the purpose of avoiding stamp duty, is a fairy tale. I do not accept it.</P>
    <P>As far as the figures given in the register set up under the Finance Act, 1961, are concerned, these particulars are given separately in respect of each transaction by the Revenue Commissioners to the Land Commission who enter them in their register, who investigate them if they call for investigation. The Land Commission have their own way, and a far more efficient way, of investigating.  They have a trained staff in every county for their purposes.  The Land Commission officials will know and must know, because it is their job, more than anybody else as to what is happening as far as land is concerned.  As rural Deputies well know, Land Commission officials in rural Ireland will be made aware very quickly of any purchases of land.</P>
    <P>There are queues outside Land Commission offices of countrymen, certainly in any of the congested counties, asking the Land Commission, in some cases, to take over their neighbour's land, in some cases to take over land that is up for sale. <Col N="390" /> There is very little happening, I would suggest to the House, as far as land is concerned in any parish in rural Ireland that is not brought in one way or another to the attention of the local Land Commission inspector.</P>
    <P>In addition to this register, my indoor staff have a fairly ready way of getting a report or checking on any transaction that appears on the register or is reported to them.  So that whatever estimates may have been made before that&mdash;and I gave details to the House in years gone by as to the kind of checks that were made&mdash; we have here, under the law as enacted by this House, since the Finance Act, 1961, an exact record of every acre of Irish land that is transferred to aliens, whether it be (1) in respect of which the 25 per cent stamp duty is paid, (2) if it is for industry or (3) if it is exempted under the sections that provide for exemption.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear also, because the point was made by somebody, that a different section of the Finance Act, 1961 covers leasehold sales.  Therefore, I assert that we now have, from the year 1961&mdash;and I will give the figures here and have given them several times&mdash;an exact record of the transfers that are taking place to aliens.  Of course, I can see that if in any case there has been a fraud, it would not come on to the register but frauds have a knack of coming out at some stage or other.  If there is any case in respect of which anybody has any suspicion that there has been a fraud or that stamp duty has been avoided by fraud, if the Land Commission are notified, they will very quickly have any such allegation investigated. It is their duty to do so. If it transpired that, due to fraud, stamp duty was avoided, all these penalties to which I have referred, in addition to the penal stamp duty that should be paid in these cases and whatever other penalties that might be provided by those concerned in the administration of the law, would come into operation.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, I ask the House to reject these amendments.  I do not want to assist Deputy Flanagan in his campaign to keep up here on <Col N="391" /> these amendments for all eternity.  I have already given these answers several times.  I suppose I shall be expected to keep on repeating them and denying the allegations that have been made.</P>

      <P>I want to put this point: the Minister talks of the penalties in the situation outlined by Deputy Sweetman but surely it is true that the format of these amendments means that those who perpetrate fraud must, within seven days, deliver to the Land Commission the evidence against themselves?  Is this not the greatest insurance that these frauds will no longer be perpetrated?</P>
      <P>I think the Minister condemns the present situation out of his own lips when he said that they heard of a case and that it is being investigated.  I think nobody in the Land Commission has time to investigate specific cases and rumours that arise.  They have to decide which is rumour and which is fact and, having done that, presumably they start, in the case of a company, by making a search in the Companies Office.  Then they would get legal opinion on the matter and go into it.  I know the format of these amendments might be an irritation to a large company such as the Minister mentions.  They might have to give a full list of shareholders but these amendments mean that the evidence of the fraud would be delivered to the Land Commission before the fraud is perpetrated.  As well as having the advantage of a proper register, any suspicion of fraud immediately places the officials in the Land Commission in the position of being able to take up the information sent in and ascertaining whether or not there has been a fraud.  This seals up the case outlined by Deputy Sweetman.  That is my view about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I want to ask the Minister a question. The Minister mentioned a fine of £500 or six months in jail, or both&mdash;I think he said&mdash;for any fraud discovered as regards registration.  Have there been any cases since 1961 in which legal proceedings were taken and sentences <Col N="393" /> imposed for such acts of fraud?  The Minister also said, in his view, there is no legal means by which an alien may avoid registration.  Yet we have Deputy O'Higgins saying he knows of such a legal means.  It seems there is a definite hiatus here of which the Minister should take cognisance and if there is not provision to deal with that, surely it is his duty to introduce the necessary amendment, if he can devise one, to cover such a gap in the present legislation.</P>
      <P>I ask him to give that serious consideration. At least it may emerge that, as regards the more elaborate amendments which we have put down regarding the establishment of a register and the more detailed information such a register would supply, it may disclose, if it cannot prevent, circumvention, whether there is much legal circumvention of the principle of registration of the purchase of land by aliens in so far as the register would be a correct one.  Subsequently, an investigation outside might disclose if there are a large number of purchases by non-nationals.</P>

      <P>The Minister will agree that there is a high degree of integrity among the legal profession generally.  Any solicitor who values his practice and the trust, confidence and honesty of his clientele will not take the chance of associating himself with any kind of fraud.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>But if there is to be fraudulent operation to avoid the 25 per cent duty, a solicitor must be associated with it.  Deputy Sweetman gave us an instance of how this 25 per cent can be got over by improper methods being used by a solicitor.  For that reason.  I feel that it should not be possible for non-nationals to purchase and wipe the eye of the Revenue authorities by false declarations, as the Minister has mentioned.  I should <Col N="394" /> like to know how many cases have come to notice since 1961 under the existing Land Commission register of a solicitor or member of the legal profession endeavouring to put over a fast one on the Land Commission or the Revenue authorities regarding the purchase of land.  Has any action been taken by the authorities in such cases? The Minister is extremely vague in what he says about these matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins has assured the House he knows of another method by which properties can be leased to aliens without the 25 per cent stamp duty being imposed.  The Minister would be expected to know the legal provisions, but then the Minister has not been in practice for a considerable time and the fact that he has been out of practice for so long may mean that he is not in touch and does not know the extent of the problem in relation to property transfers today.  Of course we forgive the Minister if he lacks intimate professional knowledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy M. J. O'Higgins mentioned my name during his remarks.  I shall be very brief on this.  I do not know how the Minister could have been any clearer in his reply on the subject of fraud.  What Deputy O'Higgins mentioned, and what Deputy O.J. Flanagan failed or neglected to take notice of is that there may be a perfectly legitimate way of avoiding paying the 25 per cent stamp duty.  If there is, I do not know it, but if Deputy O'Higgins says there is, I am prepared to accept that he knows what he is talking about.  However, that has nothing whatever to do with fraud.  As far as fraud is concerned, it has been dealt with very effectively time and time again.</P>
      <P>If there is a method of avoiding this stamp duty, all that has to be done is to have an investigation into it and take whatever steps are necessary to seal off that avenue.  That, I submit, just about finishes the discussion.  Why Deputy O.J. Flanagan should have to drag in all sorts of irrelevancies about the legal profession and so forth, I do not know.  It is not for me to answer on behalf of the Minister, but if Deputy Flanagan is not convinced now, he will never be convinced.</P>

      <P>I should like to follow the point Deputy Seán Flanagan made.  I do not want in any way to mislead him or the Minister.  I do not know of any particular case in which the system I have in mind was utilised in a way which would abuse existing legislation.  I believe there is a method which is, as I have said, perfectly legitimate, whereby the 25 per cent stamp duty rate can be avoided. As Deputy Seán Flanagan has pointed out, a certain amount of the discussion on this amendment has dealt with the value from our point of view, or otherwise from the Minister's point of view, of the amendment in cases of fraudulent intent where an effort is made to defraud the Revenue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan is quite right in pointing out that if there is a legitimate way of avoiding the 25 per cent duty which is not captured by the 1961 Finance Act, then a different field is opened and a different argument develops on this amendment.  I do not want to detain the House but I would suggest that the Minister assume with me for the moment that I am right and that such a legitimate method does exist of avoiding the provisions of the 1961 Finance Act. Assuming that to be the case, will the Minister concede that then there is value in the amendment tabled by Deputy Oliver Flanagan, if he disregards completely the question of fraud?</P>
      <P>It may be too big an assumption to ask the Minister to make, but if he assumes that the machinery set up by the 1961 Finance Act does not capture all of the cases, does not require application to be made to the Land Commission in all of these cases, then surely there would be value in this amendment, which provides for an additional requirement whereby a register will be maintained in the Land Commission and whereby anyone who is not an Irish citizen will be required to appear in that register in relation to the purchase of property to which the Act relates?  I would ask the Minister to give the amendment consideration from that point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for a register has been established by reason of the repeated admissions by the Minister for Finance that various methods of avoiding the stamp duty have escaped his attention, and his repeated declarations, when these matters were brought to his attention, of his intention to examine them and close the loopholes referred to by Deputy Seán Flanagan. What we appear to have overlooked is that there is no limit to the loopholes any more than there are limits to the ingenuity of man.  The more a person has to gain by avoiding the tax, the more likely is he to pay people to find some way of avoiding payment of the tax.</P>
      <P>It is imperative in the national interest that we know the extent of it as soon as any of these events happen.  We know from practice that what has been happening in the past is this: Perhaps for a year or more some loophole is availed of but it is only when that reaches flood proportions that the matter is brought to the attention of some Deputy, who raises it with the Minister for Finance, who states he does not know anything about it but that he will have some inquiry made. Then you have a further 12 months' or a couple of years' delay before that flood-gate is closed.  On that account I would ask the Minister to be more sympathetic to the idea and objective we have in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose for the delectation of Deputy Ryan and Deputy O'Higgins, who have strolled into the House in the past ten minutes for the purpose of having their lunch, <Col N="398" /> to go over the particular register in the Land Commission dealing with these issues since 1961.  Deputy O'Higgins was not here when his colleague, Deputy Sweetman, spoke.  It was he who alleged there were disreputable solicitors who were prepared to commit fraud for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of the Finance Act, 1961.  It was not I.  Certainly, Deputy Sweetman, who is also in practice like Deputy O'Higgins, did not suggest there was any legal way of avoiding the provisions of the Finance Act, 1961, in respect of the 25 per cent stamp duty. I have already repeated that I do not know of any way, nor has any legitimate way come to my attention or to the attention of those under my control.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins suggested he has heard there is a way, although he did not know that it was ever used.  He said he would tell us later on.  He mentioned the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo;&mdash;that land could be leased.  Strange to say, my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, has not heard of any legitimate way either of getting around the provision <i>in terrorem</i> of the Finance Act, 1961. I am not so long away from my practice not to remember this: if the method Deputy O'Higgins suggests is some form of lease of land, the leasing of land for a period of more than a year is voided under existing law.  If it is some device by form of lease, as far as agricultural land is concerned, it would work to avoid the existing law.</P>
      <P>At all events, if anybody from any side of the House can give me any evidence of any case in which he says a gap has been found in the law provided under the Finance Act, 1961, I will of course deal with the matter forthwith; but there is no evidence, nor has any evidence been brought before me, that such a loophole exists, and no evidence has come to the notice of my officials or of the Revenue Commissioners, so far.  I concede what Deputy Ryan says.  I never underestimate man's ingenuity, and particularly lawyer's ingenuity, in trying to get round provisions of this kind.  The fact remains, however, that, so far, no way we know of has been found.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House because other Deputies in the Labour Party are far more capable than I am of dealing with all aspects of this Estimate.  I wish to raise one particular item which <Col N="401" /> I raised before by way of question in the House on 19th June, 1963, and which I raised by way of repeated letters to the Minister, asking him to intervene in connection with the old age pension of a constituent of mine. I refer the Minister to column 1197, volume 203 of the Official Report.  I shall not mention the individual's name, but that reference will bring to the minds of the Minister and his advisers the case I am talking about.</P>
      <P>The appeal of this old age pensioner for a full pension has been rejected by the Department on a number of occasions.  Prior to June last, I wrote to the Minister and got the usual acknowledgement, stating that the matter was being examined.  That examination has been going on for 12 months now.  The old age pensioner is a retired blacksmith.  I know his case very well because I was born in the parish where he lives.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies I make representations from time to time on pension cases, but it is rarely that I make strong representations about pension cases.  I do that only when I know the circumstances.  I shall not tolerate, when I write in here as a Deputy and outline the circumstances, the Minister or an underling doubting my word or the word of the local clergy or people of that parish.  Not once alone did I write outlining the circumstances in this case but, after asking a question here in the Dáil in June last, I even had the patience left last December to write again, suggesting it was time a favourable decision was made in this case&mdash;and this is now March.  All I have to show for the representations I have made and for the trouble that has been taken by people in the parish to help this man is a file of acknowledgements from the Minister and his Department.</P>
      <P>I am talking at this stage to the Minister but I am trying to reach behind the Minister to what I believe should be a neutral Civil Service.  If the Department of Social Welfare and its officers fail to live up to the responsibility to be non-political, then I think they are bringing about a change in the fabric of democratic society in this country and that many people will rue the day that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister states: &ldquo;It is not a function of mine.&rdquo;  In the Dáil debate on 19th June, when I asked if the Minister would personally investigate this matter to satisfy himself whether or not the decision made by the appeals officer was correct, the Minister said: &ldquo;It is not a function of mine.&rdquo;  I must get satisfaction, as an elected representative of the people whom I represent.  Is it now the position that a faceless bureaucrat can tell me that I am not correct in the evidence I give as an elected representative of the people?</P>
      <P>I asked this Minister to intervene and he would not.  He said he had no function.  I know he intervenes in other cases.  He used this House to suggest he had no function and consequently he would not intervene.  I do not expect him to intervene but I expect that the Civil Service itself, through the letters sent and the representations made in this House, will show their own responsibility to the public, even though they may be under an irresponsible Minister.  He will not be there forever but the Civil Service structure is there and it is one we want to see preserving strict neutrality in Party politics.  The appeals officer or the senior civil servants in that Department who, when a Deputy asks for an investigation to be made, fail to carry it out are not living up to the responsibility of civil servants.</P>
      <P>Let me go a little further in this.  As a result of my intervention and the intervention of other people, this case came again before the local pensions sub-committee in Athlone on 1st February.  What happened?  The pensions officer became hysterical at the meeting and accused the unfortunate man, who is barely able to talk, of telling lies.  The words he used were: &ldquo;That is a lie,&rdquo; jumping to his feet on repeated occasions.  That information was conveyed to me personally by the vice-chairman of that pensions sub-committee who acted as chairman on that day and who was shocked and horrified at the conduct of this pensions officer.</P>

      <P>This retired blacksmith, an old man who has spent a considerable time in hospital on a number of occasions in the past three years, is now assessed as earning £27 as a blacksmith in his forge.  There are not enough horses left in the parish to shoe to earn £27.  The pensions officer said, when questioned on this by the vice-chairman of the pensions sub-committee: &ldquo;I passed by the door of the forge and there was work going on.&rdquo;  He was asked how he assessed it and he said he made an estimate of what he was making on it.</P>
      <P>The man lives in a cottage.  The pensions officer estimated he also made £27 or £37&mdash;for safety sake, I shall take £27&mdash;from setting the bit of land which is attached to his cottage. It is there available and can be given as sworn evidence that the maximum sum this man got for this was £10.</P>
      <P>The third assessment made against this unfortunate man was that the local parish priest gave him a sum of £20 for ringing the bell for Mass, for the Angelus, for the Stations of the Cross, and so forth.  When did a gift like that from the local clergy become part of an assessable income for old age pension purposes?  I think it is an absolute scandal.  This was given in one year.  One would think this was given as an income every year of his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hope that this Minister will solve it but I am asking that the matter be examined and that this man's old age pension be back-dated to the date he first made application. I ask that he be given the maximum non-contributory old age pension back-dated to the date of his original application.  I shall not be satisfied with being told he is now being granted the full amount as from 1st February, 1964.  If anybody thinks that the past injustice will be papered over by allowing him from the beginning of this year, there is another guess coming.  I hope that within the next fortnight a favourable decision will be taken as far as this man's case is concerned.  Whatever action is taken by senior officials of the Department <Col N="404" /> with regard to their lack of attention to a genuine complaint made in this House is a matter for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is common ground here that it is socially and economically good to improve our social welfare benefits to the limit of our resources and any proposal to improve the old age pension, the widow's pension, unemployment benefits and so on, has always received a very sympathetic reception in this House.  I want to direct the attention of the House to a very important aspect of this whole question.</P>
      <P>The purpose of increasing social welfare benefits is to improve the circumstances of the old age pensioners and the other social service beneficiaries. But there is at present proceeding in this country a spiral in the cost of living which takes from the old age pensioner and every other social service beneficiary in the State, by a process of steady erosion, every increase that is provided by the Oireachtas.  We are now well-nigh in the fantastic situation that, having increased the old age pension to the figure at which it at present stands, the increase in the cost of living means that the old age pension at its present figure buys approximately what 11/-would have bought just before the war.</P>
      <P>We are all persuading ourselves that we are successfully improving the social circumstances of the old age pensioners when in fact the true measure of our exertions is that we may have increased their purchasing power by approximately one shilling. Bread has gone up.  Bus fares are going up.  I am told that the price of electricity will go up.  The price of almost everything else the old age pensioner has to buy has gone up. Unless I am greatly mistaken, we are only in the initial stages of that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember when the inter-Party Government were in office, that aspect of this whole situation was constantly present to our minds but we were concerned to keep the price of essential food, clothing and fuel for our people at stable prices so that the increases in <Col N="405" /> the social service benefits we were in a position to make would be real increases and would confer a real benefit on those who received them.  It cost the Exchequer at that time about £9 million a year in subsidies on the prices of these essential commodities in order to maintain the purchasing power of social service beneficiaries, not to speak of all the other elements in our society living on fixed incomes.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government have abandoned that policy and are committed to a programme of letting prices rip, but over and above that, the Government, for the first time in my experience in public life, have nailed their flag to the mast of raising their revenue by taxing&mdash;positively taxing&mdash; the essential food, fuel and clothing of the people.  Now they have persuaded themselves, according to what they say, that the increase in the cost of living consequential on that policy has been no more than two or three per cent.  All I want to tell them is that if they honestly believe that, they are living in cloud-cuckoo land.  The true cost of living on the people who have to bear it is rising steadily and the people who suffer most are the old age pensioners, the widowed pensioners and all the others who have a fixed income and who have not available to them the means of expanding their incomes in proportion to the rise in the cost of living either through a trade union organisation or in the case of property holders by the expansion of the dividends they receive from their investments.</P>
    <P>I view this trend with the gravest possible concern because the truth is that the people on whom this burden bears most heavily find it hard to understand why, when they are receiving in money what appears to be a much larger pension than they were receiving 20 years ago, they still find themselves barely able to get as much for it as the much lesser sum bought 20 years ago.  I believe if the present trend continues, it must involve hardships for those sections of the community who are least able to bear them.  It shocks me to hear the cynical indifference with which members of the Government refer to that trend <Col N="406" /> because I am long enough in this job to remember distinctly the social progress that was made in this Legislature whereby we turned our backs resolutely and determinedly on what used to be described as &ldquo;hard taxes.&rdquo; I can remember a time when a recognised source of revenue was the tax on tea&mdash;4d a lb. it used to be&mdash;the tax on sugar&mdash;sometimes as much as 1d or 1½d a lb.&mdash;and I can remember the satisfaction it gave most Deputies when these taxes were finally abandoned on the ground that they were taxes which impinge most heavily on those sections of our society who are least able to bear them.</P>
    <P>We called them &ldquo;hard taxes&rdquo; and we were concerned to get rid of them and we substituted for them taxes on luxuries at whatever level was necessary in order to compensate the revenue for the exemption of the essential food, fuel and clothing of our people from taxation.  I believe that was a sound principle of taxation.  I believe it is a sound principle of taxation and I believe the Government's cynical departure from it has indeed not only all the elements of grave social injustice but also elements of a disastrous character from the point of view of the fundamental economy of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to pursue the economic aspect of this question for it falls outside the ambit of this Vote.  It is the social aspect I am dwelling on now, but I want to make this perfectly clear, that it is not true to say that socially this policy may have much to be said against it but that economically it is vital to the survival of the State.  I want to state quite categorically that for the reasons I state in detail now it is socially undesirable but that over and above that it is disastrous economically and with that aspect we can deal on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement the other day dealt with the total <Col N="407" /> cost of the increased benefits provided in this year.  In the course of his statement he said: &ldquo;The increased cost in 1964-65 arising from the improvements in these services made by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963 amounts to £4 millions, but this figure falls to be reduced by £269,000 as a result of offsetting factors.&rdquo;  It is not so easy to determine precisely what contribution the Exchequer is making to these increases, bearing in mind the very substantial income derived from the increased contributions by way of insurance stamps made to the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to this fact: the case has been made that in order to provide these increased social welfare benefits which all of us desire to see provided, it is necessary to tax the essential food, fuel and clothing of the people.  That proposition is wholly untrue.  Since the 2½ per cent turnover tax came into operation, there has been increases in the prices of beer, stout, whiskey, cigarettes and petrol.  There has been twopence on beer, twopence on whiskey, twopence on cigarettes and 1½d. on petrol.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out where the revenue has been found.  If these increases in prices had been obtained by direct excise duties on these several commodities, it would have produced in revenue a sum in excess of £6 million a year which is surely in excess of the total amount required to provide the benefits set out in the Estimate.  In that way, we could have got all the revenue necessary for these increases without putting a penny on essential food, fuel or clothing.  I suggest that if the sound philosophy of equitable taxation had been the guiding light of the Government instead of this cynical approach to the matter, we could have ensured <Col N="408" /> that the social welfare beneficiaries would have got a real advantage from these improvements instead of the illusory advantage which resulted from giving these benefits with one hand and taking them away with the other hand by increasing the cost of living.</P>
      <P>People cannot live without bread, cannot live without the essential necessaries of life and to tax these at the same time as you increase social welfare benefits is to take from the people with one hand what you pretend to give them with the other.  I feel that the Minister for Social Welfare ought to concern himself deeply with the growing problem of the rising cost of living.  That is one of the principal elements of the whole social welfare of our people and it is those sections of our community for whom the Minister ought to feel a primary responsibility who feel that grevious burden most acutely.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer.  I do not believe the Minister for Social Welfare can wash his hands of responsibility for the social welfare of our people whether they reside here or abroad.  We have sent to Great Britain approximately 300,000 boys and girls between the ages of 18 to 25 over the past seven years.  It is common knowledge that, in addition, thousands of boys and girls of much more tender years have gone to Britain.  I want to suggest to the House that their social welfare is the concern of this House.  I am not asking the Minister to draft any new legislation or even by regulation of his Department to take a positive step in this regard.  I know that it is inappropriate and impermissible to advocate new legislation on an Estimate but the Minister has it in his power, and it is his real duty, to recognise the social problem of our people who are in Britain at the present time, who are uncared for, but whose parents are here and whose families are here and who ought to look to us when they have no one else to look to, to help them in the social peril which they meet when they are forced to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried to raise this matter on the <Col N="409" /> Estimate introduced by the Minister for Justice but our difficulty is that everybody washes his hands and says: &ldquo;It is no responsibility of mine.&rdquo;  I want to press on the Minister for Social Welfare that it must be his responsibility.  I recognise that if the Minister did concern himself directly with those residing outside the jurisdiction, it would create a problem but the nature of this problem is one which perhaps could best be tackled not by official ministerial action but by ministerial encouragement and a readiness on his part to help in the co-ordination of the kind of effort that would give valuable results.</P>
    <P>What is our problem?  Our problem is that young Irish boys and girls go to Britain largely from rural areas in this country and find themselves catapulted into a social background with which they are wholly unfamiliar. Girls either fail to secure employment or lose it and then fall into bad hands and may either find themselves in trouble, possibly brought before the courts, or even betrayed and abandoned to the streets.  Boys in unfamiliar surroundings find themselves in conflict with the law, find themselves brought before the police magistrates and friendless and then find themselves under the handicap of that record in any subsequent search for work.</P>
    <P>I believe the majority of these young persons who get into trouble get into it for two reasons.  One is that, being themselves very young, they venture forth into the unfamiliar surroundings of Great Britain without proper preparation. I suggest to the Minister for Social Welfare that he should concern himself forthwith to bring home to the parents of children who may be contemplating emigration that young persons, but especially young girls, should not be allowed to go to Great Britain unless they have an immediate prospect of suitable employment and unless they are going to live with relatives or trusted emigrant neighbours who can be depended upon to look after them.</P>
    <P>The great disaster, from any information I have been able to collect upon this, is that the young unprotected <Col N="410" /> girl arrives over in London, or Birmingham, or Liverpool or Glasgow without a job and without a home to go to; she finds herself sometimes in most unsuitable lodgings; whatever modest sum she brings with her begins to fritter away; she may meet unsuitable companions in commercial dance-halls and, before she knows where she is, she is in trouble.  The tragedy very often in cases of this character, even where her distress is discovered by charitable organisations and an effort made to get her to go home and put the whole thing behind her, is that one not infrequently finds that the young girl does not want to recover contact with home; she wants to be forgotten. She is ashamed to come home and, instead of grasping the helping hand, she is inclined rather to reject it.</P>
    <P>The same situation in large measure applies to young boys.  If they go into unsuitable lodgings, and fail to get work, or lose the job they have, they may begin to drift and, as so very often happens, if they are in gravely unsuitable lodgings, their natural tendency is to drift into the public-house; there they get drunk and get involved in some squabble or brawl. Forthwith, they acquire a police record and, thereafter, their history may be painful in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Now, what can we do about it?  I make first the suggestion to the Minister that he has an obligation to bring vividly to the minds of parents the kind of problem that exists and the precautions they themselves ought to take for the protection of their children.  But is that enough?  I suggest to the Minister it is not.  I suggest that those of our young people who have gone wrong impose an obligation upon us; we have a very grave duty to do the best we can to help them.  I am not prepared to say that should necessarily involve the Minister in making large financial contributions to existing associations, however well intentioned and I put forward this suggestion for consideration.  I think what is urgently needed in Great Britain today, from the point of view of our young people, is a suitable personnel, that is to say, social workers who are prepared to undertake the very formidable burden <Col N="411" /> of effectively making contact with these young people and keeping contact with them, (1) to keep them out of trouble and (2) thankless as the task may appear, when they are in trouble, to extend a helping hand and keep after them until they can turn them from the road on which they have been travelling, get them back on their feet again, restore them to normal life and to the place in society they ought to occupy.</P>
    <P>Work of this kind is now proceeding. Charitable bodies, like the Legion of Mary, are engaged in this work at the present time.  Two inadequacies exist: a great many of the social workers are people relatively senior and it is very often extremely difficult for seniors to carry conviction to a young girl in trouble that they really want to help her.  Youngsters in trouble are liable, however mistaken, to see in a senior person a critic rather than a sympathetic friend, and so it becomes even more difficult for social workers, who are seniors, to make the kind of contact that it is so urgently necessary to make.</P>
    <P>The probation officers of the British police courts are already heavily over-taxed and, in any case, they do not know our people.  They are, I understand, splendid public officials, who do superb work, but they have too much work to do; they also lack the understanding, which is very natural, that might make all the difference between failure and success in helping our young people who get into trouble.  I, therefore, want to suggest to the Minister, for consideration at least, whether it would not be within the range of practical politics to promote here something on the lines of the peace corps promoted by the late President Kennedy for quite a different purpose.  He propounded to his young people in the United States of America that there was a great social task awaiting them in South America and other parts of the world, where it was not money that was primarily needed but young people prepared to do work that no one else could do, young people who were prepared to do it for a limited period from a purely disinterested <Col N="412" /> motive, none other than to help their neighbours.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not deny that when I first heard that concept formulated by the late President Kennedy, it seemed to me to be outside the scope of practical possibility in that it appeared to be much too idealistic an approach, but I was wrong.  In fact, it has had a great measure of success and there are thousands of young Americans at present serving all over the world, for no reward at all, for a strictly limited period, giving their services voluntarily to help their less fortunate neighbours in the underdeveloped countries of the world.  I wonder would the Minister not take example from this idealistic adventure?</P>
    <P>If we are to make contact with the largely forgotten immigrants who are in trouble in Britain, what we want now is personnel to rescue them from whatever perils they may have fallen into.  I should like the Minister to consider the question, after consultation with the existing charitable organisations, as to whether a similar organisation, a peace corps from this country, might not be a very material help to these charitable organisations which are at present struggling with this problem in Great Britain.  I suggest to the Minister it might be an advantage to consult the probation services of the administration in Great Britain as to whether they would be prepared to accept supplementation of their functions by voluntary personnel of this kind.  I recognise it is an idealistic approach but I have very little doubt that if the thing could be organised it would be well nigh the perfect approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>Surely Deputies on all sides of the House will agree with me that the time is long past when we can pretend that this problem does not exist.  I do not want to exaggerate.  Some well-intentioned people are inclined to inflate this problem to an unrealistic dimension and in their warmness of heart and their desire for reform sometimes I am afraid their exaggeration tends to repel people who would be prepared to make a realistic contribution but who are not prepared to be stampeded <Col N="413" /> into action by what they feel is an exaggerated version of the facts.  I want to keep the problem in proportion.</P>
    <P>It is essential to realise that according to all the best authorities 85 per cent or even more of Irish people going to Great Britain get along very well.  They become integrated into the society in which they live and earn a good living.  In some cases they come home and in other cases settle down in Great Britain and experience none of the difficulties to which I refer.  However, if we can agree&mdash; and I am afraid we must accept it is true&mdash;that up to ten per cent of those who go to England do encounter the kind of difficulties to which I have referred we shall have to recognise that in the last seven or eight years there are 30,000 of our young people in danger of trouble.</P>
    <P>We cannot simply pretend that problem does not exist.  I am not saying there are 30,000 in trouble; I am saying there are 30,000 in danger of trouble.  Some of them are already in trouble and some of them will get into trouble if we do not take steps to provide some machinery that will protect those who are in danger of getting into trouble and will redeem those who are already involved with the law or divorced from the social pattern to which they properly belong.</P>
    <P>I could use stronger language to emphasise the gravity of this problem. I deliberately forbear from that for I believe this is as well understood by most Deputies as I understand it.  However, I cannot too strongly emphasise the obligation upon us to recognise the existence of this problem and to try to find a means of contributing to its solution.  If the Minister has any other better proposal in mind I am quite prepared to hear it with sympathy and to support it.</P>
    <P>The only thing I urge that the Minister can no longer properly do, if he is earnestly to discharge the duties of the Minister for Social Welfare, is to deny the existence of this problem or to declare that inasmuch as it exists outside the jurisdiction of this Government it is none of our concern.  The fact that these young people are living <Col N="414" /> outside our jurisdiction does not discharge us from our share of responsibility for them.  We may claim we are not responsible for the conditions in Great Britain which have caused this problem but we cannot turn our backs on the fact that these young people in order to get their living believed it incumbent on them to seek it in Great Britain.  We cannot turn our backs upon the fact that these young people are our neighbours' children.  In those circumstances they belong in a very special sense to our community.  If everybody else has forgotten them, they are entitled to expect that they will not be forgotten at home.  If the Minister has no better suggestion than the one which I adumbrate to him today, then he ought to give the suggestion I am making his most careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I am in a position to say that at this time steps are being taken by certain voluntary workers to try to co-ordinate the efforts of voluntary bodies already operating in this sphere.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister when he is concluding the debate on this Estimate an assurance that he is prepared to interest himself in and sustain voluntary effort along these lines.  If he does I believe he will find there are people who are prepared to make their contribution, who are not primarily looking for money but who might, in the event of their being able to organise a sort of peace corps for this work, want some help in providing the bare subsistence necessary to keep workers of this kind in the field.  If that were the nature of their request I would commend it very warmly to the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Whatever steps the Minister ultimately determines are appropriate to the resolution of this problem I should like to hear from him an assurance on behalf of the Government that we no longer assume that what happens outside the jurisdiction of the Government of this country is no concern of ours. I am appalled when I hear people giving exaggerated descriptions of this problem to find myself in the position in which I am constrained to say that our Government know nothing about <Col N="415" /> it, accept no responsibility for it and are not prepared to provide any information or satisfy any inquiry in regard to it.</P>
    <P>If we could resolve now to end that situation a good day's work would be done and if, further, we could resolve to provide the personnel to stretch out the helping hand that is necessary for those in trouble and the helping hand that would protect those who are now in danger and must fall into trouble if that protection is not forthcoming, it would be a very happy thing for this country.  I cannot imagine that Oireachtas Éireann will be content to leave this matter unprovided for much longer.  If this Minister is not prepared to solve the problem then I hope an early successor will put the work in hand.</P>

      <P>The Deputies will have seen the announcement in this morning's newspapers of a decision taken by the Irish Banks' Standing Committee to increase the rates of interest on deposits and on advances with effect from the close of business today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, I have no powers in respect of the fixing of interest rates by the banks.  I may say, however, that the increase decided upon by them is in line with the practice, which has been followed generally for a number of years, of altering Irish bank deposit rates, and consequently bank lending rates, in the same direction as corresponding British rates but by a lesser amount.  I understand that, in the opinion of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, the increase now announced is necessary in order to <Col N="418" /> safeguard deposits.  I am satisfied that it will not have an unfavourable economic effect.</P>

The Bill is a comprehensive measure covering the 1962 and 1963 increases and providing that future increases in <Col N="419" /> public service pensions may be authorised by regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Accordingly, its preparation was considerably more difficult than previous pension increase measures.  Priority had also to be given to the calculation and payment of the appropriate increases in pensions paid out of Departmental Votes.  These pensions have been increased under the authority of the Additional Estimates passed by this House.  Public service pensions paid out of the Central Fund or from superannuation funds not voted by Dáil Éireann cannot be increased until the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>They are not nearly as short of personnel as they were when the Deputy was sending out 60,000 emigrants a year.  I wish the Deputy would face up to these problems.  He is prepared to recommend, when he is out of office, that a Government should do things he knows are impossible, simply because there are some people who will be deceived by his suggestions. There is no practical way in which our people can sustain and give social services to all the Irish who are over in Britain and I think it is a bad thing to encourage them to look for such services to be given to them in Britain. If they are prepared to stay here or to come back here, the Government are prepared to give them equal treatment with every other citizen in the country.</P>

      <P>Acknowledging the faultless courtesy of the Minister's supplementary reply, I would renew my query as to whether, in cases where insufficiency of personnel was embarrassing the work of the charitable organisations to which he refers, he thinks any steps could be taken to help these associations to secure additional voluntary personnel even if these were constituted of volunteers from this country, to help them for limited periods of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is a different proposition.  If charitable organisations here want to send volunteers over to Britain or elsewhere, that is a different matter, but to send people from here or to expect that we could help all the Irish in Britain who wanted to turn to us for help, is quite impossible and is the wrong type of policy.  We have tried to help by the appointment within recent years of an officer in our London office who goes around to voluntary organisations and encourages them to set up this sort of advisory services and information centres.  Good work has been done in the bigger cities and already in cities such as London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield, Leeds, Middlesbrough, Manchester and Nottingham services of this sort have been set up which, I think, are fairly adequately staffed and fairly well run. If these organisations need assistance, I think they would have to get it on a <Col N="423" /> voluntary basis.  I am perfectly certain many people in Ireland would help out if they were asked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>There is normally at the present time of year a seasonal decline in the activities of meat export premises, because of lower marketings of cows and finished cattle.  At one time the premises handling cows closed down completely during the late spring and early summer and at least one of the largest premises still does so.  It is nothing new therefore for the meat export premises to reduce employment seasonally at this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the first eight weeks of this year, slaughterings of cows and other cattle and also slaughterings of sheep and lambs were above those for the corresponding period last year.  The carcase meat trade has, of course, expanded considerably in the last few years and total exports of beef and <Col N="426" /> mutton and lamb in 1963 were also above those for 1962 and little short of the exceptionally high level reached in 1961 when the export price guarantee arrangements for fat cattle and beef, associated with the Bovine TB Eradication Scheme, were in operation.</P>
    <P>The meat export trade, in the ordinary course, has had to compete for supplies with the livestock export trade.  This must be regarded as in the general interest, particularly in the interest of producers, and fluctuations as between exports in the live and carcase form are to be expected from time to time according to trade conditions. At present, there is a strong export demand for store cattle and live cows and this fact has to be faced. Unlike store cattle, live cows are not eligible for any guarantee payments under the British Fatstock Subsidy Scheme.</P>
    <P>I have recently received representations from the meat export trade about this matter and I have arranged that officers of my Department will discuss the various aspects of the present position as regards livestock and meat exports at a meeting tomorrow with representatives of the meat export trade, the livestock export trade and farmers organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister now suggesting that a great deal of the meat processing business is only being carried out at certain times of the year in view of the fact that at the moment the plants are not being utilised to anything like full capacity? In the light of the Minister's statement that there is a high price abroad at the moment for store cattle and also a high demand in Continental countries for our beef, surely the logical end of this is going to be that the meat processing trade will go down and that the country will be depending completely on the live cattle export trade which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; that this country will be the centre for store cattle alone without giving due regard to the excellent industrial employment given in the meat processing industries.  Would the Minister, in those circumstances, not consider that in order to safeguard both aspects of the livestock industry, meat processing and the live cattle trade, that a special meat marketing board should be set up that would do something like what the Sugar Company is now doing in regard to fruit and vegetables,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am merely giving the facts as I find them and the facts are that slaughterings in 1964 were higher than in 1963 for the two months, January-February taken together. I have also mentioned that it has been customary at this season to find a slackness in this business.  I also mentioned the competitive side and referred to the fact that from the point of view of the producer this competition is a useful thing.  I should like to say that when in 1957-58 a marketing committee was set up, representative of all the interests concerned, to advise the Government on agricultural marketing and presided over by the former President of the NFA, Dr. Greene, a firm recommendation was made by that body, after they had examined the whole position regarding the cattle trade, that there should be no interference with its activities.</P>

Will the Minister see what he can do about the possibility of these workers being reinstated?  I would point out to him that this is not normal redundancy, that there is a crisis in the meat processing trade because of which hundreds of workers have lost their jobs and that this has caused much privation in homes in towns such as mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Lynch was appointed law agent to Laois County Council on the 1st July, 1950.  He was suspended from the performance of his duties on 16th October, 1959, and the local authority requested the Minister's consent to his removal from office on 13th December, 1960.  It is understood that he last attended the local authority's office for duty on 14th October, 1959.  Mr. Lynch availed himself of his statutory right to submit his observations on the request for his removal from office on 28th March, 1961, and there was subsequent correspondence between his solicitor and the local authority up to 27th November, 1962.  Examination of the matter has been unusually protracted because of the nature of the grounds advanced in support of the request for my consent to his removal from office. It is hoped that the matter will soon be brought to finality.  In the meantime Mr. Lynch is still an officer of the local authority but is suspended from the performance of his duties and is not in receipt of remuneration.  I understand that the local authority have engaged a firm of solicitors on a taxed costs basis to discharge the legal business of the local authority.  I have no precise information as to the cost of the alternative arrangements but I understand that the total bill of costs in respect of the four years ended October, 1963, was approximately £8,600, including outlay and expenses.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister continuing to leave this matter hanging indefinitely so that Mr. Lynch will be on the list of permanent officers for a further number of years and so that he will therefore qualify for pension purposes?  Having regard to the fact that the Minister lost no time in removing a rent collector and a rate collector from office within six months after the offences were reported to him by the county manager, has he any explanation to give as to why a man last in office on 14th October, 1959, is still on the list of permanent officers of the council and as to why he has <Col N="437" /> not made a definite decision on the matter?

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, having regard to the recently expressed fears of commercial travellers that fire warning and protection equipment in hotels are inadequate, he will ensure that steps are taken to provide adequate safeguards for hotel guests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies to questions on 3rd and 4th March on the general question of fire precaution equipment and standards.  In so far as any hotel may be a potentially dangerous building it is subject to control by the fire brigade authority under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  Under this Act the authority may require the proprietor to refrain from using such building unless specified fire precautions are taken.  These may include the provision of fire fighting and alarm equipment.</P>

      <P>We have had it for nine days at the moment, and I should imagine we would not take very much longer.  It will depend on what may arise from our consideration of it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state in what local authority areas delays of three years and more have occurred from the time the local authority decided on a housing scheme and the actual completion of the first house in such schemes; if such delays have been caused by procedures within his Department; and whether he has any <Col N="449" /> solution for such unreasonable delays in the face of grave needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities do not inform me of the dates on which they decide to carry out housing schemes and I cannot, therefore, indicate the particular areas requested.</P>
      <P>The information at my disposal indicates, however, that there may be a period of three years or more between the time a local authority first considers undertaking a housing scheme and the completion of the dwellings. Such a period does not necessarily include avoidable delays: it is taken up with the necessary processes of site acquisition, preparation of plans and contract documents, invitation and consideration of tenders and the actual work of development and building.</P>
      <P>All these procedures are time-consuming and almost all, of necessity, must follow each other.  Many special difficulties can arise at various stages, which may increase the time before the first house is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if the survey of housing needs in the different local authority areas has been completed; and if he will give (a) the results to date, showing the housing needs as at present estimated where the survey has been completed; and (b) the number of houses on which work will commence in 1964-65, and their location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey of unfit housing has been completed by 17 county councils and all but one urban authority.  The results are in the form of a tabular statement which I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to state the number of houses on which work will commence in 1964/65.  The number of houses in tender, however, at 31st December, 1963, which is some indication of likely commencements is also set out in the statement.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

Under this procedure, 90 per cent of the amount of loans for works of construction and the full amount of other loans can be drawn by direct application to the Office of Public Works.  In the case of works of construction the full amount outstanding <Col N="453" /> is not issued until the final accounts have been examined in my Department.

However, even if an agreement on reciprocal arrangements involving British retirement pensions and Irish old age (contributory) pensions can be reached, it does not follow that it will include the removal of the British restriction on the payment of increases in pensions to persons in this country; similar restrictions continue to apply in a number of countries having reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain including even some Commonwealth countries.</P>

      <P>The volume of trunk works in progress and planned in this district has made it necessary to divert engineering staff from the installation of subscribers' telephones at all exchanges. It is not the case, however, that urgent trunk works are necessary in every exchange area in which the connection of new telephones has been halted.</P>
      <P>Priority applications are being connected without delay all over the country. It would not be possible, however, to indicate when sufficient progress will have been made with trunk works to enable a clearance of non-priority applications to be made in individual exchange areas.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Land Bill, 1963&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House failed to amend this section a short time ago.  It deals with the making of an order declaring a district to be a <Col N="463" /> congested district.  This is probably one of the most important sections of the Bill.  It gives the Minister for Lands power, which no other Minister for Lands has had, to declare such other area a congested area by means of an order.  The declaring of any area to be a congested district for the purpose of this Bill is vesting extraordinary powers in the Minister.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister in very plain language the circumstances which will influence him in the making of an order declaring any county or area a congested district. Will the Minister be influenced by the congestion that really exists in regard to the size of holdings and, if so, what pattern will he follow?  Will he have in mind the size of the holdings by acreage or will he have in mind the rateable valuation of the holdings in any particular locality. Again, will the Minister take into consideration the number of families who may be living on a number of holdings in a particular district?  Will he take into consideration the numbers of the members of each family who derive their livelihood from the land on which they reside in respect of an order to make any part of a county a congested area?</P>
      <P>It is well known that in every county in Ireland there are what we can describe as pockets of congestion. Does that mean that, in accordance with the recommendations made by the NFA, any legislation dealing with this land problem should apply to the whole of the country?  That most certainly is a very commonsense approach.</P>
      <P>With congested districts in every county, why not leave it at that and allow this Bill to relate to the whole State, without picking out parts because we have already agreed that there are parts of every county in Ireland today that can be described as congested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for example, the county of Laois.  There is no part of the county of Laois that cannot be described as a congested district.  The same remarks would refer to the county of Offaly if all the bogland were excluded.  A great deal of bogland there is being put to <Col N="464" /> very good and proper use but, with the number of families living on the existing holdings, it most certainly can be described as a congested district.  Then we have Monaghan and Wicklow.  You could describe all of County Wicklow as congested.  If we exclude the congested districts and take the mountain range away completely, we must agree that there is also congestion in the remaining part of the county.  The congestion in Wicklow, Monaghan and the midlands will not get the benefits of this Bill.  Why that is so I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>That is why I should like to hear from the Minister what machinery is at his disposal to advise him about the method of making an order to declare any county or district a congested district.  There is no provision that the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and I feel that the Houses should at least be notified that it is the Minister's intention to make an order declaring a county or part of a county a congested district.  It is of the greatest importance that the Minister should be liberal in his method of dealing with this matter.  I cannot see that the Minister has any good reason for not placing notice of his intention to declare a district a congested district on the Table of each House.</P>
    <P>We can see that the section deals with congested districts for the purposes of the Act in regard to &ldquo;a county or portion of a county specified in the Second Schedule of this Act&rdquo;. If we turn to the Second Schedule, we find that it embraces Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo and parts of County Clare and of West Cork.  All those areas were declared congested districts in 1909. Surely the Minister has at his disposal &mdash;and if he has, I hope he will convey them to the House&mdash;details of what progress has been made since 1909 in regard to the relief of congestion in those areas that were congested districts in 1909.  Are they still in the same congested condition in 1964 as they were in 1909?  If they are, it does not speak well for the volume of work undertaken by the Land Commission in the years past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> It is about time there was a complete recasting or redrafting of the whole congestion situation.  I am not advocating that any area referred to in the Second Schedule should be excluded from the list of congested districts.  My argument is that the list does not go far enough and that there are other areas equally as congested as those referred to which are not included because they were not described as congested districts in 1909. I would ask the Minister if the congestion in Roscommon or Sligo is not equally as serious as in Monaghan where you have so many smallholders and great pockets of congestion throughout the entire county.  Those parts of Wicklow not within reach of the mountain range which goes down through the county, the portion that is convenient to Carlow, which would include the Shillelagh district near Bunclody which is in Wexford, could safely be described as congested districts.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what recommendations are before him already and what will influence him in regard to the making of those new congested districts. Clause (b) states: &ldquo;Such other area as may from time to time be declared by order of the Minister to be a congested area&rdquo;.  Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;The Minister shall have regard to the size of the holdings, the quality of the land and the type or types of farming carried out in the area to be declared a congested area&rdquo;.  The Minister could go much further in his explanation about the approach he proposes to make in the event of this section being passed as it stands.</P>
    <P>In regard to the reference to the quality of the land, does it mean that in an area in which you have all good land the Minister may fail to make an order declaring the district to be a congested district because it is all good quality land, even though there may be great congestion there?  On the other hand, there may be a district in which the land may not be of superior quality but there may not be sufficient families in the area and he can establish a case that there is not any great general demand for land in that district.  Will that be a means <Col N="466" /> by which he will not declare the district to be a congested district?</P>
    <P>The Minister might feel that to include the whole county might be embracing too much but I cannot see how it would be when whole counties were described as congested districts in 1909.  I feel it might be better if he did it on a county basis rather than on the basis of electoral divisions.  If one looks again at the Second Schedule in regard to West Cork, comprising Bantry, Castletown, Schull and Skibbereen, one feels that the entire constituency of West Cork could safely be described as a congested district.  In addition, the entire county of Clare could be so described, despite the fact that the Second Schedule relates only to certain rural districts.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some more information particularly in regard to why he does not favour laying the orders before the Houses and giving Deputies and Senators notice of his intention.  I would go further and suggest that the county committees of agriculture in the counties concerned should also be notified of the Minister's intention to declare any particular area a congested area.</P>
    <P>We see in subsection (3) that the Minister may by order &ldquo;amend or revoke an order under subsection (1) of this section&rdquo;; that is to say, an area may be declared congested no longer by the Minister and those residing in the district will not be given the benefits which may be available to the congested districts.  The Minister should also notify in advance the public representatives in an area of his intention to make an order declaring a district a congested district or his intention to revoke that order and so have the district declared as one coming within the scope of the congested areas.</P>
    <P>Lastly, may I say that the provisions of section 4 which vest any Minister for Lands with the power of declaring any area to be a congested district are provisions which this House ought to examine very carefully.  If the Land Commission, as a body, were to declare certain areas to be congested areas after full examination and consideration of the circumstances, having <Col N="467" /> regard to the quality of the land, the number of families on the land and the type of farming carried on there would be something to say for it.  Here we have the Minister taking power to declare any area a congested district and I think the section which gives him that power is open to political abuse.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister is likely to fall into the temptation provided by this section but any Minister for Lands, no matter whom he may be, is likely to have pressure brought upon him by his local supporters to have such and such an area declared a congested district or not declared a congested district, as the case may be.  That is putting political temptation in the way of the political head of the Department.  For that reason, I think the House ought to be very slow in its consideration of this matter and should satisfy itself that if this power is vested in the Minister, no attempt will be made to make use of it for political purposes.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister, in so far as his own term of office is concerned, should be strong in his guarantee that he will not be influenced by political considerations in declaring whether an area is to be a congested district or not. I view this matter with a certain amount of suspicion.  I think it is a power we should consider very carefully before we vest it in the Minister and for that reason I advise the House to go very slowly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 is a very important section because here we learn what powers the Minister proposes to take to himself, if permitted to do so by the House, to declare particular areas to be congested and it is important that we understand what the Minister means by &ldquo;congestion&rdquo;.  He gave a definition here last night of what a congested area or locality would be when he said it is a place &ldquo;where the size of the farm does not measure up to a family farm&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>The new target for a family farm is approximately 40 to 45 acres so that if, in future, we are going to talk of family farms as being holdings of that size, we can logically say that the farms that do not measure up to that <Col N="468" /> figure could reasonably be described as congested holdings.  If we apply this yardstick of a family farm of 40 to 45 acres of arable land, it means, on that basis, that from 75 to 80 per cent of the holdings in Ireland can in future be described as congested holdings. If that is the position that is to come about, we can see there is no hope whatever of the congestion problem being solved.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking power in section 4 to declare that certain counties or parts of counties can be declared to be congested areas.  That is all right.  We do not object to the idea of the Minister having these powers.  We in the Labour Party think it is much better that these powers should be given to the Minister whom we can challenge here and who is responsible to the House than to have the Minister responsible declaring that he has no function in the matter and that it is a matter for the Land Commission or a statutory board and at the same time whispering to that statutory board what he would like them to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister need have no worry about the Labour Party opposing him in the idea of giving him these powers but we want to clarify what he means by this family farm of 45 acres of arable land.  Is it suggested now that it is to be put into the heads of all the small farmers of 33 acres of good land, whom the Minister described two years ago as good farmers, that they are congests and that they will be entitled to get more land?  The danger of fixing a figure of 45 acres is that all the small farmers in the country whose holdings do not come up to that figure are going to feel that they have not sufficient land to give them a proper livelihood.</P>
    <P>There is not land enough in the country to meet the demand that will be created if that mentality sets in. The Government's plan on this matter is based on what European trends will be in the 70's and 80's.  They have come down on the side of those people who suggest that the average sized holding should be up to 45 acres.  I think the way they have gone about <Col N="469" /> this is most unwise because the change from the existing situation has been too sudden.  I should like to quote what the Minister had to say about the matter at column 2218, volume 195, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the aim of the Land Commission, in non-congested areas, has been to create a unit of 33 acres of first-class land or its equivalent in larger acreage of land of mixed quality. The view is held&mdash;and I certainly subscribe to it &mdash; that there is no reason why such a holding, properly worked and with the owner availing himself freely of the local agricultural advisory services, should not afford a decent livelihood to a man and his family.</P>
    <P>That was the opinion of the Minister and his Department and, I presume, of his Government just two years ago with regard to the advantages of a holding of 33 acres of good land and how desirable that type of holding was.  Indeed, he stressed that that was the type of holding desirable in the non-congested areas.  He made that statement at a time when he was aware of the report of the inter-Departmental Committee on small farms and at a time when he was aware of the views expressed by Dr. Mansholt, and various other experts, with regard to the European situation and the position of the small farmer in European countries.  If the Minister thought two years ago that a sound sized economic holding was 33 acres of good land in the non-congested areas, why is it the intention now in the congested areas to move above that altogether into the 40 to 45 acre holding?</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that at the time the Minister spoke two years ago he had something to say also on the same occasion in relation to the congested areas at column 2219 of Volume 195. Having already pointed out that he saw no problem with regard to the 33-acre holding in the non-congested area, that he was satisfied that, as far as productivity was concerned and as far as the size of the holding was concerned, a farmer could get a reasonable <Col N="470" /> livelihood, he had this to say about the holding in the congested area:</P>
    <P>As I see it, however, the real problem exists in the size of holdings provided by the Land Commission in the congested areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister's real problem, therefore, two years ago was the size of the holding provided by the Land Commission in the non-congested areas. All I have to say on that is that it was well time for some Minister to see the problem in regard to the size of the holding in the congested areas, but why now go above the figure in the congested area, namely 33 acres, which was considered ideal in the non-congested areas?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back too far on the debates in this House, but I should like to point out that on this question of the size of the holding in the congested area we had a serious discussion in this House way back in 1954 and the Minister came in here and brought in a map, placed it down in the hall where, I am sure, people recollect looking at it.  On that map he showed the position in a certain county&mdash;I shall not name it&mdash;of the holdings before and after rearrangement. The purpose of the map was to demonstrate to the House the wonderful job that was being done in the congested areas with regard to improving the holdings; 84 small holdings were raised from a valuation of £5 to a valuation of £10.  The lay-out of the holdings was improved.  In other words, the valuation of the holdings was doubled.</P>
    <P>My comments at the time were that it would have been a far better proposition to have made 42 holdings and have 42 decent-sized holdings with a valuation of approximately £20 on which the family would have the benefit of agricultural advisory services and credit thrown in.  That suggestion was not thought suitable in 1954 and 1955. The small farmers were given another £5 valuation on top of the miserable one they had and told: &ldquo;Now, boys, you should be satisfied&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What happened?  These people on numerous occasions fought the plans <Col N="471" /> of the Land Commission, saying the Land Commission were only making them worse off than they were.  Two years ago the Minister said recipients of the many fragments of divided lands were still left in the position that they had to seek employment otherwise than on the land for three or four months of the year.  We all know where they got it.  Because of that, we had the start of the migration system to Britain.  All these workers got into it as a mode of life.  It has now become traditional and that type of traditional going to Britain for a number of months in the year was brought about by nothing but the Land Commission's activities in the western counties.  Having driven the people out for three or four months of the year, it was only a short step for many of them to stay over for the 12 months.</P>
    <P>What are we at now?  We are not satisfied with enlarging their holdings. What the Minister described two years ago as a good holding, namely, 33 acres in a non-congested area, is now not good enough according to the Minister; we must now in the congested areas go higher altogether and give 45 acres to people who, up to two years ago, were being given £10 valuations in County Mayo, parts of Roscommon, Galway, and the congested areas.  The land is just not there.  In addition to that, and this is much more important at this stage, when the Land Commission were making these improvements, they never tied in with the Department of Agriculture to ensure that when John Murhpy, for example, was given his holding, the Department of Agriculture would then come into the picture and their advisory services would be brought to bear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt, but do I understand the Deputy aright in thinking that he is asserting that the £10 valuation limit should still be kept in the west of Ireland and people outside that limit should not get any additional land?  Is that what the Deputy is arguing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the <Col N="472" /> Deputy said, or that is how I interpret him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am arguing is that the figure the Minister gave two years ago as being a suitable economic family farm in the non-congested area was 33 acres of good land. If he brought the miserable holdings of £10 valuation in the congested areas up to 33 acres, which he said was good enough two years ago in the non-congested areas, that would be a practical step and it would be a better way of going about solving the problem. Tied in with that should be advisory services and credit facilities for these farmers.  Even the Minister's Taoiseach has now stated that one of the most desirable developments in Irish agriculture would be for the co-operative movement to come in at this stage and help the small farmers.</P>
      <P>If you start talking about giving 45 acres to a farmer in the congested areas, you will only sow dissatisfaction because it just cannot be done and you will only succeed in making farmers dissatisfied with a reasonable holding of 33 acres, the policy of the Land Commission in the non-congested areas, and projects like Glencolumbkille, and other projects of a similar nature which are beginning to take root, will, in all probability, go by the board in the respective counties. The aim of these projects is to organise the small farmers into groups, get them to co-operate and work together so that, by unity and strength in numbers, they will be able to compete in the marketing of their goods and, in addition, the processing of their goods can take place in the locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new idea of 40 to 45-acre holdings all round means that the farmer will say: &ldquo;There is no need for me to co-operate with my neighbours at all.&rdquo; In addition to that, he will not even get the land unless the Government take the bull by the horns and say they will accept a later amendment we have here that a ceiling should be put on the amount of land any man may hold.  You cannot have one without the other.  You cannot give the 40-acre holding unless you ensure the land <Col N="473" /> is available and you cannot ensure the land is available unless you exercise control over the amount of land to be held by anybody.</P>
    <P>Under the guise of improving the lot of the small farmer, what is being created is a completely new land structure that will wipe out the small farmer in preparation for our admission to EEC.  In every speech made by this Minister on lands and other matters, he has concentrated on the fact that Ireland will be a member of EEC by 1970 and that we must gear ourselves to change the structure of our farms so that we shall be ready for membership of EEC when the time comes.  Two years ago, when he was speaking on the 33-acre holding, on how good it was and how suitable it was as a family farm in Ireland, he went on to point out at column 2218, volume 195, of the Official Report of 7th June, 1962:</P>
    <P>In this connection also it may be worth mentioning that no less an authority than Dr. Mansholt is on record to the effect that more than two-thirds of the farms in the EEC are less than 25 acres in area.</P>
    <P>That is the position the Minister himself quoted as regards European farms.  Between the time that statement was made, less than two years ago, and today, the Department and the Government have been preparing the ground to get rid of these small 25- to 35-acre farms and amalgamate them into larger units.  What happens when the small farms are turned into larger units?  Where will the families on them be put?  I do not know.  I should like the Minister to tell me what will be done with them because he had this to say in his opening speech on the Land Bill at column 69, Volume 206, of the Official Report of 27th November, 1963:</P>
    <P>At this point, I must emphasise that the adoption of an area of 40-45 acres for the family farm does not carry with it any implication of deliberately reducing the number of persons on the land.</P>
    <P>What implication does it carry if it does not carry that?  If 45-acre holdings <Col N="474" /> are created all round the west of Ireland does it not mean that the other smallholders, if they are not gone already, will be taken away. Many of them could make a living on those holdings if they were given proper Government assistance by way of technical advice from the Department of Agriculture and also a training in the proper lines of agricultural production which would be suitable to the type of holdings they have.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into detail on that except to say we know that store cattle is one of the major props of the agricultural community in the west of Ireland on smallholdings and there is nothing as disastrous from the point of view of an economic living for the smallholders as to be depending on a couple of store cattle to sell at the occasional fair twice a year in the west of Ireland.  The holdings are not big enough to keep the cattle from the calving stage.  They are bought at a dear price and they are sold perhaps at a dear price but the profit is very small.  That is the type of economy we want now to keep in operation in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The whole plan of this Government, right through its activities, is directed towards making this country a ranch, to make it completely a store cattle area.  They are not interested in the development of the small farmer idea as practised, for instance, in the Glencolumbkille area and in the areas in Cork and Kerry where the Sugar Company is trying to keep the community interested in co-operative development.</P>
    <P>There is nothing at the moment but a sneer and a jibe at the efforts of the small farmers who are trying to lift themselves up by their own shoelaces, where the instinct of self-preservation is so strong that they have banded together in the determination to survive together.  Here we have a Government who say even to Glencolumbkille: &ldquo;We cannot give you £25,000 for your industrial project.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not codology, as the Minister knows perfectly well.  The Minister told us here last night that there were different standards 30, 40 and 50 years ago as to what an economic holding was.  In fact I have quoted the Minister's own words two years ago that 33 acres of land was considered an economic holding in the non-congested areas. Have the Minister and the Government changed their view within two years as to what an economic holding should be or are they prepared to sacrifice the small farmer for admission to the Common Market?</P>
      <P>It is worse than that because under subsection (2) of section 4 the Minister has power, when he is deciding what a congested area is, to decide what type or types of farming should be carried on in the area.  Since when did the Minister for Lands and the Department of Lands become expert in the type of husbandry that should be carried out on a farm?  Surely here is an instance where the Department of Lands and their technical services should operate in close unison with the Department of Agriculture.  It should not be left to the decision of the Land Commission alone who over the years, I must say quite frankly, have just moved into localities in the west of Ireland like machines and carved up holdings.  As the saying goes, they have been trying to keep all the dogs with them, giving a few acres to this man and that man in the hope that they will keep quiet but giving none of them an economic holding and making no provision whatever for the services to which they were entitled afterwards if they were to make a living in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is only part of the picture. What we must examine very carefully in regard to congestion is the Minister's statement on the number of small farms which are vacant and the number which are described as derelict farms.  I quote what he said in column <Col N="476" /> 69, volume 206, of the Official Report of 27th November, 1963:</P>
    <P>In the Small Farms Report, there is confirmation of the view that there are far too many vacant and underproductive farms in the country.  These clearly should be taken up and used in the structural reform.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken on structural reform.  The meaning of structural reform is simply to wipe out the small farmer.  That is the structural form.</P>
    <P>Where are the small and unproductive holdings situated and why are they unproductive?  Who made them unproductive?  Is it not a fact that the Land Commission activities in many parts of the country have created further congestion and unproductiveness? I have given the figures, or, if I have not, I have them here to put them on record, that between 1931 and 1953 the Land Commission created some 13,000 new holdings with an average of 23 acres.  Many of those holdings can be described as unproductive. Many of them are vacant. Whom are we to blame?  Are we to blame the small congests in the west who had families and who said to themselves, &ldquo;We cannot live here at the moment.  Let us go to England until we make sufficient money to buy a bit of land in our own area.&rdquo;  That is what happened.  People went to England from these areas for that purpose and, in 99 per cent of cases, went reluctantly.  Nobody denies the love that there is for the land amongst the people in rural areas.  They went reluctantly but hoped that they would be able to return either in the very near or in the distant future and get another bit of land to enlarge the homestead.</P>

If he then declares an area to be a congested area certain provisions of this Bill will then apply.  I am coming to them, if the Minister will have patience.  I pointed out that a number of holdings are vacated in the west of Ireland.  Is the aim of this Bill, in section 4, to penalise those people who were driven out by economic necessity?  Will the Minister get the land he needs to create farms of 45 acres from the small unfortunate migrants who had to leave but who hope to return, or will the Minister get the land by declaring any area a congested area and by taking land in other parts of the country belonging to the racegoer and the waster and the man who is setting large tracts in conacre?</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, again with due respect to you, I would submit that the congested areas are already in this Bill.  The <Col N="478" /> Deputy's contention about vacant holdings has nothing whatever to do with section 4.  This is an enabling section, to enable the Minister to declare areas outside the specified congested areas to be congested areas and the Deputy's argument for the last quarter of an hour has had nothing whatever to do with the powers sought by me in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to continue after that Ministerial eruption or interruption&mdash;I do not know which.  The position is that in the congested areas contained in the Schedule there is quite a number of the small farms to which I have referred and to which the Minister referred and I shall now refer to the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Problems of Small Western Farms. At page 12, paragraph 11 of that Report, the Committee have this to to say under the heading <i>Vacated Holdings:</i></P>
      <P>The problem of these holdings seems to be a growing one as migration gradually develops into emigration. At present wholly let holdings amount to some 10 per cent on average in many western counties....  In some of these cases the original family still lives on the holding but for one reason or another is not in a position to work the land.  In many of these cases, however, the owners have emigrated. The emigrants understandably hope to return some day and wish to retain the house and holding and will temporarily let it to neighbours or friends rather than sell it.</P>
      <P>This is the land the Minister now hopes to acquire under section 4.  I challenge him to say if I am right or wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I again say that this is completely irrelevant to section 4. It has nothing to do with section 4, which provides power for the Minister to declare a new area outside the congested areas to be a congested area.  If the Deputy wants to pursue this line of country and waste time, that is all right.  We will be going over all this again on other sections but, in my respectful submission to <Col N="479" /> you, Sir, this business about the Small Western Farms Committee's Report and what the Deputy has been saying for the last half hour is completely irrelevant to the provisions of section 4.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Minister should be patient.  I want to be fair on this question to the Minister because my fear and the fear of Deputies who represent the small farmers in what are now described as congested areas is that the unfortunates who are left in those areas, and those who are at the moment, we shall say, migrants, will lose their land and I want the Minister, under subsection (2) of section 4, to say what is his intention about acquiring the land for the relief of the congestion to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Problems of the Small Western Farmer emphasises that these vacant holdings to which I have referred are mainly in the west of Ireland.  Terms of this Bill and this section are aimed at the West of Ireland.  Where I think the Minister and the inter-Departmental Committee are wrong is in the overall picture of where the holdings are vacated and where the good land is wasted.  I would refer the Minister to Appendix D of the inter-Departmental Committee's Report.  We find there that in the eastern group, what they describe as <Col N="480" /> the east and midland region, 10.4 per cent of the holdings are either wholly or partly let whereas in the West of Ireland, that is the North and West region the figure is 10.5 per cent.  We should remember that 10.4 per cent in the midlands represents a far greater acreage and better land than the 10.5 per cent in the West.  I do not understand why this interdepartmental committee has harped on the fact that in many cases in the West of Ireland the letting of holdings amounts to some 10 per cent on the average.  Why do they not mention that in the midlands the average is 10 per cent also.  I want to ask the Minister who is letting the land in the midlands?  Do I have to quote the Minister himself when he made his famous speech before the society two years ago in which he said he would get after the boyos in the midlands who were setting their land, the ranchers, the con-acre men and the men who spent their time going to races.</P>

      <P>I am listening.  The point I am making is that if the Minister declares an area to be a congested area, the annuities are halved. Is it suggested that it would be improper to declare a place a congested area?  Is it that the Deputy wants to see certain places where the migrants <Col N="481" /> would get land in the east and midlands would get their annuities halved?</P>

      <P>The Minister last night defined congestion on the basis that a congested area is an area where a holding itself would not measure up to the family-size farm.  The new family-size farm is 40-45 acres.  Up to two years ago in the non-congested areas the Minister said that 33 acres was an economic farm.  At that time they were giving only 15 to 20 acres altogether in the West of Ireland.  Now the sudden change of policy is that instead of saying: &ldquo;In the west of Ireland, we are raising the standard of holdings up to what it is in the non-congested areas,&rdquo; they have moved away ahead of that figure to 40-45 acres.  I am trying to find out where the Minister is going to get that land in the congested areas.  I am sorry if I did not make it clear.  I want the Minister to know that we shall not allow an injustice to be perpetrated on smallholders who, through no fault of their own, have been victimised in the past or, shall I say, let down by various Governments.  It is not this Minister alone.  I shall not name the others but there were many since the time I began to read what took place in this House, from 1933 on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister is now seeking to change&mdash;shall I put it this way, if he is touchy&mdash;to delude the farmers that there is a 45-acre farm around the corner for them in the congested areas, that is treating them in the same way as unfortunate animals are treated before slaughter when they are brought to a different locality away from where the slaughter is taking place so that they do not see their neighbours slaughtered.  What will happen to the farmers?  They will satisfy the very small men who, in the Minister's own words have been making a good living on their smallholdings. The Minister is on record as saying <Col N="482" /> two years ago at column 2218 of volume 195:</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is a remarkable thing that most of the prizewinners in competitions sponsored by farming organisations come from holdings of this size or even less.</P>
    <P>That is the 33 acre holding of only two years ago.  Now he has changed his mind in a period of two years.  If this were a question of increasing the turnover tax from 2½ to three per cent we would not mind but people do not change their minds quickly on fundamental matters like the size of a holding or what is an economic farm.  If the aim is, as I believe to get this country big-minded, then everything must be big and we must get into big business so far as farming is concerned.</P>
    <P>I could take up the whole of this debate with the evidence of men who are described as experts on the output of small farms and the results of farming operations on small and medium sized farms in comparison with larger farms and we would find that the output, employment, and everything is much greater on the small and medium -sized farms.  That is evidence we must accept from experts and if we were to think logically ourselves, we would admit that a small farmer must work and must produce to the maximum because he must do so to keep going.</P>
    <P>The Minister was satisfied that 33 acres of good land was all right two years ago.  Now he says they are going to make that 40-45 acres.  I have to tell my constituents&mdash;so will every other Deputy&mdash;what this Bill means and if I am asked this week-end by a group of farmers, who say there is a farm of 100 acres available, &ldquo;will the Land Commission take that over?&rdquo;, I shall say, &ldquo;I do not know; I shall make representations on your behalf.&rdquo;  We find the land is not being taken over and the farmers then say: &ldquo;Where is the 45-acre holding that is to come to us?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say if this is to be a practical proposition?  Is it not a fact that this section itself will not bring about any change so far as the small farmer is concerned of a beneficial <Col N="483" /> nature and will instead bring about his downfall?  I do not think it would be fair to go into too much detail on the Common Market but the Minister himself has harped upon it.  In his opening statement at column 67 dealing with what he described as the &ldquo;new deal&rdquo; for small farmers he says:</P>
    <P>In doing so, we had in mind the necessity of carrying out much of the ground-work of reform before the anticipated participation of this country in the Common Market. The fact that there has been a delay about our entry, however, merely means that, in so far as the structural reform is concerned, we must make the fullest possible use of the breathing space thus afforded.</P>
    <P>If words mean anything &ldquo;structural reform&rdquo; means one thing and alteration on the size of holdings, so far as the small farmer is concerned, is wiping out the reference to preparation for admission to EEC and the time available now as a breathing space is the time the Minister wants in order to carry out that policy of decimating the small farmers.  This idea of 45-acre holdings does not carry with it any implication of deliberately reducing the number of persons on the land.  I want the Minister to answer that now, if he proposes to comment on what I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The mistake the Minister has made in this section and what will lead to wide controversy is in defining geographically what a congested area is.  Coming from an area which is not one of those specified here, one gets the impression that in effect, what will be enacted here is a provision to make structural alterations in the whole background of holdings in the west of Ireland at the expense of other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is aware of the fact that this Bill has led to considerable confusion among the farming community, probably more so than any previous legislation dealing with land economics.  There is a widespread feeling prevalent among smallholders that the Minister is introducing <Col N="484" /> legislation whereby he will seize all the big farms and divide them up for the benefit of the small farmers.</P>
    <P>I am being constantly approached and asked if the Land Commission will take over such and such a farm for division among the smallholders in the area.  I say I have no information about it and I am then pressed to say the Minister is not introducing in this Bill a provision to seize land for that purpose.  I am forced to say this is intended for the west alone, for dealing with the land problem there where there is such large emigration because the people have been unable to support themselves on the miserable holdings they have been working.</P>
    <P>It becomes necessary to draw attention to the fact that the Minister in this section is shaping his policy on the lines of structural alterations that have been suggested throughout Europe, and I do not think we can reasonably discuss this section except in the background of what is being done in Europe, because it is on that the Minister is basing this section.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the structural alterations in Europe have been decided on because the authorities there believe the standard of living on the land is not as good as it is in industry and in order to make economic holdings they are creating bigger farms and encouraging people to leave the land.  That is where the Minister and his advisers have slipped up in this legislation. Section 4 is leading to such controversy because its intent is not clear.</P>
    <P>One interpretation of it is that the Minister will take the smallholders, not necessarily in his own constituency but in the counties mentioned in Schedule D, and give them the opportunity of buying land, thus conferring on them advantages over and above their brethren in other areas.  We must acknowledge the fact that there are congested areas everywhere in this country.  The Minister may reply that he has embodied under subsection (1) (b) of this section provision whereby he can declare other districts to be congested areas.</P>
    <P>In a way, I do not see anything wrong with that, but the mistake the <Col N="485" /> Minister has made is in trying to delimit geographically congested areas. That is why Schedule D does not make sense to me.  I do not live in any of those counties and therefore have not first-hand knowledge of farming in them.  Take Galway, perhaps a county I know better than the others.  There is land there, particularly in East Galway, richer than a great deal of the land in Leinster and almost as rich as one would find in Munster.  Admittedly there are large areas of County Galway where there are very poor holdings.</P>
    <P>As against that, one could argue that there is in the constituency of Deputy Flanagan, Laois-Offaly, particularly beside the Bog of Allen which runs through the centre of Ireland, many small, uneconomic holdings.  It is the same in the extreme north of my constituency, on the borders of Wicklow, where many farmers live on farms of six, seven and eight acres.  If it were the Minister's intention to introduce a Bill aimed at creating general economic conditions on the land, he ought to have brought it before the House in a different form.</P>
    <P>The Minister will find that a great deal of the controversy arising from this section is because he has endeavoured to fix specified areas as congested areas.  I am not very clear myself, and I do not think anyone has been able to extract from the Minister what a congested area is exactly. Taking a reasonable view, I would say a congested area is one in which you have a group of small farmers, maybe two or three or even a dozen, who are living on uneconomic holdings.  I submit there is not a single county in Ireland, to the best of my knowledge, which does not boast such a congested area.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest the Minister is making a great mistake in presenting this section in its present form.  I presume that whoever advised him or drafted it did so on the basis of establishing here a structure on the lines attempted by the European Economic Community countries where the circumstances are totally different.  You cannot here attempt structural alterations in farming simply by introducing <Col N="486" /> legislation on land without an alternative, well thought out general economic policy as well.</P>
    <P>It is no use plucking a whole lot of people off the land in the west of Ireland and dumping them in the east, in Deputy Donegan's constituency in Louth or in mine in Wexford.  We already have problems of our own: several people in our counties will still be needing land after every acre available there at the moment is divided.</P>
    <P>A lot depends on what the Government regard as an economic holding. Do they base their definition on acreage or on the fertility of the land itself? The Minister will see this is a very complicated, obtuse problem.  Section 4, as it stands, gives certain areas priority over other areas.  At least I thought that to be the case but having heard Deputy McQuillan's viewpoint it seems to me the Minister is not conferring any benefit on these areas at all.  In framing the section in this form, the Minister has succeeded in annoying the people in the west of Ireland and in creating the impression among the people in the east and in Munster that they will all get fine economic holdings.  If the Minister could take my criticism as constructive criticism.  I am only telling him what my constituents have told me, and I agree with them.  He has only succeeded in annoying everybody. He has created the impression that this is something new in land reform.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, with all courtesy, that an attempt to deal with land reform and to deal with structural alterations on the basis of what they are doing in Europe, in America and in other parts of the world, must be tied in with the overall picture of taking people off the land. If you take people off the land, you have to have something into which to put them.  It can be argued until the cows come home that this State is in a position to settle all the uneconomic holders and congests in this country, but we cannot do it because we have not got the land.  That is the reason why so many people are speaking on this Bill and speaking at length to try to express their opinions.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong with the <Col N="487" /> draft as it is.  I am not an expert on land reform or land law.  I can only give my opinion from the practical point of view of a Deputy for my area. I think it is a mistake to try to define a congested district geographically. That is the major thing wrong with this section and the Minister should seriously consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt Deputy Esmonde has a point in what he says, but there is this much to be said for what the Minister is trying to do.  The Minister has a precedent established for him in the 1909 Land Act, whereby the old Congested Districts Board had some measurement of the economy of the small farmer.  I could rightly argue that part of my county, the lower half, should be included as a congested district. As Deputy Esmonde said, it is indeed very difficult to define a congested district.  But we all know that the usual yardstick is the rateable valuation if one takes into account the worth of the land as an agricultural holding.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister more or less accepted the figure given in the House that we have approximately 200,000 purely agricultural holdings.  Various figures have been given, but if we take 90,000 of that number as representing congests living solely by farming, we have some idea of the number of claims which would be forthcoming under any Land Act.  There is no doubt that any Minister for Lands will have a huge problem when he comes to deal with the claims of the various applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to this ideal of a 45-acre holding.  I think the Minister is not so much insisting on a 45-acre holding but merely regarding it as a figure to be aimed at. Deputy Esmonde would be a much better judge of this than I am, but I do not think they are aiming at an absolute figure in Europe either.  I think the principle they accept there is that a family farm should be the ideal.  I assume that is what the Minister for Lands had in mind when he came to deal with this matter and that that is what he is aiming at.  If <Col N="488" /> we could achieve the family farm status, it would be a great advance; but can we do it?</P>
    <P>The query posed by Deputy Esmonde when he referred to the pool of land we have presents another problem.  I have heard about this mythical pool of land in the midlands.  I do not know of any large pool of land in the midlands which is not reasonably worked at the moment.  We must look at this matter on the broad principle that land is a commodity which does not change very much except in the way it is worked.  For that reason, we must expect we shall always have a pool of land moving around the commercial market.  For one reason or another&mdash; I do not want to go into detail&mdash;you will have a farmer's dependents&mdash;his widow or young family&mdash;depending on a living from the land.  But the fact remains that that pool of land will still be on the commercial market.  Any Minister will have difficulty when it comes to competing on the open market for the purchase of land for the creation of migrant holdings or for the re-arrangement of holdings.</P>
    <P>If we had spare land in Westmeath or Longford in the morning, I would look with disfavour on bringing in people from the west of Ireland and planking them down beside congests in my county.  That is where Deputy Esmonde's point arises.  It is very hard to define congests.</P>

      <P>That is a matter for argument.  The point must be made in defence of the Minister that he is not insisting on a 45-acre holding but that he regards that as the ideal to be <Col N="489" /> aimed at.  We can all agree that, if we could achieve that, it would be the family unit.  That is the ideal which is being aimed at, not merely in Europe but elsewhere also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with a lot of what Deputy Carter said. He repeated what I have been saying for some time, but it did not find as much favour with the front bench as it did with him, unfortunately, or we might have a better situation.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Dublin on 17th February, 1961, as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the following day, the Minister said that there were 60,000 uneconomic holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be better if I gave the full context.  He said:</P>
      <P>There were from 60,000 to 80,000 genuine small farmers still trying to derive a subsistence livelihood from uneconomic holdings.</P>
      <P>He referred to the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he refer to any particular part of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the whole country. When a Minister talks in Dublin, he talks about the whole country, and when he is down the country, it is different: he confines his remarks to certain parts of the country.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>He could see no reason why a compact Land Commission standard holding of 33 acres of good land could not be really rewarding, provided that it was intensively worked and that the allottee availed himself fully of the excellent advisory services operated by the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister is doing the right thing in this section in taking unto the Minister for Lands the right to declare what is an economic holding, and what is a congested area.  He is also taking to himself the right to decide areas which are now, or may be at some future time, declared congested <Col N="490" /> districts.  He can change them by order.  Again, he is right in doing so.</P>
    <P>I believe the proper person to have that authority is the Minister for Lands because, when he has that authority, he can be asked in the House&mdash;or his successors can be asked &mdash;questions about whether things are being done properly.  If someone outside, such as the Land Commission, had that right the Minister could say he had no function in the matter.  We are all very good at using political pressure when it suits ourselves.  We all know there is an old trick which is used from time to time and which has been used on the Department of Lands as well as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  If you know you cannot get something done by asking a Minister, you advise your greatest supporter to go to that Minister and say he has become a supporter of the Minister.  That has happened again and again in every country of the world.  I am quite sure that device has always been used.</P>
    <P>The whole question of congested districts will be worked out and each place in turn will get its share of the Minister's benevolence.  I am a little worried about the areas which can be declared congested.  If I understood the Minister correctly, he suggested that areas with farms which are not of a size now considered a viable holding can be declared congested districts.  If a district contains a number of farms which are less than 40 and 45 acres, the Minister will have the right to declare it a congested district.  If that is so, the section would need a little tightening up, because the Minister could find himself in extreme difficulty.  People who have got Land Commission farms and who are living in areas where there are anything between one and 100 farms none of which is 45 acres, will read this Bill.  People always read a Bill that will affect them.  They will envisage a further expansion of their holding. That could create quite a problem for the Minister and the Land Commission.  Perhaps the Minister would have another look at it before he puts it into operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> Subsection (2) of section 4 provides:</P>
    <P>When making an order under subsection (1) of this section, the Minister shall have regard to the size of the holdings, the quality of the land and the type or types of farming carried on in the area to be declared a congested area.</P>
    <P>Can we take it from that that if there are 100 farms of under £20 valuation around a farm of £300 to £400 valuation, as we very often find in Meath, the Minister will consider it a congested area, or would the Minister consider that because a large farm was situated in the middle it would be debarred from being considered a congested area, as compared with an area such as I have described earlier with 100 farms of £40 valuation? According to the Minister he can declare that area a congested district.</P>
    <P>I should like to have those matters clarified.  While we are all very anxious to take the Bill a stage further, I am sure the Minister was not at all worried that we did not rush to section 7 of the Bill.  It might have caused a certain amount of embarrassment to everyone in the House if we had reached it before 5 o'clock this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a good thing that the Minister has power to declare an area a congested area.  It would be better if the Lay Commissioners could do that because, apart from the pressure mentioned by Deputy Tully, there is also the fact that the Minister, no matter who he is, as well as every Minister of State&mdash;and I say this without casting a reflection on any Minister&mdash;is a political animal, and as such he will behave to a certain extent in a political way.  The power that is being given to the Minister which leaves him open to political pressure from his own supporters, or indeed from the other side of the House, leaves him in the position that he can or cannot declare an area a congested area, and in so doing he must have regard to the effect it will have on the political fortunes of his Party, or any member of it.  Therefore, it would have been better if the Minister had reserved for himself as well as the <Col N="492" /> Land Commission, the right to make representations to the Lay Commissioners, and let them decide what was or was not a congested area.</P>
      <P>I can understand Deputy McQuillan's anxiety about the size of the holdings. About 18 months ago, the Taoiseach said that if you devoted the same amount of money to land division and increased the size of the holdings, you could settle a lesser number of congests. After that speech, I think every member of the House was approached by constituents, or other people, who were worried about the situation.  Old women were worried and thought that because they could not farm 18 or 20 acres, they would be taken from them.  On the other side of the fence, there were people on uneconomic holdings who thought that suddenly a saving factor would be introduced, such as an exchange holding or a piece of land from a neighbour to bring the farms to an economic size.  None of that will happen so long as the same amount of money is voted while the size of holdings goes up.  I could not see it before but I can now see Deputy McQuillan's argument.  However, there is no answer to that argument, none whatever.</P>

      <P>I gave notice at Question Time that I wished to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 47 on today's Order Paper.  As reported in volume 207, No. 3, column 489, the Minister for Education said: &ldquo;I agree that I am the responsible Minister for the <Col N="493" /> National Gallery.&rdquo;  That must be established at a very early stage.</P>
      <P>This question concerns an appointment to the vacancy for the post of Director of the National Gallery.  I raised the matter on the Minister's Estimate and in my view he dealt with it completely inadequately.  I am particularly shocked by the cavalier way he has dealt with this question.  I believe it to be a very serious issue involving his ministerial integrity because he is, as he says here, the person ultimately responsible for the behaviour of the Governors of the National Gallery.</P>
      <P>The Minister accused me on the previous occasion of throwing mud.  That is one way of trying to suppress Deputies such as myself from bringing forward difficult matters of this kind to the House.  One of the privileges we have here is the right to bring matters of this kind forward but it is a right we are given in the public interest. Whenever we feel conscientiously we have a responsibility to discharge this particular function, I do not think we should be accused of trying to throw mud.  I was particularly careful in my charge to suppress the name of the person whom I believe to be involved in this because I did not want to bring it before this House.  I said I would give it to the Minister if he asked for it. He has not bothered to pursue this matter and to ask who this person is.</P>
      <P>The other person mentioned by me, I named in this House in the highest possible terms.  Therefore, it is particularly disgraceful of the Minister to use this gambit in order to try to suppress full and free discussion on this issue.  I may be wrong in my information but the only person who can ascertain which of us is right and which of us is wrong is the Minister and he has failed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question concerns the appointment by the Governors of a Director of the National Gallery.  An advertisement appeared in July, 1963.  I have given the terms on another occasion and I do not intend to repeat them but the terms I presume were those which the Governors set out.  I do not know how many Governors there are &mdash;13, 14, 15 or 16 reputable and <Col N="494" /> honourable men who, the Minister says, are particularly experienced and well-qualified to judge on these things.</P>
    <P>They decided that certain basic qualifications would turn up the right man for this particularly important job. The National Gallery, in its possessions, happens to be probably one of the greatest galleries in Europe.  Equally, it has the spending of what I understand to be £500,000 under the Shaw Bequest.  Therefore, this appointment is terribly important, even if we leave aside the question of the principle under which the appointment was made.  Therefore, I do not think the Minister is justified, if he is conscious of his responsbility, in dealing with it in the way he has dealt with it so far.</P>
    <P>Certain qualifications were laid down in the July advertisement.  They concerned essential qualifications and desirable qualifications and a salary. I understand there was an age limit. I am not certain of this but I understand there was an age limit of 50 years.</P>
    <P>As a result of that advertisement, I know there were two replies: I understand that there were in fact five.  I understand they were all <i>prima facie</i> fully qualified to take on this job.  If we accept as the necessary qualifications the qualifications laid down by the Board of Governors, who, the Minister says, are so responsible and knowledgeable, at least two of them answered these qualifications, Miss Crookshank and the gentleman from Liverpool. They had the necessary experience and qualifications.  I am not saying either one or the other of these people should have been appointed but if two, three or four people&mdash;I understand a very distinguished American also applied&mdash;had the basic qualifications, then I think the Board should have had them in and should have interviewed them.  That is not my major charge.  I merely believe that that would be correct and standard practice if they were to follow the usual line of the Local Appointments Commission: I imagine that would be their general line.</P>
    <P>These two people, I know for certain, received notice that the job <Col N="495" /> was to be readvertised and assumed they were not to be appointed.  No explanation was given.  In the interval, my charge is that Mr. White was approached by at least two members of the Gallery.  I did not indict all the members of the Gallery &mdash;only two&mdash;and I did not mention either of the names.  I know one of them.  Two of these people, I am told, approached Mr. White.</P>
    <P>Mr. White is a person who, as I said before, has had two years in a tobacco company.  He has no academic qualifications.  He has practically little or no literary output beyond writing critiques on pictures, reviewing pictures, and so on.  Otherwise, he has no special qualifications.  He is Curator of the Municipal Gallery at the present moment and I think for a period of two years, he has been an energetic Curator of that Gallery.  Otherwise, he has no outstanding qualifications at all.  He was approached by these two people and offered the job.  He refused because he said the salary was not adequate&mdash;he is perfectly within his rights in doing this&mdash;but he said he would accept for a salary of £2,500.</P>
    <P>The next thing that happened as far as I can gather is that a further advertisement was issued in January of this year with new qualifications.  The Minister made great play with the fact that the salary was increased to attract better people.  I accept that.  I accept it could attract better people but I also believe that, if these people are the reputable and qualified people they say they are, and the Minister holds they are, the basic qualifications laid down in the first instance should have attracted the properly qualified man at the higher salary.</P>
    <P>No case seems to me to be made against the basic qualifications.  A case has been made against the salary&mdash;I accept that&mdash;but no case has been made against the qualifications.  The qualifications were altered in an interesting and, I believe, a significant way. They were altered so that, in my view, they were hand-tailored to facilitate the making of the appointment in favour of Mr. White, no matter what the alternative might be.  They were hand-tailored in this way.  In the first <Col N="496" /> advertisement, there were no essential qualifications.  The essential qualifications&mdash;Mr. White's qualifications&mdash; were (a) satisfactory experience of art gallery administration with knowledge of the care and display of pictures and (b), utterly inane it seems to me, general suitability to discharge the duties of the position and a general qualification on the subject but relatively meaning very little.</P>
    <P>Then there were desirable qualifications which were the desirable qualications of the previous advertisement&mdash; a university degree, and so on, which Mr. White has not got.  However, he has the essential qualifications.  He had not another essential qualification, as far as I know, in the first advertisement. He was aged 54 or 53.  In the initial advertisement, it was to be a person of 50.  I am not certain of that but anyway it is interesting that the second advertisement states, for the first time, that the age candidates must be is not more than 54 on 1st February 1964.</P>
    <P>The position then is that the age is changed; the qualifications are changed and the salary is changed. They are all changed it seems to me to make it inevitable that Mr. White will be appointed.  May I say that it is Mr. White who has said this in conversation quite freely.  He apparently did not see anything wrong with this and I want to repeat that I am not criticising him at all.  As far as I can see, his position is completely impeccable.  The fact that he was canvassed was not his fault.  The fact that they are giving him these things is to his credit.  He has been approached, and says that he was approached by these people, and that they offered him this post.  I believe that the Governors of the Gallery have, as the Minister has, the right, if they wish to change the terms of the advertisement. A better case should have been made for changing the basic terms of the advertisement.  They were not adverted to by the Minister in his reply.  If these people are the people they say they are, then I believe they should have interviewed these people in the first instance, because they met the basic requirements, and secondly, <Col N="497" /> they could have rejected all of them. There is no objection to that and they then could have increased the salary, altered the age limit and the essential and desirable conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>There is one thing they should not have done if they did it, that is, interview Mr. White and offer him this post on practically any terms he liked.  I am not blaming him for laying down the terms.  That is my charge.  That is where I believe they have behaved dishonourably.  I believe they have behaved in a dishonest way. The Minister has a responsibility to investigate this charge by means of a sworn inquiry.  This is a very serious thing to ask and I do not do it lightly because I know also that I am making serious charges; I know that the sworn inquiry must one day report and I know that they can discredit me in so far as they may say that the charges are unfounded.  At the same time, I believe the evidence I have been given, which I believe to have been given by reputable people &mdash;and I tried to satisfy myself to the best of my ability that they were reputable people&mdash;and because of that, I have brought this matter forward here.  I thought it my responsibility as a public representative to do so. I have taken considerable pains to restrict the names involved in this as far as I have been able to do so, but as far as the <i>prima facie</i> case against these two members of the Board is concerned, I believe that it merits an inquiry by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If I had made this charge against the Taoiseach in regard to the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commissioners&mdash;I am a Deputy of fairly long standing and have been in a ministerial position&mdash;then in all circumstances, most Ministers in either Administrations would have said that this merits serious inquiry, followed by rebuttal, if necessary, or an establishing of the facts that I am correct.  The Minister owes it to the public but above all to the members of the Board who are not a party to this.  Presumably, there may be members who are not parties to what is going on. There are plenty of boards on which <Col N="498" /> there are some people who are more energetic than others.  There is a small cabal on most committees and conceivably there is such a cabal on this one, and that some of these Governors do not know what I am talking about. In fairness to these Governors and to the public who have to supply the money for the salaries, and in fairness, if you like, to the administration of the Shaw Bequest, which is a very considerable and generous one, it is important that the best possible person should be appointed to this position and the Minister, as Minister for Education, should take a more responsible approach to the whole question.</P>
    <P>He has suggested that it is my practice to come in and throw mud at different people and in that regard he mentioned the College of Art.  All I would like to say is that at no time did I attack the personnel of the College. I attacked the educational methods.  In fact, I did not even attack them; I quoted the Swedish Design Report in regard to them, and I was accused at that time of attacking these people, which I did not do. The net result, however, is that there have been fairly radical changes in the College of Art.  It is wrong for the Minister when we come in here attempting, in a <i>bona fide</i> way, to maintain standards, to criticise the Minister, to help the Minister in his Department, not to accept our efforts for what they are, honourable attempts, and not in any way directed towards damaging anybody's reputation within or outside this House.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister at this stage before the appointment was made&mdash; the last day was the second of this month&mdash;should establish some form of judicial body to inquire fully into the whole matter.  I do not propose to give the name of the person who, I have been told, is responsible but I will give it to the Minister if he proposes to carry out a serious inquiry into these allegations.  If they are untrue, naturally the whole thing falls to the ground; if they are true, there is a very serious state of affairs which it would not be possible to ignore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to keep the record straight, when <Col N="499" /> I said Deputy Dr. Browne was throwing mud at the teachers of the College of Art, it was after he said that they were getting money under false pretences, and that was a personal attack, but that is another business.  As far as there is any responsibility to Dáil Éireann for the Gallery, I am the Minister responsible.  As far as the day to day management is concerned, this is a body set up under statute. Under section 13 of the 1854 Act, it is provided, among other things, that all officers and servants, salaries, and those otherwise employed in the care and management of the Trust property, shall be appointed by the said Governors and Guardians, subject to such regulations and conditions as they shall think proper.  There is a provision not in the Act, but made by the Minister, that there shall be a public competition. The composition of this body, which as I say is a statutory body, is: five <i>ex officio</i> members, the President of the Royal Dublin Society, the Senior Vice-President of the Royal Dublin Society, the President of the Royal Hibernian Academy, the President of the Royal Irish Academy and the Chairman of the Board of Works.  As well as that, the Government appoint ten members for five years and there are two members nominated by the Royal Hibernian Academy.</P>
      <P>The appointees are people of very high standing whose only interest is the welfare of the Gallery.  They have the right to make the appointment and while Deputy Dr. Browne might have given the idea that I referred only to the determination of the change in the salary to avoid dealing with other matters, the only thing for which I was responsible was the sanction of the higher salary.  As I explained to the Deputy, the Governors of the Gallery came to me after the first advertisement produced whatever results it did and said they thought they could widen the field of people applying if they could offer a higher salary.  There were other things but they did not need my sanction; the only question that needed my sanction was the higher salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They re-advertised the appointment on 2nd March.  Again, I have purposely <Col N="500" /> not inquired as to who did apply, whether the person mentioned by Deputy Dr. Browne applied or not, but I can assure Deputy Dr. Browne that at the higher salary, everybody who applied will be considered and that consideration will be by the whole Board of Governors and Guardians. As he said himself, he has no intention of giving the impression that the whole Board were at fault.  That would reduce these accusations to two members.  He said that two members offered the post to this other man.  This they could not do.  The whole Board will make the appointment and unless the whole Board had met and decided that they would give this man the post and sent two members to call on him, they could not offer the post to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not do it without the authority of the Board. Deputy Dr. Browne mentions the names of some people who applied. Their applications are still there for consideration as the appointment has not yet been made.  I do not know if this other man has applied.  My responsibility is only in relation to the higher salary and there is no onus on me, and it would be doubtful if I had the authority to question them as to how they made the appointment.</P>
      <P>If the Board want to get the very best man possible, and there is no reason why they would want to do a favour to the man mentioned by the Deputy, if they invited people to apply, it would be in an attempt to get people of proven ability to apply.  I have made inquiries of them and I have satisfied myself that this situation which Deputy Browne suggests does not, in fact, exist.  It could be that they wanted this man to apply and it could be that if he did apply, the Board would appoint him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Dr. Browne says about this man's limited experience in a tobacco company as well as his energy, I should like to state that he has been lecturing on all aspects of art for 15 years in the <Col N="501" /> National Gallery.  He has proved himself a man of great ability, apart from the quality of energy which Deputy Dr. Browne has ascribed to him.  The Board would be glad to get a man of his ability but if he does apply and if he does succeed, it will be on a decision of the whole Board that he is suitable for the post, which is a very important one indeed.</P>
    <P>On the question of a sworn inquiry, apart from any authority which I may or may not have, Deputy Dr. Browne would like an inquiry as to whether these two people invited this man to apply.  If that were the case, there is nothing wrong with it.  Any board of any gallery in the world will invite people to apply for such posts because they want to get the best person possible. I do not think Deputy Dr. Browne intended to mean that the whole Board sent these two people to invite this man to apply but all I can say in reply to that is that he was not offered the post.  I have made inquiries and I am quite satisfied about it.  It may be that there was some attempt to frighten this man from applying for the post.  If there was, I would regret that such a thing would happen.</P>
    <P>If I spoke of mudslinging it was <Col N="502" /> because a man whose reputation depends on his ability as a director of a Gallery was described as having two years' experience in a tobacco company and plenty of energy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>He has proved himself a person of the highest ability as a curator.  If I spoke of mudslinging, it was because I was suspicious, and I may have been wrong, that this was an attempt to stop a man of high capability from applying for the post so that a lesser man might get it.  I have crossed swords with Deputy Dr. Browne before and he prefaced his remarks by the allegation that I was not seriously interested in finding out what was going on.  I regard it as a most important matter that the best possible candidate should be appointed to this post in the National Gallery. I am quite satisfied that the Board of Governors have acted in the best interests of the Gallery, within their rights and with propriety.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 10th March, 1964.</P>
