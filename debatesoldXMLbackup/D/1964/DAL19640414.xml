      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of the towns of (a) Drogheda and (b) Dundalk (1) the number of persons, giving males and females separately, holding insurance cards on 1st January or nearest <Col N="1457" /> available date in each of the years 1957 to 1964, inclusive, (2) the number of persons in each of these years who ceased to be employed contributors because their yearly income exceeded the insurable limit, (3) the number of voluntary contributors under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, in each of these years, and (4) the latest unemployment figures, giving males and females separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to part (1) of the question, data are not available for the number of persons holding social welfare insurance cards who reside in any particular area of the country.  It is, however, possible to state the number of social welfare insurance cards exchanged and issued in each insurance year in respect of each local office of the Department of Social Welfare, though it must be noted that changes in administrative procedures may, from year to year, involve variations in the number of cards exchanged at any particular office.  The figures for cards exchanged and issued for the Drogheda and Dundalk employment exchanges include both those handled by the staff of the exchanges and by agents of the Department for whom Drogheda and Dundalk are the <Col N="1458" /> appointed offices.  These totals include, therefore, returns for a considerable area outside these towns.  With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the number of insurance cards current, exchanged and issued, in respect of the Drogheda and Dundalk employment exchanges, for males for the insurance years ended January, 1957, to January, 1964, and for females for the insurance years ended July, 1957, to July, 1963.</P>
      <P>The information requested in parts (2) and (3) of the question is not available. If, however, the Deputy would care to address a question to the Minister for Social Welfare it may be possible, from the records of his Department, to extract data in relation to part (3).</P>
      <P>With regard to part (4) of the question, the available information is also contained in the circulated statement. The live register return, which gives the data by area of residence, relates to the last Saturday of each month and distinguishes only between men and &ldquo;others&rdquo;&mdash;the figures for boys being included with &ldquo;others&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The main dispensary for the Killygordon dispensary district, in which Carrickmagrath is situated, is at Killygordon. In 1961, a former, unsuitable, dispensary depot at Carrickmagrath was closed and arrangements were made whereby eligible persons formerly served at the depot at Carrickmagrath would be seen at the dispensary doctor's residence at Stranorlar.</P>
      <P>When proposals were received from the Donegal County Council for the erection of dispensary buildings in five dispensary districts in the county, approval was granted for the erection of four but, in relation to the fifth, a new depot at Carrickmagrath, the health authority were asked, by letter of 17 January, 1964, to reconsider their proposal in the light of the arrangements in operation for eligible persons in the Carrickmagrath area since 1961, when, according to my information, only two persons, on average, attended the weekly dispensary sessions.  I understand that the matter was discussed at a meeting of Donegal County Council held on 6th instant when it was stated that the existing arrangements caused hardship to some eligible persons in the Carrickmagrath area.  The matter, I understand, is still under examination by the health authority and I will reconsider the proposal when the health authority's views have been furnished to me following this examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Physiotherapists who hold permanent posts under local authorities are entitled to superannuation benefits calculated in accordance with the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, the provisions of which apply generally to all local authority officers and servants who are pensionable.  I do not feel that any special circumstances exist in regard to physiotherapists which would justify my approaching the appropriate Minister, who is the Minister for Local Government, in regard to the superannuation provisions applying to them.</P>
      <P>As regards physiotherapists employed in voluntary hospitals, the provision of superannuation benefits is primarily a matter for the authorities of those hospitals.  I am concerned only to the extent that approved expenditure on superannuation schemes by hospitals participating in the scheme of grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund towards revenue deficits may be taken into account for the purpose of determining grants towards revenue deficits.  In 1954 the Hospitals Commission, at the request of my Department, notified voluntary hospitals of the criteria which would need to be satisfied in allowing expenditure on superannuation schemes to rank for deficit purposes.  Broadly, the standard was laid down in the local government superannuation code.  I am aware that a number of the hospitals concerned have not introduced superannuation schemes, and that where schemes are in operation there is considerable diversity in the benefits and other conditions as between different hospitals.  With a view to rationalising the position I have established a Committee, representative of the various interests concerned, which is at present examining the question of formulating a superannuation scheme which would apply generally to the staffs of the voluntary hospitals and would enable participants to transfer from one hospital to another without loss of pension rights. The position of physiotherapists in regard to such a scheme would be the same as that of other members of the hospital staffs.</P>

      <P>It is not proposed to alter the existing arrangements for the payment of disability benefit under the Social Welfare Acts.  Under these arrangements the long-term claimants, approximately half the total number, receive their benefit cheques on the same day each week in advance while the remainder receive payment promptly on submission of medical evidence of incapacity.  In the majority of cases the cheque is issued on the date of receipt of the medical certificate. Furthermore, it would not be feasible to pay all disability benefit claimants by cash at employment exchanges as the distances to be travelled would prevent large numbers from attending while many others would not be in a fit state of health to attend.  Even in the case of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance only half the claimants are paid by cash, the remainder, on account of the distances involved, being paid on a postal basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy has in mind the refusal of the British authorities to pay persons living in this country the increases in British retirement pensions granted subsequent to their leaving Great Britain or, where they lived here when awarded pension, subsequent to the date of award.  This restriction does not relate only to persons living in this country but is applied by the British authorities to persons living in all countries outside the United Kingdom except where reciprocal agreements otherwise provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain in regard to pensions but, as I stated in reply to a question on 5th March last I hope to <Col N="1489" /> be able to arrange for preliminary discussions in the matter with the British authorities in the near future.  However, even if an agreement on reciprocal arrangements involving British retirement pensions and Irish old age (contributory) pensions can be reached, it does not necessarily follow that it will include the removal of the British restriction on the payment of increases in pensions to persons in this country; similar restrictions continue to apply in a number of countries having reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain including even some Commonwealth countries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The general rule is that if an application falls into one of the approved priority categories, arrangements are made immediately for provision of service.  If priority is not warranted the application is deferred pending the next general clearance in the area.</P>
      <P>There are at present some unavoidable exceptions to this rule.  For example, in a few areas priority cases are subject to delay because of local equipment shortages, and in certain areas the work position is sufficiently advanced to enable service to be given on demand to all applicants.  Also, there is in each district a relatively small number of old applications which have had to be deferred because the construction work that would be involved in dealing with them is abnormal.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to the Council of Europe scheme of grants to student-instructors and qualified instructors undergoing further training to enable them to attend vocational training centres in member countries.  The 1964 programme under this scheme provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for 21 grants to student - instructors from Cyprus, Greece and Turkey to attend courses <Col N="1501" /> in specialised Italian centres.  There is no question of assigning students from Cyprus, Greece or Turkey to centres in member countries other than Italy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that in certain national schools in the Dublin area where classes contain more than 50 pupils, the method adopted to reduce the size of classes under orders from his Department has been to move the best pupils in the class into a higher class so as to reduce the class numbers to 50 per <Col N="1502" /> class; and that this procedure has been carried out in the middle of the school year to the detriment of the educational programme of the children involved; whether he considers this a desirable method of attaining the necessary reduction in the size of classes; and if he will have this practice investigated with a view to avoiding educational harm to the children in these schools.</P>

      <P>As I have previously stated, I am having a complete survey made with a view to getting rid of large classes.  This will be achieved in either of two ways&mdash;by reorganising existing classes or where this cannot be done without educational loss by the provision of prefabricated classrooms and additional teachers.  I am satisfied that the Department's Inspectors would not act contrary to my instructions by recommending reorganisation in any case where there might be educational harm done to the pupils.</P>

    <P>The delay in commencing the reconstruction work in the married quarters in Dún Uí Chonghaille arose <Col N="1505" /> from the necessity for careful examination of the many problems involved in the conversion to the best advantage of these old and unusual type quarters as well as from the necessity to have most of the quarters vacated before work could commence.</P>

      <P>By a letter dated 7th March, 1964, Galway Corporation inquired whether the band, together with a contingent of the Army stationed at Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa, could take part in the parade.  The Corporation were informed, by letter dated 13th March, that the band could be made available following a military parade under certain terms and conditions which are standard and which would require payment of a sum of £20, plus payment of the cost of any transport used in conveying the band from Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa to Galway and back. <Col N="1506" /> A form of guarantee signed by the Mayor of Galway, on his own behalf and on behalf of the members of the Galway Borough Council, was received from the Galway City Accountant under cover of a letter dated 14th March, 1964.  In this letter, addressed to the Secretary of the Department it was stated, <i>inter alia:</i>&ldquo;His worship, the Mayor, has requested me to convey his appreciation for your co-operation in the matter.&rdquo;  A cheque for £21 was received with a covering letter, dated 25th March, 1964.  It is understood from the Acting Town Clerk that the cheque was paid by the Mayor of Galway out of his personal allowance and that accordingly Corporation funds would not be charged with the cost of the band.</P>
      <P>Banna Ceannasaíochta an Iarthair was made available for similar engagements in Galway in 1962 and 1963.  On those occasions, application for the services of the band was made by the Galway Junior Chamber of Commerce, which body met all the expenses involved. Army bands have been made available generally for paid engagements since 1926.</P>

    <P>1.  ECONOMIC SURVEY.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose this year to make only a brief comment on recent economic developments.  The Central Statistics Office booklet "Economic Statistics" and the report on Ireland by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, both published this month, provide a comprehensive review of the economy over the past few years.</P>
      <P>The volume of national production in 1963 is provisionally estimated to have risen by 4 per cent, as compared with 2½ per cent in 1962.  Over the five years, 1959 to 1963, inclusive, the average annual increase was 4½ per cent.  As the OECD report points out, these five years "witnessed Ireland's period of fastest economic growth in the century."</P>
      <P>In manufacturing industries the increase in output last year was 6½ per cent, one of the highest in Europe. Because of a reduction in the acreage under crops, which offset an increase in cattle production, net agricultural output showed a slight fall.  The further increase in cattle herds, however, is now contributing to higher sales.  Employment in transportable goods industries rose, a gain of 7,800 being registered between the December quarters of 1962 and 1963.  Unemployment and emigration continue to be much lower than a few years ago.  Since the 1961 Census it is estimated that the population has grown by 25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exports, both agricultural and industrial, rose substantially during 1963.  There was a more than off-setting increase in imports, though this was largely of capital goods and raw <Col N="1536" /> materials to support the industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that a balance of payments deficit of £22 million was incurred in 1963, as compared with a deficit of £13½ million in 1962.  As the net external assets of the banking system and departmental funds rose by £3 million during the year, the deficit appears to have been more than covered by an inflow of capital.  I agree with the statement in the OECD report that foreign capital should not be a substitute for measures to stimulate domestic savings nor for proper action to deal with a balance of payments deficit resulting from domestic inflation.  The 1963 capital inflow was accompanied by a rise in domestic savings and helped to raise the proportion of the gross national product devoted to capital formation.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the year ahead, I should like to give some indications of how the economy is expected to shape; these are based on the usual pre-budget assessment, made in consultation with professional economists, the purpose of which is to help in framing the budget in such a way that economic growth will be sustained at a high rate without too great a deficit being incurred in our external payments.</P>
    <P>There are grounds for hoping that an even higher growth rate than the 4 per cent of 1963 may be achieved this year.  The buoyancy of the economies of Britain, America and Western Europe should help us to expand our exports and thus to maintain the momentum gained in the second half of 1963, when industrial output and exports rose faster than in the first half of the year.  The improvement in export market conditions for cattle in recent months is also helpful.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the effects of the large rise in incomes as a result of the &ldquo;ninth round&rdquo; will be significant in 1964.  There has been general satisfaction that a national agreement was reached at the beginning of the year, avoiding a &ldquo;free-for-all&rdquo; and promising stability for a period of two-and-a-half years.  At the same time, it cannot be overlooked that, as the increased incomes are being paid in <Col N="1537" /> advance of the expected increase in output, there are risks involved for the economy.  A steep rise in productivity is needed to offset the higher wages and salaries and keep costs in industry and services from rising significantly. If industrial costs are pushed up so as to render our goods or services less competitive with those of other countries, this will hamper the expansion of our sales abroad and our tourist industry. Since the growth of the economy depends mainly on increased exports, the continued expansion of production and employment could in consequence be endangered.</P>
    <P>Another risk lies in the use that may be made of the large increase in incomes. If it is spent mainly on personal consumption goods, involving heavier imports, the effect, combined with a weakening in our capacity to expand exports, could be to lead us into balance of payments difficulties.  Spending on consumption goods would also absorb resources which could otherwise be used in productive investment.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, essential that every effort be made to minimise the possible adverse effects of the "ninth round", so that advantage may be taken of the otherwise favourable prospects for the economy.  Managements should strive to bring up the productivity of workers so that they will not only be paid more but that their work will be worth more. Some of the initial strain on costs should be taken on profits, in consideration of the future easement when productivity has advanced.  And workers should be encouraged to increase their individual savings.</P>
    <P>If these steps are taken, the outlook for 1964 is good and the balance of payments deficit, though it will be higher than in 1963, will contain a temporary &ldquo;hump&rdquo; which we can surmount.  If they are not, difficulties may develop requiring corrective action.  It is a year in which we must be on our guard and, therefore, one in which the budget, while being framed so as to maintain development, should not itself give a fillip to consumption. A balance on current account must, therefore, be our objective.</P>
    <P>In concluding this brief survey, may <Col N="1538" /> I say that I feel certain it would be better for the national economy&mdash;for workers as well as for employers and every other section&mdash;that the periodic increases in money incomes should correspond as closely as possible with the growth in national production and thus assure the price stability, the advantageous competitive position and the parity between money and real income increases which were good features of the years 1958 to 1960.  I hope there will be growing appreciation on the part of all concerned with wage and salary negotiations, including those charged with the duties of conciliation and arbitration, of the wider national economic interests involved, and especially at this critical period in our development, of the need for maintaining and, indeed, improving our competitiveness in export markets.</P>
    <P Just="Center">2.  CAPITAL BUDGET</P>
    <P>This year a separate paper dealing with the capital budget has again been published so that information about the components of the State capital programme may be readily available for examination and discussion.</P>
    <P>Actual capital expenditure in 1963/64 was £78.5 million as compared with the estimate of almost £80 million.</P>
    <P>The sources from which last year's expenditure was financed are set out in Table 2 in the paper.  The main contribution came from the National Loan of £25 million.  The £20 million which was sought from the public was fully subscribed and additional applications amounting to £1.3 million were met by reduction of allotments to Departmental Funds.  This was a satisfactory result, especially as the Electricity Supply Board had already floated a loan which was fully subscribed and several successful private issues had also been made.  Small savings during the year, however, were somewhat less in total than had been hoped.  Net investment in Savings Certificates and Prize Bonds increased by £¾ million and £½ million, respectively, but, although deposits in the Post Office and Savings Banks were nearly £1 million greater than in the <Col N="1539" /> previous year, withdrawals were also larger and the net increase in deposits, excluding interest, was only £2½ million instead of the £4½ million expected.</P>
    <P>Table 4 shows the proposed method of financing capital expenditure in 1964/65.  The amount to be provided by the Exchequer in the current year is almost £71 million and over £25 million is to be obtained otherwise. The expenditure contemplated on schemes of national development is thus, in money terms, 22 per cent greater than last year but should nevertheless be within the competence of the economy having regard to the considerations set out in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. The bigger the contribution made by current savings, however, the more satisfactory will it be from the economic standpoint.  Building and construction (which includes houses, schools and hospitals), air and other forms of transport, industrial grants and credit, and telephone development are the principal categories for which extra capital is needed.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, every effort must be made to ensure that the £40 million or more of spending power due to the "ninth round" will not excessively raise demand for consumer goods and services at the expense of capital needs.  I would, therefore, ask everyone to put aside some proportion of increased earnings into savings.  The higher the proportion the better.</P>
    <P>I am having an examination made of the present arrangements for National Savings to see whether there is any way in which they need to be improved or brought up to date.  As the current issue of Savings Certificates has been on sale for eight years, I am increasing the maximum permitted holding from £1,250 to £2,500.  I have recently, as is known, made the next Prize Bonds draw more attractive by adding two bonus prizes of £10,000 each.  As a result, there were nearly twice as many applications for Bonds during the recent issue period as there were a year ago and over £1 million extra was subscribed.</P>
    <P>The Post Office Savings Bank and <Col N="1540" /> the Trustee Savings Banks cater for small savers, affording a guarantee of immediate repayment, whenever required, with interest and without loss of capital.  The Post Office Savings Bank is looking into the possibility of giving an improved service to its customers. The Trustee Savings Banks have represented that their progress is handicapped by certain statutory limitations and I hope to introduce legislation shortly to remove these.</P>
    <P>I should like again to refer to the excellent work being done by the Savings Committee, whose members voluntarily devote much of their time to the promotion of savings.  The Committee has just completed a campaign for the encouragement of saving by children in primary schools &mdash; a campaign which met with considerable success as a result of the full co-operation and assistance of the clergy and of teachers.  The habits of thrift acquired by the children should be of value to the economy in future years.</P>
    <P>Another very important feature of the Committee's work&mdash;and one which will yield more immediate results&mdash;is the organisation of savings groups in places of employment.  These groups operate a type of savings scheme based on the deduction of savings from pay; it might be referred to as &ldquo;Saving as You Earn&rdquo;.  Saving is thus made easy, regular and virtually automatic.  At the present time, more than 20,000 people save about £1 million a year where they work, through the 250 groups already in existence&mdash;100 in private firms, 50 in semi-State organisations and 100 in Civil Service and local authority offices.  These range from groups of about ten people to a group of over 4,000 members.</P>
    <P>There is obviously still much scope for this activity and when I met the members of the Savings Committee recently I was pleased to hear that all existing groups are being asked to make a special effort to increase their membership and savings.  In additions, the Committee is about to undertake an intensive drive for new savings groups in firms and factories throughout the country.  The campaign will begin immediately in the Dublin area and I understand that it has the full <Col N="1541" /> backing of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I feel sure that, as hitherto, employers will also readily co-operate.</P>
    <P>3.  CURRENT BUDGET, 1963/64&mdash; OUTTURN</P>
    <P>Recent wage and salary increases have not only contributed to this year's budgetary problem but could be regarded as themselves accounting for last year's deficit of £2.2 million.  The specific wage increases for the Garda Síochána and for national teachers and the general increases arising from the "ninth round" cost 2½ million in 1963/64.  Additional expenditure was, of course, also incurred on items other than pay.  State outlay on pensions, children's allowances and agriculture was specifically increased in the budget and there was need, as well, to provide for various unforeseen items such as shipbuilding subsidy and additional expenditure on health grants.  It is indicative of the buoyant state of the revenue that, although the total supplementary provision needed for current services exceeded the budget estimate by £5.3 million, the overall deficit was limited to £2.2 million.</P>
    <P>The most important feature on the revenue side of the budget last year was the introduction of the turnover tax in November.  It is now working smoothly and the assumptions made in last year's budget about the advantages of this particular type of sales tax have been borne out.  The yield from the tax, £3.7 million, proved to be closely in line with the budget estimate of £3½ million.  The tax did not, as the cost-of-living figures for mid-November and mid-February confirm, result in a disproportionate increase in prices.  Competition, consumer awareness and good sense on the part of traders combined to ensure that the effect of the tax was to raise prices by little more than the tax rate itself.  The tax provides a reliable and indispensable new source of revenue to finance our economic and social development.</P>
    <P>4.  CURRENT BUDGET, 1964/65&mdash; INTRODUCTION</P>
    <P>The turnover tax came into force only last November.  So did the increase <Col N="1542" /> in children's allowances and in other social welfare benefits which have offset for a large proportion of the population the effects of the tax. We have had in recent months the &ldquo;ninth round&rdquo; of wages and salaries. Of its economic implications I have already spoken.  From the revenue point of view it will swell receipts but it also entails a large rise in expenditure.</P>
    <P>The basic figures for this year's budget are shown in the White Paper &ldquo;Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure&rdquo; published a few days ago. Though revenue, at £208.35 million, is up by £23.9 million, current expenditure is shown at £209.96 million and an initial deficit appears of £1.61 million.</P>
    <P>On the revenue side, full allowance is made for the buoyancy of the economy.  Special consideration was given to the prospective yield from the duty on tobacco.  This is one of the most important items of revenue and the intake in February and March had been adversely affected by the coincidence of the United States Surgeon-General's report and Lenten self-denial. The setback now appears to have been transitory and, if the tax rate were unchanged, the realistic estimate is that tobacco consumption this year would show no fall on last year.</P>
    <P>The expenditure total includes £6.85 million for &ldquo;ninth round&rdquo; pay increases and £2 million for CIE subsidy.  Neither of these items was settled in time for inclusion in the Volume of Estimates and special attention is, therefore, drawn to them in the White Paper.  The payment of subsidy to CIE depends, of course, on the enactment of amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The salient features of expenditure this year are apparent from Table III of the Current Budget tables.  Social expenditure in the broad sense shows the largest increase at £8.7 million. This was to be expected in view of the full year's cost of the increase granted to social welfare recipients in last year's budget, the growth of the health services and the increasing outlay on education.  The further improvements in teachers' salaries which have <Col N="1543" /> recently been granted will widen the difference between this year and last year; so will any express provision made for additional expenditure in this budget.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure represented 22.7 per cent of gross national product last year.  It is expected that this year's ratio will show some small increase but will still be moderate by international standards.</P>
    <P>The Government have given very careful consideration to the problem which a deficit poses.  Producers are being urged to avoid as far as possible an increase in prices.  The Government do not themselves want to cause any rise in prices that can possibly be avoided.  At the same time, it is essential to persue a sound financial policy.  To leave a deficit uncovered would, in present circumstances, be bad finance; it would add to inflationary pressure and widen the balance of payments gap.  An optimistic assessment of revenue is justifiable, and has in fact been made, but it is important not to incur any serious risk of a current deficit this year when there will be a much larger capital budget.  Further taxation is, therefore, unavoidable.</P>
    <P>Moreover, there are certain items of expenditure not provided for in the White Paper of which account must be taken.</P>
    <P>There are, first of all, what I might term foreseeable supplementary needs. Certain claims for pay adjustments distinct from the &ldquo;ninth round&rdquo;, such as those of teachers and Post Office clerks, have been the subject of conciliation or arbitration settlements. Other claims and various minor items have also to be dealt with.  I do not know what the extra liability will amount to but I have thought it prudent to make an indirect provision for it by not making any deduction this year for errors of estimation.  In the past these deductions have been of the order of £2-£3 million.</P>
    <P>Secondly, and as an entirely separate matter, consideration must be given to the question of arranging, by taxation, a transfer of incomes to certain sections of the community in <Col N="1544" /> view of the extent to which wages and salaries have recently been increased.</P>
    <P>5.  CURRENT BUDGET, 1964/65&mdash; DETAIL</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmers</i>
    </P>
    <P>By utilising the production aids and the advisory and educational services now available, and through increased co-operation, farmers can take direct action to increase their production and their incomes, as indeed many of them, even on holdings of moderate size, are already doing, to their great credit.</P>
    <P>As in most other countries, agricultural incomes in Ireland are, in general, lower than those earned in other occupations, though the difference is not as great in Ireland as it is in some other countries.  Without the high scale of State expenditure in relation to agriculture, the disparity between agricultural and other incomes in Ireland would be much greater.  There is no justification for the gloomy picture painted in some quarters of the farmer's position.  Agriculture in Ireland, as elsewhere, faces certain difficulties, particularly in international trade, which are beyond the power of any individual Government to overcome completely.</P>
    <P>We have to export a much higher proportion of our agricultural output than any other country which is reasonably developed economically, with the single exception of New Zealand.  For many products, because of the tendency of world agricultural production to outrun commercial demand, the prices obtainable in export markets fall short of meeting the cost of production.  While our marketing methods must be improved as far as possible, it would be a mistake to think that this in itself will solve then basic difficulty which is that export markets are over-supplied and price conditions in these markets are distorted as a result of the domestic support policies followed by the Governments of importing countries. Great industrial economies such as Britain and Germany, in which agriculture represents only a small percentage <Col N="1545" /> of the national product and makes only a minor contribution to exports, can afford to assist their agriculture to an extent that we cannot emulate.</P>
    <P>Until the domestic agricultural policies of exporting and importing countries are effectively co-ordinated and harmonised so that efficient farmers in different countries can obtain reasonably uniform returns for the products they sell, the present export marketing difficulties are likely to continue.</P>
    <P>The higher prices available for cattle this year will, if they continue, raise farmers' receipts by several million pounds.  The price improvements already announced for barley and sugar beet should add close on £1 million. It is the Government's policy that a reasonable relationship should be maintained between the incomes of farmers and those in other occupations. In consideration of the general rise in non-agricultural incomes, they have decided that a further substantial increase in farmers' incomes should be assured by State action.  It is, therefore, proposed that the amount of aid to agriculture should be increased, at the cost of the taxpayer, by close on £5 million in a full year, amounting to £4½ million in the current financial year.  The increase will comprise:</P>
    <P>(1) an addition of 2d. per gallon to the price of creamery milk.  It is to be expected that there will be the same increase in the price paid for liquid milk in the Cork and Dublin Milk Board Areas but this will concern the consumer rather than the taxpayer:</P>
    <P>(2)  additional relief of rates on agricultural land to the extent of £1.4 million, which, allowing for the higher rates being struck this year, will enable the net charge for rates on agricultural land to be kept at or below the 1956-57 level; and</P>
    <P>(3) the raising of the minimum prices for pigs by 8/- a cwt. for grade A and 5/- a cwt. for grade A special.</P>
    <P>The increase in the milk price will come into effect at the beginning of May and the higher pig prices will <Col N="1546" /> operate from 1st June.  In deciding to raise pig prices by the amounts indicated, the Government took fully into account the effect on pig production costs of the increase in the minimum price for feeding barley of the 1964 crop, as well as other factors.</P>
    <P>The total cost to the State of supporting milk prices is already £6 million a year.  The further aid now afforded will raise the cost to £9 million in a full year.  The cost of the rates relief on agricultural land will be raised to nearly £11 million.  Support of pig prices is now expected to cost the State about £2 million a year.</P>
    <P>Various capital grants, for farm buildings, water supply and other purposes related to the objectives of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> have already been increased and their cost is expected to double by 1970.  Total State expenditure in relation to agriculture, including the measures I have just outlined, will now amount to over £43 million a year.</P>
    <P>The large increase increase in State expenditure on agriculture should be of considerable assistance to farmers in expanding their production to meet the targets of the Second Programme. In particular, the increase in the price of milk, together with the calved heifer subsidy scheme, should be a powerful impetus towards attainment of the goal we have set for increased cattle production.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>When consideration is being given to incomes generally, it would be regrettable to overlook the social assistance beneficiaries.  The Government have decided that provision should be made for a further increase of 2/6d. a week for the non-contributory classes of old age and blind pensioners, widows and unemployed persons and their adult dependants. This will come into effect from the beginning of August next and will cost £730,000 in the present year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Despite various increases already granted, the purchasing power of pensions <Col N="1547" /> payable to former public servants has not kept up with the value of money when these pensions were awarded.  Deputies are familiar with the problem, which was discussed in the House last week on the Second Reading of the Pensions (Increase) Bill.  Increases in pensions must be considered both from the budgetary standpoint and also in view of the repercussions on pension schemes outside the public service.  The substantial increases granted in 1962 and 1963 are costing the Exchequer about £1,100,000 this year.  Having regard to this and other pressing commitments, the most that I can afford to give to the public service pensioners on this occasion is 5 per cent, which goes part of the way towards compensating for the rise in the cost of living since 1959.  The increase will be granted to the same groups of pensioners for whom I provided an increase last year, with the addition of those who retired between December, 1959, and November, 1961.  Military Service pensioners and holders of special allowances will also benefit. The increase will take effect from 1st October next and the extra cost to the Exchequer this year will be £140,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Post Office Charges</i>
    </P>
    <P>These income transfers to farmers, social assistance recipients and public service pensioners will cost in all £5.37 million this year and have the effect of widening the deficit to £6.98 million. From this I am deducting £2 million in anticipation of the higher charges which, as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has already announced, will be necessary to meet the additional cost of Post Office services owing to "nine round" and other pay increases. It has always been the policy that the Post Office should pay its way, one year with another, as a commercial service.  The new charges may not balance the extra cost immediately because there is an element of pay arrears to be covered but this may be made up temporarily from existing balances.  Appropriate orders will be made at an early date and the details of the increased charges will then be <Col N="1548" /> given by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>To cover the remaining £4.98 million&mdash;an amount that can be more appropriately met by adjustments in particular taxes than by a change in the rate of turnover tax&mdash;I propose to increase the duties on petrol, cigarettes, beer and imported spirits.  It will be noted that, for the customary retail units, the increases in duties are slightly less than a round number of pence.  These margins have been left to allow for the turnover tax mark-up on the increase in duty.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Petrol and Diesel Road Fuel</i>
    </P>
    <P>The effective rates of duty on petrol and diesel road fuel have not been altered for the last seven years and, during this period, consumption of both these fuels has been rising steadily.  I can reasonably look to this source for additional revenue.  I propose to increase the duties on petrol and diesel road fuel by 2 11/12d. a gallon.  I expect this to yield an additional £1,250,000 this year from petrol and £250,000 from diesel road fuel.</P>
    <P>I am increasing from 6d. a gallon to 9d. a gallon the rate of repayment of duty on diesel fuel used in road passenger vehicles.  There will, therefore, be no effective increase in taxation of diesel fuel used in buses.  Since practically all buses use this type of fuel, bus passenger fares should not be affected.</P>
    <P>Hydrocarbon oils, other than petrol, will continue to be relieved completely from duty when used otherwise than as road fuel.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tobacco</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to increase the main rate of customs duty on leaf tobacco by 5s. 1½d. a lb. which is slightly less than 3d. on a packet of 20 standard size cigarettes.  Special consideration must, however, be given to the position of pipe tobacco.  The statistical evidence which suggests that cigarette smoking is injurious to health does not apply to pipe smoking.  Whilst neither I nor my predecessors can be accused <Col N="1549" /> of encouraging smoking in any form&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I think it would be unfortunate if, at the present time, pipe tobacco were to suffer equally with cigarettes.  Accordingly, in the case of hard pressed pipe tobacco I propose to increase the rate of the existing rebate by 4s. 6d. per lb.  For other pipe tobaccos I propose to introduce a similar rebate of 4s. 6d. per lb.  The incidence of duty on all classes of home-made pipe tobacco will thus remain unaltered.</P>
      <P>The increased tobacco duties are estimated to yield an additional £2 million this year, allowing for some fall in cigarette consumption.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Beer</i>
      </P>
      <P>I propose to raise the duty on beer by £1 10s. 3d. per standard barrel which is slightly less than a penny on the pint.  This increase will apply to both home-produced and imported beer and is expected to yield £1,100,000 this year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Spirits</i>
      </P>
      <P>In the year just ended the total quantity of spirits cleared for home consumption was nearly 1,100,000 proof gallons, a figure which has not been equalled in 40 years.  It is clear, therefore, that some additional revenue can be sought from this source.  At the same time, I must take into account the possible consequences for the distilling industry of an increase in the excise duty on home-made spirits.  Ten years ago, imported spirits accounted for only about one-fifth of domestic consumption of spirits and, except in abnormal supply conditions, this pattern had remained more or less stable for the preceding thirty years.  In recent years, however, there has been a progressive and significant rise in the consumption of imported spirits, notably of brandy and whisky, and the share of the expanding market commanded by imports now exceeds one-third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although we may perhaps expect that, with increased spending power, <Col N="1550" /> consumption of imported spirits will rise, none of us would wish this trend to continue to a point where imports would threaten the well-being of the home distilling industry.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to raise the customs duty on imported spirits by £1 9s. 7d. per proof gallon which is rather less than 4d. a glass and to leave the excise duty on home-made spirits unchanged.  Allowing for a retarding effect on imports, I expect the increased customs duty to yield an additional £300,000 this year; and, since sales of home-made spirits should benefit, I expect to get a further £100,000 in excise duty.  Thus, the overall increase in the revenue from spirits is estimated at £400,000 this year.</P>
    <P>Even when turnover tax has been allowed for in all cases, the full increase in retail prices, corresponding to the additional duties and tax, will be 3d. a gallon on petrol, 3d.  on the packet of 20 standard size cigarettes, 1d. on the pint of beer and 4d. on the glass of imported spirits.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Road Fund</i>
    </P>
    <P>These duty increases will provide an extra £5 million of revenue, leaving me with only £20,000 in hands&mdash;not of itself enough to afford any tax relief. There is, however, one direction in which I can look for a supplement. Motor taxation receipts are particularly buoyant.  They were £835,000 more last year than they had been in 1962/63.  The estimate which has been taken for this year, at £9 million, represents a further increase of over £750,000.  The Minister for Local Government has agreed that, if this estimate is realised, it will not be necessary to call on the Exchequer for the grant of £200,000 included in his estimate.  As I believe the figure of £9 million will be realised, I propose to divert the £200,000 to other purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Age allowance and small incomes relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>The "age allowance" for persons who have reached the age of 65 years is at present confined&mdash;subject to "marginal" relief&mdash;to those whose <Col N="1551" /><i>total</i> income does not exceed £600. Within that income limit existing law gives in effect a deduction of one-fourth of unearned income; the maximum deduction, which is allowed where the income is wholly unearned and amounts to £600, is £150.  I have been urged on several occasions to raise the income ceiling.  Having considered the matter fully I have reached the conclusion that the structure of the relief should be altered.  My proposal will extend the relief and simplify it. In future, entitlement to full relief will not be confined to cases where the total income does not exceed £600. Persons aged 65 or more, irrespective of their total income, will be entitled to a deduction of one-fourth of their unearned income, will be entitled maximum allowance of £150.  There will be a proviso that, where a person has both earned and unearned income, the aggregate amount of the deductions for earned income relief and age allowance may not exceed £500, that is, the existing limit for earned income relief.  The proposed change, it is estimated, will cost £80,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>I have received many representations about the effect of higher living costs on small investment incomes. Taxpayers over 65 are relieved by the provisions I have just mentioned.  I propose to introduce a new allowance for persons under 65.  In their case, the Finance Bill will provide that incomes up to £450 a year will qualify for a deduction equivalent to earned income relief, with marginal relief above that figure.  The cost of this new deduction will be approximately £100,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Profits Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under the general heading of corporation profits tax, I am making the following proposals:</P>
    <P>(1) Losses will be allowed to be carried forward for corporation profits tax purposes and set off against later profits as is done in the case of income tax.  This relief will operate as from 1st January, 1962, the date from which the tax-free margin was abolished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> (2)  Under existing law a private company, the liability of whose members is unlimited, is outside the scope of corporation profits tax. There is evidence that this exemption is being exploited for the purpose of avoiding tax and I propose to bring companies of this type within the charge as from 1st January, 1964.  I shall move the necessary Financial Resolution later.  The Resolution is in broad terms but the Finance Bill provision will make it clear that only profits arising from 1st January, 1964, will be brought into charge.</P>
    <P>(3)  In computing the profits of a director-controlled company for purposes of corporation profits tax, that maximum deduction which may be claimed for the remuneration of a director is £1,500.  I have received numerous representations that this limit, which has stood unaltered since 1947, should be raised and I propose that, as from 1st January, 1964, a new limit of £2,500 should apply.</P>
    <P>Taking these three corporation profits tax proposals together the net cost to the Exchequer for the current year will be approximately £40,000, which disposes of the balance available.</P>
    <P>The procedures in relation to the assessment and collection of corporation profits tax will be brought broadly into line with those which now apply in relation to income tax and sur-tax. The Finance Bill will contain a provision under which, as from a date to be fixed by the Revenue Commissioners, assessments to corporation profits tax will be made by inspectors of taxes and the tax will be payable to the Collector-General.</P>
    <P>Where a company resident in Ireland has profits arising abroad, all tax paid on those profits in the foreign country is deductible in computing the amount to be charged to Irish income tax, notwithstanding that the whole or a part of the foreign tax may be set off as a credit against Irish corporation profits tax.  This is anomalous as Irish corporation profits tax is no longer admitted as a deduction in calculating <Col N="1553" /> profits for income tax purposes.  I propose to insert in the Finance Bill a provision, which will require a Financial Resolution, limiting the deduction for foreign tax to the amount, if any, which cannot be allowed as a credit against Irish corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Collection of certain tax arrears</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is visualised that the new arrangements for collection of income tax and sur-tax outlined in the First and Second White Papers on Direct Taxation will be fully operative as from the current year.  The Finance Bill will provide that the Collector-General may recover tax outstanding on the termination of the existing system of local collection.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exports Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under a scheme for the centralised export of Irish bacon, arranged under the Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act, 1961, all sales of bacon in the export market are made by the Pigs and Bacon Commission who are empowered to obtain supplies by compulsory purchase from licensed bacon curers.  As a consequence, curers who previously exported their own bacon have lost any entitlement to exports relief since, under existing law, relief is confined to the actual exporter.  I shall, however, be granted to bacon curers vision in the Finance Bill to enable relief to be granted to bacon curers for bacon compulsorily sold by them to the Commission and afterwards exported.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Compensation for loss of office</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under existing law, payments to retiring directors or other employees may in certain circumstances represent both a deductible expense for the concern which pays them and a tax-free advantage to the recipient.  This state of affairs can be readily exploited as a means of tax avoidance, which has become known as the "golden handshake".  I propose to bring within the tax charge voluntary payments on the termination of employments and all payments described as compensation for loss of office.  Exemption, <Col N="1554" /> however, will be provided in favour of reasonable lump sum payments of the nature of superannuation benefits or by way of compensation to redundant employees; and other exemptions will include payments on death in service or on account of physical injury or disability.  I shall move the necessary Financial Resolution later.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Restrictive Covenants</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to introduce a provision to put an end to the avoidance of sur-tax by means of arrangements, known as restrictive covenants, which usually take the form of a top executive's undertaking not to set up in competition with the concern he serves or to enter the employment of its competitors. In return the concern gives him a large benefit in money or money's worth which, as the law stands, is not liable to sur-tax in his hands.  A Financial Resolution will be necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exemption of profits of Voluntary Health Insurance Board</i>
    </P>
    <P>It has repeatedly been urged that a profit or surplus arising in any year from the operations of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board should not be subjected to tax.  In general I have to resist firmly any proposal to exempt profits from taxation, even where corporations providing public services are concerned.  However, in view of its particular circumstances and the social importance of the service it gives, I am satisfied that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board merits special consideration and I accordingly propose, as an exceptional step, to include in the Finance Bill a provision relieving the trading profits of the Board from income tax.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Schedule A</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a measure of tax simplification I propose to include in the Finance Bill a provision enabling Schedule A assessments to be dispensed with in the case of business premises owned and occupied by companies.  The provision will be so framed that the overall tax liability of companies will not be affected.  Also, in many instances per- <Col N="1555" /> sons who are not themselves liable to income tax are required to account under Schedule A for tax deductible from ground rents and this has been a source of complaint over the years. I propose to introduce a scheme under which, at the instance of the inspector of taxes, arrangements may be made in certain circumstances for the payment of ground rents in full, leaving the tax due by the recipient to be recovered by direct assessment.  This change in procedure, where adopted, will not affect the amount of the tax liability of either the payer or the recipient of the rent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unsettled Appeals</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will provide that, where an assessment to tax is appealed against, any amount of tax agreed between the inspector of taxes and the taxpayer as not being in dispute shall be payable on account, subject to any necessary adjustment when the appeal has been determined.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Covenanted Subscriptions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Finance Acts of 1957 and 1959 granted a tax advantage in relation to certain covenanted subscriptions for research or for teaching the natural sciences.  I intend during the present year to examine how these concessions might be modified so as to prevent abuse, while leaving an adequate, though temporary, incentive for such subscriptions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to abolish with effect from 1st August next the stamp duty of sixpence on letters of allotment and letters of renunciation.  The revenue involved is negligible.  I also propose to provide that statutory bodies may compound for the stamp duty on their cheques or pay orders.  This facility has already been granted to banks and to certain local authorities.</P>
    <P>I might say that the volume on stamp duty law which the Revenue Commissioners have prepared for the assistance of the legal profession and others will be published this month.</P>

      <Col N="1556" /> 6.  SECOND PROGRAMME AND TRADING RELATIONS</P>
    <P>
      <i>Second Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>When the outline of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was published in August last, it was stated that the principal functional organisations would be consulted regarding the practicability of the programme and the best means of realising its aims. The views of most of these organisations and of international economic agencies have since been received and are being considered.  The industrial aspects of the programme have been examined by the National Industrial Economic Council, which found that the industrial target is &ldquo;certainly capable of being achieved&rdquo;.  A series of consultations with representatives of the principal industries regarding the detailed targets for these industries has also been undertaken and is making good progress.  Arrangements are being made to keep the NIEC informed of the course of these discussions.  The consultative process has taken somewhat longer than was expected but it has been extremely valuable.  It is now hoped to publish the second part of the programme, in which details will be given of the contributions expected from the major sectors, before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Trading Relations</i>
    </P>
    <P>To achieve the targets of the second programme we need an increase of the order of 75 per cent in exports of goods and services over the decade 1960-70.  Although agricultural exports will be expected to make a substantial contribution, the major part of the increase will be in industrial goods, exports of which must rise by over 150 per cent in the decade.  We have set ourselves this target in the full realisation that, between now and 1970, the movement towards freer trade will continue and intensify in Western Europe and North America, the areas with which we have the closest trading relations.</P>
    <P>Since the breakdown in the British negotiations with the European Economic <Col N="1557" /> Community in January, 1963, the Government have kept our trade policy under continuous review with the aim of securing improved openings for our exports.  We are in constant contact with the Community through our mission in Brussels and the arrangements which have been made for periodic discussions with the Commission on matters of mutual interest will keep us informed of developments and enable us to explore any possibilities of improving our trading relations with the Community.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to reopen discussions on the terms of accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  These were postponed in 1961 pending the outcome of our negotiations with the European Economic Community.  The GATT is the principal forum for the examination of trade problems on a world-wide scale and comprises all the leading trading countries outside the Communist bloc.  It is instrumental in promoting multilateral negotiations for the reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade.  In view of our growing interest in international trade it is important that we should be associated with these negotiations, particularly, those due to commence in a few weeks' time &mdash; known as the Kennedy Round &mdash; which are expected to result in significant tariff reductions.  These reductions will afford some return for the lowering of our own tariffs which we have undertaken as a means of promoting efficiency and preparing ourselves gradually for more competitive conditions. The Kennedy Round negotiations are intended also to embrace trade in agricultural products the aim being to provide better terms of access to world markets.  There are certain problems in regard to preferential duties and low-cost imports for which we shall have to find a solution in the course of our discussions with the contracting parties to the GATT.</P>
    <P>The conditions of trade between the more developed and the less developed countries are under consideration in the United Nations Trade and Development Conference at present taking place at Geneva, at which Ireland is represented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> Realism demands that in trade matters we continue to give primary consideration to the British market. During the year discussions were held both the Ministerial and official level with the British authorities on trade relations between the two countries. At these discussions particular stress was laid on the importance for Irish agriculture of improved outlets in the British market.  Reciprocal concessions were sought for the increased opportunities offered to British exporters by the reductions in our industrial tariffs. These discussions are continuing.  As the Taoiseach said recently in London, the Irish Government desire that the close economic links between the two countries, which already include important features of a regional free trade area of common market, should be strengthened and consider that this would be to the advantage of both countries.</P>
    <P>An economic climate favourable to the expansion of trade is a necessary supplement to formal trading arrangements. Experience throughout the world in recent years has shown that economic growth in the major industrial countries is as potent in expanding industrial trade as the lowering of trade barriers.  The immediate prospect in this respect is encouraging so far as our principal export market is concerned and should enable us to get off to a good start with our Second Programme.</P>
    <P Just="Center">7. CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>This budget is presented at a time when the rate of economic growth is high and the prospects for increased production, exports and employment are good provided competitiveness is maintained and the balance of payments deficit is kept within tolerable limits.  Some strain on costs, prices and external payments is inevitable because of the degree to which the recent rise in money incomes anticipates the increase in national production. The Budget, therefore, is intended to favour saving, to increase investment and to put a slight brake on consumption.  It provides for <Col N="1559" /> economic and social needs on a scale as generous as available resources will allow.  It plays a part in seeing that improved incomes are not confined to particular sections but are extended throughout the community.  The assistance given to farmers, social assistance recipients and public service pensioners has had to be met by increased taxes on items which at the margin are not essential and do not enter materially into the cost of living. It is regretted that any further taxation should be necessary this year but a budget deficit which would add to spending and widen the balance of payments gap would be indefensible.</P>
    <P>Special measures have been taken to improve the position of farmers.  The generous State aid now being afforded to agriculture is intended to increase productive and earning capacity &mdash; to generate additional income &mdash; and not just to provide a temporary supplement to existing income.  Financial assistance is accompanied by continuous international negotiation aimed <Col N="1560" /> at ensuring satisfactory export outlets for agricultural products in face of a pronounced movement towards greater regulation of access to the principal export markets.</P>
    <P>The Second Programme sets high but not unattainable targets.  The united efforts of all concerned with the production and sale of goods and services will be needed to achieve them. The Government are doing their part by maintaining a high level of investment, by providing grants, fiscal incentives and other aids and encouragements and by attending to education, housing, health and other community needs fundamental to progress.  Government policy has been effective both in promoting a high rate of growth of the economy and in ensuring that all share in the increasing national prosperity.  We are confident that, in return, a wholehearted effort will continue to be made by all to safeguard that prosperity and to advance it further.</P>

This is offset in the Assets Statement where the balances on the American Loan Counterpart Fund, the National Development Fund (Winding-up) Account, the National Loans Sinking Fund and the Savings Certificates Fund (Principal Reserve Account) include the Fund's investments in Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer and Exchequer Bills.</P>

      <P>A year ago, from these benches, we warned the Minister for Finance and the Government that the path on which they were then travelling in imposing taxes on the essential necessaries of life was one that was bound to bring in its train an inflationary spiral which would end God knows where.  The Minister today has had to devote a substantial part of his Budget speech to the fact that we have that inflationary spiral now, an inflationary spiral he himself touched off a year ago.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan, Minister for Finance, came into this House today with the announcement that, in the Tables he had circulated, he was going to provide, and to find by way of borrowing in this year, a record sum in relation to the expenditure of the Government, a sum approximately double the sum borrowed in 1956-1957. He came to the House at a time when, as he said himself, there was a substantial danger of inflation, having himself for the third successive year brought the year to a close with a Budget deficit, a Budget deficit which arises this year, as it arose last year, and the year before, not because of a shortfall in revenue but because of increased expenditure and because the Minister for Finance failed to exercise the control that it is his duty to exercise.  If, therefore, there is any danger in the inflationary position to-day it is a danger that arises solely because of the action the Minister himself initiated last year, and because he failed during the year just gone by to take any proper step to see whither he was travelling.  He came to this House today in the knowledge that he would get, out of old taxation, a record sum. Notwithstanding the fact that he was going to get out of old taxation that record sum, he has today in his Budget, in the measures that give effect to taxes for the current year, imposed £17 million additional taxation this year on the people as compared with last year: £17 million new taxation.</P>

      <P>£17 million additional new taxation and £14 million buoyancy in revenue &mdash; £31 million in all, bringing the share the Government will take of the national cake to an all-time high level.  In doing that, he has given some mere temporary benefits to which I shall refer in a moment.  The tragedy is that he has taken this additional buoyancy and this additional new taxation and, by and large, it is all being frittered away without any real provision for long-term needs and the necessary long-term expansion.  Do all of us not realise that there is no hope of our keeping pace in the modern world with the new inventions and new techniques that are being developed every day, unless there is a real and substantial improvement in our research possibilities and in our educational possibilities?</P>

      <P>There is nothing in this Budget that provides for the additional needs of education in regard to that development.  Admittedly, there is an increased sum for education but that increased sum for education arises because those who are engaged in education are entitled to receive their 12 per cent increase in line with the rest of the community.  There is nothing in this Budget for the real, long-term needs of education and the development of our educational facilities, a development we must have if we are to succeed in keeping pace with Europe, much less the United States of America, in increased benefits and improved higher living standards in the Free World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in this Budget for the improvement of health services, services about which the Minister for Health has been talking for so long and in relation to which he set up his Health Committee as a smokescreen to try to cover up his own defects.  If that were a really genuine effort, he would have been able to persuade his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to include something in this Budget in that <Col N="1599" /> regard.  This comes at a time when the Minister for Finance has not only come in with a Budgetary deficit to swell the inflationary pressure but has also told the House, as he had to tell the House, that for the second year running, we have had a substantial deficit in our balance of payments, a deficit over the past two years of £35 million, which, in relation to external reserves, is being met by what?  By the sale of Irish assets.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear at all times that I believe it is entirely desirable that foreign capital, foreign knowhow and foreign technique should be brought in for the purpose of developing our manufacturing potential and increasing our industrial and other employment; but that is not the type of capital that is coming in to offset the deficit in our balance of payments current account.  It consists to a large extent in the sale of assets already here, assets which will not be improved in any way by being sold off to foreign hands.  It consists in large sales of the wholesale distribution arrangements of this city, large sales of hotels already there and functioning and not, therefore, for future development. That sort of investment, like the foreign investment in land, does not bring any benefit to the Irish people and is, in fact, merely covering up present defects and creating future difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget Statement has acknowledged, and rightly, that agriculture is in a difficult position and that it is essential that there should be a measure of relief granted to agriculture in the current Budget. Everybody expected that; everybody knew it should come.  In the short time at my disposal, as far as I can see, the twopence a gallon on milk is the exact figure the Minister will get from the increased price for butter sales and could be met, as was advocated from these benches not so long ago, by the removal of the levy by Bord Bainne in that respect.  It does not give any real indication of a proper approach to the fundamental long-term problems of agriculture.  It should have given some indication <Col N="1600" /> that the proposals the NFA set out in their Green Book were being considered and that there was going to be an adequate placing aside of funds and reserves to meet that.</P>
    <P>We see nothing like that, nor, in the same context, do we see any relief for the hard-pressed small shopkeepers, whose rates in the coming year will be well nigh impossible for them to meet.  Naturally, I am more intimately acquainted with the rates in the two towns in my own constituency, Naas and Athy.  There the manager was looking for an increase of more than 10/- in the rates for the coming year.  There is nothing anywhere in this Budget to give the ratepayers hope of relief from this burden they will be called upon to bear in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the ninth round of wages and the increases in the early part of this year, most people felt that social welfare benefits would be increased by more than 2/6d.  I note there is nothing in the Budget Statement that takes account of contributory pensions.  It is only in the noncontributory band that this small, disappointing increase has been given. As regards State pensioners, the Minister himself, in the wording of his Budget Statement, made it clear that he acknowledged what he was doing was pitifully unjust and that it failed completely to meet the just claims of these pensioners for an increase to meet the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>Turning for a moment from the expenditure side of the Budget to the receipts side, what do we find?  The first thing the Minister promises us is that a second Budget will be introduced later in the year by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The people will no doubt be delighted to know that, if they want to take their families out on Sundays for a drive, they are going to have the pleasure of paying 3d per gallon more for their petrol and that distribution costs for the wholesale and retail trade, whose distribution is largely done by petrol vehicles, will also go up.  Far worse, however, the cost of diesel oil for transport <Col N="1601" /> which is a fundamental cost in industry, is to be increased at this juncture.  That will be something that will affect very substantially manufacturing and distribution costs at a time when our costs are already in jeopardy of being pushed up so much as to price us out of our export markets.</P>
    <P>I will agree with the Minister that no Minister for Finance has ever encouraged tobacco, and the Minister is certainly living up to that pattern this year.  It means that the duty content of the packet of 20 Players will go up to 3/- out of the new price of 4/-.  I note, too, that the man who drinks his pint is not going to escape this year the wrath of the Minister. Naturally, those of us who drink Irish whiskey are relieved that we are not going to have to pay more for it. However, it seems to me that the Minister is going to have some little difficulty, having regard to our overtures to GATT and the reduction of protective tariffs, in justifying the fact he is now changing what heretofore has been a revenue impost into a protective impost.  All power to him if he is able to get away with it.  However, there are other implications to which, I am sure, the Revenue Commissioners directed the attention of the Minister. I know from my own knowledge they were brought to the notice of both Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Aiken when they were Ministers for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is at least some consolation that the Minister, when imposing the tax on diesel oils, made some provision by virtue of which it will not affect road passenger vehicles; but that does not affect the manner in which the cost of diesel oil, which is used in all the heavy transport in the country, is being still further increased at a time when the Minister for Transport and Power has done his utmost to ensure that every railway line that could be closed in the country is closed.</P>
    <P>The people who got increases in their wages and salaries confidently expected the Minister for Finance on this occasion to increase the allowances for which there is provision under the Income Tax Acts.  It is nonsense to <Col N="1602" /> suggest that the increases, which the Taoiseach suggested during the by-elections were full increases, are full increases, when in fact his colleague, the Minister for Finance, has come along and taken from these people approximately one-third in income tax alone and is taking more in other forms of indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has lamentably failed to meet the real challenge of the times &mdash; the long-term development of our economic growth &mdash; and has completely frittered away the great opportunities given to him by the buoyancy in revenue to provide for the essential permanent things.  They will have to be provided for by other means in the future, but the Minister could have provided for them with a properly planned Budget, really designed to examine the long-term position and develop long-term economic growth and not merely give us a temporary sop to try to avoid political unpopularity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Budget should be used as an instrument for distributing the resources of the nation and for placing the tax burden in accordance with the principles of social justice.  I regard this Budget, as all Budgets, in that light.  The Budget is also connected with something the Minister seemed to steer away from &mdash; the question of unemployment, employment and emigration.  After listening to the Minister's speech, I think the Budget has been a complete failure.  One must have regard to many things when considering a Budget of these dimensions &mdash; the Budget provides for approximately £210 million, something on which we did not hear much comment from the Minister &mdash; and we must ask ourselves was there any attempt to prune this amount to see whether or not non-productive services could be cut out or whether much of the money was being expended properly.  We have had no indication from the Minister that there has been this detailed examination to see whether or not there is room for economies in certain of our services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing we must remember about this Budget, something the Government <Col N="1603" /> would like to forget, is that it still includes the turnover tax.  The Minister made reference to it and I think he described it as reliable and indispensable.  I suppose the statement that it is reliable is true because people have to live; they have to eat food; they have to buy bread and the other necessaries of life.  Whether or not it is an indispensable tax is a matter of opinion, views on which were expressed by members of the Labour Party during discussions last year.</P>
    <P>Last year the turnover tax extracted from the taxpayers something like £3.69 million and this year it is estimated to yield something in the region of £14 million.  It must be remembered that this Budget still includes the provision whereby tea, bread, butter, sugar, flour, meat, clothing and footwear carry the 2½ per cent turnover tax.  What strikes me particularly this year is the Minister's reference to the tax on beer, cigarettes, tobacco, <i>et cetera.</i> Last year when he wanted to provide excuses for the introduction of a turnover tax, he said, in effect, that the consumption of beer, spirits, cigarettes and tobacco was at near-saturation point and that if he attempted to increase these in price by way of taxation, the returns would diminish and diminish very rapidly. Last year the Minister got his turnover tax at 2½ per cent on practically every commodity one can think of.  He gave the impression last year as regards beer, cigarettes and the other commodities which are being further taxed today, that they were not considered because they would not give him any appreciable sum of money.  This year he gets something in the region of £5 million from these same commodities.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Minister said last year in regard to these consumer articles, they did go up in price.  Therefore, the people have the increases necessitated by the turnover tax, the increases imposed by the manufacturers, plus the increases the Minister now proposes to impose one year afterwards.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister estimated that the turnover tax would bring in a sum in the region of £10½ million.  Now his <Col N="1604" /> estimate is a little over £14 million. Therefore, the turnover tax this year will produce about 40 per cent more than he estimated in his last Budget. We cannot too strongly stress the damage that has been caused by the introduction of the turnover tax, particularly in regard to prices.  What I am amazed at is what appears to be the complacency of the Government in the matter of prices.  They do not seem to be concerned.  Nobody is at all impressed by the half-hearted statements made from time to time by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the investigation of prices. If there is to be an investigation of prices of essential commodities, it should not be held in secrecy by any Department of State.  It should be held in public or at least a report on the investigation should be made available to the public because the public want to know why these increases have been imposed.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency in recent months to blame price increases on wages.  Wages are not the biggest element in any increase in prices that has taken place in recent months.  The Government themselves must take a share of the blame for some of the increases in wages because it was necessary to grant increases in order to compensate for the turnover tax this Government introduced.  The Minister and the Government should now be warned that the trade union movement are gravely concerned by this tendency towards price increases.  There is no use in quoting the cost of living index figure for November and February.  As far as I can see, most of the big increases occurred after the cost of living index figure was published for mid-February.</P>
    <P>While the trade union movement here agreed, and rightly so, that a national wage agreement should obtain for a period of two-and-a-half years, they cannot allow the 12 per cent increase they negotiated on behalf of their workers to be frittered away by this gradual process of price increases about which the Government appear to be very complacent indeed.  It seems to me &mdash; I may be wrong in this &mdash; that the Government have a vested <Col N="1605" /> interest in prices.  The turnover tax represents a considerable income to them.  This year the Minister says it will be £14 million, and if prices go up, it will be greater.  The Government ought to be warned that unless they control prices, the trade union movement will have to think twice about the national wage agreement which they made because they must protect their members.  If they are to be compensated to the extent of 12 per cent&mdash;of course the Taoiseach wanted to have only eight per cent&mdash;and if their wages are to retain their purchasing power, serious regard must be had to the question of prices.</P>
    <P>One would imagine from the various statements of the Government and from their complacency that a great deal was being done about social welfare.  I want to tell the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare that their record in respect of social welfare is a bad one in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall talk about yours, now that you have responsibility. I answered for mine when I was there.  We were always led to believe by the Minister for Finance and by various Ministers for Social Welfare in the Fianna Fáil Government that if they got more by way of taxation they would pay it out to the social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a nice way of approaching it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister's way of approaching it.  I am not as adept as the Minister at juggling with figures but we were always led to believe that if this Government got extra money by way of taxation, income tax or turnover tax, they would be prepared to improve social welfare benefits.  They have got in any amount of money in the past six or seven years but the social welfare recipients have not got their share of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me quote some figures.  In 1957-58, £25.5 million was devoted to social welfare payments: tax revenue <Col N="1606" /> amounted to £102.7 million and social welfare got 24.8 per cent.  It has been declining year by year since then.  In 1963-64, £31 million was devoted to social welfare: tax revenue stood at £155 million and social welfare got 20 per cent.  In 1957-58, social welfare recipients got 24.8 per cent and in 1963-64, the amount declined to 20 per cent.  In 1964-65, pre-Budget, social welfare got £33.9 million out of revenue amounting to £177.2 million. The share for social welfare went down to 19.1 per cent, and again tax revenue has gone up.</P>
    <P>While I have not had an opportunity of examining the figures in detail, I guarantee this to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare, that in 1964-65 even a smaller percentage of tax revenue will be devoted to the social welfare group. It is fantastic that in a year in which we expect to get so much money, in a year in which our gross national product will amount to something like £900 million, all we can afford for the old age pensioners is 2/6d.  The Minister may tell me: &ldquo;During your time, you did not give them that; you gave it in one or two years,&rdquo; but having regard to the cost of living, to the value of the pound and to the amount that the Government have taken in in tax revenue, the old age pensioners have been treated scandalously.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Social Welfare accepting on behalf of the Government a principle embodied in a motion tabled by Deputy Sherwin to the effect that social welfare payments should keep in line with wage increases. Therefore I suggest that if the old age pensioners were to get their due, they would be given 4/- to 5/- extra per week today.  I notice tremendous efforts being made &mdash; perhaps the Minister may say it will not cost a lot of money &mdash; in regard to corporation profits tax and to give tax inducements to those who export.  All these sums of £20,000 or £30,000 add up.  It must be remembered also that while from 1954 to 1957 and in the few years on from that, it cost over £1 million to give the old age pensioners an extra 2/6 a week, today it costs almost £750,000 to give the 2/6.  Therefore the Government's <Col N="1607" /> task should be easier in many respects.</P>
    <P>I believe that the system employed for getting the money should be looked into.  I and my Party supported in every way the tax proposals which the Minister introduced last year, apart from the turnover tax, in respect of corporation profits tax and the regulations in respect of tax rebates. They were very good proposals but there were many more avenues that needed to be explored.  There is great concern, particularly among the economists, not to touch too hard on the fellow who is engaged in production, in a management capacity.  The theory seems to be that if you increase sur-tax by 1d., he might fly from the country, that if you touch the business man or the industrialist to any degree in regard to surtax and other taxes, he may get out of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that there is a lot of money which is not subjected to any sort of income tax. This is the day of the take-over bid and of take-overs; this is the day of speculation on the Stock Exchange and of speculation in property, and profits made from those transactions are not taxable.  I may pose the question: What is the difference?  Why is there this difference in regard to the man who goes out tommorrow and buys property for £1,000 and in three months' time, sells it for twice its value, and with the profit, buys a bungalow, in respect of which there is no tax?  If the salary or wage earner wants to buy a house, he pays money on which he has been taxed.  I do not know whether there is a substantial amount of money involved in such matters but whether it was £40,000, or better still, whether it was £750,000, efforts should be made in that respect to ensure that people such as old age pensioners who need an increase at present will get it.</P>
    <P>I want to deal only briefly with these matters because this should be on the record in view of the fact that little or no mention was made &mdash; I may be corrected on this but as far as I can gather there was no appreciable comment &mdash; of unemployment, employment <Col N="1608" /> or emigration.  The Minister boasted, and I suppose rightly boasted, that for the year ended February, 1963, the rate of emigration stood at 12,200.  There were certain circumstances that obtained last year but at least, the Minister said, it showed a trend, meaning that it showed a trend downwards.  For the 12 months ended February, 1964, emigration was 25,660.  That is double what it was in February, 1963.  It is not fair to say that it is doubled in view of the circumstances that obtained last year, but it is now up 25,000.  A few months ago we had the Minister for Transport and Power saying that it was now around the 11,000 or 12,000 mark, that this was the normal figure.  The Government need not be complacent about figures so far as emigration is concerned.  I received the impression from Fianna Fáil spokesmen that as far as employment is concerned the country is booming and that as far as unemployment is concerned, it is negligible.</P>
    <P>Let us quote a few figures contained in the booklet which the Minister published last week.  In 1963, there were 1,000 more at work than there were in 1962.  That is an improvement, but there were 3,000 fewer at work in 1963 than there were in 1960.  There were 8,000 fewer at work in 1963 than there were in 1959, and in the bad year about which the Fianna Fáil people talk, the year 1955, there were 94,000 more employed than there were in 1963.</P>

      <P>What price the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion?</i> What is the prospect for the Second Programme, if this is the result we get from the first?  It is true that as far as manufacturing is concerned, there were 4,000 more employed in 1963 than in 1962 and there were 9,000 more employed then than in 1957 but the Government have responsibility for all workers, to provide the conditions to ensure that these will be employed, but we have lost 54,000 from agriculture in the rural areas from 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach does not seem to be too annoyed about unemployment but <Col N="1609" /> he and every Deputy in Fianna Fáil should look at the statistics given to us every week.  These show that on 4th April, 1964, there were 3,500 more unemployed than there were on 4th April, 1963.  I am not quoting 1963 because everybody can see that to some extent it was an abnormal year. Even as far as last year is concerned the unemployment figure on the last Friday or Saturday available shows that it is some hundreds higher than it was in April, 1963.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying that the Budget may be balanced and the two and two make four on either side; that is a very important thing for the Minister for Finance and a very important thing for the economists but it is not the most important thing. There are still many social injustices, particularly in respect of lower paid workers and in respect of those dependent either on social welfare benefits or on pensions.  They get the usual crust today in an all-time record Budget.  The halfcrown certainly could not, as every Deputy knows, compensate them for the increase in the cost of living in recent months and recent years.  This Budget does not do anything; it does not hold out encouragement for an increase in employment, even at the rate forecast in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> This Budget does not show, as the Minister said last year, that the tendency for emigration is to fall; it does not show that unemployment has fallen appreciably in the past two or three years.  Because of these things and because of the social injustices which have still been uncorrected, the Budget is a failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy representing a rural constituency, my principal interest in the Budget was to see if the Minister or the Government had any plan to check the denudation of the countryside caused by the flight from the land.  The Minister offers two well-picked bones for us to chew on for the next 12 months, one, represented by the few shillings extra by way of relief of rates on agricultural land and the other, by a further 2d. a gallon on milk.  That is the size of the Minister's <Col N="1610" /> plan for checking the flight from the land, that is, if the Government have any serious intention of trying to check it.</P>
      <P>Various statements made by Ministers throughout the year have attempted to put across to the people the image that emigration is declining. Emigration has come to a full stop in some areas because there is no one left to emigrate and in other areas there is nobody left but the old people whose last emigration will be to their final resting place.  It would seem that the policy of the Government is aimed at the complete wiping out of the countryside while at the same time the propaganda machine keeps up the idea that everything is satisfactory.  Does the Minister seriously believe that he will remove the disparity between agricultural and non-agricultural occupations by giving a few shillings relief in the rates on agricultural land and an extra 2d. a gallon on milk?</P>
      <P>I am not one of those who believe that any section of the community should cry out for an increase in income simply because somebody else has got a well deserved increase.  I do not believe in such an approach.  But, if the Government are serious about holding the small farmers on the land, the few who are left, some provision will have to be made besides the miserable sops contained in the Budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister has treated old age pensioners and blind pensioners very miserably in view of the deterioration in the purchasing power of the £.  A halfcrown increase to old age pensioners is very poor.  The Minister from time to time jibes about what the inter-Party Government did in their day but we gave a halfcrown increase when a halfcrown was worth something. Today 2/6d. is little more than pence one would give to a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has put extra taxation on cigarettes.  If that tax helps reduce cigarette smoking.  I have not much to say against it, in view of world medical opinion as to the health hazards involved. If the increased taxation on cigarettes reduces cigarette-smoking, the Minister will have taken a step in <Col N="1611" /> the right direction.  Medical opinion all over the world is that cigarette-smoking is a serious danger to health.  In that case, something should be done about it, something even more drastic than a tax that would discourage cigarette-smoking.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put a penny on the pint, the poor man's drink.  He has put 4d. on the glass of imported spirits in order to prevent any danger of the home distilling industry being hit.  That is all to the good.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that should not be lost sight of in regard to all these taxes the Minister is imposing in this Budget.  All these taxes will be affected by the turnover tax of 2½ per cent.  I am sure the Minister will be quite pleased when at the end of the year he gets the returns of revenue.  He told us when the turnover tax was introduced last year that it would produce £9 million in a single year.  That has gone up to a figure approaching £15 million.  My own guess at the time was that it would produce £16 million in a single year.  Certainly, when these new taxes are in operation, it will reach £16 million.  Out of that the Minister could be more generous to the old and the blind and should have made a more determined effort to reduce the disparity between farmers' incomes and other incomes.</P>
    <P>Great play was made with the 12 per cent increase to all other workers. They wanted it, but the Minister should remember that farmers, particularly the small farmers, have nobody to give them a 12 per cent increase. Had the Minister his tongue in his cheek when he spoke about the increased prices for cattle that took place last year?  I am a farmer and I meet a number of farmers.  That was the first I heard of any increase in the price of cattle.  There might have been an increased demand as compared with the horrible failure last year but there has been no increase in the price of cattle and the Minister will not be able to put it across that there has been an increase in farmers' incomes because of that.</P>
    <P>This Budget is disappointing to me <Col N="1612" /> and, I am sure, to most rural Deputies. It seems that the policy of the Government is to back up what the Minister said in 1945 when he was Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;There are too many people on the land".  I want to tell him that I still believe in what I and members of my Party advocated over the past 20 years, that if the Government want to hold the farmers, particularly small and middle-size farmers, on the land, the land should be completely derated.</P>
    <P>That problem and the problem of unemployment are the two most urgent matters facing the Government. These problems have been very carefully sidestepped in this Budget.  There is no employment in the countryside. Young people are leaving the land according as they leave school.  The same situation as has obtained down through the years obtains today.  The moment the young people in the country areas reach maturity, or even before that, they leave.  They have lost hope of making a living in their own country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, section 2 (2), paragraph (h), line 30, after &ldquo;for&rdquo; to insert: &ldquo;periodical inspections of all such homes by health authorities and their officers and also provide for&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that those of us who live in rural areas particularly have not any great experience of homes such as are covered by this Bill.  The Minister, on Committee Stage, objected to an amendment somewhat similar to this because he did not feel there was any need for such inspection as is envisaged by this amendment.  I read&mdash;I believe it was in the Press about four weeks ago&mdash;a letter purporting to come from the Irish Housewives Association in which it was stated by the Secretary that they had sent to the Minister, or were about to send to him, certain facts relating <Col N="1635" /> to difficulties in homes, which they felt should be inspected and should be investigated. It is because of the fact that such evidence is said to have been made available to the Minister that we felt that we should re-table our amendment on this Stage, to give the Minister, if he wishes, an opportunity of including in the Bill, before it becomes law, some regulations that would deter, in some way, by the mere fact of its being in the Bill, such happenings.  It is rather unreasonable to say that until such report reaches the Minister an inspection will not take place.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister nobody wants to make this Bill so difficult and so drastic as to stop the type of home, which is at present rendering such good service to people who are mainly in need of food, shelter and care, without particular medical attention. Nevertheless there could be, and apparently are, if the Irish Housewives Association are to be believed, in the city of Dublin, some homes which do need inspection.  I would appeal to the Minister in the interest of making this a good Bill, to include in it the right of inspection.  The mere fact of its inclusion in the Bill, even if it is never used, will be a deterrent and will put an obligation on those running such homes to keep them in such condition and to give the people in their charge such treatment as will be worthy of houses called homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Kyne mentioned the letter from the Irish Housewives Association which appeared in the <i>Evening Press</i> on 24th March last in which it was stated that in 1958, when the Irish Housewives Association first brought this matter to the Minister's attention, one of their members reported three cases, evidence of which she was prepared to give to the Minister, if called upon to do so.  There then followed a statement of three instances where it was alleged abuses had occurred.  May I say, if those statements had been substantiated by the Irish Housewives Association, I would certainly have been very greatly relieved in my mind <Col N="1636" /> in dealing with the problem.  I would then have had, for the first time, some definite evidence produced by a responsible body, evidence which would demonstrate, to my satisfaction at any rate, that on the facts a real case might be made for inspection before registration, rather than take the line proposed in the Bill and defer such a visitation to premises, as the commissioning of an official to inspect and to probe into the conduct of them and the treatment of patients in them only when a complaint had been received.</P>
      <P>My feeling in relation to this whole question of inspection is that one or two solitary cases are certainly regrettable but not conclusive.  However, it might be, as I said, that it would have given me some satisfaction if people had come along and demonstrated that these abuses really existed.  And, even if there had been only one or two, I might have been moved to ask the House to give me power to require inspection, though I would have done that with a great deal of hesitation, because in the exercise of such power I would be using the whole apparatus of the State to go into premises and probe into the conduct by people of their business&mdash;and this merely on the fact that one or two instances of abuse had emerged.</P>
      <P>There are a considerable number of these homes throughout the country and it is admitted by everybody that in the great majority of cases, at any rate, they are performing a useful public service.  As I said, if the existence of abuses had been demonstrated to me I think I would, on the whole, have said: &ldquo;Well, since the evidence has been adduced, we will have an inspection".  I would have done that with a great deal of hesitation, however, for the reason I have mentioned. I do not think we should have the equivalent almost of a Gestapo, walking without notice into a person's premises, into a house in which people are being looked after, and probing and investigating those premises from roof to cellar.  That, very regretfully, would have been my position had evidence been adduced.  The fact of the matter is that no evidence was adduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> This Association wrote to the Minister for Health, not in 1958, as they have said in this letter to the <i>Evening Press,</i> but on 19th April, 1960.  I had better put their communication on the records of the House.  It is written as from the Irish Housewives Association, 19 Ely Place, and it is dated 19th April, 1960.  It is addressed to the Minister for Health, Custom House, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>We enclose a short statement on the need for the registration of Nursing Homes and we should be grateful if you would receive a deputation to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>Our Association is seriously concerned by persistent reports of unsatisfactory conditions in nursing homes and we have several cases which we can use as evidence of the need for such registration.</P>
    <P>We know you will appreciate our difficulties in mentioning names of Homes or patients but we ask you to trust out integrity as a nonprofit making Association with a long record of service to the public and to grant us the favour of an interview.</P>
    <P>Certainly housewives do not seem to lack appreciation of their due need of self-praise.  But what evidence can there be when even the name of the place where the abuse is alleged to exist cannot be stated and they are not prepared to mention the name of the person who gave them the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Following that letter they were seen by my officers on 20th May, 1960.  At the meeting they tendered a statement on their own headed paper saying:</P>
      <P>NURSING HOMES 1.</P>
      <P>Nursing Home owned by a woman not a nurse, catering for patients who require general nursing as well as old people requiring care. Number of patients about 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That might be case No. 1 in their letter to the <i>Evening Press</i> on 24th March <Col N="1638" /> last.  In the Press the home is described as&mdash;</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;home&rdquo; run by a retired nurse, who had entire charge of five bedridden elderly patients, with the help of a charwoman for two hours each day.</P>
    <P>In the letter to my Department it is a home owned by a woman not a nurse, so there would appear to be a discrepancy between their two accounts of this particular case,</P>
    <P>The second reference is a&mdash;</P>
    <P>Nursing Home catering for seven patients in small private house run entirely by the owner, a trained nurse aged 79.  Only help employed was a charwoman....</P>
    <P>It occurs to me now reading both, that perhaps their No. 1 case in one letter has become their No. 2 case in the other, and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>CASE No. 3:</P>
    <P>Nursing Home catering for general cases and old people.  Aged patient kept in room under stairs with no window, wire netting.  Fees from 10 guineas downwards.</P>
    <P>That appears in the letter to the <i>Evening Press</i> as&mdash;</P>
    <P>A home where an elderly patient was in a &ldquo;room&rdquo; under the stairs, with no window.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of wire or anything else in the letter to the Press.  I grant you these would be deplorable cases, provided it were demonstrated that they in fact existed.  The ladies on this deputation came in and saw my officers.  They discussed the whole matter with them and the record of the meeting shows that they left, apparently, without mentioning where these homes were which they alleged ought to be inspected, and without mentioning the names of their informants. Despite what the Honorary Secretaries of this Association said in their letter to the <i>Evening Press</i> of 24th March, of this year, I do not think there was any evidence adduced at that interview which would justify me coming to the House and asking the House to empower <Col N="1639" /> local authorities to inspect every nursing home in the State.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter, as I have said, I declined to do that. Instead, I brought in this Bill which, let me say, is an empirical measure. It is, I think, as far as I am justified in going on the basis of the information given to me, and on what I know, so far, about this problem.  It is not impossible that, when this Bill becomes operative, some evidence may become available to us, which will justify the Oireachtas in meeting to some extent the views expressed here and elsewhere as to the need for inspection. Until the need for that inspection, however, has been fully demonstrated we are not, I think, justified in going further than we go in this Bill.  I hope, therefore, that the House will reject the amendment and allow the Bill to pass through its final Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has actually made the case in his speech as to why this amendment was put forward by the Labour Party.  He admits that, if the claims made in the letter were substantiated, he would seriously consider the amendment, or a similar amendment introduced by himself, even at this late stage.  I must accept the fact that the statements made by the Housewives Association have not been substantiated.  This amendment was put in merely to give the Minister an opportunity of explaining, as he has done, whether or not these charges were made, whether or not they were investigated and what were the results. I am satisfied from what the Minister has said that on the evidence he has, he probably would not be justified in accepting the amendment and, accordingly, I am withdrawing it.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I explained the section on the last occasion.  It arises because the existing law does not fit in with the operations of the Land Commission dealing with local authorities for rating purposes. Under the law as it stands, to get exemption from rates from a local authority in respect of buildings, the owner must prove that he let the buildings or made an attempt to let them and that they were vacant. Obviously, this would be impracticable for the Land Commission to do. They have these buildings for only relatively short periods.  The lettings would give rise to preferential treatment claims in resale schemes.  It is for this purpose this section is introduced. The local authority will not lose revenue, in as much as immediately the scheme is prepared by the Land Commission and the tenant moves into the holding and takes possession of the portion allotted to him, he would be liable for rates to the local authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow the Land Commission in suitable cases to issue a general consent to a particular type of sub-division. There is, for example, an existing procedure under which local authorities acquiring sites for labourers' cottages may act under a general consent given to them by the Land Commission so that, within certain reasonable limits, they may carry out their own sub-divisions. I want to make sure that <Col N="1641" /> this sensible piece of administrative co-operation can continue.  In this way we hope, while maintaining the essential features of control, to eliminate mere red tape as far as practicable. That is the purpose of this amendment. Where, for instance, somebody buys a portion of building land that would entail consent to several sub-divisions, we can under this amendment give general permission.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;and may be subject to such conditions (if any) as the Land Commission think fit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For many years past, it has been the common practice of the Land Commission to attach appropriate conditions to sub-division consents, such as partial redemption of annuities and consolidation with other lands as circumstances require.  Up to the present the power to attach such conditions to the giving of consents has been implicit in the various statutory provisions in the Land Acts.  Section 12 is intended as an up-to-date comprehensive provision and it seems advisable to take this opportunity of legislating explicitly on this point of attaching conditions to consents to sub-divisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24b.</P>
      <P>In page 8, after subsection (1) to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The powers of the Land Commission under this section shall be so exercised as to prevent the creation or continuance of holdings which, in the opinion of the Land Commission, are not economic holdings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that landowners might fear that this sub-division control could be used arbitrarily against them.  While I do not concede there is any evidence from past experience to justify such fears, I am prepared to write in a statutory criterion based on the avoidance of uneconomic holdings.  The effect of this amendment will be that the Land Commission will be unable, for example, to prevent a man dividing his land between his two sons if he gives each of them an economic holding. It is in relief of landowners; otherwise, the law could be interpreted as meaning that the Land Commission could arbitrarily prevent a man with 300 acres of land giving 150 acres each to his two sons.  In other words, under this provision, at law <Col N="1643" /> the Land Commission could not withhold their consent unless the effect of consent would be to create uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Running through this whole section is that fear of the Land Commission in regard to the creation of uneconomic holdings.  Might I suggest that that day is completely past? Who wants today to create an uneconomic holding?  Even holdings that by some people's standards would be adjudged economic are being deserted all over the country.  Anybody thinking along those lines about the danger of the reestablishment of small, uneconomic holdings is years behind the times.  The picture I see emerging in regard to land occupation is that holdings are being sold to such an extent that either private individuals or the State will have to step in and purchase them on a big scale for the purpose of consolidation or creating larger farms.  I believe we are at the commencement of an era where we are reverting to the situation that existed during the early years of Grattan's Parliament when a farmer farmed a whole townland and there was nobody but the one family there. The Minister must be as well aware of that in his locality as I am in my part of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small holding is no longer able to produce the income that will keep the youngsters on the land.  It is the youngsters we want to keep on the land.  The old pattern was that, whether a man had two, three or ten sons, all of them emigrated or found a job elsewhere except one who was kept for the land, in most cases the youngest.  Now what we Deputies are hearing from all over the place is: &ldquo;I reared three sons and I cannot get even one of them to stay on the land.&rdquo; Only recently I heard of a man in Ballinrobe who has a very comfortable, well-stocked farm with a valuation of about £30, if not more, and who could not induce any of his four sons to stay on the land.  They told him the land was not worth bothering about, that they never saw anything but their mother and father in slavery <Col N="1644" /> on the land and that they did not intend to go in for that kind of life.</P>
    <P>There is no need, therefore, for the Minister to push this amendment. There is no danger in the world of sub-division that would call for the intervention of the Land Commission in regard to the creation of uneconomic holdings.  All we are doing here is locking the stable door after the horse has gone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is an addition to a list of amendments which has already been submitted to the House.  I do not know whom the Minister and his Department think they are deluding by producing this smokescreen of amendments seeking to suggest they will help in any way to remedy the serious situation that exists today in rural Ireland.  Is the Minister seriously putting before the House an amendment to put an end to sub-letting where there is a danger of creating uneconomic holdings?  Is it not a fact that at the present time what the Minister should be doing is trying to prevent the gobbling up and the grabbing of all the holdings in a locality by local gombeen men.  Instead of hitting the gombeen man, the Minister pretends to this House that he is protecting the small farmer.  Deputy Blowick is quite right when he states we are reverting to the situation as it was in years gone by when one farmer farmed a townland.  At the rate things are going, it will not be long before one rancher will farm a parish and there is nothing whatever in this section to prevent such an occurrence.  The Minister is bringing in an amendment that seeks to suggest that a farmer of 25 to 30 acres of land is likely to be such a dangerous lunatic as to attempt to divide that between two or three sons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister suggest that if a farmer has 300 acres and wants to divide them between his two sons, giving them 150 acres each, this amendment will make his passage easier in that regard?  In what way is it difficult at the moment for such a farmer of 300 acres of land to divide that between his two sons and give them 150 acres each?  In what way is <Col N="1645" /> the Land Commission geared to make it awkward for such a farmer to carry out that purpose?  There is no impediment in the Land Acts that I know of that would hinder a farmer with such a desirable intention.  I do not pose as an expert on the Land Acts but if there is any section in the Land Acts that makes it difficult for a large farmer with 300 or 400 acres to divide such a holding into economic units, I should like the Minister to let us know in what Act that section is to be found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the two previous speakers on this amendment and if they are not very badly informed or innocent people, they must come from an extraordinary part of the country, if we are to believe what they have said.  I come from an area in which the land is not of the same quality as that of the areas from which the other two Deputies come. Were it not for the fact that some regulations exist to prevent it from happening, every farmer, no matter how small, would have his holding divided. Some regulation must not only be made but must be strictly enforced if we are not to go back to the old days which immediately followed the Famine when everybody carved up his holding into all the pieces he desired and his sons and daughters tried to exist on these little parcels of land.</P>
      <P>I know it is perfectly fair that anybody who wants a site for a house or a holding should get it.  That right should be retained for everybody who wishes to take advantage of it but I cannot stand idly by and accept that a holding should be carved up into three or four acres, because, bad as the position is now, that would make it two or three times worse.  I do not agree that people are running away from these lands either in Roscommon or South Mayo and certainly not in North Mayo where land was never one-quarter the price it is now.  If the land is so valueless in Roscommon and South Mayo it is a wonder they are holding it up until they get a colossal price for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am completely on the side of the Minister in this step.  I see no reason <Col N="1646" /> for preventing any farmer from dividing his land into two or even five economic holdings provided it is shown that they are holdings which will maintain the people on them and not that they will be holdings which the people will have to maintain.  It is quite possible that a 40-acre holding could be divided into two holdings and that the persons obtaining them could have economic holdings but it is also possible that a 500-acre holding would not be worth dividing into two holdings.  The matter has to be treated in a commonsense way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that a farmer with, say, a 400-acre holding, can subdivide that into four or five suitable portions to provide economic holdings for each member of his family?  The problem I see is that where very small portions of land are made available there is usually one extensive farmer in the area who is likely to buy up all the small portions.  That is likely to have a serious effect on the local small uneconomic holders who are anxious to purchase but are not in a position to compete with the well-off extensive farmer with very considerable financial resources.  We have many owners of uneconomic holdings of 12 or 14-acres. Such an owner may have 10 acres around his house and four acres a mile away.  If he desires to dispose of the four acres he should be permitted to do so provided the purchaser is a local smallholder.  That is to say that the purchaser will also be an uneconomic holder.  I should like to hear more from the Minister in this regard because very great difficulties will present themselves as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if there has been any great number of applications for subdivision where the result would be the creation of uneconomic holdings?  What I have in mind is the type of case the Minister has in mind in bringing in these amendments, to stop the creation of uneconomic holdings, where a farmer with £10, £12 or £15 valuation wants to make two holdings.  Since I left the <Col N="1647" /> Land Commission in 1957 has there even been one application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been several applications which would result in the creation of at least one economic holding if they were allowed to go through.  Down through the years one of the fairly regular propositions was not alone in regard to a bit of land which was bought, but also if a man could get away with dividing a fairly substantial holding which would result in one of his own sons getting on the Land Commission roll.  And that was done regularly down through the years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to my personal knowledge.</P>
      <P>I should like Deputies to consider this proposition for a moment.  What is the point or sense of trying to enlarge uneconomic holdings unless at the same time you take corresponding control against subdivision?  It is absurd to have the one without the other.  Deputy McQuillan wants to know what law provides against sub-letting. This very Bill provides against it.  Under this Bill all types of title are brought in, in the provision against subletting and subdivision, for the first time.  In former cases, where the annuity was brought over, there was the right under the 1923 Act to split it up any way desired and where that was done uneconomic units were created.  The purpose of this sub-section is to prevent that, although, as I pointed out to Deputies, this is in relief of the landowner.  Deputy McQuillan may have the view that we are bringing these amendments in for fun but since the Second Reading of the Bill, I have received representations from different organisations, including one purporting to represent landowners.  It is my duty to listen to every side of the story.  It was pointed out that the section as it stood could be interpreted as giving the Land Commission power to refuse sub-division arbitrarily in any case whether there was sufficient land being divided or sold off the parent holding to create uneconomic holdings, or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> This amendment is put forward to clarify that position, to make it clear that the Land Commission cannot unreasonably refuse permission for sub-division where it will not result in the creation of uneconomic units.  Deputy Blowick and other Deputies can be assured that the Land Commission have had quite a few cases during the last year in which congests were refused and in which if they had been granted uneconomic units would have been created.</P>
    <P>So far as Deputy Blowick's suggestion about the desertion of the land is concerned, I can assure the Deputy &mdash;indeed, no assurance should be required by him or any Deputy representing a western constituency&mdash;that there is no dearth of applicants for land.  There are 40 of them for every acre the Land Commission may be able to acquire throughout the length and breadth of the land.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Deputy says that they are not prepared to exist on the smaller units on which their parents or grandparents lived, I entirely agree with him.  The purpose of this Bill is to build up the units occupied by the people living by farming and to get them away from what we call subsistence farming.</P>
    <P>As for Deputy McQuillan's gombeen man, if he is seriously concerned with him, he should support sections 12 and 34 of this Bill which are designed to deal with that problem and to strengthen the hands of the Land Commission in getting these lands into the Land Commission machine for the building up of these uneconomic units of which there are so many, particularly in the congested areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a number of small holdings in an area, which are on the borderline between what might be described as economic and what might be described as uneconomic. There may be a group of farmers who are anxious to acquire a holding which might be for sale in the vicinity.  Any one of them might not be able to purchase the holding on his own but two or three farmers might wish to combine to purchase it. I am sure the Minister has had experience <Col N="1649" /> of such cases.  There may not be a big farm in the locality which could be acquired for the relief of their congestion and it would be most unlikely that the Land Commission would ever move into the area.</P>
      <P>Having given that picture of the type of case I am speaking of, I shall come now to the case where one of the holdings becomes derelict and is put up for sale and two or three farmers combine to buy it for the relief of their own congestion at no cost to the State. These people should be assisted.  I assure the Minister that the question that he has brought up now will frighten people from attempting to buy a farm in such circumstances.  He is doing more harm than good.  As far as the prevention of the creation of uneconomic holdings is concerned, I am all with the Minister and with the Bill, but I am greatly afraid that this section will do immense damage.  The Minister should make it quite clear that where people propose to relieve their own congestion at their own expense, in an area to which it would be most unlikely that the Land Commission would come, they will get every encouragement.  The Minister should make a firm statement here and now that such effort on the part of local farmers will be assisted by the Land Commission instead of being impeded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that if the power which the Minister says he needs is really necessary, we should give it to him in this Bill.  I suppose there is no point in asking the Minister at this stage to withdraw the Bill and to reintroduce it?</P>

      <P>Any similarity between the Bill when passed, even with only the Minister's amendments, and the Bill as it is now will be purely accidental. There has never been a Bill in respect of which so many amendments were brought in by a Minister. I am not blaming the Minister.  Representations have been made to him as a result of which he has tried to remedy <Col N="1650" /> the Bill where he thought that should be done.  That proves that, no matter how long it took to prepare the Bill, the Bill was introduced too soon.  The Minister should have waited until the Bill could have been introduced in some other form.  I am sure the next printing of the Bill will be twice the size of this printing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We will only have to follow the Bill as we go along.  If the Minister needs the power, we should not prevent his getting it.</P>
      <P>I have a distinct recollection of a case where a person had a 64 acre farm.  His son was getting married. He applied to the Land Commission for permission to give 14 acres of that land to the son.  The son wanted to build a house on it.  They were intensive farmers, engaging in market gardening, and so on.  For a long time, permission was refused.  I wonder if that is the way that things should be done or is it intended in future to refuse permission in cases like that. It was stated that it would be creating another uneconomic holding but that was not so.  The boy proved himself, having got the permission, well able to live off the 14 acres by the use he made of it.</P>
      <P>There is the case of a man who is, say, a farm worker, who has been working on a farm all his life and who managers to get enough money to buy a farm and a small farm comes up for sale in the locality.  He will not be allowed to buy it.  The Land Commission will not sanction the sale to him on the grounds that it will create an uneconomic holding.  He is a landless man.  I consider that that is a wrong attitude on the part of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other case, where people are in possession of holdings.  I do not know how the Minister proposes to deal with it.  There is a holding that I know of comprising slightly over eight acres.  The county council carried out road widening and took one and a half acres of the centre of the holding.  The farmer gave half an acre <Col N="1651" /> to the county council to build a cottage for his son on it.  The father died. Last week an inspector of the Land Commission called to the widow, who was ill, to tell her that she was not working the land properly and that it would be taken from her.  I do not know how the Minister would deal with that sort of case.  If it is not possible under the Bill to prevent that sort of case arising, the Minister would be much better without the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 24b let me put this case to the Minister: very often in the past an addition was made to a holding.  The addition might have been two or three miles from the holding.  The person got it in days gone by, in the time of the Congested Districts Board.  Now all his family have left and he with his wife are in the same position as they were when they got married, the two of them living alone.  Very often the old person is not in a position to look after the addition which is at a distance from the main holding.  In other cases he may want the price of it.  He does not want to sell the entire holding, only the addition.  He may wish to work the original holding.  Would the <Col N="1652" /> Minister accept an amendment on Report Stage from me to meet that type of case?  I can see the undesirability of the Land Commission allowing subdivision in that case because it is quite possible that a young man might buy the addition and build a house on it and create an uneconomic holding and the original holding could create a second one.</P>
      <P>Where a local person buys the addition for consolidation with his own holding, would the Minister consider an amendment whereby a condition would attach to the folio that in the event of that holding ever being sold the Land Commission would not in any circumstances ever give a further addition to it?  What would be wrong with such procedure?</P>

I have no doubt that when the chance arrives, those constituents will look after them in the proper way.  This is a scandalous attitude to a Bill brought in to help people in the congested areas.  While it is true there are more pages of amendments than there are in the Bill itself, with the exception of the few very good amendments put down by the Minister, all the others have been put down by auctioneers and their agents with the express purpose of holding up the passage of this Bill until foreigners have come along to buy up all the available land in the country.</P>

There is not one iota of principle change in the Bill because of these amendments which will improve it as a result of our study and experience and of representations made to us to make certain provisions quite clear to all and sundry concerned with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is all right for Deputy Tully and others to pose a situation where somebody gets 14 acres and where he, because of his special skills, or because of the judicious use by him of machinery, has been able to make a good living on the land.  Deputy Tully forgets what may happen to an individual occupying that land after the original holder is dead and gone.  The Land Commission must look to the type of person who will succeed the original holder so as to avoid the possibility of the fragmentation of land. Perhaps a new person, a young married man who has not the same skills as his predecessor, may succeed to the holding.  He might not be able to make the same good living out of the 14 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to provide overall control of subdivision.  The whole effort of endeavouring to build up land units would be an absurdity if we did not, at the other end, control the fragmentation or subdivision of lands.  If Deputy Blowick has read and understands amendment No. 24b, he would see its implementation would be in ease of the very people of whom he speaks.  If, as he suggests, three people decide to buy a farm and divide it among themselves &mdash; I agree with Deputy Leneghan that co-operation has not got to that degree in the part of the country from which I come &mdash; the Land Commission would, of course, agree to a subdivision because <Col N="1654" /> it would build up the units of the group of farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of this amendment&mdash;to make it quite clear that the aim is to stop the creation of uneconomic units.  In the case posed by Deputy Blowick, the group of farmers would not be creating uneconomic units.  These three farmers would be building up their own units to economic levels.  That is made quite clear in the previous amendment accepted by the House.</P>
    <P>As far as the giving of additions to holdings is concerned, the Land Commission in recent years have been making the distance between the holding and the addition shorter.  That has been my experience.  While the Land Commission are very slow, and obviously they should be slow, in allowing people to sell additions which they have been given at very great expense to the taxpayers, if there is a special case to be made involving family circumstances, or if the disposal of the addition would help to consolidate another small holding in the area, the Land Commission would not withhold consent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but every case must hang by its own tail.  Naturally, the Land Commission must be very slow to allow somebody who has got an addition to go out on the open market and cash in by selling that addition.  It is only when special family circumstances apply, or where the addition will help relieve the congestion of another tenant in the area, that the Land Commission will give consent. That has been, and I am sure, will be, the practice.  The whole purpose of the amendment is as I have said: it is necessary because of the changes in the law that will take place under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like it to go on record that from my experience over a number of years the Land Commission have been reasonable and have acted in a humane manner in giving consideration to special circumstances of individual families who have asked for permission to sell portions <Col N="1655" /> of small holdings because of ill-health or other changed conditions.  In the Midlands, at any rate, the Land Commission have used very wise discretion. If I had a guarantee from the Minister that the sympathetic consideration shown by the Land Commission in the past in this respect would continue, I should have no objection to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 8, line 30, to delete &ldquo;letting, subletting or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is that the Minister has brought into the Bill a rather sweeping wording.  I do not know if he intends that the Bill, if passed, shall apply as I have read it, but, as I see it, if passed without amendment, it means that all conacre lettings, all convenience lettings, even where one brother obliges another or a father obliges a son, are subject to the granting of Land Commission permission. This is a wholly unwarranted intrusion into the private affairs of every landowner.</P>
      <P>From time to time I admit that we have Deputies here who were never any nearer to a holding than to pass by the road and look in, probably taking pity on the unfortunate serfs inside and pharisaically thanking God they were not in that class.  I have heard Deputies of that type making an outcry about the letting of land without knowing what they were talking about and on a few occasions I had to correct them, both on the Minister's side and on this side of the House.  It was rather pathetic to have them wasting the time of the House talking of something of which it was quite clear they knew nothing.  If that kind of attitude has prompted this Bill, I think the Minister is very foolish to allow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First he is giving a power to the Land Commission which will clutter them up.  They cannot possibly enforce it without putting a Land Commission inspector into every parish.  Secondly, I do not see why the Minister is treating <Col N="1657" /> the farmers in this way.  If a shopkeeper lets his shop or a tradesman his workshop, there is no outcry, but if the farmer lets his land, that is a different matter.  If he meets with a run of bad luck, which very often happens through disease of stock, and his financial circumstances become poorer, he may find he has no way of getting an income from his land except to let it to somebody able to stock it.  I see nothing wrong with that and it is nothing short of impertinence for anybody to criticise it.  It would be different if he were wasting something but if Deputy Flanagan, for instance, has a holding which for some reason or other he is not able to work and asks me to take it and work it, I can assure you that, because I pay him a substantial conacre rent, that land will produce for me.  Otherwise, I would not take it. Yet, I have heard Deputies making fools of themselves trying to build up an idea that any farmer who lets his land in conacre is some kind of criminal, worse than the Mau-Mau in Africa.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister has swallowed that nonsense because in this section he wants to give the Land Commission power to stop all letting, or perhaps he has not a grasp of the situation.  It is impertinent for anybody to interfere in somebody's business to that extent; it is positively criminal for the State to take on that form of interference with farmers.  The only place I have heard of that being done is in Russia where we heard talk of virgin lands since the time of that amiable character, Joe Stalin.  It is completely wrong.  One would imagine the farmer got the land from the State as a free gift and that he is prepared to sell the soil off it down to the rock when in fact he inherited it from his parents or bought it with his own hard-earned money.  It is his own property. The word &ldquo;impertinent&rdquo; is not sufficient to describe it if the State steps in in this way, beyond what is called for in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <P>I was wondering how long Deputy Blowick could go on without bringing in Stalin or Russia <Col N="1658" /> or setting up a political Aunt Sally for the purpose of knocking it down.  This section of this Bill does not control conacre letting.  Conacre lettings were always outside the Land Acts since the Decies Act of 1860.  They are not lettings. They are the giving of a temporary easement.</P>

      <P>According to Cherry's Irish Land Law and Land Purchase Acts, pp. 360-1, 3rd Edition:</P>
      <P>A usage prevails in Ireland of letting small portions of land seldom containing less than a rood, or more than an acre in each lot, at a stipulated price for a single crop of potatoes or other tillage, called conacre or quarter ground.  This creates no tenancy but is simply a sale of a profit out of the land and a temporary easement.</P>

      <P>It is no such thing. The practice was to let these small portions, but that does not take away from the legal principle of conacre lettings being outside the Land Acts as they have always been held to be. After all this Balaclava about the letting of land, it is surprising to me if Deputy Blowick is unaware that any <Col N="1659" /> letting of land subject to the Land Acts, for a year or more, without the consent of the Land Commission, is void.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy chapter and verse for that if he requires it.  Indeed, down through the years there were many cases where, in fact, the consent of the Land Commission was sought and given to the letting of land, for temporary family reasons or purposes, for a period of perhaps three, four or five years.  This section provides, as was the law before, that the consent of the Land Commission to the letting of land for more than 11 months will be necessary in the future. There would be no real reason for that except for the fact that under this Bill in addition to lands coming in under the Land Acts, land held under fee farm grants, and land in respect of which annuities were redeemed will be covered.  In other words, this will cover all the agricultural land in the country. This section will make it clear that all land, no matter how held, with the exceptions provided in the amendment, will be subject to this law which has been there down through the years. This section does not deal with conacre lettings, nor is there any intention of interfering with conacre lettings.</P>

In this case, land held under fee farm grants and other lands were not subject to the general rule to which I have referred.

      <P>The Minister tells us this was the law in the past, or words to that effect.  It was no such thing, and furthermore I do not care what definition he has got out of Cherry.  This subsection is most sweeping.  It puts the lid on any court decision and on any legislation passed in the House of Commons or here.  Subsection (1) states in very bald and ruthless terms:</P>
      <P>An agricultural holding shall not be let, sublet or subdivided without the consent in writing of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister think he is talking to a crowd of fools when he calmly <Col N="1661" /> reads out a court decision from Cherry and asks us to believe that this section will not over-rule everything?  The Bill is pickled through and through with sections which are doing nothing but making it quite clear that the decision of the Land Commission, regardless of previous court decisions given against them, will prevail.  Even Lord Clanrickarde did not seek anything like subsection (1) of section 12. It is a most damnable and unwarranted interference.  If the Minister is so concerned about conacre farms, let him accept my amendment, which does not interfere with the general purpose of the Bill and, at the same time, does not give the Land Commission this extraordinary power.  It seems to me that the Land Commission want&mdash;if the Land Commission advised the Minister to include the subsection&mdash; to engage in work they were never intended to do.</P>

      <P>This is a very serious subsection and a very serious section.  It is a very important amendment <Col N="1662" /> we are dealing with, more particularly in view of the fact that the Minister states that this question of letting does not include ordinary conacre letting.  The Minister has gone further&mdash;and I feel from my limited knowledge of the law that he is correct &mdash;and stated that if a person wants legally to set a portion of land, he cannot do so, in the present circumstances, without the consent of the Land Commission, if he wants to set it for a period of one year or more. Therefore, it is common practice in this country to set land for periods of 11 months.  That is how the 11 months conacre system arose.  If we want to set for a period of 12 months, we must have the consent of the Land Commission for such a conacre letting.  In order to avoid that, the practice, in every part of the country today, is to set for a period of 11 months.</P>
      <P>It is a very serious matter that the permission of the Land Commission must be sought in relation to land lettings.  There is very little use in the Minister's telling us that conacre lettings are not covered by the Land Commission restriction on lettings.  If a case is contested in the courts somebody may produce a copy of the Official Report of the proceedings here this evening and say to the judge or the justice: &ldquo;Conacre lettings are not in any way restricted and here is a copy of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann which indicates the expression of opinion by the Minister.&rdquo;  No judge or justice when administering the law will act on the opinion of a Minister or a Deputy but on what is in the Act.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this Bill to make it clear beyond all shadow of doubt that conacre lettings and temporary lettings are excluded from the terms of this section.  None of us doubt the Minister but those of us who know the law are aware that conacre lettings are not excluded by this section and the sub-section to which Deputy Blowick refers may have a very serious bearing on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may happen that the Land Commission may take serious action against a person who has conacred his lands.  When such serious action is taken by the Land Commission it will be of no avail to quote what the <Col N="1663" /> Minister said here because there is nothing in the section excluding conacre lettings.  I am inclined to agree with what Deputy Blowick and other Deputies who have spoken on this matter had to say.  It is a very serious trespass and infringement on the rights of any farmer or smallholder or landowner to do what he or she please with his or her land.</P>
    <P>For a long time, we have cherished the right of free sale in this country. We have cherished the right of a person to put up his holding, large or small, and to offer it to the public for the highest bid.  There must be conacre lettings for the convenience of people who, because of financial or domestic circumstances, are not in a position to work their lands for their own use.  If we set land for a root crop then the person who takes that land must manure it for the root crop and he expects to get the land the following year so as to get the benefit of the manuring for his corn crop.</P>
    <P>How is the difficulty to be overcome? The ground must be set because of domestic or financial necessity. A person may pay up to £20 an acre for conacre.  When he takes the land for 11 months he will put into it his work, his time and his seeds but, in addition, it will be richly manured at his own expense.  He will want a good root crop&mdash;potatoes, beet, mangolds or turnips&mdash;but the reason he will richly manure the land for the root crop is to have the benefit of it for his corn crop in the following year.</P>
    <P>A person will hesitate considerably before richly manuring soil if he has not any guarantee that he will get the land the following year.  That is why it is common practice with auctioneers and with people setting land to set it for a two-year period.  How is the problem to be resolved?  The land can perfectly legally be set for two periods of 11 months each and the person gives clear possession of the land to the owner for two months of the two years.  Not alone is the question of conacre lettings serious for the person who takes land but it is of the <Col N="1664" /> greatest importance for people who find it an absolute necessity to set their lands.</P>
    <P>I suppose no profession more than the auctioneering profession has rendered greater service to people who must set their lands.  They advise and co-operate with them and they get the best possible price for those requiring land by conacre.  If the letting of land is to be prevented then the very small holder and the landless man will be very badly hit.  This is a very important and urgent matter and the Minister should seriously reconsider it.</P>
    <P>It is a very drastic step to prevent a person from setting his or her lands except with the permission of the Land Commission.  Consider the shopkeeper. There may be certain covenants in his leases so that he may have to consult his ground landlord but if he is the owner of his shop he may sell it to whomsoever he wishes.  A blacksmith may set his forge to whomsoever he likes when he retires.</P>

      <P>Take a carpenter who retires or who, through ill-health, cannot carry on his business. There is nothing to stop him from setting his workshop, his tools and his equipment, if he so desires.  The same may be said in respect of a garage, a hairdressing saloon, and so on.  A doctor may sublet his surgery to another member of the profession, if he so desires, as can also a dentist.  However, the farmer, the smallholder, the main producer&mdash;those who are producing food for man and beast&mdash;may not do so.  The rights they have enjoyed up to this are now being taken from them.  The matter is left to a group of officials in Dublin who do not seem to have a thorough grasp of the situation or to have considered the significance of the manuring of conacre land.  That is why I think that in principle this is a wrong step and that very serious consideration should be given to the question of the letting of these lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister tell us what objection he has to putting in either Deputy Blowick's amendment or a short <Col N="1665" /> amendment of his own, and God knows he has put in enough.  He has drastically changed the face of the Bill.  Why then can he not put in a few lines of an amendment to clarify the legal position, so that the problem will not arise in court later on, when the Minister may be quoted, and when any justice will be bound to say: &ldquo;That is not in the Act and I can only go on what is in the Act&rdquo;?  There is nothing in this Act which says that permission to conacre land is necessary, and I think it should be cleared of all doubts so that everybody will be satisfied and so that it will be very clear to the legal profession, to the auctioncering profession, and, above all, to the parties themselves.</P>
    <P>We have the case of widows who are anxious to hold on to their land until their families come of age.  It is absolutely necessary for such people to set land.  This is something which we should very fully and very seriously debate. The Minister tells us that he has been receiving deputations and meeting parties interested in this Land Bill.  I find it hard to believe that the Minister has met any deputation or organisation of landowners who would not mention to him the right to conacre or to set land without the consent of the Land Commission.  The Minister has been very generous in his solemn guarantees by word that conacre sales are not included.  We may take it then that if grass sales, meadowing sales and hay sales on the land are not included, the smallholder will not have to obtain permission to set his grazing, because a grazing letting for a period of 11 months does not, I am sure, require the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I can foresee difficulties arising when the Bill does not clearly state&mdash;and it does not clearly state&mdash;that for the purpose of this section, all 11-months conacre lettings and temporary lettings for domestic and other reasons, which must be undertaken by the owners, are excluded.  In order to remove all doubts, I would ask the Minister to introduce, on Report Stage, an amendment which will make this clear.  For the reasons stated, I make a very serious and genuine appeal to the <Col N="1666" /> Minister to make the Bill easy for everybody, to make it easy for himself, for the professions who will be dealing with this matter and for all concerned to understand the law in relation to this matter.  As it stands, it is very clearly stated in the explanatory memorandum that letting and sub-letting of all agricultural land in the State shall be subject to Land Commission consent. It does not say &ldquo;with the exception of conacre or temporary conveyances.&rdquo; For that reason, I would ask the Minister to be a little more generous and helpful in this matter.  I am sure he can, and I am sure his advisers can, very easily advise him as to how this difficulty can be overcome, by the insertion of a short suitable amendment which will be very readily accepted by this side of the House, in order to clarify the position.</P>

      <P>There is no good in the Minister trying to convince us that this section is a re-enactment of anything. I want to tell the Minister equally that the precedent he is setting in this section is all cod.  If that section is let through in its present form, the Minister knows perfectly well, as a competent lawyer, that the section is sufficiently wide as to upset completely any precedent he may quote for it or any suggestion he may make in respect of the Decies Act.  That section is broad enough of interpretation to include any type of letting, and no matter what was excluded previous to this Bill, let the Minister not try to cod a colleague in law anyway that this section is a complete change of power and a complete change of purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what has happened to our thinking on Land Commission problems in this House over the number of years I have been in it.  The Land Commission have a unique record.  I suppose they are the longest sitting commission in any part of the world.  They were designed for a purpose that was meant to be transitory and their main purpose was to get the title and the rights into the hands of the tenant farmers of Ireland.  It was to get those rights on the historic basis of free sale, fixity of tenure and fair rent. We know that there have been so <Col N="1667" /> many deviations, variations, extensions and changes in the annuity system that we never know at what projected moment in the future any holder may hope to be a freeholder. But under this section, let the Minister not try to prevaricate.  Under this section in its present form, the Minister is taking powers which I very much doubt he can constitutionally take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has considered the constitutional implications of this bald and complete negation of rights just on the whim of the Land Commission. Our experience of the Land Commission and their whims is such that to give them any more power at all is only slowing down this cumbersome machine which we are trying to operate.  I wonder has the Minister referred this matter to the Attorney General's office at all on the issue of its constitutionality or otherwise, because this is a complete invasion of basic liberty of the citizens of this country.  Let nobody try to say anything else.  Arbitrarily, the Minister is giving powers, and, no matter what guarantee the Minister personally may give, he is giving powers that can be twisted and most unscrupulously used by anybody who subsequently takes his place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to see that it can become a very strong, desirable political weapon and one that can be readily used in the best Tammany Hall tradition.  There is no good in trying to say that conacre lettings are not included because the simple fact of the matter is that the phrase is &ldquo;all lettings and sub-lettings&rdquo;.  The Minister knows as well as I do, as an experienced lawyer, that you have no difficulty at all in arguing that the broad definition must catch all types of lettings, conacre or otherwise.  All the Minister's talk about antediluvian cases tried hundreds of years ago is so much claptrap if this section becomes law in its present form because it will then be on the Statute Book for interpretation. <Col N="1668" /> The words of the statute are global and all-embracing, and well the Minister knows it.</P>
    <P>I will not argue on the lines on which Deputy Flanagan argued.  I argue purely on the merits of the section and the esoteric ill-conceived motive behind it.  It is a shameless, ruthless invasion of private liberty. Nobody detests more than I do the man who will not work his farm properly in the best interests of the nation. I know, however, and the Minister knows, that a wide variety of causes or reasons can be involved in all this. The land may be in trusteeship or wardship or under some type of control which inevitably drives it into the market for letting.  This bald power asked for by the Minister here will upset not only ordinary lettings but lettings and the administration of lands held in wardship of the courts themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have a very good look at this section before the Report Stage.  If he wants to show his <i>bona fides,</i> there are two simple things he can do.  He can, as suggested by Deputy Blowick and Deputy Flanagan, exclude all types of conacre or yearly lettings specifically.  Further, as an earnest of his good faith, he can introduce a subsection making interference by the Land Commission in this arbitrary way referable to some tribunal for review as to whether or not such interference is reasonable or fair in the circumstances.  That is one of the commonest principles we have in ordinary legislation.  Where an arbitrary right is granted a tribunal is set up to which appeal against the arbitrary decision is referable.</P>
    <P>If the section goes through in its present form, the Minister knows as well as I do that, if the strict legal interpretation is adhered to, he is taking rights away which are regarded as sacrosanct in the tradition of the Irish landowner, rights which were hard fought for and won, as desperately fought for as any of the liberties we enjoy.  It is no good the Minister saying that while he is there &mdash;I do not believe he has any personal esoteric motive in this&mdash;the interpretation he has suggested will operate <Col N="1669" /> in the minds of the Land Commission. The Minister knows as well as I do that, once this Bill becomes law, the reply to any question about anything done under it will be that it is a matter for the Land Commission.  Let the Minister come out into the open and tell us frankly that he wants these dictatorial powers or, else, that he is prepared to modify them in order to give expression to what is in the amendment and some right of appeal against any arbitrary decision as to whether people should be permitted to let or sublet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>No case whatever, I think, has been made, or can be made, in fact, for the inclusion of the words &ldquo;let and sublet&rdquo;.  Most of us would agree, I think, that subdivision is undesirable. Deputy O.J. Flanagan is not the only auctioneer engaged in the business of letting and subletting land who is seriously concerned about this section.  This is not a branch of auctioneering which is particularly attractive to auctioneers.  It involves a great deal of trouble of one kind or another.  It is undertaken only as part of general auctioneering business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only is this a serious restriction on the rights of ownership but it will impose considerable difficulty on auctioneers themselves.  Deputy O. J. Flanagan is concerned that the amendment should be accepted in order to ensure that conacre lettings will be specifically and legally excluded.  That type of letting is often far less desirable than period letting for three, four, or five years.  Many excellent farmers are prepared to take land provided they are assured of having it for at least three or four years in order that they can set about doing a first-class job on the land, manuring it and putting it into good heart and, at the same time, getting some benefit from their labours.  With the 11-months system there is always the danger of the land being mined; the man who gets it takes as much as he possibly can out of it.  He is not concerned with what the land will be like the following year.  On the other hand, if he takes it for three or four years, even for grass, he cares the land. Numbers of farmers are anxious to <Col N="1670" /> have period lettings of grass so that they can manure the land well for the first year or two.  That, of course, is to the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>As has been said, we are here restricting the right of the owner of land.  We will not allow him any more to let his land over a period.  If a man is engaged in any other business or has any other property he is free to let it for as long as he likes.  I regard this subsection as wrong.  We are anxious that the words &ldquo;let and sublet&rdquo; should be deleted.  Deputy Blowick's amendment is a reasonable one.  This is a matter of concern not only to landowners but also to auctioneers who have very considerable experience in this business throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission are seeking powers to do these things. What is the position with regard to a large area of land in County Meath? According to an answer I got here today a good deal of land in County Meath has been in the hands of the Land Commission for a number of years.  In regard to one estate which they acquired on 17/4/57, 203 acres are set for grazing and 27 acres in conacre.</P>

      <P>They took the land from those who owned it because they were letting it.  We have cases of 70 acres taken in 1959, 182 acres taken in 1958 and 150 acres set in grazing since the Land Commission took the land over. I was told that it was not yet possible to indicate when the rest of the properties mentioned would be disposed of but that there would be no avoidable delay.  Some time in 1961, when I asked the same question and included some of these estates, I was told there would be no avoidable delay. I do not think the Land Commission should have one law for themselves and another for everybody else.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier this evening to the question of a person who had eight acres of land.  That person gave the local authority permission to straighten a road through the land.  The result was that one and a half acres were taken away, leaving six and a half acres.  They then gave half an acre to the county council to build a cottage, for the son.  That left six acres divided in two.  When the local river floods, they have about half an acre because it comes up on the bank and the land is of very little use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 12 months ago, the man who owned that land died.  His widow was next-of-kin.  She had three sons, one of whom has recently come to live in the county council cottage across the road.  About a fortnight ago, a local farmer asked for permission to put a few cattle in on one of the fields not flooded until such time as the flood had subsided, because his own land was flooded.  The following day, by a peculiar coincidence or by the long tongue of some neighbour, a Land Commission inspector arrived. They must have a fair amount of influence to be able to get an inspector on the spot so quickly.  He went into that poor old lady seriously ill in bed and told her she was not dealing with the land properly.  She explained the situation that her husband was less than 12 months dead and that the bit of land had been cut up badly.  She had a cow and a couple of calves and her son now intended to work the land. Two or three days afterwards, a letter <Col N="1672" /> arrived telling her that the Land Commission proposed to take the land from her because she was not using it properly, that she was letting it.  I have that letter in my possession if the Minister wants to see it.  Is it the intention of the Land Commission to hound unfortunate people like that all over the country?</P>

      <P>If the Land Commission want to go after the people with anything from 1,000 to 2,000 acres of land, which they set year after year, and take it from them and divide it among the local applicants or even congests, they will get the fullest support from me; but I will not agree that small farmers should be hounded and that unfortunate defenceless people should be treated in the way this old lady has been treated by officials of the Land Commission.  I am prepared to stand over what I have said.  I am not in the same position as Deputy Collins and I cannot quote the legal interpretation of the section.  The Minister stated that conacre was exempted from the general terms of the section.  He made a reference to conacre up to one acre. I agree there is a possibility that that type of conacre could be excluded. But I am not talking about conacre up to one acre.  In my constituency the conacre is very seldom an acre or less than an acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can stand over asking for the powers he is asking for here&mdash;that the Land Commission should be entitled to go into every holding, no matter how small, and simply because the holding has been let because of the illness of the man of the house or for one of a hundred other reasons, should be able to throw out the person there.  The Minister may say that what he says is that if land is let without the permission of the Land Commission, the Commission are entitled to claim that that letting is null and void.  If the Land Commission have to be asked in every case for permission, then they must have an up-to-date record of everybody setting land.  I assume that is the intention.  I am not, however, as <Col N="1673" /> innocent as Deputy O.J. Flanagan and I do not assume everybody asks for permission from the Land Commission. We know they do not.  The Minister is aware of it.  However, circumstances alter cases.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I never heard of a judge when interpreting a section looking back to the Dáil Debates to find out what the particular Minister who piloted the Bill through the House had in mind and what opinion he expressed about it. They interpret it as it is written for them.  There may be differences of interpretation as between one court and another, but they apparently never advert to what a particular Minister may have had in mind when introducing the Bill.  It may not have happened in this Parliament but it must have happened in other Parliaments that when a Minister had certain ideas in introducing a Bill, he found afterwards those ideas were set aside when it came to interpretation by the Legislature.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems confident in his own mind that this does not affect conacre.  Apparently, the purpose of it is to compel people letting their land to inform upon themselves or to put them in the position that somebody else can inform on them that they have let the land so that the Land Commission may go in and adjudge whether it is proper or not that the lands have been let.  It may be considered that these people are using their land improperly and should be deprived of it.  That would seem to be the objective behind it.  We on this side of the House feel an injustice is likely to be committed.  Innocent people will be tormented and will suffer as a consequence of this attempt to get everybody into the net.  He apparently accepted the fact&mdash;I suppose we all must&mdash;that conacre is a legitimate practice in certain conditions and within reason, and, carried to excess, is the reverse.  He wants the Land Commission to adjudicate on this; he wants every form of letting to be reported, and judging by the wording of the provision, that is what will happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me reiterate that not alone today, not alone in 1923 but away back in 1870, a conacre letting or agistment letting was not a letting by law, and it was so defined, but was regarded as the sale of a <i>profit á prendre;</i> in other words, it was what some colleagues of mine in the west of Ireland used to call the sale of the &ldquo;eatage&rdquo; of the grass&mdash;which, to my mind, is a good way of expressing it&mdash; and was consequently outside the Land Acts down through all those years. Now we come along to the 1923 Act and for Deputy Collins's edification, let me say section 65 of that Act does not say &ldquo;voidable&rdquo;.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> (1)  Where the Land Commission have after the date of the passing of this Act made any advance for the purchase of a holding or parcel, the proprietor thereof shall not subdivide or let the holding or parcel without the consent of the Land Commission, and every attempted subdivision or letting in contravention of this provision shall be void as against all persons, and on any such contravention the holding or parcel shall at the option of the Land Commission vest in them.</P>
    <P>There is not one exception in section 65 relating to conacre or agistment lettings, which goes to show that the accepted law then was, as it is today, that conacre and agistment lettings are outside the provisions of the Land Acts and are in fact the sale of <i>profit á prendre.</i> The very same wording as is in the 1923 Act is used in this section of the Bill about lettings.  That obviously covers lettings for more than 11 months, lettings outside agistment lettings and, of course, as everyone concerned in these matters knows, a lease of land or a letting of land for one, two or three years or for over a period of one year is void under that section, without the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Somebody says for the sake of argument that a shopkeeper is entitled to let his shop without any penalty.  While it is not quite relevant, let me say it is not strictly true.  If a shopkeeper lets his shop for a period of over three years, as lawyers know, under the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931, the tenant is entitled to go to the court and get a lease for 21 years and keep renewing it in perpetuity.  The shopkeeper who lets his shop for over three years parts with his shop for all time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the same at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1870, conacre lettings have been defined by law in the way I have set out and put on the records of this House and that has been accepted by all concerned, including by judicial decision, down through all those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> Again let me deny as emphatically as I can&mdash;because evidently I can keep on repeating this until I am black in the face&mdash;that agistment or conacre lettings are not within this section, that they are outside this section.  Let me reiterate that the wording of this section follows the wording of section 65 of the Land Act, 1923.  Let me reiterate that it was necessary to get the Land Commission's consent to lettings of a period of a year or more. It is only because we are following it in other categories of land now that it is necessary to extend the same sub-division control and subletting control as was exercised under section 65 of the 1923 Land Act.</P>
    <P>For those who have a real interest in the purposes of this Bill, let me also point out that if there were lettings for longer, without the consent being necessary, then any longer arrangements would be indistinguishable from permanent subdivisions and would make complete nonsense of the control machinery.  If we did not extend this control provision about lettings for periods of over one year, it would mean that the Land Commission or anybody else would never know where they were, if consent were not necessary for these long lettings.  The fact remains that this has been the law before and that this law is only now being extended with the new lands that are being brought under the scope of this Bill and this section does not interfere in any way with conacre lettings or agistment lettings, or the letting of after-grass lands to which Deputy Flanagan referred, or to any of these short, temporary convenience lettings under the 11-months system. I do not think it will serve any useful purpose for me to keep on repeating what the law has been, what it is and what is proposed here.  That is as clear as I can make it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where the land had been allotted to allottees but where the ownership had not been handed over.  The Minister knows that and he has brought in this section to make sure.  Now he tells us that agistment and conacre, by regular custom and probably by legal decisions down the years, is not included in a letting. He makes sure that all this custom is in by simple wording that a child can read or understand when he says in subsection (1) of section 12 that &ldquo;an agriculture holding&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a vested holding, or a holding that might be redeemed free of rent forever, or a free farm holding or a leasehold holding&mdash;&ldquo;shall not be let, sublet or subdivided without the consent in writing of the Land Commission&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> I must congratulate the Minister on the clarity with which he has worded it.  If he has brought in a tyrannical weapon against the small farmer, I certainly compliment with which he plainness and bluntness with which he has worded it.  A child in the second class in national school could understand it.  In case the custom in the past has been for agistment and conacre to be outside the scope of letting and sub-letting, he has made sure now.  If the Minister is genuine in what he says and if he gives me an assurance that on the Report Stage he will just exclude conacre and agistment, I shall withdraw my amendment immediately; otherwise, I am not going to allow the Minister to bring in a tyrannical weapon for either his own hands or for those of whatever unscrupulous Minister may follow him, turning the Land Commission into a minor Gestapo for the purpose of annoying farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blowick has given still further evidence that he does not understand this section.  It might be interesting to realise that under another Bill introduced recently the precise effect of this section would automatically be in operation in about 20 or 25 years' time when all title in this country would be registered anyway. All the Minister is doing is taking time by the forelock and bringing in unregistered land.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might be interested to know the history of the section in the 1923 Act and why it was introduced. The fact was that the previous Land Act had been ineffectual in preventing subletting and subdivision inasmuch as the rider was added &ldquo;until the Land Commission advance has been redeemed.&rdquo; Therefore where pre-1923 land was concerned, it was possible, on the redemption of the annuity, to carve up the land and to undo the work the Land Commission had been established to do and make nonsense of their efforts.  It became essential to bring in this wording to make void any arrangement to sublet or subdivide, irrespective of whether the annuity was or was not redeemed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the history and to suggest that the Minister is trying to bluff <Col N="1681" /> anybody or is bringing in something new or that the interpretation which Deputy Blowick has been putting on it is the interpretation which has been in force for over 41 years, is just plain childishness, to use a word so beloved of Deputy Blowick.  It seems to me now that Clann na Talmhan and its remnant for some reason best known to themselves, have decided to join Fine Gael in obstructing a provision that is not merely late in 1964 but would have been late if Deputy Blowick had started it.</P>

      <P>Finally, let me say on this amendment and put it on the records of the House that what Deputy Blowick has stated about the effect of section 65 of the Land Act of 1923 is utter nonsense, is incorrect, is untrue, and that section 65 of the Land Act of 1923 applied to every holding purchased under that Act, not to holdings awaiting division by the Land Commission, but to every holding purchased under that Act and that under that section every holding purchased under the 1923 Act was subject to this control, that is, that if there was a letting for more than 11 months it was void without the consent of the Land Commission.  I want to give the lie to the utter nonsense uttered by Deputy Blowick in regard to section 65 of the Land Act, 1923, and to point out that this control was there in respect of all lands purchased under that Land Act and that this particular control was there also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of unvested land. That is what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression, perhaps, wrongly, but if <Col N="1682" /> what the Minister said is correct, rightly, that under section 65 of the Land Act, 1923, permission and consent must be obtained and that no letting would stand legally unless the permission and the consent of the Land Commission were obtained.  The Minister now agrees with me that that is so.</P>
      <P>The reason why 11 months conacre lettings have taken place, particularly since 1923, is to avoid having to get the consent and permission of the Land Commission to let owing to family circumstances, for convenience and to assist people who must avail of conacre letting.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that there appears to be a strong exchange of views between both sides of the House in relation to this matter but I feel rather strongly about this matter myself.  In the event of legal proceedings being instituted by the Land Commission in relation to the letting of lands, can the Minister tell us what defence the defendants will have in court if the learned judge refers to section 12 and sees that as far as the law goes the letting and subletting of all agricultural land in the State is subject to Land Commission consent?  It will be of no use to tell the learned judge that the Minister for Lands said in the Dáil when the Bill was going through that conacre and agistment lettings were outside the scope of the section.</P>
      <P>Therefore I would ask the Minister to insert, on Report Stage, 12 words in the Bill, to which the learned judge can refer, to the effect that conacre and agistment lettings and temporary lettings do not come within the scope of section 12 of the Land Act, 1963.  It is as simple as that.  If the Minister would meet us on that I am sure Deputy Blowick and other Deputies who have spoken strongly on the matter would welcome any step he might take in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to Deputy Seán Flanagan's statement that there is a deliberate attempt on this side of the House to obstruct the speedy passage of this Bill.  There is no such thing.  I am sure the Minister will agree that we are reasonable on <Col N="1683" /> this side of the House.  There must be an Opposition in order to produce the best possible legislation.  We are here, not to obstruct, but to make honest and constructive criticism.  That is why we are examining this Bill patiently, not alone section by section, but sub-section by subsection, line by line, word by word.  The Bill deserves the fullest possible examination.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to let us discuss the Bill in a spirit of friendliness. Let what is said be said in an effort to make this section workable.  I would make a genuine and sincere appeal to the Minister to review this matter.  I am sure that his very capable officials could advise him.  May I say with reference to the Department of Lands that we have the best civil servants in Ireland in the Land Commission and we have a high standard Civil Service.  I would ask the Minister to consult his officials with a view to the insertion of some suitable subsection on Report Stage that would clear the air and ease the minds of persons who must conacre their lands.</P>
    <P>I have met people in recent weeks since this Bill was circulated and reference has been made to it.  They are people who as a matter of necessity conacre their holdings.  There is a certain amount of fear and a great strain and a wave of depression over them because they feel the powers given in this Bill will react against them and that they will have to apply to the Land Commission in order to obtain permission and consent to conacre their lands, despite the fact that the auctioneering and legal professions have gone to great lengths to explain to them that there is no need for any uneasiness.  There is a section of the legal profession who have serious doubts about this and maintain that, on the reading of the Bill as it stands, &ldquo;all lettings within the State&rdquo;, as referred to in the Bill, would include conacre lettings, agistment and temporary lettings.</P>
    <P>In order to remove these doubts, I would ask the Minister to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage. I do not know of conacre letting of one acre or under.  In all the lands <Col N="1684" /> that I have set in years past, I do not ever remember making a conacre letting of one acre of land.  Land is let in conacre in 30, 40, 70 acres and so on.  If it is quite legal to set one acre or under one acre without having to get permission, then the permission and the consent are nonsensical.  Nobody goes to the trouble of setting one acre of land.  It might be a cottage plot.  Those who have cottage plots work them wisely and well.  They are the people who look for conacre so as to be able to work an additional piece of ground.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House want to see this Bill work because we are most anxious that the congestion problem should be tackled in the proper manner.  We want to see the lot of smallholders improved.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister, in order that he may get a greater measure of co-operation from this side of the House, to meet us on this and bring in a short amendment on Report Stage.</P>

As it is, I suggest he is taking leave of his senses.  Here he is the big man's man.  His speech on this section was directed against the small farmers of the west.  Does he not realise that not only is there nothing extraordinary in this section but that there is nothing new in it at all?  If justices and judges in this country since 1923 have been perfectly capable of interpreting this section, is there any reason why a new section, drafted in exactly the same way, should be misconstrued?  I fail to see any merit in the opposition to this section.  The extraordinary thing is that the opposition is coming from auctioneers and legal men, the only two categories who can benefit by holding up the Bill.</P>

There is no such <Col N="1686" /> exception made in section 23 because these lettings were never legal tenancies under any of the Land Acts.

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 32, after &ldquo;persons&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;; provided, however, that in any case where the consent of the Land Commission under this Act is given after the attempted or purported letting, subletting or subdivisions, such consent shall, if the Land Commission so direct, so operate as to validate with retrospective effect such attempted or purported letting, subletting or subdivision.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Since Second Reading, I have noticed that this section does not clearly give the Land Commission power to grant <i>post factum</i> approval of a subdivision or subletting.  It is possible that a man might innocently complete a dealing which, while being technically a breach of this subdivision control section, would be quite innocuous so far as Land Commission policy is concerned. In such a case, it would be too severe to have the dealing accounted &ldquo;null and void as against all persons&rdquo; with no possibility of redress and no account being taken of the merits of the case.</P>
      <P>I feel that this element of rigidity must be removed from the section.  At the same time, I must state for the record, that I have no desire to see this amendment&mdash;which is an escape clause &mdash;used to cover up the misdeeds of real offenders.  However, it will transpire from time to time that innocuous sublettings or lettings would arise in respect of which there would be no objection from the Land Commission policy point of view.  It might also transpire due to squatters on small areas that boundaries of folios would change.  This amendment is designed, therefore, to give the Land Commission power to give <i>post factum</i> approval to such matters where they arise.  It is for clarification purposes.</P>

      <P>For either subletting or subdivision.  It could arise in either case.  To my own knowledge, there have been hundreds of sublettings of over a year that are completely void under the 1923 Act.  Unless there was a row and they came into court, they went ahead.  It may also have happened in cases under the 1923 Act, and perhaps if they were brought to the notice of the Land Commission, they would be inclined to give <i>post factum</i> approval.  At present the law is not there to enable them to do so. Under this section, they can give <i>post factum</i> approval where they consider it should be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27a:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after subsection (2) to insert the following subsection;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;() Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to any holding which is not subject to purchase annuity or other payment payable to the Land Commission, and either&mdash;<Col N="1691" /> (a)  the whole of such holding is situate within the boundary of any county borough, borough, urban district or town, or</P>
    <P>(b) the Land Commission certify under their common seal that in their opinion such holding, by reason of its proximity to a county borough, borough, urban district or town, is required for urban development.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <P>I move amendment No. 27b:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after subsection (3) to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  Where but for this section a title to a part or parts of a holding would be acquired by possession, the consent of the Land Commission under this section shall be required to such acquisition.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I know from my experience as a solicitor that there are ways in which parties who have been refused permission to subdivide a holding can enter into collusion to bring about an effective subdivision by what is commonly called &ldquo;adverse possession&rdquo;. Lest there may be any doubt, I propose that this circumventory device be clearly controlled, as in the amendment now put forward.  The person who is in process of acquiring squatter's title is essentially a trespasser. The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that, for purposes of sub-division control, the squatter is in the same position as the legal owner or tenant.  It would be quite absurd to put squatters at an advantage compared with legal owners.  I must point out, at the same time, that the amendment will not affect the case in which a man establishes a possessory title over a whole holding; for example, the man who has only a possessory title to a family farm will be no less secure than he is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has transpired that where people have applied for permission to subdivide land and such permission was refused, they have simply gone on in possession, put up fences, squatted on <Col N="1692" /> the land, and acquired squatter's title. The purpose of the amendment is to stop that practice.  As I have explained, it does not apply to a person who squats on a whole farm.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27c:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after subsection (3) to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() Every stipulation in a contract for the sale of land whereby the purchaser is precluded from making requisitions in relation to a letting, subletting or subdivision of an agricultural holding shall be null and void.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It has occurred to me that since sub-divisions without Land Commission consent will be null and void over a wider field than heretofore, it will become necessary for a purchaser's solicitor to demand proof that there is no such flaw in a vendor's title, especially in respect of purchases in the now limited category of unregistered freeholds.  On the other hand, we might have a vendor's solicitor trying to stipulate in conditions of sale that requisitions based on section 12 of this Bill would be barred.  Accordingly. I propose that restrictive conditions of this nature against a reasonable requisition of title should be declared null and void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with restrictive conditions of sale forbidding the purchaser to inquire whether lands are subject to this section.  After discussions <Col N="1693" /> with Land Registry officials I am satisfied it is desirable to clarify the law, and to have this amendment dealing with title.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to prevent a solicitor for a vendor from putting into conditions of sale a clause which would preclude the purchaser from making certain inquiries as to whether or not the land has been the subject of section 11.  It is, therefore, a protection for the purchaser and should commend itself as such to the great protector of farmers who has been speaking so volubly and irrelevantly on their behalf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27d:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete subsection (4) and to insert the following sub-section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;agricultural&rdquo;, in relation to a holding, means substantially agricultural or pastoral or substantially agricultural and pastoral in character;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;holding&rdquo;, in relation to a particular tenant or proprietor, means all the land held by him at or after the passing of this Act under a single demise or to which he has acquired title by possession, whether fee simple, fee farm grant, leasehold or from year to year (whether or not under statutory conditions), and whether held jointly or in common or alone or in severalty, and whether or not purchased under the Land Purchase Acts or registered or deemed to be registered under the Registration of Title Acts, 1891 and 1942; provided that where two or more than two such holdings stand consolidated they shall be deemed to be one holding and that, where two or more than two registered properties are registered in the same ownership and have not been consolidated by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> they shall be deemed to be separate holdings for the purposes of this section;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;subdivision&rdquo; includes any claim whatsoever to title to a part or parts of a holding, whether by disposition to one or more than one person, and `subdivide' shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to enlarge the definitions subsection so as to cover several other points on which clarification may be needed.  I shall deal with them separately:</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;property&rdquo; in line 38 is being replaced by the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; because it was not explicit enough. This is merely a drafting point.</P>
    <P>Next we have, a line or two later, the introduction of the phrase &ldquo;or to which he has acquired title by possession.&rdquo;  In the original text the phrase &ldquo;under a single demise&rdquo; would hardly cover the assumption of title by what is called adverse possession or squatting and so we would have an unjust situation in which the squatter would be quite free of sub-division control while the ordinary purchaser or inheritor of land would be subject to it.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps mention that this is not the same point as that which I dealt with on amendment No. 27b. Broadly speaking, that amendment related to the severance of a holding through the claim of the squatter; this new phrase introduces the idea of control over any subsequent action by the squatter in sub-dividing what he managed to get title to.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the words in brackets in the amendment,&mdash;&ldquo;whether or not under statutory conditions.&rdquo; This is purely a matter of drafting.  It seems possible that the words &ldquo;year to year&rdquo; immediately preceding would not cover a judicial tenancy and so it is desirable that this small gap should be closed.</P>
    <P>Another point which has caused some concern is the argument that, on the original wording of this section, any two folio holdings acquired by the one <Col N="1696" /> man and registered in his name might have to be treated thereafter as one unit&mdash;for the purposes of sub-division control&mdash;even though they were otherwise quite unrelated.  They might be very many miles apart and obviously distinct and separate units for the purposes of any rational land-structure policy.  I have no desire to introduce unreal paper consolidations of this type since they would be vexatious to the owners concerned and would raise unnecessary problems in the Land Registry.  Accordingly, the second last passage in amendment No. 27d provides in effect that two folio holdings in this situation shall remain distinct units unless the Land Commission have specifically provided that they be consolidated.</P>
    <P>In the last three lines of the amendment I have sought to deal with certain problems of evasion.  There are legal devices by which a lawyer might seek to achieve an effective sub-division and at the same time maintain that he had not legally subdivided the holding within the meaning of this section as originally drafted.  The amendment has had to be worded comprehensively so as to put all such dealings in jeopardy and deter people from attempting evasion by the devices I have in mind.</P>
    <P>With the exception of drafting amendments and, the last one, the point which was brought to our notice that you have, of course, some owners having two or three folios in different parts, perhaps widely separated, and in places where they are not consolidated, we thought it better to make the law clear here in this section and to set out that they would be regarded as separate units.  These are the purposes of this comprehensive amendment on points that were raised as between the Land Registry and others on the legal effect of this section.</P>

      <P>It is not fair to the House to introduce a Bill of this sort with an explanatory memorandum and to introduce shortly afterwards a list of amendments and to introduce, shortly after that, another list of amendments&mdash;and we are now presented with another list of amendments. There is nothing to prevent the Minister from introducing, every week the Dáil sits to discuss this Bill, a list of amendments.  I am sure he would not, knowing it to be so, but he will admit it is rather unfair to Deputies and to Parties who have considered this Bill, discussed what was before them and decided to take a certain line of action, to find that, at this stage, the whole face of the Bill is being changed.  The Minister says they are only drafting amendments. An amendment which requires one-third of a page of highly technical terms can hardly be considered one which is put in as just a drafting amendment.  The Minister is being unfair to the House and to Deputies who want to discuss this Bill with him and who want to see it go through as a proper Land Bill.</P>

This is the place to deal with such matters.  Not one amendment interferes with the original principles enshrined in the Bill.  Their purpose is to make the law clearer and to deal with these odd cases of a very technical legal nature for which it is necessary to make provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly; I meant no discourtesy to the Chair.  Deputy Tully believes that all these special cases were within the knowledge of the Land Commission or the Land Registry.  Deputy Tully is quite entitled to say that the Minister could have delayed the printing of the Bill until such time as he could cover all the difficulties he is now trying to cover by amendment.  This is leading to confusion in the case of those who are not aware of the technical difficulties or the purpose of the Minister's amendments.  It is in the Minister's own interest to clarify <i>simpliciter</i> rather than technically the reasons for these amendments.  I am anxious the Minister should get this Bill quickly but, at the same time, Deputy Tully's protest should register with the Minister. It is unreasonable to find the Land Bill, in the course of a couple of months, being amended in this fashion by amendment and counter-amendment and amendments to amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are mainly drafting amendments.  They are of a very technical nature.  Deputy Collins will appreciate it is not easy to explain in layman's language the effect of some of these dealing, for instance, with squatter's title and what can happen with registered titles under the Local Registration of Title Act and the position that could arise with regard to squatters under the provisions of this Bill.  In very odd cases, too, there are fears of evasion.  Either I, or someone else, after the Second Reading, saw the possible legal way in which the intention of the Bill could be evaded.  It is to prevent such evasion that these technical amendments are introduced.  The principles have not been departed from.  The law has been made clearer and we are trying to foresee technical evasions and <Col N="1699" /> trying to make provision to make sure they will not occur.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) In this section a holding shall be deemed to be let or sublet where it is held by virtue of any instrument in writing, whether under seal or not, containing a contract of tenancy in respect of holding, in consideration of a rent or return and shall not include a letting for the purpose of temporary depasturage, agistment or conacre or for temporary convenience or to meet a temporary necessity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the law in relation to these lettings.  I shall not repeat what I have already said but, if the Minister is making an attempt over the weekend to improve the Bill by the circulation of further miscellaneous amendments, I really think a genuine effort should be made to improve the Bill by accepting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A farmer should be free to let his land for temporary convenience and <Col N="1700" /> legitimate conacre.  It is a serious handicap on any farmer to be prevented from making such lettings or put to the inconvenience of having to seek permission from and the consent of the Land Commission.  I presume there will be a section specially set up for the purpose of dealing speedily with applications and that a farmer will be assured of a reply in the course of a week or ten days.  It is desirable no time should be lost in giving decisions.</P>
    <P>This amendment should be accepted particularly in the light of the recommendation made to the Minister by the NFA in their observations on the Land Bill.  They state clearly that they appreciate the fact that the Minister has stated that the usual conacre or legitimate lettings are not covered by this section but they also recommend that agistment and conacre should be specifically exempted from the section. The one way in which that can be done is by accepting this amendment. I have considered the matter very carefully and I believe the amendment is worthy of consideration by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference between this amendment and the amendment moved by Deputy Blowick. I do not propose to weary the House reiterating that this Bill does not deal with conacre or agistment lettings. The law on that has been quite clear since 1870.  I see no reason why the Land Commission should need any staff to deal with consent to lettings when, in fact, the law of the land is sinnce the passing of the 1923 Act that consents were necessary in respect of land purchased under the Act.  The staff dealing with that can continue to deal with the matter in the future. I have dealt very fully with the whole position on the amendment moved by Deputy Blowick and the same arguments apply to this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether a subletting or agistment has ever been defined in any Act?  I do not want to raise any heat over it, but I cannot see a judge putting any interpretation on this Bill when it becomes law other than that which is written into it.  It is a judge's function <Col N="1701" /> to interpret the laws we make, whether they are good or bad.  It would ease my mind enormously if I could be assured that no judge in the future would interpret subsection (1) in the way I am afraid of.</P>

      <P>The Minister should be less naïve than he is.  We have had a welter of verbiage in successive amendments from him.  Since we have graciously consented to all kinds of long, technical amendments from the Minister, it is not unreasonable for us to ask him to bring in a simple two or three-line amendment on Report epitomising Deputy O.J. Flanagan's amendment to show it is clearly statutorily declared that, whatever the interpretation of agistment or conacre lettings may be, for the purposes of the 1963 Act, they are specifically included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past 90 years, the law has been that a conacre or agistment letting is not, in fact, a legal letting at all.  It does not create any tenancy but is a sale of a <i>profit à prendre</i> out of the lands or the eatage of lands, as we describe it in the west. That is the reason why there is no necessity to exclude conacre or agistment lettings in any of the Land Acts. What is the use wasting time on this when that is the law known to everybody, and there is no doubt about it. Every legal schoolboy knows that.  I have used all these arguments before on Deputy Blowick's amendment and I do not think I should take up more of the time of the House dealing with it.</P>

      <P>The argument is that there is no need for Deputy O.J. Flanagan's amendment.  The Minister has stated that every legal schoolboy knows that.  The Minister says that position is created by precedent.  There is a simple way of confirming precedent, that is, by statutory inclusion. If the Minister wants to copperfasten the precedent and enshrine it in perpetuity, he can put it into the statute in the form of the amendment moved by Deputy O.J. Flanagan or in the very much shorter and simpler form I suggested earlier.  He can do that, if his interpretation of the law is right, without any effect except enshrining a statutory provision in the Bill which will make it a statutory law as distinct from precedent as he has described it. If that is done, the speed with which all the other amendments go through will stagger him.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> This subject has been debated already and there has been a division on it. However, the Minister maintains that under the law conacre is not a letting at all.  I presume what he means by that, in my language, is that the interpretation of the law up to the present has been that conacre is not a letting.  I submit that it has never been statutorily written into any Land Bill that conacre as such was not a letting and it has merely been left to the interpretation of the law.  Will the Minister not agree that something that is written in by statute is stronger than <Col N="1704" /> something which is left to legal interpretation?  It is on that basis we are asking him to accept this amendment. Interpretations may alter at some future date.  None of us knows what a future judge may decide or what a future High Court may do. I would ask the Minister to incorporate this provision in the Bill.  That is what we on this side of the House have been asking for and what the Minister has been resisting.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 of this Bill can be described as a disastrous section in any Bill but particularly disastrous in the Land Bill where steps are being taken to prohibit letting, subletting or subdivision without the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>This is certainly a very serious infringement of the rights of the farming community or of the right of the owner of land to do what he likes with his own property.  This section can be described as unreasonable.  It carries, in my opinion, a great deal of dictatorship from the Government in regard to the owners of property.  This House has given every subsection of this section very serious thought.  I have been wondering whether this section is at all constitutional.  I am not so sure that at some future date it might not be contested as to whether it was in conformity with the Constitution.  It is very wrong that the right of the ownership of land should be endangered and that the landowner should be deprived of the right to set his land as he thinks fit.  On that principle I strongly and bitterly oppose this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear <Col N="1705" /> there is a great deal of opposition to this section from this side of the House but the Opposition is based on different interpretations of what is contained in the section.  It is my belief that this section is aimed at the congests in the west of Ireland and that the purpose of section 12 and the pile of amendments to strengthen section 12 is to get rid of the small farmers and congests in the west by legal means. The Minister was asked today to come out into the open and tell the House frankly what he had in mind and I restrained myself from contributing on a number of these amendments because I wanted to find out, as clearly as it was possible to do so, what exactly the Minister and the Government had in mind in this section.</P>
      <P>I shall not bore the House by repeating what other Deputies have said but not content with producing the section itself originally, the Minister proceeds to tag on a number of amendments to that section.  Deputy Seán Flanagan and other legal luminaries sought to suggest that some of these amendments were very good amendments and a form of protection. That was the kind of argument put to Deputy Blowick and the suggestion was made that Deputy Blowick was unaware of the legal implications of one or two of these amendments.  I think Deputy Blowick was perfectly correct in his interpretation in this sense, that even though the amendments, on the face of it, appear to be a safeguard, when that safeguard was put on to a bad section, all that is done at that stage is to safeguard somebody who should not be safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister sought to hoodwink the House in regard to the real purpose of these amendments.  If you clear out a room and then proceed to lock the door, you will strengthen the locks and strengthen the barricade if you put wedges in the door; you will make it harder to prise it open and if you get a dozen wedges and ram them in all round, you will make the place completely safe against penetration.  The amendments put forward by the Minister were wedges so that, once the tenants or the small farmers were out, <Col N="1706" /> the door would be wedged to prevent their holding on to what the Minister describes as squatters' rights or by any other method by which they were entitled to remain.</P>
    <P>On that basis, we shall have to make it clear to the general public and to the small farmers in the west that this Government brought in a series of amendments to section 12 as a smokescreen to hide their true aims. There is page after page of amendments to the section.  If they were aimed at the acquisition of the large tracts of land which have been set for years to the wheat rancher and to the limited companies which have engaged in the growing of wheat as a speculative form of enterprise, there would be complete agreement in this House to strengthen the Minister's hand in dealing with that type of person or groups, but in fact there is nothing in these amendments or in section 12 which will strengthen the Minister's hand in dealing with those people or groups. The Minister's hand is being strengthened in this section to deal with the small man who, perhaps through no fault of his own, through economic circumstances, had to close the door of his house and go to England for two or three years in order to make sufficient money to help his family at home.  He is the man who will be harried or hounded under section 12. The aim is to clear out the remainder of the small men who are still clinging hopefully to their holdings in the west and in the congested areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister sought, unsuccessfully, I must say, to sidetrack Deputies from this aspect of section 12 by his smokescreen and by a form of diversion to the effect that there was a great danger of this evil of subdivision in the small holdings and in the congested areas being allowed to continue. His argument was: &ldquo;We have to tighten up this law to prevent further subdivision in uneconomic farms.&rdquo; In fact, the position today is that there is no danger whatever of any large scale subdivision of uneconomic holdings. That day has gone and some Deputies who have sought to suggest that a farmer in the west with three or four sons and 20 acres of land was <Col N="1707" /> still inclined to divide that land between his sons are either deliberately trying to mislead the House or are completely out of touch with the situation in the west of Ireland.  I challenge any Deputy who has made that statement, particularly when it affects Mayo, with betraying the small farmer and the congest in the western areas.</P>
    <P>The position in Mayo, south and north, in Roscommon, Galway and in all these counties, is that a number of smallholders have been forced, through the ineptitude of this and other Governments, to clear out for a period of years to try to make sufficient money to enable them to return and rear their families here.  In their absence, there is now an attempt to acquire the small bit of land they have.  At the moment wherever a bit of land becomes available in the west, instead of a question of subdivision arising, it is a question of consolidation which is taking place.  In fact, we have a new breed of landlord, the local rich individual.  I will not describe what his form of living is at present but the local speculator is now <Col N="1708" /> in the process of buying up land in every parish and bringing the country back to the state which obtained here a number of years ago.</P>
    <P>The aim of section 12 should be to prevent an entire townland being gobbled up by one individual.  That is the real illness today in rural areas. Instead, the Government seek to suggest that there is a danger of further subdivision.  Is it not proof positive that this Government are trying to hoodwink the smallholder and condoning this consolidation on the part of the rancher, the speculator and all the men out to make profit from the land?</P>

      <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Corish on 9th April, 1964:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann considers that the Minister for External Affairs has not discharged his duty to the taxpayers in the manner of the production of the booklet &ldquo;Facts About Ireland&rdquo;, and that the section of the booklet headed &ldquo;History&rdquo; does not reflect respect for objective recording of events of the past half century <Col N="1713" /> but is written with the obvious purpose of political advantage of the Fianna Fáil Party; that, further, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that gross offence is offered to large numbers of our people by the complete omission of any reference to such a historically significant social event as the great struggle of the workers in 1913 under the leadership of James Larkin which had <Col N="1714" /> such profound results upon the living standards of the Irish people and peoples of other countries; and that, further, Dáil Éireann condemns the lack of any reference to the growth and development of the Trade Union movement and its tremendous contribution towards the well-being of the nation.</P>

    <P>The amount collected by way of customs duties in the nine months ended 31st December, 1963, was £35,941,689.  Statement A attached gives particulars of receipts of customs duty under individual headings in cases where the net receipts under such headings exceeded £10,000 in the nine months April to December, 1963.  Since the introduction of the <Col N="1513" /> new form of Customs Tariff on 1st January, 1963, the accounts of the receipts from customs duties are kept under headings which are not directly comparable with those formerly in use.  Accordingly it is not possible to furnish details of receipts under the same headings as appeared in the reply to Question 53 of 4th April, 1963.</P>
