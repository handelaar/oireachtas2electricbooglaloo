      <P>The question of proceeding with our application for accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is still under consideration.  I cannot, therefore, make a statement, at this stage, on our participation in the Trade Negotiations Conference which is due to commence in Geneva in May, 1964, under the aegis of the GATT.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, having regard to the serious dissatisfaction of medical laboratory technologists with the Labour Court award last year and to the subsequent protests and requests made by them, he will now have their claims sympathetically reconsidered and introduce acceptable salary scales for all grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The remuneration of staffs employed in the health services is primarily a matter for the employing authorities. As regards the staffs of voluntary hospitals my functions are limited to the determination of the expenditure in respect of salaries which may be reckoned for the purpose of payment of grants from the Hospital Trust Fund towards the revenue deficits of those hospitals participating in the deficit grants scheme.  I am aware that the remuneration of laboratory technicians employed in voluntary hospitals was the subject of proceedings before the Labour Court in January, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After a full hearing the court recommended the introduction of increased salary scales for all grades. <Col N="195" /> The recommendation of the Labour Court was accepted by the hospital authorities and, for my part, I approved the reckoning of the additional expenditure involved for deficit grant purposes. The recommendation of the Labour Court was framed, no doubt, with due regard to the duties and responsibilities of laboratory technicians as set out in their claim.  I do not consider that the fact that the revised scales recommended did not meet the expectations of the staffs concerned warrants any action on my part with a view to further revision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the technologists take exception to being described as technicians and would the Minister not be big enough to see these gentlemen are described as technologists if they request to be so described?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the association think it is of importance and no doubt the Minister will be sufficiently courteous to so describe them in the future.  Further arising from the Minister's reply, is it a fact that the Minister refused to consider the representations made subsequent to the Labour Court award, and having regard to the fact that the effect of that award was to enlarge the difference between higher and lower grades, would the Minister take another look at the matter in order to consider improving the standards of the lower grade technologists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is certainly on the wrong track in this matter.  If he is, as I understand him to be, talking about the voluntary general hospitals, I have to point out that I could interfere only if I were to take control of the voluntary general hospitals.  Is that what the Deputy wants me to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister advised the voluntary general hospitals that he would not use any of the Hospitals Trust funds <Col N="196" /> to assist them if they should pay more than the Labour Court award?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that many merchants throughout the country who sell goods on the hire-purchase system and are financed by hire-purchase companies have been at a considerable loss owing to the fact that during the period June to October 1963 they sold numbers of articles on hire-purchase and that, although the goods were in possession of the purchasers, the hire-purchase finance companies did not forward the necessary finance to the merchants until after 1st November 1963, when the merchants concerned had to pay turnover tax on the goods sold; and whether he will have this matter investigated and a rebate of tax paid to merchants where the goods were in fact sold prior to 1st November 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no representations regarding any case such as is described in the question.</P>
      <P>In fact turnover tax is not payable on payments so far received after 1st November for goods purchased before 1st August last.  As regards goods purchased between that date and 1st November, merchants had ample opportunity to adjust their prices to cover the tax or to arrange with the hire-purchase finance companies to make payment before 1st November, and thus avoid tax liability.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if there has been any <Col N="197" /> change in the system of accounting or dates of payment of expenditure from the Exchequer as between this financial year and last year, with particular reference to the increased revenue of £18.5 million compared to increased expenditure of only £12.7 million up to the 22nd February in each year allowing for the receipt from retrospective Corporation Profits Tax and moneys taken from Revenue Balances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change in the system.  Revenue receipts rose by £17.5 million in the period referred to.  The smaller expenditure increase of £12.7 million was due to casual variation in the dates of substantial payments, notably the Road Fund Grants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen Press reports of the statement to which the Deputies refer. It was with great regret that I read these reports as the officers of my Department at home and abroad endeavour to maintain the closest co-operation and friendly relations with potential exporters, and statements of this kind are not helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Department of External Affairs, we are keenly conscious of the vital importance of expanding Ireland's foreign earnings both in trade and in invisible items and we are doing everything within our resources to promote such earnings.  In furtherance of this objective I called home, in July, 1961, the Heads of all our Missions abroad and I arranged a series of conferences for them.  Apart from many conferences I had with them myself, I arranged that the Taoiseach should meet them collectively, that they should have conferences and exchanges of views with the Heads of the Economic Departments, State-sponsored bodies and other interested organisations.  Included in this series was a session with a large group of representatives of the <Col N="199" /> Irish Exporters' Association.  In the course of the conference the then President of the Association said that his Organisation appreciated very much what our representatives abroad were doing on behalf of exporters.</P>
    <P>Some of the exporters may feel, as one of them said at the meeting referred to, that the Department of External Affairs should have more expansive and more expensive representations abroad for the purpose of promoting exports.  My Department, quite naturally, would not be averse to expanding its staff and having more money to spend on trade promotion.  It would be for decision, however, whether additional State assistance for exporters should be used in substitution or extension of the various other forms of aid already being given to exporters, for example, by Córas Tráchtála, by the Industrial Development Authority, by the Industrial Credit Company and through relief on profits arising from increased exports.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, the value of our exports for 1963 has increased by £65 million or 50 per cent as compared with 1957 and our earnings on tourism by £21 million or 63 per cent.  The officers of my Department have done their share in this development and have worked hard and intelligently at all times for improved trading arrangements with other countries.  Many exporters and tourist agencies have expressed their appreciation to me for the co-operation they obtained from our headquarter staff and our Missions abroad.</P>
    <P>In regard to the complaint that the attention of the Irish Exporters' Association was not drawn to specific trade opportunities by our Missions abroad, I may say that the practice has always been to bring such opportunities to the notice of the appropriate Economic Department or Córas Tráchtála who in turn pursue the matter with the export interest concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by saying that apart from the speech referred to in the Deputies' questions, I have heard no complaint from exporters as to the <Col N="200" /> failure of the officers of the Department of External Affairs to co-operate with individual concerns in the promotion of exports.  This lack of complaint was not due to any lack of opportunity of making a complaint to me directly as I have never refused to see an exporter and I meet many of them frequently at their trade displays at home and abroad and on numerous other occasions.  I need hardly add that if a specific complaint of lack of co-operation should be made to me at any time it will be thoroughly investigated and if a legitimate grievance should be discovered the necessary remedial action will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <P>There is not, and never <Col N="201" /> has been, a Trade Counsellor attached to the Irish Mission to the Argentine. The only officer of diplomatic rank at the Mission is the Minister Plenipotentiary whose responsibilities, of course, include the exploration of trade possibilities.</P>
      <P>The Argentine Government, as is well known, have a highly restrictive import régime for other than vitally essential goods.  While the Minister Plenipotentiary has received no recent indication of interest in the Argentine market on the part of Irish exporters, he has from time to time raised with the Argentine authorities the possibility of a relaxation of import restrictions. The reply has been that, as Argentina has provisionally acceded to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and operates a nondiscriminatory import régime, it is not possible to make discriminatory concessions in our favour.</P>

A number of countries have agreed that after a certain time there should be a six-mile limit exclusive to the country concerned and also that there should be excluded from the area from six to 12 miles out all countries who have not established a traditional fishing claim on it.  This is a reciprocal agreement.  The French, for instance, will exclude everybody except the Irish and British and the other participating States and we shall reciprocate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know perfectly well what the reply was.  It is not my intention to ask CIE to break down individual costs and receipts for any part of the system. CIE are disposed to operate in a unitary sense.  Reports are published which indicate a certain breakdown of receipts and expenditure.  It would require an enormous staff if CIE were required to prepare statements of receipts and expenditure for individual sections, either in relation to buses or trains.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows perfectly well, CIE made a particular study of the Tramore-Waterford line.  At one point they examined the savings that could be made, and the results of their findings were published in the Dáil on the occasion of the debate on the CIE report for the year, during which the question of the closing of railway lines was fully discussed for a period of over a week.  There is no reason for CIE to be asked to make detailed statements of expenditure and receipts in connection with a particular section, the buses run there, when in fact the buses are used for various purposes in different parts of Waterford.  The whole question is completely out of date and no longer has any validity.</P>

      <P>Sketch layout and house plans for a 62 house scheme at Caherina and a ten house scheme for elderly persons at Stack's Villas, Tralee, were first received in my Department on 17th October, 1963.  Following discussions early in November at the request of the housing authority between technical officers of the housing authority and my Department, revised plans were received in the Department on 13th January for <Col N="211" /> the Caherina scheme and on 24th idem for the Stack's Villas scheme. Further discussions of a technical nature on the plans for both schemes took place on 6th February last, following which the final versions of the plans are now awaited from the housing authority.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>1.  The variations in the amount paid to a local authority as between one year and another are due to a number of factors including the payment of final instalments of subsidy in respect of schemes for which payments on account were made in previous years.</P>
    <P>2.  Certain annual subsidies paid to housing authorities under pre-1932 legislation were compounded in 1958-59 in accordance with the provisions of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1958.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if there is any national standard with which owners of buildings must comply in regard to fire hazards; or if British standards are applied here; and if he will expedite the provision of such adequate standards as will alleviate public uneasiness caused by recent outbreaks.</P>

      <P>In the case of public buildings and institutions the Department published fire protection standards in 1950.  It is hoped to issue an up-to-date version of these standards for more general application in the immediate future.  In the case of existing potentially dangerous buildings control is exercised by fire brigade authorities under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.</P>
      <P>Fire resisting construction and other precautions in new buildings can be required at present by local authorities in exercise of powers under building bye-laws and the Town Planning Acts where they are in force.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, empowers me to make building regulations prescribing standards, including fire precaution standards, which will have general application and which will replace the various codes of bye-laws now in force in a number of areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a previous question about this estate on 18th ultimo.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the claims of all eligible applicants were fully considered by the Land Commissioners before the limited acreage, viz. 40 acres, available for disposal on the estate was allocated.</P>
      <P>The two successful applicants were&mdash; Martin Browne, Drumnamahaneisland, Borrisokane and Charles Coughlan, Sopwell, Cloughjordan, County Tipperary; their allotments comprised 15a. 1rd. 30p. and 24a. 2r. 30p. respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on that estate there have been a vast number of smallholders having from 18½ acres down to eight acres and that the Irish Land Commission, when allocating the last 22½ acres of that land, approached a gentleman who offered to hand over portion of his farm; that the Land Commission would not take the portion unless he surrendered the entire acreage?  Is the Minister further aware that the Land Commission gave him 22½ acres, bringing his total acreage over 60 acres, while the smallholders are left without any of that estate?  Will the Minister have the case reopened and investigated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>All I know is that both successful applicants were relying solely for their means of livelihood on farming as an occupation, that they were within the requisite distance of the land to be divided&mdash;there were only 40 acres to be divided&mdash;that one of their valuations was £4 5s. and the other valuation was £12.  It is quite obvious to me from this information that both these men were deserving <Col N="222" /> applicants.  The division of any estate is a matter reserved by law as a function of the Irish Land Commission and neither I nor the Deputy can question what they in their wisdom have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will not defend the action of the Irish Land Commission in depriving one man, Thomas Minogue, who now holds 18½ acres and who has a family, and also a man named Carroll who owns 16 acres and whose son, aged 18 years, has gone to England since the land was divided?  As far as the valuation is concerned, the particular portion of Sopwell, which I know very well, comprises a lot of old bog land, of which, naturally, the valuation is low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot disclose the information that I have got from different applicants.  Indeed, I think it would be very bad practice.  I do know that one of the people mentioned by the Deputy is, in fact, a county council ganger and is not depending for his livelihood solely or mainly on farming.  The Land Commission have to assess as between all the different people living within the distance limit as to who should get land in a case of this kind.  That is the procedure that has been laid down by this House and, unless the Deputy wants that changed, that procedure must continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the case the Minister has mentioned of a man being a road ganger, I want to say that that man has a vast acreage taken in conacre; that he has a wife and four in family, including the boy of 18 who has since gone to England.  His wife and family will not be eligible for the position in the county council when Mr. Carroll retires.  The fact that he is a road ganger should not be held against anyone in regard to land division in Ireland.</P>

Go dtí seo bhí trí Meastacháin againn mar atá, Oifig an Aire Leasa Shóisialaigh, Árachas Sóisialach agus Cúnamh Sóisialach.

    <P>Comh fada agus a bhaineann le cúrsaí riaracháin, tá laghdú de £40,000 faoí Fho-Mhírcheann A&mdash;Tuarastail, Pá agus Liúntais.  'Séard is príomh-chúis leis an laghdú seo ná gur deineadh atheagrú ar ghnéithe áirithe d'obair na Roinne i rith na bliana i gcaoi is gur féidir an obair sin a dhéanamh níos éifeachtaí le foireann laghdaithe.</P>
    <P>Sin gearr-chuntas ar phríomh gnéithe an Mheastacháin Leasa Shóisialaigh in aghaidh na bliana 1964-65.  Má tá breis eolais or ghnéithe áirithe ag teastáil ó Theachta ar bith tabharfaidh mé dó é ach a iarraidh orm.</P>
    <P>At the outset I wish to direct the attention of Deputies to the alteration in the form of the Estimates for the services administered by my Department. The three separate Estimates which hitherto covered respectively the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, <Col N="229" /> Social Insurance and Social Assistance, have for 1964-65 been combined in the one Estimate for Social Welfare.  Subheads A, B and D of the new Estimate cover the gross provision formerly made in the Estimate for the Office of the Minister, Subheads E and F correspond to the former Estimate for Social Insurance and Subheads G to K cover the gross provision for assistance services formerly made in the Estimate for Social Assistance.  The provision under Subhead L, Appropriations-in-Aid, includes the receipts formerly provided for under the Appropriations-in-Aid subheads of the Estimate for the Office of the Minister and the Estimate for Social Assistance.  On the whole I think Deputies will find the new lay-out more convenient as it will now be possible to see the total Exchequer expenditure on social welfare at a glance, while at the same time all necessary detail continues to be apparent.</P>
    <P>There are two further changes in the lay-out of the Estimate to which I should draw attention.  First, a new subhead &mdash; Subhead C &mdash; has been opened to provide for repayment to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of the cost of services rendered by it to my Department.  Secondly, certain grants which were formerly shown separately in the Estimate for Social Assistance are now combined under the heading &ldquo;Miscellaneous Grants&rdquo; in Subhead K. Details of the individual grants will, however, continue to be shown separately in Part III of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The main feature of the Estimate for Social Welfare for 1964-65 is the increased amount being provided, an increase of £5,216,000 over the original provision for 1963-64.  This increase is of course mainly attributable to the increased rates of payment and the other improvements in the social welfare schemes brought about by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963.  The increased expenditure arising in the current year from that Act is not included in the figures for 1963-64 shown on the Estimate, as the Supplementary Estimates providing for that expenditure have <Col N="230" /> only recently been passed.  If the Supplementary Estimates are taken into account, the increase in 1964-65 as compared with 1963-64 is £2,690,000. On the other hand, the Estimate for 1964-65 does not make provision for the increased administrative costs arising from the application to the Civil Service of the 12 per cent salary increase recently agreed upon.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead E, which provides for the payment from the Exchequer of the amount by which expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund exceeds the Fund's income, a provision of £9,284,000 is being made, which represents an increase of £1,302,000 as compared with 1963-64.  This is the net result of an increase of £3,395,000 in expenditure offset by a net increase of £2,093,000 in income.  The estimated expenditure from the Fund in 1964-65 is £24,705,000 made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>This figure includes £2,481,000 for the estimated gross cost of the increase in benefit rates and other improvements brought into effect from the beginning of January, 1964 under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>The estimated income of the Social Insurance Fund in 1964-65 is £15,421,000.  Of this, £14,700,000 is attributable to employment contributions, the balance representing income from investments and receipts under Reciprocal Arrangements.  These figures show that the total expenditure on social insurance in 1964-65 will be met as to 37.6 per cent from the Exchequer, 59.5 per cent from contributions of employers and employees, and 2.9 per cent from investments etc. The Estimate of £14,700,000 for contribution income in 1964-65 represents <Col N="231" /> an increase of £2,100,000 over the 1963-64 Estimate.  Of this £1,718,000 is due to the increased rates of contribution in operation since the beginning of January last, and the balance of £382,000 is expected to accrue from higher stamp sales resulting from a continuance of the upward trend in employment.</P>
    <P>Under the social assistance heading, there are increases of £454,000 on old age pensions, £2,955,000 on children's allowances, £222,000 on unemployment assistance and £100,000 on widows' and orphans' pensions.  These increases total £3,731,000.  In fact, the increased cost in 1964-65 arising from the improvements in these services made by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963 amounts to £4,000,000, but this figure falls to be reduced by £269,000 as a result of offsetting factors, for example, a continuing decline in the numbers of non-contributory old age and widow pensioners according as more people in these groups become eligible for the corresponding contributory benefits.</P>
    <P>The only other subhead which shows a substantial increase is Subhead C&mdash;Post Office Services&mdash;where the increase as compared with 1963-64 is £254,560.  As I mentioned earlier, this is a new subhead made necessary because of a decision requiring all Departments to pay the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in cash for all services rendered by that Department to other Departments. My Department already recouped the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for telephone, etc., expenses and for postal expenses in connection with the social insurance scheme, the necessary provision being made under subhead B of the former Vote for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare.  In addition to these expenses, it is now necessary to provide for recoupment of postal and other expenses incurred by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on the administration of social assistance services, and this explains the increased provision for 1964-65.</P>
    <P>Subhead A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and <Col N="232" /> allowances&mdash;is one of the few subheads to show a reduction.  The decrease of £40,000 is mainly due to reorganisation of certain aspects of the Department's work which resulted in the centralisation and assigning to junior staff of certain routine work previously performed as part of their duties by more highly paid officers, and led also to a net reduction in the total number of staff.  This overall reduction in numbers was achieved despite the allocation of some additional officers to meet the permanent increase in the work of the Children's Allowances Branch as a result of the admission to the scheme of one-child families as from the beginning of last November.  While dealing with the question of the staffing of my Department perhaps it would be in order for me to refer briefly to the implementation of the increases in benefit and assistance rates announced in the 1963 Budget.  As Deputies will appreciate, there is a considerable volume of work involved in this task&mdash;the printing and issuing of order books and receipt slips, receiving and deciding new claims, etc.  As the work has to be done within a relatively short period it is inevitable that isolated errors will occur.  I can, however, assure Deputies that the percentage of error is very small, and that where an error does occur it will be rectified immediately it is brought to notice.</P>
    <P>The main item included in Subhead L&mdash;Appropriations in Aid&mdash;is a sum of £1,159,000 representing the amount repayable by the Social Insurance Fund in respect of the expenses of the Department on the administration of the social insurance scheme.  A further item, for which a provision of £322,000 is made, represents the estimated receipts from certain local authorities under the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  These two items account for almost 98 per cent of the total estimated receipts, the balance being made up of a number of minor items.  I have now explained the main features of my Department's Estimate for 1964-65.  I think all Deputies agree with the purpose of the expenditure involved, and accordingly <Col N="233" /> I recommend that the House should approve of this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say at the outset that we, on this side of the House, accept the declaration in the final paragraph of the Minister's statement that it is his opinion Deputies will agree with the purpose governing the expenditure involved in this Estimate and, in recommending it to the House for approval, he will certainly have the approval of the Party I represent.</P>
      <P>Consideration of this main Estimate comes within a matter of a week after the House has had an opportunity on the recent Supplementary Estimate of expressing views relevant to the administration of the Minister's Department. Consequently, the discussion today must be influenced to some extent by the fact that views were expressed on social welfare policy within the past week and need not now be repeated.</P>
      <P>More information is, of course, available on this Estimate than was forthcoming on the Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister, in his statement, refers quite frequently to improvements that have been granted, or are projected, for the classes it is intended to cater for under this Estimate. There are, of course, glaring omissions.  The omissions are relevant to the reasons that warranted the increases in social welfare benefits and to the fact that we have had increases in the cost of living, the like of which this country never experienced before, and which will continue because all the indications are that the spiral will go still higher in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such a situation, those worse affected are those who are catered for by the Minister for Social Welfare and for whom moneys are voted by this House&mdash;the aged, the unemployed, the sick, and so on and so forth.  If there is any aspect of Government administration which commands unanimity in this House, it is that which recognises the necessity for improving the conditions generally of social welfare recipients. There is a climate of public opinion which favours the granting of <Col N="234" /> the maximum awards possible, particularly to the aged.  In this context I should like to pay tribute to <i>Independent Newspapers</i> for their constant advocacy of better treatment for old age pension recipients.</P>
    <P>The only limitation was said to be the non-availability of revenue.  It was represented to the House not so long ago that the new and drastic changes in the system of taxation were designed to amass moneys to be devoted to relieving the lot of our social welfare recipients.  What are the facts?  Last week, when opening the discussion on the Supplementary Estimate, I asked the Minister whether he had considered, accepted, or rejected the recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts, under the able chairmanship of Deputy Jones, with regard to the amalgamation of the various Estimates for his Department under one heading.  I am very glad the Minister has accepted the recommendation of the committee.  This new form has certain advantages.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the extra amount necessary this year to cushion the aged, the unemployed and all the other people for whom the Department of Social Welfare have responsibility against the vastly increased cost of living could have been found by the State if the Government had been prepared to utilise the increased prices our citizens are now paying for beer, spirits, tobacco and petrol.  There was obviously no need for taxation on bread, butter, tea, sugar, meat and medicines for humans.  All the extra moneys required could have been found by taxation on luxuries and without any impact whatsoever on the price of the essential foodstuffs on which the social welfare categories rely.</P>
    <P>The picture is clear.  Was it not an appalling error for the Government to create a situation in which old pensioners and others are told, on the one hand, that their lot has been improved, while, on the other hand, when they go to purchase the necessaries of life, they find themselves heavily taxed, and that in a situation in which it is now patent sufficient revenue could have <Col N="235" /> been obtained from the current increase in the prices of certain luxury items, including petrol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a collective capacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to discuss collective capacity, then we shall find ourselves discussing every Estimate on every other Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, Sir, but I can refer to the fact that the pensions which the Minister described as improved pensions are, in fact, no improvement at all because any improvement is vitiated by the rapidly rising spiral in the cost of living.  The Minister has made frequent reference in his statements to the 1963 Act.  When that Act was on the stocks, did the Minister envisage at that stage the increases that subsequently occurred in the cost of living and is it his intention now to alter the rates in accord with the increases that have occurred, that are occurring currently and that will occur in the months ahead?  We are told that more revenue accrued to the Minister's Department by virtue of increased contributions from employers and employees. The employees had no option but to pay out of their earnings, but in how many cases have employers succeeded in passing on to the recipients the ultimate cost to them of increased contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is now with us and we must, therefore, face it.  The Minister as a member of the Government is in duty bound on every opportunity that presents itself to him to defend the position of the weaker sections of our community by guaranteeing to them <Col N="236" /> that whatever incomes they have will be preserved to them, ensuring that the money they receive holds its value and enables them to purchase, without taxation, the simple necessaries of life. It is in the present appalling situation that these people find it so difficult to meet the problems of today.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister if, as was represented to us at one time, there is practically an unlimited source of new revenue open to him and his Government, that in the circumstances of the cost of living now existing and the unfortunate portents for the future, there are classes in the community who should be catered for specifically and urgently.  The Minister assured us last week that there has been some easing in the operation of the means test, that the arms of the Department of Social Welfare have been spread wider to bring benefit to people who formerly did not qualify.  We have statements by the Government that there is a general improvement in the standard of living and the incomes of various classes and categories.  If these things have occurred, is it not obvious that, within the ambit of these sections of people for whom the Minister is responsible, there are distinct variations in the conditions under which these people have to live.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate that the non-contributory old age pension recipient, the person who lives alone, say, in a flat, is in an extremely difficult set of circumstances compared with a person living with his family, a person assured of care by relatives, and so on.  It would be well for the Minister to examine the desirability, as an interim and emergency measure, of giving special increases in the rates of non-contributory pensions to old age pension recipients who are holders of medical cards.  The reason I advocate that is that, first of all, no administrative cost would be involved.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  A colleague of the Minister, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, has stated that it is his intention, come what may, to make his Department pay its way.  I know from the statement of the Minister for Social Welfare that he is making a formidable contribution to his colleague in this respect, the sum of £254,560.  I want to know whether this item has taken into account the projected increases the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs announced when dealing with his Supplementary Estimate here a fortnight ago.  If it has not, then this is an unreal estimate of what the expenses will be in the year ahead.</P>
      <P>May I conclude by referring to the necessity for finding the additional moneys proposed in this Estimate to offset the difficulties which all the recipients of benefit are encountering as a direct result of the planned economic policy of the Government in creating a situation in which the price of bread, butter, tea, sugar, bus fares, medicines and other necessaries of life for the aged person, the unemployed person and every other recipient of assistance under this heading has increased?  In order to counter the direct consequences of Government policy, it is vital that these moneys proposed to be voted be passed.  However, I do want to make it clear, and I challenge anybody to counter it, that these moneys could have been provided by increases on luxury items alone so that these people would not have to suffer a diminution in the benefits to which the Minister refers by virtue of a constant cost of living increase which if it is not controlled or averted, can result only in a further reduction in the standard of living, already pitiably low, of the various people in our community for whom the Minister and his Department are responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Supplementary Estimate discussed last week was used by some of us to cover a number of points which properly arise on this Estimate, I do not intend to make a very long contribution.  One thing, however, I think I should repeat <Col N="239" /> is that the Department of Social Welfare have a great record for civility and service and, despite comments made by people who do not take the trouble to find out how to do things properly or how to make applications properly, the Department, as far as I know, will do everything they possibly can to accommodate those who have to approach them either for benefits or for information. It is only fair to make that statement here because on many occasions nowadays we hear Departments being criticised.  I probably have criticised Departments myself for their lack of civility and their unbusinesslike approach.  I have received nothing but the greatest civility from the Minister for Social Welfare and his officials.</P>
      <P>That does not mean everything in the garden is lovely.  It is true that many applications made to the Department for benefit are held up for unduly long periods of time because of regulations which have been in operation for a long number of years.  I suggest to the Minister he should attempt to remove certain restrictions which are preventing even a better service being given by his Department.</P>
      <P>I shall take as an instance the case of somebody who is drawing unemployment benefit or disability allowance, and this is one of the things about which the Minister should take strong action.  Somebody may bring it to the notice of the Department that for one reason or another, a neighbour may not be entitled to benefit.  Benefit to that person is stopped while an investigation is being carried out and the person is left without anything unless the local authority home assistance section help him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in many cases these complaints come from anonymous people and quite a proportion of them turn out to be incorrect.  I suggest to the Minister that unless the Department have very definite evidence that the recipient is not entitled to the benefit he has been receiving, there should be no question of suspending payment at any time.  I further suggest that if payment is suspended <Col N="240" /> and on investigation it is found the person is entitled to have the amount repaid to him, every possible step should be taken by the Garda Síochána to find out who was responsible for making the incorrect complaint.</P>
    <P>I am afraid this habit of carrying a spite like that against a neighbour has not died out in the country.  It is too bad to find some evilly disposed person acting in such a way against a neighbour as to cause grave hardship.  I completely absolve the Department from any complicity.  They are doing only what the regulations stipulate, but the Minister should tell the officials that unless there is very definite evidence that the person is not entitled to benefit, payment should not be suspended pending investigation.</P>
    <P>Another problem which arises again and again is that of the insurability of certain employment.  It is an extraordinary thing that a person can be employed for years, stamping cards, and with no complaint, and yet that man can find, if thrown out of a job through dismissal or illness, that as far as the Department are concerned his employment was not insurable.  It very often happens in employment within families or when a person is employed by inlaws.  The regulations are so framed that a man who has a large family, simply because he is working with his wife's brother and although he has been stamping cards over a number of years, is held not to be entitled to benefit.</P>
    <P>I suggest that is drawing the bow far too long.  I would appeal to the Minister to take some action to see that sort of thing is not allowed to happen in future.  If a person has been employed for a long period it is unlikely there will be any question of fraud, of stamps being put on so that the person can qualify for benefit.  It is just too bad that a person is debarred from benefit for the reasons I have given.</P>
    <P>Another thing the Department should include is the system of hearing appeals.  By question last year, I elicited from the Minister that in certain circumstances benefits could be paid to somebody who was awaiting a <Col N="241" /> decision on appeal for a long period. The question applied both to unemployment and to disability benefits, and the Minister's reply then was not exactly correct.  I have been trying to check and in no case have found an instance where a person awaiting a decision on appeal for a long period has received such benefit.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but the answer he gave me was not in accordance with the information I have now given.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that when somebody who is drawing benefit and is debarred, while his application on appeal is being reviewed, the onus is on the Department to have the matter dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  It is unfair that the person should be left waiting not for days or weeks but, on occasion, for many months before he gets a decision.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the officials are again working within the regulations but I submit these are regulations which the Minister should remove because if somebody who is awaiting a decision on either unemployment or disability benefit has no other income and if the local authority home assistance section do not come to his aid, he and his family suffer real hardship.  In fact, I am aware of instances of real hardship having being caused.  I know of a case where a man with a wife and eight or nine children were left without any source of income, good, bad or indifferent, until eventually the home assistance people gave them enough money to buy food.  After months, the Department decided the person was entitled to benefit and he got it.</P>
    <P>That is something which does not do the name of the Department any good. It is something which should be avoided.  I have been citing instances in my own experience within my own area and I feel sure other Deputies can give similar instances in regard to their areas.  In most cases there is no justification for the hold-up in the investigation. In regard to road accidents, we have had suggestions that a special corps should be set up and a special fleet of ambulances provided.  I suggest this problem in the Department of <Col N="242" /> Social Welfare deserves to have similar special treatment.</P>
    <P>I had an interview with the Minister yesterday on the very vexed question of investigation officers.  I wish to make it clear that I consider the Minister's attitude to be the correct one.  We have had a number of officials, scattered around the country in offices, known as investigation officers of the Department of Social Welfare.  Deputies and others on occasion accused them of going around counting the hens in the henhouse or the apples on the trees when investigating applications for non-contributory pensions.  The Minister decided to remove them from the country towns and put them into certain centres.  Immediately there was an uproar that this interfered with the good name and status of the towns concerned.  Those people were appointed for the purpose of investigating and I submit that such investigation work does not and should not take place behind an office desk: it should take place in the homes of the people who apply and I believe the Minister is perfectly correct when he says that is the way it will be done in future.</P>
    <P>I do not think any applicant, either for an old age pension or any other social welfare benefit, is losing anything as the result of these gentlemen and ladies being removed from the district.  It should be made quite clear to all applicants for these benefits that any forms or information they may require may be obtained either at the local post office or employment exchange and that there is no necessity for them to travel to the home or the office of the investigator to get information about these matters.  The officers should go out to them.</P>
    <P>The contributory old age pensions have been improved slightly and I was told by the Minister a few days ago that as a result of the change of the qualifying period from 15 to 20 years, an extra six hundred people have qualified and that this number would grow.  I again appeal to the Minister to implement the letter of the law in this matter.  The Act which set up the contributory old age pension scheme specifically stated an average of stamps over the entire insured life of the <Col N="243" /> person applying.  While I am aware that quite a number of people have qualified for pensions because of the shortened qualifying period, first from ten to 15 years and now to 20 years, I am also aware that there is a feeling of frustration and annoyance in the minds of many old people who started to work in their very early years, who worked all their lives until they were almost 60 years of age and who then, for one reason or another, perhaps because they acquired a bit of land or started a small shop, left insured employment and now have not the required number of stamps to qualify them for a contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Over the years these people have contributed very much more to social welfare than those who qualified for contributory pensions because they entered insured employment a few weeks before they reached the age of 60.  The Minister may say that these people did not pay towards contributory old age pensions.  He may be correct in that but the fact is that they did pay for social welfare benefits.  The Minister might have another look at this very vexed question.</P>
    <P>There is no use in his saying that the records are not there.  When other Departments, such as the Department of Local Government, required evidence as to the number of weeks worked by certain people, the evidence was produced back to the beginning of the Department of Social Welfare itself. If the Department can supply information such as that, I do not see any reason why they would not be able to produce the records in these other cases.  I appeal to the Minister to have another look at this matter.  I am very grateful to him for the alteration he has already made but I think he can do better.</P>
    <P>I also wish to call attention to the predicament in which a person, married and with a large family, who has been drawing unemployment benefit or disability allowance finds himself when he reaches the age of 70.  Then all the children's benefits are withdrawn from him and all he is left with is the allowance applicable to a man and wife. There is no reason why he should be <Col N="244" /> left like that and he then has to do what he probably never had to do before, apply to the local authority for home assistance.  The amount of money involved in remedying this injustice may be considerable but the Minister would be well advised to have a look at the matter and see if he can do something about it.  It is too bad that people who have been drawing up to £7 a week find themselves suddenly knocked down to slightly over £4 for no reason except that they have grown old.  The Minister should remedy this matter and if money is required to do it, he will not have much difficulty in getting it.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an incident which occurred at an old age pensions committee meeting which I attended this morning.  I do not know if the Minister intends to keep these committees but they do very useful work with regard to the non-contributory old age pensions and also in connection with applications for blind pensions.  At the meeting of the committee which I attended this morning, there was an application from a woman who is blind.  She is not completely blind&mdash; she can see to walk but cannot do much more.  Despite the fact that the doctor who attended her certified that her eyesight was so defective that she was unable to do any work and was not in a position to travel without assistance, the Department of Social Welfare officer who investigated the application interpreted that certificate as meaning that as she was not stone blind, to put it crudely, she was not entitled to a blind pension.  That is a very harsh interpretation and I think the Minister should look into such cases and see if anything can be done about them.</P>
    <P>I understand that the officials who decided against her were not medical people.  If an inspection were carried out by a doctor from the Department and his findings were different from those of the doctor who examined her in the local hospital, I could understand the attitude of the Department. However, in the absence of such an examination, I can see no reason why that situation should be allowed to continue.  I appeal to the Minister to <Col N="245" /> have cases like that dealt with in a different manner.</P>
    <P>I am aware of an almost similar instance in which a local clergyman who was chairman of the committee so resented the fact that another applicant, also a woman, was treated in this way that he took her to a different specialist who again certified that her eyesight was so impaired as to be almost useless.  As a result of this, a blind pension was granted to that woman.  The lady I met this morning told me that this was her second application.  She was first refused about 12 months ago and has been living on the charity of her brother since then.  These cases should be dealt with in a different way.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we find people applying for non-contributory old age pensions, people who missed the contributory pension by a fraction probably because they are a few stamps short in a particular year and so do not qualify for the non-contributory pension.  I had experience of one such person and the investigating officer in the case certified that because the man had taken nine acres of grass in the previous year on which he was rearing a few sheep, he had made a profit of £1,000.  It turned out that when the man's case was fully investigated it was shown that in earlier years he had been a herd.  He was a good judge of cattle and sheep and had been in the habit of going to local fairs and making a bargain.  Time and again he was listed as the buyer or seller of stock which, in fact, he did not own and with which he had no connection, except that he would get the price of the drink when the bargain was concluded.  Despite this, the officer whose job it was to investigate his means certified that he made £1,000 in the previous year.  We pointed out to this officer that it was absolutely nonsense to suggest this could happen and he promised to have it further investigated. He admitted he made a mistake. But he found there was another reason for debarring this man, and the poor old man still did not get his old age pension.  If he had another year's stamps or had signed for sickness benefit for a year, he would have qualified for the contributory old age <Col N="246" /> pension.  I am sure none of us can blame these old people if they have a feeling of frustration as a result of the treatment they get.</P>
    <P>If these committees are to continue and do their work properly, much more weight will have to be given to their recommendations.  It looks stupid to take people from their normal business to attend in a particular place in the middle of the day, to waste a couple of hours investigating certain claims, to bring in the people concerned, and then to find that somebody who will not go to the trouble of getting the full facts simply writes off their recommendation, saying the person is not entitled to a pension though the committee recommended it.</P>
    <P>One thing I noticed in the Estimate &mdash;Deputy O'Sullivan also referred to it&mdash;is that no provision appears to have been made for an increase to cover the increased cost of living at present. It is all right to say that the assistance people received an increase last November and the benefit people an increase on 1st January.  Do not forget that referred to the possible effect of a 2½ per cent tax on turnover. It has no relation whatever to the ninth round wage increase and most certainly no reference to the tremendous increases in the cost of living which are being artifically created at present.  Anybody who wants to find out whether or not living costs are going up for old age pensioners and those depending on social welfare benefit and assistance should check the prices of the ordinary articles these people have to buy, such as tinned beans and peas and bread.  I do not think the Minister can suggest that the 5/- they got last January will compensate them for the increase.</P>
    <P>Because this increase is likely to continue and become much worse inside the next couple of weeks, I would ask the Minister to do one of two things: either to make representations immediately to his Government to have a ninth round for pensioners and those in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and disability benefit included in the coming Budget or, alternatively, to get the Minister for Industry and <Col N="247" /> Commerce to stop further price increases before the matter has gone too far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appreciates the position as well as I do.  I would ask him to do what he can to remedy it.  If he does not, we will have to say to him he has not done his job.  I said earlier that I think he is doing it pretty well and should hate to have to say in a couple of months' time that he is letting down the people depending on him for their existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Questions have been asked about it time and again.  The Minister has given a stock reply which is becoming a bit hackneyed.  The Minister is aware that seven years ago a Commission was set up.  They sat for six years and brought in recommendations.  The Minister almost a year ago apparently made up his mind what he was going to do.  Yet we are in the position that we still have a maximum of £4 10s Od. a week paid to people on workmen's compensation, irrespective of family commitments or pre-accident earnings. It has gone beyond a joke now, particularly in view of the fact that one of the heavy drains on disability benefit is the amount of money which must be paid to those people in excess of their <Col N="248" /> £4 10s. Od. when they have qualifications which entitle them to a higher rate of social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>What it means is that the Department of Social Welfare are subsidising the commercial insurance companies. I do not think it was ever the intention of the State&mdash;it certainly was not the intention of Deputies on this side of the House&mdash;that that should be allowed to continue.  I do not mind whose feelings I hurt on this.  I believe there are certain vested interests who would love to see the decision on the Workmen's Compensation Act put back for years to come, because with every week that passes a substantial amount of money is saved to the commercial insurance companies.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, in the interim period, if there is a grave cause for further delay in bringing in the change which he suggested, will he not even at this late stage decide to bring up to a realistic figure the amount being paid in workmen's compensation? There is no reason why he should not do it.  It will reduce the cost to his Department.  It will leave him more money with which to do worthwhile things and, while it may annoy certain interests outside this House, it is the right thing to do.  I am sure that, on contemplation, the Minister will agree that it is the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are insisting on getting their pound of flesh.  Could I ask the Minister, if there has been such a tremendous increase in the amount of business being handled between 1963/64 and 1964/65 as is shown by the figures?  The figure in 1963/64 was £83,390 and in 1964/65 is £337,950.  Or has the Minister's Department been caught out by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as short-changing them to the tune of that very substantial amount of money?  We all agree that it is only right that each Department should pay their way and that it would be wrong for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs further to increase the already fairly high costs to the public because of the fact that another Department <Col N="249" /> were not paying their share but I hope the Department of Social Welfare will not allow the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to value their services so highly as, apparently, one section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Television and Radio Authority, are allowing them to do.</P>
    <P>I am interested also in some of the figures which the Minister has given. While, I suppose, there is no harm in being optimistic, I hope the Minister has not gone a little too far when he suggests that the increase in the number of people in insurable employment will bring in the extra revenue which he refers to here because that would be a very bad blunder and, at the same time, he gives a figure showing an increase in unemployment assistance of £222,000.  I do not know where the Minister is getting his figures from because if there are to be more people in insurable employment, surely the number in receipt of unemployment assistance should drop?  I am sure the Minister will not suggest that the 2/6 which these people got last year represents a further £222,000 in 1964/65 because it would be just too bad if that were so.</P>
    <P>The Minister, according to his own figures, expects that the number of people drawing contributory old age pensions will increase and the number drawing non-contributory old age pensions will decrease.  I hope he is right in that, but if he is, would he not consider that the stage has been reached when the very strict means test applied to applicants for non-contributory old age pensions could be relaxed considerably?</P>
    <P>Today I met a man who had been living with an aunt who died and left him a county council cottage.  The aunt had been in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension for ten years.  She had almost £400 in the bank.  After her death, the investigation officer discovered that this money existed.  He discovered it when administration was being taken out by the young man who was the heir.  That was three years ago and the Department of Social Welfare have not yet released that money, even though, under the regulations, the non-contributory old age pension would be <Col N="250" /> granted and the first £25 of that would not count at all and the next £375 would count only as £18 10s.  Despite that, for three years the amount which is still in the bank has been held up and every effort made by the heir and his solicitor have failed to dislodge it. If I give the particulars to the Minister, will he endeavour to have this case straightened out because it is one of the cases that are casting a reflection on a Department which is otherwise pretty well run?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonorMaryCrowley" hpid="Mrs. Crowley Mrs. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to several difficulties I have come across with regard to old age pensioners and widows' pensions.  One matter I should like the Minister to look into is the question of allowing old age pensioners and widows to cash their pension vouchers at any post office.  At the moment old age pensioners and widows have to come to their native town to cash the vouchers.  That is often a great hardship on them because they sometimes go around to stay with their married sons or daughters and, if they have to come back every three months, especially in rural areas, it is sometimes quite costly.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably say to me that if they notify the Department that they are going to change their address and that they want their pensions payable at another post office, they can do so but the difficulty about that is that, naturally, it takes a bit of time for the Department to notify the post office and then perhaps the person concerned has moved to another area where there is another married son or daughter.</P>
      <P>I do not think there could be any question of fraud.  These people value their pension books.  They should be allowed to cash their pension vouchers in any post office.  If there were any difficulty over a period of a year, I would agree that it might be a good idea that they should come back to their own town or village at the end of the year but in the interim, it would be of great benefit to them if they were allowed to cash their pension vouchers in any post office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point about <Col N="251" /> widows, for instance, who go abroad, to England, or to America, or to Canada.  If a widow stays away for more than a year and then comes back, she is unable to draw any widow's pension but if she is an old age pensioner, she is allowed to draw three months' back pension.  That matter should be rectified so as to give widows and old age pensioners the same facilities when they return to this country.</P>
    <P>While I am on the question of the old people going, for instance, to England to stay with married sons and daughters but who have to come back in order to draw their pensions, may I say that some of them are very old, perhaps 85 or 90 years of age.  I have known several of them.  In many cases it is very expensive and very difficult for them to come back and I do not see why the Department could not agree with the appropriate Department in England to visit these old people once a year and find out what their means are so that they would not be drawing non-contributory old age pensions while being very well-off.  I ask that for the reason that the Department of Defence do that for people enjoying special allowances.  As far as I know, persons drawing special allowances, either in England or in America, are allowed to continue drawing the allowance because there is an arrangement with the appropriate Department in these two countries to investigate the means of these people, I suppose once a year, to see that they are not drawing the allowance when they are over the income level set in this country for the purpose of pensions.</P>
    <P>When a woman getting a widow's pension is nearly 70, she is notified by the Department of Social Welfare of the fact.  She is told that she will be 70 in a month's time and that she must apply for the old age pension.  When she becomes 70, her widow's pension ceases but quite often some of the old age pension committees do not meet as often as they should.  They are supposed to meet monthly but some wait until they have two or three cases <Col N="252" /> before meeting and that may be in two or three months' time.  Meanwhile, the widow draws no pension, neither widows' nor old age.  She cannot draw the old age pension until the Department have given a decision.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to allow a widow to go on drawing a widow's pension until it has been decided whether or not she is entitled to an old age pension. Occasionally, not very often, there is a lag of two or three months when the widow gets no pension.  If she is drawing a widow's pension, she is nearly always entitled to an old age pension.  I should like the Minister to look into these matters which are not very complicated and could be rectified if he made some arrangement to help old people who are quite often in difficulties regarding their pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, at the opening of his statement, referred to the format of the Estimates.  Without dwelling on the matter, I think it would have been appropriate if he acknowledged that the change in format arose as a result of a recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of staff mentioned by Deputy Tully, what the Minister has done is to remove, not the expensive staff but the experienced staff from country areas and this has not helped applicants for social welfare benefits.  Local offices of the Department were in places where the applicant could at least meet the official and make his case.  With these offices now further apart, it means a longer time must elapse between the application and its investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I mentioned means tests and I make no apology for returning to the subject.  The Minister mentioned then that means tests were laid down by law.  As passed by this House, the social welfare code allows certain sums of money in certain conditions for the alleviation of the lot of social welfare recipients.  The regulations which govern these are drawn up by the Minister's Department for which the Minister is responsible.  Where are these regulations?  Where may copies of them be obtained?  Have copies of <Col N="253" /> them been laid on the Table of the House and where, or when, have they been brought up to date?</P>
    <P>The means test operates in the main against the person seeking a non-contributory pension and I think it is realised that these people are the least of our brethren in the community, least able to defend themselves against the estimation of means which is made.  From my own experience certainly, I am not at all satisfied with the way these means tests are applied and I propose to give the House some instances of their application.</P>
    <P>The first is the case of a small farmer who married late in life and who, at the time of his application for an old age pension, had six adult dependants on the farm.  I gave the necessary particulars when trying to sustain an appeal on behalf of this man to the Department.  Yesterday I received a reply from the Department stating that it has been determined by an appeals officer that the claimant was not entitled to any pension.  First let me say it is a fundamental element of justice regarding these appeals that the person appealing should be entitled to be heard.  For somebody to dismiss an appeal irrevocably without having heard the applicant is certainly not the way to administer this type of legislation.</P>
    <P>The reply goes on to state that in accordance with the provisions of the Old Age Pensions Act, he&mdash;the man is named&mdash;was assessed with half the yearly value of a farm of 48 statute acres of valuation £29 10s. on which were carried ten cows, eight other cattle and a quarter acre of tillage, allowance being made for the necessary labour.  On this farm, as I submitted and which is not contradicted, at the time of the claim, three sons aged 32, 29 and 22 were working. There was a girl, aged 19, at home and two other children away at school.  I said that the creamery return for the year was approximately £600.  That is not contradicted because the figure quoted here as the creamery return is £640 17s. 10d.  I should like the Minister to tell the House what value is put on the adult <Col N="254" /> labour of these four individuals on that piece of land in West Limerick.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what assessment is made in regard to these people for their existence.  I should like to know what provision is made for the further education of the two members of that family, or how it is that regulations can be so framed that in a case like this, of a man who decides to keep control of the family farm in order to ensure that the younger members of the family will have an opportunity in life, it is held that he is not entitled to an old age pension.  I should like any member of this House to try to justify that type of situation, where a family income from a small dairy farm of £640 disqualifies an individual from receiving some assistance from the State.  Great sympathy is expressed at times for these people on small farms who are the backbone of the country but they are unable to stamp cards or provide for themselves in any other way.  They are self-employed and may not contribute to the social welfare funds in order to get a contributory pension.  Yet when we reach the stage where it might be thought they would qualify we find that instead by some system of regulation, it is decided they can be wiped out.</P>
    <P>The other contributory fact, as I see it, is that there was half the yearly value of a sum of money in a joint bank account with his wife. Lest anybody might think that this was being concealed, I quoted the £560 joint account in the bank.  It seems very strange to me that we encourage young people to stay in the country and remain on the land and yet penalise the parents of the self-same people when they look to the State for assistance in their old age.  It is the kind of regulation that I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion, I asked the Minister if he would consider these regulations and see what could be done with them.  I believe it should be within the compass of investigating or appeals officers to have that liberty of movement which would enable them to do justice to any case put before them.  They should not be hidebound by any type of regulations which are <Col N="255" /> framed to suit the general case.  Perhaps a person might say it is a weakness to argue from the particular to the general or from the general to the particular, but here we are dealing with the welfare and happiness of people as well as with their very existence and we should ensure that nothing in regulations framed by a native Government will deprive these people of such assistance.  They work hard on their small farms and they produce a certain amount of wealth for the State.</P>
    <P>The other type of regulation which is used equally in this regard is in relation to a person who has property or a plot of ground.  I referred to this on a previous occasion and asked the Minister what value is attached to the occupation of a half-acre plot adjoining a cottage.  There seems to be some type of notional value attached to this plot.  You cannot detach the plot from the cottage but I should like to assure the Minister, and I am sure he knows it, that the fact that the plot is there certainly does not mean that the person of 70 years or over is working the plot or, that if he does succeed in putting down a bed of onions or something like that, it has a cash value which should be taken into account so as to reduce in any way the pension to which he would be entitled.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the question of widows' pensions.  There is the operation again of a means test.  As I say, neither the ordinary individual nor any Deputy&mdash;indeed nobody outside the Department of Social Welfare&mdash; can understand the regulations as they are administered.  Certainly I should like to see a copy of them and I hope the Minister in his reply will deal with the question of these regulations which are drawn up within the social welfare code.  The Minister has mentioned that they are brought up to date from time to time and I should like him to say when the last revision took place and where Deputies may see them, or if he will put them in the Library for inspection.</P>
    <P>In regard to unemployment benefit, <Col N="256" /> I want to mention the type of disqualification which can occur.  There are cases where applicants sometimes think they are entitled to benefit but after some weeks receive notification that they have been disqualified from a certain date for six weeks.  This is something which the Department should bring to the notice of the public because it will save heartsearchings among some individuals.  I know of a case involving a married man with eight children who was travelling four miles to work.  He left his employment because he was not satisfied with his conditions.  He thought he could better himself and that he could get work nearer home.  It is a very human thing that a person should think that and that he should decide that if he could avoid travelling a distance to work, he should do so.  He went to the labour exchange and signed his forms and has been doing so for four weeks.  Today I learned from the Department that this man has been disqualified as it is held that he left his employment.</P>
    <P>I do not quibble with the principle that if a person leaves employment, he is held not to be entitled to benefit for a certain number of weeks. What I do quibble with is that this is a fact which the working public do not understand.  It is not brought to their notice sufficiently that such a thing can happen.  I should like to raise the problem of this individual with the Minister.  He must now turn to home assistance because that is the only other thing left to him until such time as he is lucky enough to get work somewhere.</P>
    <P>It has occurred in the past that where home assistance has been paid by local authorities, such as in the case I mention, the local authority later find that they cannot recover the amount they paid on behalf of the Department when the individual concerned comes into benefit.  The only reason the local authority have to step in in the first instance is that the Department are not able to pay the benefit soon enough.  Now, local authorities cannot work miracles and, if a local authority do provide assistance, then they should be <Col N="257" /> recouped by the Department.  Local authorities have only a small pool in any financial year for the relief of such necessitous cases and, if demands are made on that pool such as the demand I have mentioned, that will certainly reduce the amount available for other cases that fall to be met.</P>
    <P>With regard to the payment of benefits, I should be grateful if the Minister could find some way to speed up payments administratively. There are regulations in regard to certificates and so on.  I have in mind the case of an individual who had been in a sanatorium.  The procedure in the sanatorium is to issue a monthly certificate.  Apparently the regulations require that certificates must be furnished at shorter intervals &mdash;subject to correction, I think, weekly.  What is an applicant who is getting a monthly certificate from the sanatorium to do?  Weekly certificates are required and he is waiting for payment of insurance or sickness benefit.  This may not be widespread &mdash;I should like to think it is not&mdash; but it is a type of case that ought not to happen because it is not just the question of the individual; his dependants come into the picture, too. This benefit represents the only weekly source of income for the family.  If it is withheld for any reason, that is bound to inflict hardship on quite a number of people.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister how the footwear scheme is administered by his Department.  What instructions are issued to local authorities in regard to the operation of the scheme?  What classes are excluded from the scheme?  Are the local authority, having judged the merits locally through their investigating officers, entitled to make footwear available, subsequently recovering the necessary percentage from the Minister's Department?</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I should like to refer.  I may be ignorant of the reasoning governing cases and I shall be glad to have the Minister's enlightenment.  I refer to employment exchanges and the register of unemployed.  On occasions people have approached me in regard to work. <Col N="258" /> When I have asked the local exchanges what the prospects are, I have found that the situation is that the man with a wife and children who is drawing insurance benefit is left on stamps while those who are drawing unemployment assistance are sent out on whatever work offers, even though those may be single men.  The Minister will correct me if my version of what happens is wrong, but I should like to know why a married man, with dependants, on a small weekly sum, may not qualify for employment while a single man, who has no stamps, is allowed to go to work.  I have no objection to any man going to work but I should have thought the greater obligation would have been to the person with dependants to support. The Minister may be able to give a reasonable explanation for the practice that obtains.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the Minister's Department is a very important one. It is very important where the weaker sections of the community are concerned. It is a Department which comes into very close contact with the people, with the aged, the infirm, and the weak.  These are all dependent on the Minister and his Department for what little sustenance they are able to obtain.  I should like to be assured now that the Minister will go over the regulations and assess them from the human point of view to see whether there could not be an easing in order to eliminate the kind of hardships to which I have referred.  This is within the competence of the Minister and I hope that this year he will give his earnest consideration to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked that the House pass this Estimate.  The Minister can rest assured that any Estimate dealing with the most needy sections of our community will receive the support of the Labour Party.  That support has been forthcoming in the past.  That support is there today.  That support will continue in the future.  It is only right, however, that we should make some comments both on the provisions made for those who need benefit and on the administration of the various schemes by the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> I cannot but agree with my colleague, Deputy Tully, in regretting that there is no provision to offset the further increases that are bound to arise in the cost of living as a result of the 12 per cent national wage increase, which is now being granted to all the strata of workers in the country and which, in a very short time, must have a consequential effect on the cost of living. It is all right for the Minister to reply that that has been taken care of, that the 2½ per cent was covered by the increase of 2/6 to the non-contributory pensioners on 1st November and the further increases on the contributory side on 1st January.  Nevertheless, there will still be that gap which will widen during the year to come and for which no provision appears to have been made.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I cannot but agree with Deputy O'Sullivan who stated that if the revenue from the increases imposed on cigarettes and drinks were put to the use of social welfare, devoted to the increases given in November 1963, and in January, 1964, it would have amply provided for those increases.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, there is no justification for claiming that the turnover tax and the consequent 12 per cent wage increase had to happen to provide for the old, the unemployed, the sick, the widow and the orphan. Indeed on page 2 of his speech, the Minister admits that a sum of more than £2 million in increased contributions from employers and workers is again going into the fund to provide for total increases, including expenses of administration, which only amount to over £5 million.  There would be ample to spare, without any other imposition, from the tax yield from the commodities I mentioned, plus the increased contributions, to provide all the benefits and indeed provide more than the benefits that have been passed under previous legislation.</P>
    <P>I would also draw attention to the fact that although we were being twitted with being a Coalition Government and derided for giving 2/6 increase to old age pensioners at a cost of £1 million, at the present time 2/6 increase to the non-contributory sections <Col N="260" /> costs only £454,000.  Therefore this latest increase in non-contributory old age pensions must be only half the value of the 2/6 increase given by the inter-Party Governments.  I cannot see how it was that a greater increase could not have been provided for this, the most necessitous section of our people who have nothing else to keep them but what they get from the State.</P>
    <P>I welcome an increase of 2/6.  I would welcome an increase of 1/- or 6d for any old age pensioner because I believe any increase is good.  However, I do feel that the increases granted during last year were not adequate then and will certainly not be adequate to meet the needs of the people during the year to come.</P>
    <P>Of all the things I deplore in connection with non-contributory pensions, it is the horrible and detestable means test.  I may be told that if the means test were not adhered to pensions would cost considerably more. I wonder how it can be justified that a means test must be rigidly carried out in every case involving a sum of less than £500,000 for old age pensioners whereas a sum of almost £3 million for children's allowances can be paid out regardless of means.  In the case of the old age pensioner, a thorough investigation has to be made so that Deputies complain that the eggs laid by the hens are counted, all contributions by a son are investigated and every sum that an old age pensioner may hope to get is investigated and calculated against him.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister it is both irritating and out-dated to continue the means test for non-contribuory pensions. It leads to concealment, evasion and fraud, and the game is not worth the candle.  We have endeavoured several times by question here to ascertain from the Minister what is the cost of investigation.  There is no doubt that the cost of investigation must almost offset any gain that is secured by depriving people of a pension for the period in which they live over the age of 70 years.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw to the Minister's attention delays in the payment of disability benefit and sickness claims. The Minister will be aware of one <Col N="261" /> case to which I have already drawn his attention, and in connection with which I got an immediate reply and immediate results, but nevertheless the complaint was such that the Minister should ensure that such cases will not arise again.  The local agent in my area sent in certificates amounting in benefits to over £104 so that they would be paid before Christmas.  They failed to arrive on a certain day and, believing that the Christmas post caused the delay, he did not notify the office for a day.  When he received no communication and believing something serious had gone wrong, he telephoned the Department&mdash;for which I do not know whether he can claim or not&mdash; and he was assured that benefits amounting to more than £104 were sent out to some eight or ten people who were waiting for their money for Christmas. That money did not arrive.  Immediately the offices opened a few days after Christmas, the agent was again in touch with the Department of Social Welfare.  It was only after the third telephone communication that any search was made in the Department of Social Welfare and that the cheques, which were alleged to have been sent out about 18th or 19th December, were then dispatched on 30th December and arrived on New Year's Day.</P>
    <P>That type of delay should not occur. I know it is human to err.  Any clerk can make an error and benefit cheques which should be put into a pigeonhole for one agent can inadvertently be put into the next pigeonhole and go out to the wrong agent.  I suggest that one telephone communication from an agent, drawing attention to a delay in the payment of benefit, should be accepted above an entry in a book that the cheques had been sent out. A thorough search should have been made in the office after the first or second complaint.  Instead, they waited for the third complaint and left at least eight families in my town without the means of sustenance over the Christmas period.  I feel quite sure the Minister or any of his officials would not deliberately countenance anything like that.</P>
    <P>Immediately I got in touch with the <Col N="262" /> Minister's Department by telephone, investigations were carried out, the facts were discovered and the cheques posted with apologies.  I suggest a tighter examination should have been made on receipt of the first complaint. If such delays are found to be due to carelessness or incompetence, the Minister should see to it that the responsible official is suitably reprimanded with a view to securing greater efficiency.  No man feels the loss of these benefits more than the sick person depending entirely on them, added to which, of course, is the consideration that money is never scarcer than during a period of sickness.</P>
    <P>At the moment I am investigating a case which I shall submit to the Minister's Department this week in connection with a lady claiming sickness benefit.  All the satisfaction she has been able to get so far is that her number has been mixed up with that of somebody else.  Apparently, in the Department she and somebody else have been allocated the same number. It has been clearly established, as the Minister will find when he examines the particulars, that the lady in question not only has the 26 stamps, which would qualify her for benefit: she has something closer to 76.  Notwithstanding that, she has been waiting four weeks.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has any idea whether provision has been made, and if so what, to give agents the benefit of the 12 per cent increase recently awarded to the Civil Service.  I do not see any provision in the Estimate for it.  Some of these local agents are full-time but a big number of them are part-time officials.  I understand a previous application for an adjustment of their emoluments was unsuccessful and I suggest now to the Minister that provision be made to pay them the 12 per cent, plus whatever award comes from conciliation and arbitration, where their present application lies.</P>
    <P>Even though some of these men are part-time workers who engage in additional employment, there are cases in my area where they give every day of their working week to <Col N="263" /> the carrying out of duties in connection with social welfare.  From my experience as a local agent in the days of the National Health Insurance Society, I know the pittance these men received in the past.  Their position has improved somewhat but it is still pretty close to starvation level. Therefore I would ask the Minister to endeavour to make provision to have adjusted the emoluments of these men who carry out a hard task in a pleasant and capable manner.</P>
    <P>I am afraid Deputy Tully stole some of my thunder when he appealed to the Minister to deal with the recommendations of the Workmen's Compensation Commission.  In this connection, a good deal of strain is put on the funds of the Social Welfare Department which normally should be borne by insurance companies.  If the maximum workmen's compensation of £4 10s. a week were increased correspondingly with increases in wages over the past four or five years, a considerable amount of money would be needed to raise the present figure of £4 10s. in cases where the insured worker has a large number of dependants.  If the recommendations of the Commission were adopted, it would save the Department quite a considerable sum in future.</P>
    <P>I have come across recently many cases where unemployment assistance has been refused on the ground that Departmental officials were not satisfied the applicants had proved they had genuinely sought employment.  In the past fortnight alone, two cases have come to my attention.  It is very difficult for a man to prove he has genuinely sought employment.  I suggested to one such man that he should go to the half-dozen industries in the town and not only apply for work but ask them to let him have written indication that he had done so.  I have seen the letters stating that this man, giving his name and age, though suitable for employment could not be employed because no work was available for him.  This case is on appeal and I cannot say whether it will be turned down or not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> However, I had experience of a female employee who was out of work and who sought benefit.  I told her to take similar action but of course her area of possible employment was more restricted.  She went to the apple-packing factory in Dungarvan where normally girls are employed.  Her custom was to go to the Isle of Wight from May to September or early October each year to work in an hotel, then to return for the apple harvest and work in the apple-packing factory until the following February.  She will follow that pattern this year.  Meanwhile, her claim was turned down on the ground that she had not provided genuine proof she had sought employment.  I feel there is something wrong when a person who secures evidence from an employer cannot have that evidence accepted.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if it seems that all I can do is put forward complaints because the Department do 95 per cent of their work perfectly.  However, when I receive complaints, it is my duty to bring them to the Minister's attention. There is one complaint which I have already brought to the notice of the Minister, that is a case in respect of which a question of insurability arose, and it went for decision by the Minister's Department.  The investigator found that the employment was insurable and the employer was asked to stamp the cards.  However, he has consistently delayed stamping the cards, thereby depriving the insured person of his right to benefit for a period of six months.  I have received promises from the Department that efforts are being made to secure the contributions but up to the present moment I have had no indications that the contributions have been received or that there is any hope of them being received.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that it is open to the worker to bring the employer to court but we all know that a man without money finds it very difficult to get a lawyer to take a lawsuit on his behalf.  They will always advise the people without money to go through the usual channels of approaching their local Deputy or the <Col N="265" /> agent of the Social Welfare Department. The only hope there is for this man is that the Minister's officers should do the work they are appointed to do: proceed on behalf of the worker, and see that he gets the benefits that are really due to him.  I should like the Minister to do something to expedite this case.</P>
    <P>Last year I addressed a question to the Minister and I repeated it at the end of the year.  It had to do with the question of Irish seamen employed on British registered ships, such as those of the Clyde Shipping Company in Waterford.  If an Irish seaman, resident in Ireland and contributing to our Social Welfare Insurance fund, is injured in the course of his employment, that company claim that, following a court decision arrived at in Ireland, they are free from the obligation of paying workmen's compensation.  In all fairness to that firm, I must say that they voluntarily pay to the man an amount equivalent to what he would get under the Workmen's Compensation Act, but they do not admit the principle that they are bound in law to pay him workmen's compensation and they base that on a court decision.</P>
    <P>I gave particulars of that case to the Minister when I put down the question and the Minister in his reply promised that the matter would be investigated. He also promised that if the investigation proved that action should be taken, he would see that such action was taken.  I would now ask the Minister if any action has been taken and if not, would he pursue the matter and endeavour to set right anything that may be wrong.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude on a cheerful note.  I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the booklet issued on 1st January each year which brings us up-to-date on the various changes that have taken place in the social welfare code.  I think that is an excellent production.  It is kept up-to-date and if there are interim alterations, the Department issue an addendum which can be stuck into the booklet.  This is a great help to Deputies, as it contains all the information we need to reply to the many questions that are put to us with regard to social <Col N="266" /> welfare.  I suggest that some of the other Departments, such as the Department of Health, could copy this scheme with advantage.</P>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to a footnote on the 2nd page of the Estimate which states that the private secretary to the Minister gets an extra allowance of £70 a year.  If there is any person who ever earned £70, I would say that the private secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare earns it.  I am but one of 144 Deputies who must give him continuous anxiety with the various complaints we get and the £70 that is given to this official is more than earned.  If it is within the Minister's power I think he should consider increasing that amount.</P>
    <P>I must thank the Minister for the courtesy which he himself, his private secretary and the Department have extended to me.  Whenever I draw attention to what I feel is a complaint, I always receive courtesy and consideration. I hope the Minister will continue as the responsible Minister dealing with the most needy section of our people and that he will press for the maximum benefits he can get from the Minister for Finance so that our old, our sick, our unemployed and the widow and orphan will get as much as the country can afford to give them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw attention to a number of grievances to which previous speakers have also referred.  They are not very major ones but they are most annoying to the people concerned, the poorer sections of the community.  I want to refer first to the serious delays in some cases in the payment of unemployment benefit and unemployment <Col N="267" /> assistance.  Unlike other Deputies, I do not find similar delays in the payment of disability benefit.  But a delay of up to ten weeks in the case of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit is too long.  No person in employment could afford to wait that length for the payment of his wages, and these people can less afford to wait.</P>
    <P>I have cases with the Minister's Department where the delay in paying unemployment benefit reached ten weeks.  I appreciate that investigations must be made into whether a person has the required number of stamps, whether they are properly affixed and whether the person has made honest and truthful statements.  But surely some benefit should be paid to him during the waiting period?  In nine cases out of ten, everything turns out all right, except that the recipient, although he does get back-dated payment, has to suffer the lack of payment during the intervening weeks.  Surely we should pay him something, even half, and proceed to recoup in the very odd case where a discrepancy occurs.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the previous speaker in his appeal to the Minister concerning an employer who refuses or neglects to stamp cards or delays in returning them to the employment exchange, thereby causing payments to be delayed to the applicant and causing him to forfeit unemployment benefit of up to three months.  I agree with Deputy Kyne that it is not enough for the Department to say you can go to the courts and recover from your employer.  The Department should take any action required against an employer who refuses or neglects to stamp cards or delays in returning them.  As Deputy Kyne said, these people have not the wherewithal to fight court cases.  They are loath to create trouble with an employer, even an ex-employer, because they feel they may be regarded in the area as troublemakers and that all employers will shun them.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I drew the Minister's attention when speaking on this Estimate last year was the fact <Col N="268" /> that in some of the small farm areas in the western counties, income from a small holding was credited to a son or son-in-law living with the owner of the holding.  That is getting away completely from the established position so far as the old age pension is concerned. An owner of a holding who assigns that holding to a son or daughter qualifies for the old age pension. But in the case of unemployment assistance, if the son is living with the father or mother or father-in-law or mother-in-law, he will not get unemployment assistance because the income from the small holding is attributed to him when he comes to apply.  In other words, the whole income of the farm is set against his application and in some cases debars him from receiving part or all of the unemployment assistance.  That is not fair.</P>
    <P>These people who hold on to their farms even though they have reached a ripe old age still run them with an iron hand and allow very little to the unfortunate son or son-in-law, who has to work very hard for very little. Eventually, even at the end, he has no guarantee that the small holding will become his, and very often it does not. Having spent the best years of his life on this small holding, he finds he is penalised by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Department have a reciprocal arrangement with the Ministry of Labour in Britain and in the North. That should be reviewed with a view to the extension of reciprocal benefits. I find people coming back from England who have worked there for a number of years.  The most they are entitled to on their return is 26 days' benefit.  Having contributed in England or the North for a number of years, it is not a good enough arrangement to have such a small payment made when these people return home.  Twenty-six days' benefit is very little.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister if it is proposed to increase the incomes of managers of branch employment exchanges in line with those of other State employees by the amount of 12 per cent.  Perhaps he would let us know that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> I do not think Deputy Kyne was quite right when he said that the Minister should have made provision because of the fact that the 12 per cent would create a spiral of commodity increases.  I think the basis on which that figure was reached was that both employers and labour would agree and that increased production and output and other methods would absorb at least a fair amount of that increase.</P>
    <P>The figure of £5 million increase in the Estimate this year is a very substantial one indeed and one which will give greater benefits to the sections of the community catered for by the Department of Social Welfare.  A further point to be appreciated is the great drop in the number of unemployed since this time last year.  We hope that that trend will continue.  It will mean that the extra money provided can do more good.  It may be, if that trend continues, that the Minister will find, as I hope he will, that he will be able during the year to pass on any savings there may be in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): This is submitted to us as an annual Estimate but I cannot help feeling that it is in the nature of an interim measure and that before the year ends the Minister will find it necessary to come forward with a further Supplementary Estimate to try to do, in some fashion, justice to the social welfare classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this House a few months ago, the Minister for Finance stated that increases given to the population in general in relation to the turnover tax at that time had compensated one million of our 2,800,000 people but, since then, the ninth round wage increase has spiralled off an increase in the cost of living of which we have not yet seen the end and it will probably be five to six months more before we realise what this ninth round wage increase will entail as regards expenditure to every section of the community.  In our society, like every society, when inflation hits us, the people affected are the retired people, people on pensions, <Col N="270" /> people self-employed in a small way and, in our society, of course, farmers who have no weapon against inflation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham mentioned that the social welfare classes would be covered as regards the ninth round wage increase and its inflationary effects, by increased productivity.  For Heaven's sake, how will increased productivity help many of the people in these classes?  I cannot see how it can directly help very many of them. He mentioned also that this substantial increase which the Minister has in his Estimate of £5,300,000 will be a tremendous help.  I do not deny that it is of some help but let us not forget that of that £5,300,000 it appears that £2,100,000 comes from the Insurance Fund.  I admit that some of that is Government&mdash;37 per cent of it&mdash;but the substantial part of it will come from employers and employees&mdash;in other words, from the people.  It is just taking it from one pocket and putting it into another.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with this Estimate because I thought I would see substantial improvements given out on the basis of all the money we are supposed to get in from turnover tax.  I find, for instance, that we have an estimated expenditure increase of £5,304,000.  When you analyse it and break it down, as the Minister quite honestly did, you find £2,614,000 of it applies to 1963/64 and £2,690,000 of it applies to 1964/65, so that brings it down to half.</P>
    <P>When we realise that in 1963/64 we got in only £2,500,000 from turnover tax and, in 1964/65, we ought to get in £10 million, £11 million or maybe £12 million from the turnover tax, or maybe more, I fail to see where is the generosity.  It does not seem that the Minister is giving us any help at all on foot of this turnover tax.  We are just as we were and much of the increase we have got has been paid really by the contributors themselves and there is no evidence in this Estimate that I can see of an overall generosity on the part of the Government as regards increased disbursements of money to the social welfare classes.</P>
    <P>It may be, indeed, that I am anticipating <Col N="271" /> the Minister.  It may be, indeed, that we will have a wonderful and happy Budget and that these people will be compensated in one stroke for the 2½ per cent turnover tax and in the second stroke for the 12 per cent ninth round inflationary effect on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us also why he has not taken into consideration in his Estimate the expenses of the 12 per cent salary increase in respect of his staff.  He stated in his introductory speech that it is not provided for and I should like to know why.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make is that I agree with Deputy Jones that the regulations governing some of these social welfare benefits should be made available to Deputies.  In a general way, guidance is given in the annual booklet issued by the Department but sometimes when one is consulted, one finds oneself quite unable to give the information sought.  One is constantly confused as regards old age pensions about which we are often consulted.  I have always had to tell people that I think they are entitled to a pension, that I hope they are, and that I would write in about it.  In most cases I am unable to arrive at any decision of much use to them.  Perhaps the Minister could give some better guidance as regards eligibility for social benefits.</P>
    <P>I particularly urge on the Minister the necessity of making more generous provision for the social welfare classes, the most unprotected members of the community, who have no defence against the increased cost of living and the progressive fall in the value of money.  They are in exactly the same position as other retired people living on pensions of some sort.  I often wonder whether some provision should not be made to tie some of these social benefits and pensions in general to the cost of living or the gross national product or some other index, in the same way as we are now trying to tie incomes.</P>
    <P>If incomes are tied to the national productivity figure, in social justice we should consider whether social welfare <Col N="272" /> benefits should not be somehow tied to some such figure so that people will not get an increase in social benefits on 1st January and find before half the year is out the increase is worthless.  In the past when there was a constant value for money, it was easy to arrange pensions and incomes for retired people.  Now, and for the past 40 or 50 years, we have progressive inflation in every country and some solution must be found for the people in these classes who have no protection against progressive inflation which seems to be something we shall have to live with in our age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are so many flagrant defects in our archaic and outmoded social welfare code that one could speak for a long time on them but suffice to say the man who pays 5/11 or the woman who pays 4/10 a week towards a stamp is getting very little in return.  The Taoiseach recently in reply to a Dáil question indicated that if the people of north-east Ulster were to join the Twenty-Six Counties, he would make available to them the same social welfare benefits as they enjoy in Northern Ireland.  That was a brave statement and one that was received with joy throughout the country.  If the Taoiseach is sincere in his overtures to these people, I think it behoves him to take immediate steps to up-grade the social welfare classes here and bridge the very wide gap that exists between the social welfare benefits payable here and in the North. It would be a practical demonstration of goodwill on the part of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare to ensure that the aged, the sick, the unemployed and all those against whom the winds of adversity blow hardest are adequately and fully cared for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would expect in a Christian society such as ours that we should at least conform to the standards in the North and not lag behind to the extent that we do.  I hope, therefore, that speedy steps will be taken to increase benefits to the unemployed, the sick, the widowed and the aged and when our standards are about on a par with those of our brothers and sisters in the <Col N="273" /> North, then we can look with enthusiasm for the return of these people to the fold in a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that employment exchanges were places where thousands of Irish men and women suffer for a time before they go to England.  It is a fallacy to suggest that our exchanges are employment exchanges in any sense of the word.  The amount of work provided by them is negligible and any work offered is of a most menial and arduous kind.  No wonder Irishmen have an absolute horror of signing as unemployed.  There is no more detestable place than an Irish employment exchange because one is dragged down to subsistence level there; one is humiliated and degraded and one's future hopes sadly blighted. The vast majority of those who were forced to go to these places abandoned hope, packed their bags and went to England.</P>
    <P>One would expect an employment exchange to be a place where men and women, having regard to their talents, aptitudes, skills and trades would be directed to places of employment. That is not so in Ireland.  Work in this country is virtually impossible to find.  It seems to me that all the art of man has been used to devise tricks and devices to deny the social welfare beneficiary of entitlement. Every possible device, trick and gimmick is down in the Statute Book to make it as difficult as possible for a beneficiary, even with the required stamps, to draw benefit.  Everything possible is done to ensure that he does not draw it or, if he does, does not do so for very long.</P>
    <P>The unfortunates who sign as unemployed can be caught out by innumerable devices, thought up by the wizards in the Department of Social Welfare.  They can be disallowed benefit on the grounds that they are not available for work, or not genuinely seeking work, or that they lost employment as a result of misconduct, which is a very ugly word. They can be disallowed benefit on the ground that they are not resident in the area sufficiently long to qualify. Heaven help the emigrant who returns home in the hope of securing employment&mdash;and many of them do in the <Col N="274" /> belief that employment will be forthcoming. If they are obliged to sign on at the labour exchange, they are denied benefit straight away and must wait a considerable time before they can qualify for any assistance under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>People can be turned down on the ground that they refused work that was offered.  This is a pretty good trick in the labour exchange.  Having been turned down by any of these tricks or devices, the unfortunate person must appeal and may be waiting six weeks or more before his appeal is heard.  What happens to him and his wife and family in the interim is nobody's business.  No one seems to care what happens to that human being or his dependants when the aspects of the social welfare code I quoted are invoked against him.  Clearly he can seek home assistance.  He has hit rock bottom in society.  He may now beg for home assistance or, as so many do, throw up his hands in horror and quit the country altogether.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are close to the ordinary people and know their sufferings and hardships are very acutely aware of the manner in which these devices are operated to deny people social welfare benefit, particularly unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  If a man happens to say to a clerk in the labour exchange that his wife was ill in the morning and he was obliged to care for her and the children, he would find in the post a day or two later a statement from the Department of Social Welfare saying that he was been disallowed benefit on the ground that he was not available for work.  If a man&mdash;and this is not an exaggeration&mdash;signing for unemployment benefit were to go in with a bad cough or a cold and is asked by some slick well-paid clerk how he is feeling that morning and he replied that he is unwell, then just as God made little apples, within 24 or 48 hours, he will be informed that he is no longer allowed unemployment benefit and should apply instead for disability benefit as he is a sick man, as determined by the clerk in the labour exchange.  This has happened many times.</P>
    <P>We have then those categories of <Col N="275" /> people who are denied benefit because, allegedly, they were guilty of misconduct under their employer.  This word &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; is a most obnoxious word.  I have sat on boards of referees to which boys and girls came on appeal, having been disallowed benefit for a number of weeks on the ground of misconduct.  They have pointed out that they were forced to quit the job by reason of the overbearing or tyrannical attitude of an employer; or by reason of the slave wages and the rotten conditions of the job; or by reason also of misconduct of a very nefarious kind by the employer from time to time, or because of allegations of theft.  These people who exercised their fundamental right under our Constitution to terminate their employment were penalised under the social welfare code because they exercised that right.  Depending on the decision of the officer who decides the cases at the tribunal, they may or may not be allowed benefit in part or in whole or, as so often happens, they may be denied benefit.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, the social welfare code has a class bias directed, in the main, against the worker.  The dice is loaded against the insured employee at all times under this code. That is borne out quite clearly by that part of the code which lays down that any worker, any insured person, who as a result of a lock-out loses his employment shall not be paid any benefit.  This is fundamentally wrong. That is a piece of anti-working class and anti-trade union legislation which should be amended and will be amended at the first opportunity we get.  It is bad enough that a person should be denied unemployment benefit as a result of being legitimately on strike, or legitimately locked out, but to include in this category hundreds of other workers who, as an indirect result of this strike, may be locked out is patently unjust.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that a strike can take place affecting certain essential services or supplies of essential goods or services, and that if that strike continues, it may result in unemployment in other quarters as a <Col N="276" /> result of a shortage of materials, goods or services.  People who are not in any way connected with this strike are put out of employment and when they go to the labour exchange, they are denied benefit under this code.  It is high time that kind of anti-working class legislation was amended and that all these tricks and devices which man can devise and which are directed against the employee and the insured contributor should be amended to give fair play to both sides.</P>
    <P>Clearly the employer is not penalised for exercising his right to terminate employment. Why then should the employee be penalised in such a brutal fashion because he exercises his right to terminate employment under, in most cases, appalling circumstances?  The Minister and his officials will understand that before a man or woman terminates his or her employment, the matter is given very serious consideration. These people realise that there is no alternative work and no man in his proper senses would throw up his employment and go on the labour exchange just for what he will derive from it.  There are always sound and cogent reasons why people terminate employment and it is clearly wrong for the Minister to permit this kind of code to be operated under which people, if they lose employment through misconduct of that sort, are denied social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>We have too many cases of people being denied benefit on the ground that they are not seeking employment.  I have seen many of these unfortunates walking about the town seeking work and being refused work because work was not available.  They are still denied benefit until they prove in writing that they were genuinely seeking work. These people are compelled to humiliate themselves, going around from potential employer to potential employer, asking him to give them a statement that they called seeking work and that no suitable work was available. It is not a question of just one statement; half a dozen are probably required before a person is again put back into benefit.</P>
    <P>One of the most obnoxious aspects is the refusal to grant benefit because a <Col N="277" /> person refuses to accept work offered by his employment exchange.  I have known cases of industrial workers, skilled workers, artisans, who were directed from the labour exchange to agricultural or labouring work of a certain kind.  Were they not legitimately entitled to refuse?  I have known cases where highly respectable girls, highly educated, well reared, were directed from labour exchanges to peeling potatoes in a chip shop.  One girl, who had been doing office work, was denied benefit because she refused to peel potatoes.</P>
    <P>We should have some justice in the matter of the payment of unemployment benefit.  Regard should be had to qualifications, to status, to the particular trade, vocation or profession.  A man should not be demeaned, degraded and humiliated by being directed to work other than that which is his normal pursuit or his natural bent.  It is patently unfair and intrinsically wrong that officials in employment exchanges should direct people to employment which is clearly unsuited to them and completely at variance with their status in life.</P>
    <P>There is one worrying aspect of all this as far as I am concerned.  All those who are denied benefit, unemployment or assistance benefit, by the devices I have outlined are no longer registered as unemployed.  I take it, that being so, they are not included in the unemployment census taken at any given time.  They are, in fact, a forgotten legion: they are nobody's children. It would be revealing if we had the number of people awaiting appeals today on ground of having been disallowed on any of the points I have mentioned.  It would be revealing to ascertain the number who have been so utterly humiliated that they have no intention of ever again frequenting a labour exchange.  They have hit rock bottom and they are either beneficiaries of home assistance or mere vagrants. Their pride will not allow them to subject themselves any longer to the humiliation that can be inflicted on human beings in Irish labour exchanges. I repeat that an Irish labour exchange is nothing more than a place where thousands of Irish men and women suffer for a time in humiliation <Col N="278" /> and degradation before they go to England.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at the figures for insured contributors and non-contributory beneficiaries in the &ldquo;Summary of Social Insurance and Assistance Services&rdquo; supplied by the Minister's Department.  It is very gratifying to note that more and more of the people coming into benefit under social welfare are people who are regarded as contributory beneficiaries and are thereby entitled to contributory pensions.  That obviates the necessity for this odious means test to which so many were subject for too long.  It is a grand thing for a woman who loses her husband to know that she can get a contributory pension without a means test.  It is heartening that an old man when he reaches 70 will get a pension to which no means test applies.</P>
    <P>What, however, of those who are still subject to this means test, a means test which is applied in a most rigorous and sometimes inhuman manner?  The contributory pension at the moment is 42/6 while the non-contributory is only 33/6.  There is a difference of 9/- between the two. I think I am right in saying that those of us who contribute to social welfare will not begrudge another penny, twopence or more, in order to bridge that gap and permit the Minister to be more generous with the non-contributory beneficiaries.  It is clearly wrong that there should be such a disparity between these rates of pension.  The widow on a non-contributory pension has to face all the hazards of life, the high cost of living, the difficulty of rearing and maintaining a young family in just the same way and possibly in the same circumstances as the widow who is in receipt of a contributory pension.</P>

      <P>There is an aspect of the social welfare code to which I take exception. It is in regard to men and women in the country where there is no employment exchange where they can conveniently sign on.  The people are obliged to go to the local Garda barracks and present themselves there for observation and satisfy the authorities that they are, in fact, in the area and unemployed.  It is particularly degrading that any citizen of ours should, as if he were a prisoner and had done some wrong, have to present himself to the Garda and have a statement issued in order to qualify for benefit. I would ask the Minister to devise other ways and means of satisfying himself that these people are qualified to receive benefit without compelling them to subject themselves to interview by the local Garda sergeant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> I had occasion to bring to the notice of the Department a very serious defect in regard to the payment of workmen's compensation on the one hand, and disability benefit on the other, in respect of a particular category of workers.  I referred to miners in particular.  It has come to my notice that a miner who falls ill of pneumoconiosis or coal in the lungs, as it is popularly called in those parts, has in many cases not qualified for workmen's compensation.  At the present time I know of miners who are suffering from this disease and who have been denied workmen's compensation by their employers.  They applied for disability benefit to the Department of Social Welfare as insured contributors with the proper number of stamps required to qualify and were denied that benefit or at most were paid only the difference between workmen's compensation and what they would be getting in disability benefit by reason of the number of children in the family.</P>
    <P>The Department presumed all the time that these miners were receiving workmen's compensation and despite the evidence we provided to the Minister's Department that they were not&mdash; the workers wrote in and said they were not receiving workmen's compensation and I corroborated that they were not receiving workman's compensation&mdash;it was only after great difficulty we persuaded the Department to pay the full rate of disability benefit. It is disconcerting, to say the least, to know that these sufferers from pneumoconiosis are treated in this fashion. If it is within the competence of the Minister's Department I want him to investigate the reasons why the people who suffer from this dreadful disease, after giving a lifetime of service in the mines of this country at the most arduous and dangerous work one can find, should be treated in this fashion. I want the Minister to investigate whether it was justifiable to deny such benefit to these people in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is some confusion in this regard.  On the one hand, it is felt that this is an illness in respect of which people should get social welfare disability <Col N="281" /> benefit; on the other hand, the Minister's Department feel it is an industrial disease contracted on the job and that workmen's compensation is more appropriate.  I should like the Minister and the employers concerned to make up their minds speedily on this issue to obviate the terrible hardship and suffering which can be inflicted on families in the interim period if there is delay in arguing out the case.</P>
    <P>It was a retrograde step on the part of the Minister's Department to withdraw from the local authority the powers and functions they exercised in respect of the administration of the so-called free footwear scheme.  As one who has some knowledge of this scheme, I can say that when the local authorities administered this scheme, it was administered in an impartial and just manner.  The local authorities, with their knowledge of the people applying for these free boots and shoes, were able to allocate them on a just basis.  The Minister thought fit a short time ago to take over the administration of this scheme and since then he has perpetrated some terrible injustices on the applicants.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the House is aware that under this so-called free footwear scheme the only people who are entitled to free footwear are those in receipt of home assistance and that a charge is made to all other categories of persons? A poor unfortunate who may be drawing disability benefit under the social welfare code, who may be drawing the disabled person's maintenance allowance, a TB allowance, or an allowance as a person with a large family who is unemployed or is in casual employment, all have to pay so much per voucher under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the House is further aware of the amounts that can be charged under this ridiculous and absurd scheme which is the negation of a free scheme.  An unemployed man can pay 5/- or 7/6 per voucher on a pair of shoes.  In fact there are cases in my county where under the scheme as administered the beneficiaries have to pay anything from 5/- up to 22/6 for supposedly free boots and shoes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> I would appeal to the Minister, if he is not prepared to take cognisance of the ridiculous state of affairs existing in relation to the administration of this footwear scheme to give back to the local authority the functions they had in this regard.  It is farcical to suggest that there is a free footwear scheme in any sense where the beneficiaries have been obliged to pay as much as 22/6 towards a 30/- pair of boots or shoes. It is as absurd as that.</P>
    <P>Clearly a change in this matter is desirable.  I do not know what the reasons were that induced the Minister to take over the administration of this scheme but I believe it is the desire of most local authorities in Ireland that the Minister should hand back that scheme to them.  I wonder if the Minister is aware in respect of this scheme that so extortionate were the demands made by his Department on the beneficiaries, that they should pay up to 22/6 for a pair of shoes, that in many cases to my knowledge and belief, the vouchers were returned to the local authorities and the commodities were unavailable as far as the unfortunate people are concerned.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by asking the Minister to indicate his intention to reduce the old age pension qualifying age to 65 years.  The overwhelming consensus of opinion in the country is that the qualifying age should be reduced to at least 65.</P>

I urge the Minister to have the courage to say whether or not he intends to reduce the age for qualification for the old age pension and to abolish the three-day waiting period to which I refer.  He would be conforming with the wishes of the Taoiseach by improving the social standards of our people and bringing them on a par with our brothers in the north-east of the country.  We all look with enthusiasm <Col N="283" /> to the day when we shall be reunited with our brothers in north-east Ulster. To achieve that, the Government could make no better move than bridge the terrible gap existing between the social benefits available to our aged, our sick and our infirm and those available to our brothers in north-east Ulster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>One can appreciate every Deputy taking an active interest in the Vote for social services, but one can also dispute the point made by the last speaker in his somewhat bitter condemnation of local labour exchanges. This country is not very big. We all have active knowledge of local labour exchanges.  Even those of us who have never drawn either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance know the position.  We also know our country towns.  I am speaking here as a Deputy for ten years, as a person of some experience, and I know the position to be that officials in social welfare offices are very kindly in their dealings with individual applicants. I know that indeed in some instances members of social welfare staffs go out of their way to bring into line claims which might not otherwise succeed.</P>
      <P>Let me also say that we all welcome the fact that the Minister has consolidated, more or less, this Vote under one heading.  The Committee of Public Accounts, of which I have been a member for a long time, sought this system and the Minister very kindly met the Committee.  It makes for more simplicity and better working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can deal with this Vote only on certain points.  Let me mention in this context that one can appreciate the saving the Minister has effected in his Department and the fact that such saving has not been effected at the expense of any of the benefits administered under the Vote.  The saving was effected through reconstruction, and I find from my part that appeals in all categories, old age pensions, unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions and all the rest, have been speeded up.  That does not show any <Col N="284" /> evidence of laxity or disinterest on the part of the Minister or his staff.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think it only right one should mention the facts as one knows them.  Whatever fault we may find, it is not that the staff of the Minister's Department have been unkind to anybody. I have yet to meet the employee of that Department who has been unkind to an applicant.  Fault has been found in regard to our social services generally and several speakers have contested the point that we are not doing enough on this side of our programme. I suppose it can be said one can never do enough in regard to social services in any country at any time, but it can be said with reason that we have since 1957 gone as far as our resources would permit us.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone can disagree that all social progress demands that special attention be given to social welfare. For that reason, since 1957, in every single year and in every Budget, the Minister for Finance in a Fianna Fáil Government has made provision for improved social welfare services in one category or another.  I do not propose to go on in that vein.  What I really want to do is mention a few points in the hope that the Minister will take note of them and do something about them.</P>
    <P>One point in particular I have in mind is unemployment assistance.  I merely mention this problem and, in mentioning it, realise that it is not an easy problem to solve.  We know that some farmers up to a certain valuation are permitted to draw unemployment assistance.  I realise that payment of unemployment assistance to small farmers cuts across everything we are trying to do in this way.  Unemployment assistance was designed for the industrial worker and qualification for it was and is that the worker be deemed to be able-bodied and genuinely seeking employment.  In this context, small farmers cannot be deemed to be genuinely unemployed. A small farmer may seek employment of a marginal kind.  If the recipient of unemployment assistance improves his holding in any way, if he buys an extra cow or an implement or improves <Col N="285" /> an acre of land, he is thereby deemed to have improved his holding and is liable to be cut off unemployment assistance.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should slant this regulation in favour of the small farmer and call it agriculture aid or some such name. Instead of penalising the smallholder for improving his status, he should be given some incentive in that direction.</P>
    <P>We are paying large subsidies from the Exchequer to aid agriculture and it is foolish to be paying agricultural instructors to advise farmers as to how to improve their holdings and, at the same time, to penalise those smallholders in their unemployment assistance for the mere fact that they have improved their holdings or improved their positions by hard work.  I shall not advocate any extreme measures except to say that as far as I know the Minister takes a reasonably sensible and wise view of these matters and I know of no case where extreme penalties were imposed for contravention of the regulations.  However, there is the danger that smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance will be stultified, or get into a groove in not improving their land, and, therefore, we should try to direct assistance to them through different channels.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my thanks to the Minister for accepting a point I made previously regarding the payment of unemployment assistance.  It concerned a case of a recipient whose assistance was cut off and whose appeal was pending.  The Minister made the decision in that appeal retrospective in order to ensure that the applicant would be paid from the date he was cut off rather than from the date of the decision of the appeal. We appreciate that.</P>
    <P>Another small point I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister is that there is some inequity in dealing with widows' pensions.  You will find certain widows, widows who are blind, and up to the age of 70 years, they can draw a blind pension and a widow's pension.  On reaching 70 years, the blind pension ceases because of the fact that the blind pension and the <Col N="286" /> old age pension go together and so a person cannot continue to receive the blind pension.  I should like to see that system smoothed out to provide that persons in that category who have been in receipt of a dual pension will not have their standards lowered on reaching the age of 70.</P>
    <P>We all know that the Minister's Department deals with an enormous number of claims.  For my own part, I have given the Minister as much annoyance as any other Deputy and I must admit that I have always found him more than well disposed to any particular case submitted to him.  On that account I must add my voice to those of other Deputies here in paying tribute to his enthusiasm in providing all the social welfare benefits possible for our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Carter put his finger on the trouble spot of the Department when he said that he has given the Minister as much annoyance as any other Deputy in continually writing letters to the Department about unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, national health, widows' and orphans' pensions and old age pensions.  Surely if a person is entitled to any of these social benefits, there should be no necessity for Deputies to write to the Minister in support of his claim? Deputy Carter has pointed out that he is continually pestering the Minister about these other matters, as is every other Deputy, so there must be something wrong with the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>Prior to the establishment of the State, we were educated to look on civil servants with suspicion and they looked on the people with suspicion, but since the establishment of the State, the Army, the Garda and all other officials of the State have become the friends of the people and are taken into the confidence of the people, with one exception, that is, the investigating officer.  He is the enemy of the people throughout the country; he is looked upon with suspicion; and he looks with suspicion on the people.  It is on the question of the means test that I want to say a few words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> I come from a very poor constituency, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle well knows.  A great number of the people there are depending on unemployment benefit, national health and old age pensions.  We have a number of fishermen, part-time fishermen particularly, and I believe they are being very unfairly treated by the Department of Social Welfare.  They are scattered all along the Rosses, Gweedore and the north-west coast of the county. Take two brothers living in the same circumstances.  One has to migrate to Great Britain, where he is paid a fairly liberal wage.  He may come back at the end of eight months with as much as £600 or £700 saved as a result of his labour there.  He immediately becomes entitled to unemployment assistance and, in some cases, as a result of an agreement entered into by the late Deputy Norton and the British Government, to unemployment benefit. He can continue to draw it for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>But his brother who is a fisherman decides to remain in this country and to fish for salmon.  During the salmon fishing season, which is at most eight to ten weeks, there are many nights when he goes to sea and for various reasons fishes all night and catches nothing.  But the fact that he has gone to sea debars him from proving unemployment during that day.  Supposing he is fortunate enough to catch during that season £100 worth of fish, that £100 is assessed as means for unemployment assistance.  Surely that is wrong?  If his brother can go to England and earn £600 or £700, why should he not be entitled to be classified in the same category?  His earnings from his livelihood as a fisherman should not be assessed against his means.  I would appeal now to the Minister to see that these unfortunate fisherman from Teelin and Arranmore Island areas will not be victimised in this way in future but will be treated in the same manner as their brothers who are unfortunately compelled to migrate but who later return.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Carter says, that down through the years the various Ministers for Social Welfare have increased <Col N="288" /> the benefits payable, but, so surely as there is an increase, around comes public enemy No. 1, the investigation officer, reinvestigating the means.  What happens?  Up goes the means and down comes the amount of benefit.  I have known many people who have had their means doubled within the past five or six years, despite the fact that their visible means are the same as they were five or six years ago.  That is very unfair.</P>
    <P>Quite recently in our courts I came across a case of poor man whose poor law valuation was 3/- for the land he owned.  Three different social welfare officers went into the box and swore that they assessed the profit on that farm of 3/- poor law valuation at £18 a year.  Is that fair?  If these people are making £18 a year on a valuation of 3/-, I wonder what the gentlemen we were referring to last night on the Land Bill, the gentlemen whose poor law valuation is £50, are making?</P>
    <P>The Minister should look into the manner in which investigation officers assess the means of recipients of unemployment assistance living on very small uneconomic holdings.  Just imagine a poor law valuation of 3/-! The Minister knows the case I am referring to.  The man's means were assessed at £18 profit.  I know there are very hardworking men in that locality and that they take every ounce they can out of the barren rocks on which they live, but they cannot work miracles and take £18 profit out of a poor law valuation of 3/-.  The Minister should review that.  If he does not, he will drive more of these people out of the country.</P>
    <P>We have all heard of the good work which Father McDyer is doing in north-west Donegal through the Errigal Co-operative Society.  Again, his efforts are being frustrated by the Department of Social Welfare.  This co-operative society is being set up in the Glencolumbkille area, one of the poorest parts of the west of Ireland, a fíor-Ghaeltacht area, an area in which every effort is being made to stem the flow of emigration.  Fr. McDyer, with the assistance of others, has done a wonderful job there.  He has, first, <Col N="289" /> encouraged the small crofters, who prior to this were in receipt of unemployment assistance, to plant vegetables on their small holdings.  We know that may not be economic for a few years.  But, so surely as these small farmers follow the advice of Fr. McDyer, they immediately lose their unemployment assistance.  If the investigation officer comes around and finds them tilling a plot with vegetables for the co-operative society, they are immediately debarred from drawing unemployment assistance in respect of the day on which they are working.</P>
    <P>Again, if these small farmers are fortunate enough to make £50 or £60 &mdash;and that would be a very high average indeed&mdash;on the sale of their produce to the co-operative society, that £50 or £60 is taken into account in assessing their means, and unemployment assistance is cut down accordingly.  That is no encouragement to people such as Fr. McDyer, to those engaged in trying to stem emigration and to those engaged in trying to make economic holdings out of these uneconomic holdings in the mountainous districts of the Gaeltacht.  Surely they should not be doubly victimised?  They should not be victimised, first, for engaging in manual work on their own land and, secondly, they should not be victimised by taking into account in assessing their means whatever profit they make.</P>
    <P>I would make an appeal to the Minister to co-operate with Fr. McDyer.  He knows exactly the case Fr. McDyer has put to him, that unemployment assistance should be treated as a social service so far as the people in these uneconomic patches are concerned.  If the Minister can do that, I can assure him that despite the activities of his investigation officers, he will have the blessings, the thanks and the prayers of the people in those localities.</P>
    <P>I wish to complain, as other Deputies have, about delays in payment of old age pensions, unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  I have known applicants for old age pensions whose claims have been held up for months and months because the investigation officer has <Col N="290" /> not had time to investigate their means.  If the Minister would pay these people the maximum pension at the beginning, investigate their means afterwards and, if they are found not to be entitled to the full pension, deduct what overpayment they may have received, it would be much more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Another complaint is this.  When it is finally decided, possibly after two or three months' investigation, that an old age pensioner is entitled to the full pension, the pension book is issued to the pensioner but the arrears of pension are not paid for some weeks afterwards.  That is very unfair.  Surely, once it is decided that a person is entitled to the old age pension, the full amount of the pension and arrears should be paid forthwith?  I am personally aware of these cases and that is one of the reasons why I quote them.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is this: A person applies for unemployment assistance and is turned down on the question of availability for work, ability to work and the fact that he may not be genuinely seeking work.  Prior to 1948, the applicant for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit had the right to appeal to a court of referees.  That court was comprised of a professional chairman, a representative of the employers and a representative of the employees.  They knew local circumstances; they knew the local facts of the case.  They heard the evidence. They heard the investigation officer. They heard the representatives of the Department.  They heard the workman and any witnesses whom he could call in support of his case.</P>
    <P>What happened?  That court of referees has been abolished and now if an officer of the Department turns down an applicant for unemployment assistance, the applicant has the right to appeal.  Appeal to whom?&mdash;to another officer in the same Department. I do not think that is fair at all because both officers are servants of the Minister and, sometimes, indeed, the appeals officer does reverse a decision of the junior officer but, human nature being what it is, it is not fair <Col N="291" /> to him because if sufficient appeals are reversed by the senior officer, that junior officer eventually will be rapped across the knuckles.  The Minister should consider reverting to the old system of courts of referees and trial by one's peers.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Treacy who referred to the humiliating queuing up of applicants for unemployment assistance at Garda barracks and labour exchanges.  There is a sufficient number of peace commissioners throughout the country and it should suffice for an applicant to appear once a week before a peace commissioner, swear a declaration that he was genuinely unemployed during the week, that he was available for work and genuinely seeking work.  Also, instead of requiring attendance at the labour exchange for payment of unemployment assistance, the moneys due to such applicant should be sent out by post.  If that were done, it would save a considerable amount of the hardship which poor unfortunate recipients of various social welfare benefits suffer.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer If the recipient of a retirement pension or old age pension in Great Britain wishes to leave Britain and to return to this country, he will be paid while he is living here whatever pension he is entitled to on the other side.  That is only right.  Many of our migrants and emigrants do not voluntarily leave this country.  Force of circumstances drives them to England.  There they become entitled to certain benefits and pensions and if they wish to return to their native land it is but right that they should continue to draw those pensions when they come back here.</P>
    <P>But, take the recipient of an old age pension in this country.  His or her family may have found through economic circumstances that it was necessary for them to emigrate or migrate to Great Britain.  When the head of a family reaches the age of 70, draws the old age pension and possibly after a few years finds that he has no person to look after him, he is most anxious to go to Britain and live there with his sons and daughters.  If he goes <Col N="292" /> across there and remains for longer than three months, he automatically loses his pension.  He is entitled to a pension neither here nor in Great Britain and during the three months payment of his pension is suspended.</P>
    <P>The same thing happens if a person crosses the Border into the Six Counties.  The pension is automatically stopped.  If he comes back within three months, he will receive the old age pension but if he remains longer than the three months with his brothers, cousins, or sisters across the stream which is the Border, he automatically loses whatever social benefits or retirement benefits he has become entitled to.</P>
    <P>We in Donegal are unfortunate in that we have no home for old people in the county other than the county home, but in the neighbouring county. Derry, there is a very fine home provided by the Nazareth nuns.  It has been a bone of contention down through the years that if an old age pensioner from Donegal wishes to cross the Border and take up residence there, he automatically loses his old age pension.  Those nuns would be very glad indeed to keep the old age pensioner if they were assured that he would be entitled to the pension, and would be paid the pension.  The nuns would be prepared to keep him for the pension.  I have raised the matter here very many times and the answer I always get is: &ldquo;In certain circumstances the pension will be paid.&rdquo; Why should it be in certain circumstances? It should be in all circumstances. If a man wants to cross the Border into the Six Counties and live with some of his relatives there when he finds himself without friends and relatives in the Twenty-Six Counties, he should be entitled to draw the pension which he has earned while here.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look into that matter again and to do what he can to have a reciprocal arrangement made with Britain, and not to have it one-sided.  Recipients of old age pension in Britain may draw their old age pensions and retirement pensions here if they become entitled to them on the other side.  Surely if they become entitled to them on this side <Col N="293" /> and wish to go across the Irish Sea, they should remain entitled to them when over there and the full amount should be paid to them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Estimate dealing with such an important aspect of the country's welfare, particularly in relation to social welfare classes.  At the same time, I should like to express my disappointment that the Minister has not seen fit, so far at any rate, to raise the limit of insurability under the Social Welfare Acts, which still remains at £800 a year.  With the changing trends, with increases being sought and obtained within the past few years, a strong case exists that workers whose earnings are up to £20 a week should enjoy the benefits of the Social Welfare Acts.  There are numerous non-manual workers in this city engaged in the building industry and other trades whose earnings approach that figure and, certainly, are much more than £16 a week.  The Minister should look into that matter and take steps to raise the insurable limit.</P>
      <P>I also feel that some consideration should be given to the granting of children's allowances to old age pensioners who have dependent children. I believe that, so far, representations made to the Minister in this respect have been resisted.  I understand representations have been made in respect of cases of hardship which exist in the city and throughout the country where there are dependent children in respect of whom, I am told, no allowance is made.  The whole income tax code is based on giving reliefs for dependants and I cannot see why the Minister and his officials should fail to recognise this problem and handle it in the way I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a great deal of discussion about delays in dealing with claims. I should like to refute some of the allegations made.  My personal experience has been that matters relating to administration have been handled by the Department with expedition. I should like to congratulate the <Col N="294" /> Minister and his officials on that happy situation.</P>
    <P>The Department deal with thousands of people and are centralised and, perhaps, inevitably that causes some delay.  Possibly some review should take place with the idea of decentralising some of the activities to provincial centres.  A start has been made in the Department of Justice with the transfer of the Garda Training Depot to Templemore.  That is a very welcome move.  Some consideration should be given to transferring to main provincial centres on a regional basis some of the administrative work of the Department.  This should help to expedite social welfare claims.</P>
    <P>Under the present system, Dublin Health Authority take responsibility for the delivery of free fuel to those in receipt of home assistance but have no authority to arrange for delivery of such fuel to old age pensioners.  The authority's function is limited to permitting recognised hauliers to deliver to old age pensioners for a fee arranged between the pensioner and the haulier.  In the past few months, it has come to my notice that there has been a breakdown in that arrangement and old age pensioners in my constituency in North-East Dublin, in Howth, Raheny and Clontarf, have been denied that facility because of the failure of the individual involved to carry out deliveries.  It has been represented to me that this is because more attractive work is available to him and he has no obligation to the health authority.  It is purely an arrangement under which the health authority give him permission to take an amount of fuel to these people.  Beyond that, they have no responsibility.</P>
    <P>The matter will come before this week's meeting of the health authority on a motion I have put down asking the chief executive officer to investigate the question of providing a free delivery service for old age pensioners. I understand the health authority have no funds at their disposal for that purpose and I suggest the Minister might look into the matter and see if it is possible to give a grant to the authority towards providing that service. It is a reflection on our society generally <Col N="295" /> to see in Dublin city old age pensioners obliged to go to the fuel depots in all weathers and where they do not get the assistance of some able-bodied person, they must fetch the fuel themselves.  They should not have to undertake that.</P>
    <P>I should also like to support the plea made by Deputy Kyne in regard to the allowance paid to the Minister's private secretary.  It is my experience, and I am sure the experience of most Deputies who deal with him, that he is most kind and courteous in his position as liaison officer between Deputies and the Minister.  I was surprised and disappointed to learn that he receives such a small allowance.  If the Minister has any function in the matter, I ask him to see if he can get that allowance increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the position of people who are affected by a strike. Suppose a strike takes place on the docks, people who are not associated in any way with the strike are laid off. They are denied unemployment benefit. For over 20 years as a member of the Appeals Board, I have continually endeavoured to have this position rectified, but yet, even though a person has no connection and perhaps no sympathy with the strike, unemployment benefit is denied him if he is laid off as a result of it.  As far back as the time of the late Tadhg Forbes&mdash;which must be 20 years ago&mdash;I raised this burning question time and again but I never succeeded in having it remedied.</P>
      <P>I wish to join with Deputy P. O'Donnell in asking the Minister to consider the reconstitution of that Appeals Board because many of the cases that came before that body when I was present could not have been interpreted by a representative of the Minister without the assistance of outside evidence of people speaking on behalf of the individual concerned.  I have seen many times cases reversed on appeal but yet the situation of which I complain persists.  If it cannot be remedied in any other way, I think there is some case for the re-establishment of the Appeals Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> I also ask the Minister as I have done for the past three or four years, to give some consideration to the ceiling fixed in relation to the eligibility of those applying for social welfare benefits.  As various increases take place in the cost of living, whether due to taxes, indirect or otherwise, or to other factors, the old book of rules governing the operations of the investigating officer should be readjusted. The people now face increased costs which the benefits they are getting cannot possibly cover.</P>
    <P>There is one other small point which I am sure can very easily be righted. It is that between 9 and 9.30 a.m. when one is passing along Gardiner Street in Dublin, one notices that even though the weather may be inclement&mdash;it may even be snowing&mdash;the doors of the labour exchange are closed and the applicants are huddled together outside, while they could be enjoying the heat inside the exchange without harming anybody.  The doors are not opened until 9.30.  Some of these men have walked from distant places such as Finglas and they may be wet enough by the time they get to Gardiner Street but they are denied shelter.  It is a bleak spot and this matter could very easily be rectified without delay.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that applicants who are about to receive the old age pension invariably find that they are getting less than what they had before when they were in receipt of national health.  This applies to a very limited section of the community but, as Deputy O'Donnell said, the Minister by doing something about this would get not only the blessings and prayers of that section but might also get their votes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is really only one point which I want to make. There is general agreement on all sides that whatever Government are in office, they should do their best as far as social services and social welfare benefits are concerned.  When discussing an Estimate such as this, it is right that Deputies from various constituencies should deal with particular cases or points, or draw particular aspects of administration to the attention of the Minister, not in any carping manner, <Col N="297" /> not as criticism directed against the Minister or his officials, but with a view to trying to streamline or iron out any difficulties that exist, or at least that might be avoided in dealing with recipients of social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>It is in that spirit that I want to refer to a particular case that has come to my notice, the particulars of which I have sent to the Minister to see if anything might be done about it.  This is the case of a man whose unemployment benefit was disallowed by the deciding officer on the ground that he was not unfit for work during a particular period.  He appealed against that decision and the matter is to go to the appeals officer.  This unfortunate man's difficulty is that he is in a nursing-home. He cannot appear before the appeals officer.  An effort has been made to have the case heard and evidence on his behalf given by his wife and also by his clergyman who was prepared to appear before the appeals officer in support of the appeal.  I have seen copies of the medical statement and it would seem to me that it is an appeal which might well be allowed.</P>
      <P>The position apparently is that the appeals officer&mdash;and I am not criticising him or faulting him in this&mdash;feels that he should have the appellant before him before he comes to a decision in the matter but the unfortunate applicant is too ill to go out and his doctor will not allow him to go out.  There are probably other cases on a par with this and I want to urge the Minister to endeavour to ensure that the appeals officer will hear the other evidence, that is, the evidence of the wife and the clergyman.  It may very well be that on hearing that evidence, he may reach the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed, in which event this man would become entitled to the unemployment benefit which at the moment is disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if on hearing that evidence, the appeals officer decides that he still requires further evidence from the applicant in support of the appeal, no harm has been done. He can adjourn further consideration of the matter and convey his view to the applicant that he thinks he cannot come to a conclusion without <Col N="298" /> hearing him.  Arrangements of one sort or another may possibly be made in that event.  I would ask the Minister to look into the case.  It is a difficult one and the man is without benefit at the moment.  It may be that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some criticism of the Department was expressed by Deputy O'Donnell.  First of all, I want to say that recently I had a lady in with me who complained that because she had £4 15s. a week, her husband who is unemployed would get nothing.  I had a similar case of a man who was getting 1/6d because his wife had something like £5 a week.  It is rather unfair that a man should be deprived of any assistance just because his wife has a certain income.  I could understand it if her income were above a certain figure, or if she had property, but it is hard luck on a man when he has to beg the price of a packet of cigarettes from his wife and may not even get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard criticism of the Minister's Department and in the past we have heard criticism about what welfare recipients get.  I was surprised this morning when at a rent case in the Corporation, in which a woman was due for eviction, I heard her say that her husband was idle and that her differential rent was 17/6d.  I said that it was amazing to me that it should be 17/6d.  Because usually people pay only about 6/-.  She then said: &ldquo;But I have £6 16s. 6d. because there are seven children and we got a big jump in the last Budget.&rdquo;  When we are criticising the Department about what people get, we should remember that <Col N="299" /> a man can get £6 12s. 6d. although he is idle.  I have heard that in England people were supposed to get as much as if they were working.  We are approaching that situation in this country and it is nice to think that you can get £6 12s. 6d. although you are idle.  I have nothing further to say beyond repeating that I think it is strange that a man should be deprived of a few shillings just because his wife has £4 or £5 a week.  I will sit down and let the Minister in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister last night pointed out that the key to a successful policy of land division was that the necessary finance should be made available to implement the policy.  In section 3 of this Bill, as in section 2, the Minister for Finance plays a very big part in controlling the <Col N="301" /> activities of whatever Minister for Lands is in office.  I should like to put a question to the Minister: is it not a fact that, if the necessary finances had been made available over the years, with the existing Land Acts properly operated, the congestion problem, which is still with us in such a major form, would be greatly remedied today?</P>
      <P>We are faced with a new Land Bill. Have we any guarantee that the dead hand of Finance will not appear again, with the same monotonous regularity as it has appeared over the past 30 years as far as land division is concerned? I am not at all satisfied that the control with regard to expenditure on land division should be exercised so strongly by a Minister for Finance, but it is written in here deliberately in the two sections we have discussed up to this.</P>
      <P>The Minister said last night that it was all very fine for Deputy McQuillan, and others, to say that the sky was the limit as far as money was concerned and that they were irresponsible in their approach.  The fact is that no Government since 1938 have made sufficient money available to make even a dent in the congestion problem. The result of this interference by the Minister for Finance in the land problem has amounted to this: in order to appease the Finance people, the Land Commission were forced to buy or acquire inferior land in the majority of cases.  If the Minister says that is not true and that the Minister for Finance had nothing to do with the type of land purchased, then the Land Commission must take the blame for the fact that it was to a great extent inferior land, or lowly-valued land, the Land Commission acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not so very long in office and, if he does not believe that what I am saying is correct, I should like to remind him that his predecessor, Deputy Childers, was very clear in his own mind as to the amount of money the Land Commission were prepared to spend per acre on land for the relief of congestion.  I quote from a speech Deputy Childers, then Minister for Lands, made at a Fianna Fáil convention in Tullamore on 12th April, 1958: <Col N="302" />&ldquo;The Land Commission made a gift of taxpayers' money of £36 per acre to each person receiving an allotment... land would only be taken where this large gift was not exceeded&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Was the Minister for Lands at that time, in 1958, not making it quite clear that the Land Commission could not go beyond a certain figure in the price paid for land for the relief of congestion?  The Minister for Lands stated that £36 per acre was the gift given to a congest or a migrant who received land, and that, at a time when the average price of land in the west was around £100 an acre, good, arable land.  We can see from this the type of land likely to be made available to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Lands have over the past 30 years taken every opportunity in this House to exhort migrants, to exhort congests, to exhort those living on rundale holdings, to co-operate more with the Land Commission and successive Ministers have threatened to use the big stick on those unfortunates who they believed were not co-operating in the efforts made to solve the problem.  Is it any wonder that lack of co-operation was there when the type of land being dished out in many instances was of inferior quality?  The small farmer and the congest is fully entitled, in my opinion, to fight his corner to the utmost of his capacity in order to ensure that he gets a good type of land.</P>
    <P>I shall not argue on this section as to what the size of a holding should be.  That will fall for discussion on a later section.  If, as a result of this section, the Minister for Finance can tell the Land Commission that they must not pay more than £60 or £80 an acre for land for the relief of congestion, then the situation is a bad one. I should like the Minister to tell us what is the average price per acre at the moment paid by the Land Commission for land purchased for the relief of congestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give Deputy McQuillan some assurance with regard to some of the statements he has made here.  I know that what can be described as second-class land has been acquired here and there but <Col N="303" /> it has been acquired in areas where land was urgently needed to enlarge the holdings of the smallholders who were very glad to get it.  I do not know where the Deputy got his figures.  However, it was a great pity that more land was not acquired when it was cheaper.  I have seen a holding down in my constituency which we did our utmost to persuade Deputy Blowick to take when he was Minister for Lands.  It was a holding of 425 acres which a large number of unfortunate people whose predecessors had been evicted from it previously were waiting to have taken.  That holding will now be acquired by the Land Commission but it will cost four or five times as much as it would have cost when Deputy Blowick had the opportunity of taking it.</P>
      <P>As regards the congested areas, there is not a Deputy who has not congested areas of land in his constituency.</P>

      <P>In Newmarket there is a holding of 97 statute acres.  Surrounding that holding were seven <Col N="304" /> smallholders, the largest of them having 21 statute acres of land.  I admit many Deputies who have not much brains or much sense were messing around with this for a couple of years.  I got word on a Monday night that the farm was being sold by public auction the following Thursday.  A representative of the Minister for Lands attended there and offered £9,000 for the 97 acres.  He did not get it.  It went for £9,025.  However, it was acquired two months afterwards by the Land Commission for the £9,025.  That will give a fair idea of what is being paid for land today which, had Deputy Blowick done his job when he was Minister for Lands, would have been purchased for one-fifth of that money.  Anybody who doubts my word can look up the records and see that I raised these matters on the Adjournment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past week, another holding in my constituency has been acquired by the Land Commission. Some 140 acres have been acquired for around £15,000.  A third holding of 90-odd acres down in the Ballymacoda area was acquired last year by the Land Commission for £13,000.  To indicate the position of smallholders in connection with finding <Col N="305" /> land on which they can make a livelihood, let me say that the letting of that land for 12 months for grazing and tillage made £1,800.</P>
      <P>I have at present lined up for the Minister's attention three more holdings. One of them is a holding of 425 acres which Deputy Blowick let go and which unfortunately will now cost five times as much as when Deputy Blowick yielded to the appeals of the Unionist minority in that area and pulled out, for fear he would offend any of them.  Another holding down in the Ballintubber-Carrigtuohill area has been taken over from an alien.  Another holding in Ballinona, Midleton, has been taken over.  They will all be wanted and more of them will be wanted to make any dent in the congestion and to help the unfortunate people endeavouring to eke out an existence on uneconomic holdings in my constituency.  We must face that as I had to face another situation here when I appealed to have a holding of more than 1,000 acres owned by Mrs. Flowers of Cloyne taken over by the Land Commission.  The Land Commission, having had a long stretch of kind, Blowick guidance, took over 15 of the 1,000 acres.  If you want facts about land division, I can give you plenty of them.  Up to the moment at any rate, I have not found a single instance where either the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Finance put any obstacle in the way of the acquisition of land required for division among congests.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Bill very clearly states that payments made and expenses incurred by the Minister for Lands and the Land Commission in giving effect to the Act and in the administration thereof shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  We have had experience, and we know from close contacts with both the Department and the Land Commission, that there have been extraordinary delays in paying the owners of lands for lands already acquired simply because ample provision was not made by the Department <Col N="306" /> of Finance and the money was not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position.  Assuming this Bill becomes law and that the lands are available, that the congests are there, that the machinery is set up for the bringing into effect of the Bill, the Minister for Finance says: &ldquo;I shall permit the expenditure of only £x for the purpose of acquiring lands to put that section of the Act in operation.&rdquo;  What happens then?  It is well known that in cases where the Land Commission had not sufficient funds to carry on to the end of a financial year, in order to avoid the embarrassment of telling the client's solicitor that he would have to hang on until the next financial year, the Land Commission proceeded to set lands in their possession by conacre in order to get the money.</P>

      <P>Let me repeat that it is competely untrue for the Deputy to <Col N="307" /> allege there is any slowness on the part of the Land Commission in paying any owner for his land because of any lack of finance.  In 99 per cent of cases, it is the fault of the owner's solicitor in not proving title.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the experience of Deputies.  We hope that experiences we have had in the past will not prevent the bringing into operation of the Act and we are forewarning the Minister of difficulties likely to arise.  Deputy Corry queried the accuracy of Deputy McQuillan's recollection of a statement made by a former Minister for Lands in which the former Minister clearly indicated that only £36 per acre was paid by the Land Commission.  Everybody knows that at the present day land which could be described as good arable ground could not be bought for anything less than £150 to £175 per acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of land is always determined by the demand.  In one area it might not be more than £50 if the demand is not there, but in another area, in a congested district, where there are a number of prospective purchasers, land could go as high as £200 per acre and has gone more than £200 in many cases.  Therefore, I say Deputy McQuillan's argument must be taken seriously.  A former Minister for Lands said that the Land Commission's expenditure only rose to £36 an acre.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must take what he said as accurate.  The Minister has the assistance of very able and efficient officials.  They go to great rounds to supply the Minister with <Col N="308" /> accurate statistics.  Here we have a statement by the Minister for Lands at the time to the effect that an average sum of £36 per acre was paid. What type of land could you get at such a price?  It certainly could not be described as first quality.</P>
      <P>I should like to get a more definite assurance from the Minister on this section that the Minister for Finance will not in any way curtail the activities of the Land Commission.  I view the section with very great suspicion. I am afraid of this section.  I am afraid that no matter how enthusiastic the Minister may feel, no matter how deeply he feels for congests in his constituency and elsewhere, no matter how eager he may be to relieve the problem of congestion which exists, as Deputy Corry said, in every constituency in Ireland, the Minister for Finance may cut in and curtail the operation of the Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, when faced with the provisions of the Act, may say: &ldquo;This year, I shall be generous in the allocation of State money for Land Commission purchase of land, for the erection of buildings in congested areas and other districts.&rdquo; In another year, however, the Minister for Finance may say: &ldquo;The Land Commission have had it good up to this; I shall cut down their operations.&rdquo; In such circumstances, what provision is there in the Bill to help the Minister implement it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The undertaking the Minister gave the House last night on section 3 is insufficient.  We know the Minister for Lands cannot speak for another Minister; we know it would not be fair of the House to ask the Minister for Lands to give an undertaking for the Minister for Finance.  It is something he cannot do.  We may take it that there is such a thing as collective responsibility in this Government.  If that collective responsbility exists, we are safe in taking an undertaking from the Minister for Lands that no financial crisis will arise in relation to the financing of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  On the other hand, if you have not that co-operation between the two Ministers, I can see this Bill ending in disaster, being left on the shelves in <Col N="309" /> Merrion Street, covered with cobwebs and dust.  We have enough plans, schemes and Acts in the Land Commission and in other Departments hidden away covered with dust and we do not want to see the Land Bill of 1963 joining them.</P>

Here in section 3, we are asking the Minister for Lands to give an undertaking for another Minister who is not in the House to answer for himself.  He cannot give an undertaking that there will be no lack of money to implement this Bill. I am seriously suggesting to the Minister that he will find himself in a seriously embarrassing position if the occasion arises, as outlined by Deputy McQuillan and myself, that money will not be forthcoming for the implementation of the various sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>That is why I should like to hear from the Minister a greater degree of undertaking on his own behalf and on behalf of his colleague so that it may be on record that the Minister for Lands has committed the Minister for Finance.  I think this is an occasion on which the Minister should commit the Minister for Finance.  We are all very enthusiastic about this Bill and about its implementation but we are whipping a dead horse unless we are satisfied that section 3 will not be a hindrance to the good intentions behind the principles of the Bill.  I should like to have more definite assurances from the Minister in that regard.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of intervening in this debate, but having heard the case made by Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Flanagan, I thought that as a Deputy coming from the land I should flatly contradict the statements they have made here in relation to the Department of Finance. My experience is that when the Coalition Government were in office, the finance for the purchase of land was not forthcoming and I came across cases of people from whom land was acquired and who were not paid for two years.</P>
      <P>With regard to the statement made by Deputy McQuillan that Deputy Childers had stated that no more than £38 an acre would be paid for land, I am glad to be able to inform that Deputy that 10,000 acres have been acquired in my constituency in the past two or three years, more land acquired in one year than was acquired in six years of Coalition Government, and the price paid was up to £150 an acre, for the best land in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am not responsible for the compositors on that particular paper, nor am I prepared to accept the accuracy of a newspaper report, no matter what paper it is, with regard to this particular figure, when everybody knows that anybody who sold land to the Land Commission or from whom it was acquired had to get the market value of the land under the law of this House.  If any person is not satisfied with the price offered, then he has the right of appeal to the Appeals Tribunal which fixed the market value of the land in 1958 as well as today.  Any other land acquired by the Land Commission in that year would have to be acquired by voluntary negotiations with the owners concerned. In that instance, if they sold land at the low figure suggested here, I take it they were glad to make that deal on a voluntary basis with the Land Commission.  If they could get anything extra from any other purchaser, they would certainly do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is not new.  In fact, it is a regular section relating to finance which is in practically all Acts passed by this House.  This is well known to the Deputies opposite.  This is a deliberate attempt to obstruct the passage of this Bill.  When Deputy Flanagan, to quote him, &ldquo;has very grave suspicion of this section&rdquo; and &ldquo;fears very much as to what may happen because of this section,&rdquo; he conveniently forgets that the Land Bill of 1950, passed by the Government in which he served, contains the very same section.  Section <Col N="312" /> 4 of the 1950 Act reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The payments made and expenses incurred by the Minister and by the Land Commission in giving effect to this Act and in the administration thereof shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of the moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If we went back to the records of the House for 1950, I wonder would we find there grave suspicion expressed by Deputy Flanagan about the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Finance in that year?  If Deputy Flanagan expressed grave suspicion of the then Minister for Finance, he would be right on the ball.  That very Act of 1950 was supposed to enable the Land Commission to purchase land on the open market, but the sinews of war provided by the then Minister for Finance to give effect to that Act amounted to £1,400 in that year.</P>
    <P>Let me now come to a further Land Act passed in the year 1953, and let me quote section 3 of that Act:</P>
    <P>The payments made and expenses incurred by the Minister for Lands and by the Land Commission to give effect to this Act and in the administration thereof shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of the moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy Flanagan on record in 1953 as expressing his fears, his doubts, his grave suspicions of what the Minister for Finance did under that section? In section 3 of this Bill, we have the same provision, word for word, which has been sanctioned in every one of these Land Acts, which must be there to enable the Minister for Finance to provide the moneys to implement the Acts.  I am sure Deputy Flanagan knows that very well, but he wants to try to create these fears and delay as long as possible the passage of this Bill.  I suppose I should not be surprised at this, because the Deputy and his colleagues are probably licking their wounds after recent events and must do something in this House to try to create a different image of themselves in the public mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> Deputy McQuillan asked me the average price paid by the Land Commission for land.  I could not give him the figures without notice, but I can tell him that during the past five years, with which I am familiar, approximately 206,000 acres were allotted to approximately 11,000 allottees, that the cost of the land, speaking from memory, was approximately £4.5 million and that, in addition, the Land Commission expended approximately £3.3 million on improvements.  That is a very substantial expenditure for this purpose. I do not say it is too much.  Let nobody suggest a very substantial amount of money has not been provided for this purpose over the years.  The Deputy can see the figures quoted in the papers day after day on the decisions given by the Appeals Tribunal on the question of price. The Land Commission must pay the market value for any land they acquire, unless the land is acquired by agreement.  But in that case the people who sell the land believe the Land Commission are the best purchasers and that the price they offer is the best price they can get.  If the Land Commission exercise their powers of compulsory acquisition, the persons dissatisfied with the price offered by the Land Commission have the right under law &mdash;a right regularly exercised&mdash;to appeal on the question of price to the Appeals Tribunal, which is presided over by a High Court judge.  In that court, they are entitled to call as many auctioneers and valuers as they wish to give evidence on their behalf. It is for the court to decide what is the market value of the land.</P>
    <P>It is therefore a complete fairy tale to suggest there is any limit per acre on the amount to be paid by the Land Commission for land.  In many cases the Land Commission must compete on the open market to get land.  In fact, under this Bill, the limitations prescribed by the 1950 Act will go altogether, and under the powers sought here, the Land Commission will be enabled to purchase land, not for the limited purposes and under the conditions set out in the 1950 Act&mdash;<Col N="314" /> that the land is for the provision of migrant holdings and that there must be intermixed plots in the immediate vicinity&mdash;but for any of the purposes under this Bill.  Of course, the Land Commission can succeed in getting land only if they are prepared to pay the market value, which is what the law lays down.  I respectfully suggest that sufficient of the time of this House has been wasted, deliberately or otherwise, in discussion of a section that is in every Land Act for as long as I remember.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, in fact, made the strongest case that has been made in the House against the section because he points out that because of this section in a previous Act, the Minister for Finance was able to impede the working of that Act. What stronger case could be made against the section than that?  Having had that experience, is it not rather surprising that the Minister for Lands did not take the opportunity of changing the wording of the section so that nobody could suggest that the Bill would be held up by the Minister for Finance?</P>
      <P>I had an open mind on this but the Minister has nearly convinced me that there must be something wrong with it. He cannot accuse this side of the House of holding up the section or of holding up the Bill because the longest speeches made were made by Deputy Corry and Deputy Medlar and the Minister himself has added his share now.  It is unfair to make an allegation of the sort the Minister has made.</P>
      <P>As far as the price is concerned, I wonder was the Minister serious when he gave the figures which he gave a couple of minutes ago.  There is something seriously wrong.  He says that his predecessor, Deputy Childers, was incorrectly reported in the <i>Westmeath Independent</i> of 12th November, 1958 as saying that the Land Commission were not prepared to make a present of more than £32 per acre. In other words, they were not prepared to pay more than that.  But he went on further and this is what Deputy Childers&mdash;he was then Minister for Lands&mdash;is reported as having said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> There were 165 holdings of under £20 valuation.  The pool of badly-worked land was diminishing and the Land Commission would not take well worked land in this early effort because two million acres would be required and congestion would never be solved.  There was not the £100 million required for the work nor the land.</P>
    <P>If you do a bit of reckoning there, after having given the price as £32, Deputy Childers then proceeded to say that he proposed to spend £50 on it and the Minister's figures here, as far as I can make them out, roughly, work out at an average of £40.  Would the Minister check again and see if somebody has been codding him or have I got the whole thing wrong?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has. I think the speech of the former Minister for Lands possibly was referring to the subsidisation element, perhaps, in resales.  I certainly would look for the full text of his speech because, as the Deputy well knows and as everybody knows, in 1958, just the same as today, market value had to be paid for land by the Land Commission. There is never any question and there could not be any question because the law is there as far as the Land Commission are concerned that they must pay market value for any land they acquire.  That is the reason I have challenged the accuracy of that newspaper report because I am quite certain that the former Minister is misreported or, by not publishing the full context of his speech, there is something wrong with the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like this to be accurate because that is necessary. The Minister has stated that in the past two years, to his knowledge&mdash;we are speaking roughly&mdash;a total of 206,000 acres was given to 11,000 allottees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I unintentionally misled the Deputy.  I said there was approximately that amount divided amongst approximately 11,000 allottees, and that is correct.  The intake of land during that period is a different question.  I think that, rough and ready, the figure of the intake of land over those years would be approximately 157,000 acres and if the Deputy calculates to get an average &mdash;he was probably later at school than I was&mdash;let him work out what price per acre it was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been accused here of misquoting the Minister's predecessor Deputy Childers, that the figure of £32 per acre would not be accepted by the Minister in any circumstances, that the compositor on the <i>Westmeath Independent</i> could be, shall we say, slightly intoxicated when he set that figure.  I know the Minister did not mean that but, at any rate, the Minister was not prepared to accept that figure.  Now he has given figures himself of 206,000 acres.  I am not concerned with the 11,000 allottees at all but we will take the price paid for the 206,000 acres, which is £4½ million.  Now we will add to that the Minister's figure of £3½ million for improvement works and I will give the Minister the two figures together&mdash; £8 million&mdash;and we will divide 206,000 acres into that.  It works out at £40 per acre, improvements and all, and that is, to my mind, an example of what the Land Commission are doing when it comes to the division of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It proves to the hilt, unless the Minister's figures are wrong, my earlier point, that the Land Commission have concentrated their efforts in areas where the land is inferior or of poor quality and that is where the hand of <Col N="317" /> Finance has come in.  I am not satisfied now from the Minister's approach on this that it is not the Minister for Finance who is the deciding factor, who says: &ldquo;This is all you can spend, Minister for Lands.  I am allowing you only this much and if you want to buy good land, well, I am sorry, you will have to reduce the acreage involved&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a significant thing in the Land Commission that I have found over the years.  I have a fair amount of experience in probing this Department and very little success attended my efforts from time to time to extract information.  Why is it that the Land Commission, on this issue, the question of value, never yet gave any figures to this House or to Deputies on the valuation of land that is acquired and distributed amongst the locals?</P>
    <P>I have a letter here from the Minister's office dated 25th November, 1954:</P>
    <P>With reference to your question on 17th November, 1954, I am desired by the Minister for Lands to inform you that he has ascertained from the Land Commission that some 13,000 new holdings of an average acreage of 23 acres were created in the period between 1931 and 1953.</P>
    <P>The question I asked was, what was the valuation of the holdings&mdash;of the whole lot&mdash;and what was the average valuation.  What was the answer?&mdash;&ldquo;The Land Commission have no record of the rateable valuation of these lands&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That proves my point that the Land Commission are very shy about giving information as to the valuation of the land which they are taking over.  We know that the valuation of land varies considerably.  For instance, in Meath, the average valuation per acre is around 16/-.  In Roscommon the valuation is around 9/-.  I am speaking roughly now.  I have not looked at these figures for some time.  The valuation varies from 16/- in Meath, perhaps a little more, to 9/- in Roscommon, 7/-, say, in Mayo and various other figures throughout the country.  That valuation is based on the 1854 Griffith valuation, which has not been changed since.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> It does not take a very suspicious character, and one need have no suspicions at all about the Land Commission to worry as to why, when they are giving figures of acreages of land acquired, they fail to give the valuation. It is very easy to get co-operaation from the Land Commission when they want to give you a figure of 206,000 acres being acquired, but when I ask what is the valuation of that land, I will not be told.  Not so many years ago, the Land Commission acquired several thousand acres in Donegal.  I think the valuation of that land was about 6d. an acre.  The acreage seemed huge but, in reality, the land would not support a fly.  In the eyes of the public, the Land Commission were doing great work.  When the Land Commission deal with the question of value as we are discussing it on section 3 here, I want them to let us know the valuation of the land taken over by them, because only on that basis will be able to assess what type of land is being acquired and what average price per acre is paid.</P>
    <P>I am not asking the Minister to give me an answer in a hurry to this question: what is the average price over the country paid per acre by the Land Commission for land acquired for the relief of congestion?  If he has not got it to-night, I am sure he will be able to make it available on some other occasion.</P>

      <P>It is correct to say that when the 1950 Land Act was going through this House, there was a section in it similar to this section we are now debating.  The Minister went to great pains to ascertain whether I made any contribution on the section at that time and whether I had any suspicions of the section then.  I certainly had not and I made no contribution on that section of the 1950 Act because I had implicit confidence and trust in the then Minister for Finance. That is the answer to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate in the past half hour has drawn special attention to the quotation by Deputy McQuillan of a speech by the former Minister for Lands, which the present Minister <Col N="319" /> states must have been misquoted.  That is an old game with the Government: every time they are caught out they blame the newspaper.  I do not believe the former Minister was misreported. I believe the report published by this well-known and trusted journal must have come from a script handed in by the Minister outlining his statement in relation to the amount per acre of benefits which were being bestowed by the Government on the successful allottees.  That is why I am not prepared to accept a statement by the Minister that the former Minister was misreported.  I do not believe he was. Knowing the present Minister and his colleagues, I believe there are grounds for suspicion.  Telling us about the misquotation in newspapers is a cock that cannot always crow.  He has been crowing for a long time as far as the Government are concerned.  We do not believe it any more.</P>

I gave the other figure as the amount of land divided, 206,000 acres among 11,000 allottees.  I repeat that in case it is suggested I was trying to mislead the Deputy or the House.  The only average figure available to me and which I have been given to-night is the average price paid last year.  The average price approximately throughout the length and breadth of the country was £56.7 per acre last year.</P>

      <P>No; I am talking of agricultural land.  I do not think it is a very useful exercise to be discussing the newspaper report of what the then <Col N="320" /> Minister for Lands said in 1958, but let me reiterate that I do not accept the allegations made for the reasons I have stated&mdash;the law was the same then as far as the market value was concerned as it is now and the Land Commission had to pay in 1958 on compulsory cases the market value as decided by law or, where there were voluntary acquisitions by the Land Commission, they had to buy land in competition with anybody else in the market.  Therefore, the allegations made to-night that my predecessor then said that the Land Commission would not pay more than a certain figure per acre could not possibly be correct.  I believe that that report is either a summary of his speech or that perhaps the then Minister was dealing with subsidisation on resale prices that would be charged to certain allottees.  Certainly, in the form in which his speech is quoted here, it is incorrect, and whether it is the fault of the reporter or of the summary, I do not know.  It could not possibly be correct.  No Minister for Lands could make such a statement because the law on market value was the same then as now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want this clarified. It is not my duty to defend newspapers here except to the extent of saying that I have never found this newspaper to be inaccurate in its reporting.  I know the previous Minister for Lands, on every possible occasion, issues a typed statement to every newspaper in the locality to which he is going before he speaks at all.  That is his practice over the years and he is never &ldquo;taken down&rdquo; by a shorthand notetaker at any political meeting.  Every Deputy is well aware that the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, snows under every newspaper with his typed copy.  This is, in my opinion, a very accurate report of what the Minister said.  If it is inaccurate, then the former Minister or his advisers must be at fault.  I doubt very much if his advisers are at fault.  I believe what <Col N="321" /> the Minister said or is reported to have said according to the <i>Westmeath Independent</i> dated 12th April, 1958. If I wanted any proof of the accuracy of that report, I have found it in the statements made here by the Minister because he has said&mdash;and nobody attempted to twist what he said&mdash;first, that the Land Commission had acquired 206,000 acres&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says now that he did not use the figure of 206,000 in the context to which I referred, I accept that, but I am going to go on to the figure he gave as a correction, namely the figure of 157,000 acres.  That is the one I am going to argue about with the Minister now. The Minister said that that figure was the intake and the same figure of £4½ million stands here but if it does, the cost per acre in these circumstances was £27 10s. per acre.  Where does the Minister think he is going?  This is the only place in which we get an opportunity of analysing the figures.  If the Minister is going to tell me that over the past five years the intake of land was 157,000 acres and that the Land Commission paid £4½ million for that, is it not a fact that they paid roughly £27 10s. per acre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies, whether they are from Cork, Donegal, Roscommon, Meath, Offaly or Mayo, know that nobody will get agricultural land for £27 10s. per acre.  The Minister has given the impression: &ldquo;Let us forget the past five years and let us take this year, that £57 10s. was the average this year.&rdquo;  Has that jump taken place <Col N="322" /> from £27 10s. to £57 10s.?  I will accept that with a very large grain of salt because I am quite satisfied, with all respect to the Minister, that that is completely inaccurate because the figures he has given prior to that prove that his Department officials have not got the figures with them at the moment.  I have made a charge that the type of land bought by the Land Commission over the years, through the Department of Finance sticking its fingers into the pie, has been inferior land.  Is the proof not there that in the past five years the figure was £27 10s. and that land has not been taken over for forestry but for the purpose of settling families on it?  It is a disgrace and it shows what the Land Commission have been doing.</P>
    <P>I shall go even further into this question of Land Commission expenditure over the years.  The Minister can announce with a flourish of trumpets that the Minister for Finance is behind him and that money presents no problem in this drive for the relief of congestion, in which the Land Commission are paying £27 10s. an acre and meeting with opposition, resistance and stubbornness from the small farmers and the congests who will not play ball when the big stick is held over them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Corry in regard to Deputy Blowick and what I have to say applies to every Minister for Lands who has been in this House, using the big stick on congests and on the people living on small holdings, on intermixed plots, and telling them: &ldquo;You will be left here like this for the rest of your lives if you do not co-operate&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister has suggested that I misrepresented the Minister for Transport and Power, that I gave wrong figures with regard to the price the Land Commission were paying and that I had been inaccurate.  I say that the Minister and his Department have been codding the congests over the years. They have been defrauding the small farmers of the kind of land which should have been made available to them and the dead hand of Finance <Col N="326" /> will still reach into this proposed legislation to prevent the purchase of the good land which is available in many parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply do not understand what this performance is all about.  Any county councillor, much less a Deputy, must know, even after a week, that everything works on the basis of permission to spend money.  The only permission I know of to spend money where the State is concerned comes from the Cabinet and the Minister for Finance is the operative channel through which the money flows.  If one wants to promote any Governmental activity and one has to spend money thereon, then in whatever legislation is introduced, there appears a provision in similar phraseology to the phraseology of section 3 of this Bill.  If one wants to describe the regulating hand of the Minister for Finance as the dead hand of Finance, and assert that has a depressive effect, then one is perfectly entitled to do so. If one, on the other hand, wants to describe this as an expansive provision, with the Minister for Finance increasing the amounts, equally one can do so.  This is permissive legislation and, since it is, I do not understand the criticism.  I fail to see what Deputy McQuillan's long performances ever achieve here, except perhaps some newspaper publicity; if people talk at a certain time of the night, they may get certain publicity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  A figure of £56 or £57 per acre was quoted by the Minister as the average figure paid for land.  Deputy McQuillan's figure is £27 per acre.  I accept the Minister's figure.  It seems to me to be extraordinarily low and I am as anxious as anybody to see something done for the congests.  I wonder if owners of lands acquired by compulsory acquisition are being fully compensated? I do not go with Deputy McQuillan on this question of the quality of land.  As far as I know, all the land divided in my constituency is first-class.  I think the same is true of other areas.  Not so long ago, I had the opportunity during a rather disastrous by-election to be in a certain place in Kildare, in which there were numbers of congests, some from Deputy McQuillan's constituency and some from Kerry.  The land divided there was first-class land.  However, I find this figure rather low.  I am told that after valuation by competent valuers on behalf of the owner and on behalf of the Land Commission, the matter is decided finally by the Lay Commissioners and a figure struck.  I should like to know what the trend has been over the past year or so. What has been the average price for good land?  This figure is very relevant. I find a figure of £56 to £57 ridiculously low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputies have failed to appreciate is that the figure is an average per acre for the whole country.  Quite obviously, some Deputies are under the impression that this is the figure the Land Commission are offering.  That is utter nonsense. Recently I took over a very large estate in my own county for which a very high figure was paid.  On that estate, there are 500 acres of very poor land.  That will be handed over to the Forestry Division.  In practically <Col N="328" /> all lands taken over, one finds some element of mountain, lakes, turbary. Deputies simply have not grasped the fact that, when one is dealing with average figures, the average does not mean that this is the figure offered per acre to the owner.  The owner has his price.  He is entitled to the market value.  The Land Commission have either to get the land voluntarily from him at a price he is prepared to accept or buy it compulsorily at its market value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the average price for previous years, but what I have said is correct.  In some of the land taken over, there may even be some commonage, the intrinsic value of which would be very low.  What I describe as the parent holding acquired by the Land Commission would command a very substantial price.  Recent experience is that the Land Commission have had to pay very substantial prices for land in competition with other buyers.  I dealt with all this extensively last night.  As Deputy Donegan has said, this section appears in every Land Bill.  I cited section 4 of the 1950 Act and section 3 of the 1953 Act.  It is in every Act.  It is a provision to provide for the financing of the work to be done under the Bill. Deputies have made all kinds of suggestions on this section.  One would think that something sinister was appearing for the first time in a Land Bill.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is purely an enabling section and I respectfully suggest that enough of the time of the House has been spent now in debating this innocuous section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister answer one question?  He stated categorically earlier tonight that the figure given did not include land for forestry.  He has stated now that not <Col N="329" /> alone does it include some land for forestry but it includes turbary as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I was asked did the figure include lands for forestry.  It did not.  The Deputy knows well that when lands are acquired by the Land Commission, those portions which are not of good quality are handed over to the Forestry Division.  In some of the old large estates, there are already some woodlands which were planted as such by the owners.  In different parts of the country, particularly in the congested areas, in many instances some of the holdings taken over are extremely small by our standards but most important rfor the job the Land Commission are doing.  These holdings would comprise commonages or stretches of poor land and, of course, when these acres of land are schemed by the Land Commission, an average figure is arrived at which covers the good land as well as the bad land, which covers the stretches of water, drains and so on, as well as the acres of good land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what we have found out is that this figure is no use to anybody.  For instance, if you take a number of land deals of any auctioneer in an area of good arable land, there would not be any percentage of waste in them which would reduce the value to £56 per acre. Apparently what the Minister is buying includes all sorts of things such as woodlands, lakes and so on.  Therefore, the figure given is of no interest to anybody and we can forget about it.</P>

    <P>This is a section which should be given very close consideration because, according to the section, the Minister can declare any area outside the congested districts a congested area.  This is giving too much power to the Minister and can be open to all kinds of very serious abuses.  When it suits the Minister, his Party or his Party's supporters, he can declare an area <Col N="331" /> congested and thus have the annuities halved where his own Party supporters would obtain land.

      <P>We are dealing with the Deputy's amendment at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that this section as it stands in the Bill should be drastically amended. That is why I put down these amendments. We have heard from the Minister earlier tonight and last night that there were occasions on which he referred to land, non-agricultural and agricultural.  For that reason, I feel he should make it very clear in this section that the land referred to is agricultural land.  There is turbary and land suitable for forestry and there are other areas of land which could not possibly be described as arable. Therefore, the Minister should accept this amendment, thus deciding that the land for the purpose of this section should be agricultural land.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, the Land Commission should establish and maintain a register in which, as outlined in the amendment, particulars of the various purchases of land should be recorded. There is a serious national problem in relation to the purchase of land by aliens.  Many people who support the Government in this House and who have been loud in their protests outside the House against the purchase of land by foreigners should avail of this opportunity to put right those wrongs of which they speak outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very serious problem even <Col N="332" /> though the Minister for Lands tells us that the purchase of land by aliens is not a cause for concern.  He has told us in the course of discussion on his Estimate and on other occasions in the House that he is glad to see aliens coming to purchase lands which are unsuitable for acquisition by the Land Commission.  He has quoted instances of large tracts of land being purchased by aliens which he described as too poor in quality for the Land Commission to acquire for division among the many local applicants.</P>
    <P>Here we have an opportunity for the Land Commission to assess the importance of this national problem.  I put it to the Minister that the Land Commission have no idea of this problem and the reason for that is that there is no proper means of accurately finding out the amount of land being purchased by aliens.  The Minister may proceed to give a report from the Revenue Commissioners on the amount of stamp duty paid on purchases by aliens.  That is not an accurate figure for the Land Commission, the Minister or the country to go on because we have known of many cases of land being purchased by aliens where, by various ways and means, they avoided paying the stamp duty.</P>
    <P>We know well that large tracts of land have been purchased by aliens whose children were born in this country and shortly after the birth of these children, the lands were put in their names and, because they were of Irish birth, that was sufficient to avoid the payment of the 25 per cent duty. Aliens are purchasing land in this country today and they are avoiding the 25 per cent duty in a wholesale manner by putting the land in the names of their children.  There are other means by which the Revenue Commissioners have their eyes wiped and the Minister knows that those aliens do not mind paying the 25 per cent duty.  Those who come from Germany and the continent come over with very substantial cheque-books. When they come to invest in Irish land, it is all the same to them whether they pay £50,000 or £100,000 for the farm.  They are not concerned with <Col N="333" /> the duty but if they can possibly avoid paying it, they will do so.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should establish a register for the purpose of ascertaining what the real position is. They should record in that register the nationality of all persons buying Irish land and they should give full details of all the circumstances of the purchases.  Again, where a company buys land, full details of that concern should be registered as I have suggested in these amendments.</P>
    <P>This problem is so very serious and of such great importance that many organisations in this country have given a good deal of thought to it.  I am sure that the Minister has received the findings of the Small Farms Committee of the National Farmers' Association. That committee was established to investigate the extent to which foreigners were buying land in this country and in the first part of its report, it states that insufficient land is available in this country to meet the requirements of Irish citizens. Whatever else we may say about the National Farmers' Association, we all recognise that it is a body of intelligent farmers, looking after their own problems in a sensible way and in a non-political atmosphere.</P>
    <P>This committee has made a finding that there is insufficient land available to meet the requirements of the people of the country anxious and equipped to work the land.  In the face of that finding, surely it is time that we had a stocktaking as to why we are allowing the best of our Irish land to get into the hands of foreigners who are coming here, not for the love of the land, but to get what they can out of the land, to beggar it and then to fly out of the country again.  That is why I say that this Bill as it stands does nothing to prevent the purchase of land by aliens. The amendments which I suggest will make this an effective Bill as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>The second finding of the Small Farms Committee of the NFA is that in the light of the many sales of large tracts of Irish land to non-nationals in recent years, the land of Ireland is not being preserved for the people of <Col N="334" /> Ireland.  Surely everybody must agree that that is so when we see so much land being purchased by those undesirable people who come in and purchase land and thereby deprive our small farmers and local applicants of the benefit of their land.  The Minister represents a western constituency and he must be well aware of the serious flight from the land of our small farmers.  He knows the numbers who have emigrated in recent years, the number of families who have emigrated in their entirety and left their houses closed up with corrugated iron. Here we have the small farmers of the west and the midlands being forced out of this country because they are being denied a livelihood at home and are being replaced by foreigners coming over here.</P>
    <P>Is that a sound land policy?  Is that good economics?  Can it be described as a land policy with a good national outlook?  Our small Irish farmers are being forced out and foreigners are coming in and buying up the land which is the backbone of this country and the source of all good as far as any agricultural country is concerned.</P>
    <P>The third finding of the NFA Committee is that the disposition of Irish land is not sufficiently controlled.  This Committee of the NFA were asked to make certain recommendations. They made them and the first recommendation was that legislation be enacted to preserve the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Is that not the real problem?  What good is it to pass legislation dealing with land division and distribution to settle the problem of congestion until steps have been taken to see that the land of Ireland is preserved for the people of Ireland? Was it not James Fintan Lalor who said: &ldquo;The soil of Ireland for the people of Ireland, to have and to hold as God gave it to them&rdquo;, or something of the sort?  Could there be anything more desirable?  This section as it stands does nothing to change the situation.  The time has now come <Col N="335" /> for a complete overhaul of Land Commission activity in so far as the purchase of land by aliens is concerned.</P>
      <P>Section 4 deals with the setting up of congested districts and the Committee on Small Farms recommended that any legislation of this kind should apply equally to every part of the country.  With that I very much agree. I cannot understand why the Minister has brought in this Bill without a single mention of the purchase of land by aliens.  If one listened carefully to the Minister's speeches in recent months, one would not have found a single reference to this great problem. That is why I am compelled to put down those amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the Land Commission should have a register in which to enter details of the nationality of the purchasers of land here.  I cannot understand why this register of non-nationals has not already been set up because I have been reading a speech made by a former Minister for Lands, now Minister for Transport and Power.  I shall quote part of the report of that speech, made at Castleblayney, County Monaghan, his own constituency, and recorded on page 8, column 7 of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 1st January, 1964.  He was addressing a meeting of the National Farmers' Association.  I want the Minister for Lands to listen carefully to this, lest the Minister for Transport and Power should say later that I misquoted him:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill which will shortly be introduced would, it is hoped, defeat the misuse of land division and would have a definite effect in preventing <Col N="336" /> foreigners from buying up vast tracts of Irish land, said Mr. Childers, Minister for Transport and Power.  A special register of vacated farms was being compiled by the Irish Land Commission, he added.</P>
    <P>The Minister was accompanied by Mr. P. Mooney, T.D. and Senator J. J. Brennan.</P>
    <P>What has happened since New Year's Day?  According to Deputy Childers, the Land Commission were to set up a register such as I now suggest in my amendment.  Surely there is such a thing as collective responsibility in Government?  You cannot have the Minister for Lands doing one thing and the Minister for Transport and Power saying another thing in relation to the relief of congestion and the utilisation of the land of Ireland. What makes it more serious is that Deputy Childers was addressing the NFA who have been dealing with this very problem.</P>
    <P>I should therefore like to hear from the Minister for Lands why he is not prepared to accept the amendments aimed at setting up a register of aliens. What serious objection have the Land Commission to it?  Can the Minister tell us now that this is not a very serious problem?  Of course he cannot, because everybody realises the vast amount of Irish land that has gone into the hands of foreigners.</P>
    <P>The amendments I propose would render this Bill most effective.  Some years ago, Deputy Dillon introduced a Private Members' Bill dealing with this problem but the Government of the day did not see their way to accept it.  I put it to the Government and the Minister that there is no more serious national problem, no problem more distasteful to Irish farmers and to farmers' sons, the deserving applicants for land, than this undesirable penetration by aliens and the purchase by them of the best arable land in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>How would the keeping of a register prevent them from buying land?  It would only be a regisster of those who already had bought land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would tell us how we stood.  The Minister has told us, and will again, I suppose, that this is not a serious problem.  How can we accurately gauge its seriousness when there is no clear record of the amount of land that has gone to aliens?  I am sure the Minister cannot deny that the amount of land that has got into the hands of aliens has been the subject of much representation to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>The NFA carried out a survey of the amount of land in the hands of foreigners.  We were told some time ago that there was no register set up in the Land Commission, that all the Minister could go on was the stamp duty paid by aliens.  That does not cut any ice.  There are ways and means of getting out of that, and they have got out of it.  If an alien comes in here and any of his family are born in this country, his children cannot be described as aliens and they can buy land. Section 3 of the Aliens Act gives the same rights to aliens to purchase property as to any Irish citizen.  A number of townlands were selected by the NFA in the survey they undertook. We see in it Kells, County Meath. Meath is a county that cannot be described as having the worst land in Ireland.  Yet the Minister has stated that these people only buy land nobody else would touch.  The survey shows the following purchases of land: Kells, Meath, 200 acres; Athboy, Meath, 500 acres; Trim, Meath, 150 acres; Edenderry, Offaly, 250 acres; Athy, Kildare, 600 acres; Naas, Kildare, 500 acres; Straffan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Afterwards it was bought by a cattle dealer for £14,600.  In 1955 we had Deputy Sweetman as Minister for Finance and Deputy Blowick as Minister for Lands.  That farm was purchased by a German called Von Harder for something like £27,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are designed merely to produce this register which the Minister says he has but, if one examines the type of register he has, one will find it is not very detailed.  Our proposal is that the register be confined to agricultural land.  That is the first thing about it.</P>
      <P>The thing we would like to impress is that as a Party we have no objection at all to the introduction here of foreign capital.  We have no objection at all to a foreigner.  As a matter of fact, we were the first Party to encourage the introduction of foreign capital here for factory building and for the promotion of industry.  But, as well as that, there is the fact that the people of this country are perturbed by the purchase of large tracts of land by foreigners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points about this. The first is that Deputy Corry must be barking up the wrong tree because <Col N="341" /> if he takes the sales of land as a unit in any one year and takes the amount of land the Land Commission can buy and distribute with the funds at their disposal, even if one were to double or treble the funds, one would find that this was still but a very small percentage of the total sales of land. So it is no good saying the Minister is a good Minister and he will see that a certain area is divided and that we do not need this register because non-nationals cannot come in and buy land.  The amount of land changing hands in the country is far greater than the impact of the Land Commission. Therefore, we do need some sort of specified register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as long as you have the jotter properly tabulated. This does not mean that we think it is wrong in all cases for a non-national to buy land for agricultural purposes. Where these men can come in and employ people, there is nothing wrong with it.  I can give instances in my county of non-nationals who came in and who are now paying in the production of vegetables as much as £11 a week to four, five or six times as many people as were employed on these lands before, but it is necessary because of the trend and because of the fears of our people, particularly of our congests and larger farmers, that a proper register should be kept.</P>
      <P>This is not an extreme measure.  It is, in my opinion, a very well-measured piece of legislation.  It goes into detail. It is well drafted and it would give us the kind of register that would be available to all and that would give far more information than any type of general register which the Minister assures us is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first amendment defines the type of land that would be involved as agricultural land.  The sole purpose of this amendment No. 3 is to exclude all other varieties of land, to exclude woodlands, building sites, factory sites, places along a beach where there might be development for holiday camps or any of that sort of thing, and <Col N="342" /> to get this register strictly confined to non-nationals who are buying agricultural land for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>Our concern as a Party is with agricultural land.  In a general way, our concern as a Party is to see more foreign capital coming in here but we do want to keep a closely-knit register of the amounts of land being purchased for agricultural use by foreigners.</P>
    <P>The machinery is there in our amendments. It would be but delaying the House if we were to go into every word in these amendments but if the Minister wants to question whether or not they are properly drafted, we are ready here and willing and able to debate that point with him.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 makes it necessary for a non-national to notify his intention to purchase land.  This, in fact, means that the net should be complete and that no fish should get through.  Deputy Flanagan has pointed to the position in relation to section 3 of the Aliens Act whereby, if a child is born here of a non-national, he is automatically a national and the registering of the land here in his name means, of course, that you have the transfer without paying the 25 per cent stamp duty.  That is something that is not covered by these amendments but acceptance of the amendments would means, without going to extremes, that a proper register would be kept and we would know how far this is going.</P>

      <P>That is what he wants&mdash;a properly tabulated jotter&mdash; and it does not matter how much land is bought by non-nationals as long as the jotter is big enough to hold it and if the jotter is not able to hold it, Deputy Donegan would buy another jotter and fill that, too.</P>
      <P>This is the type of nonsense we get from Deputy Donegan and his like, who are trying to bluff the small farmers and to have it both ways.  On the one hand they are saying to the non-national: &ldquo;Everything is all right; you can buy up all the land in Ireland, provided you are registered in Deputy Donegan's jotter&rdquo; and, on the other hand, he will go down the country if he gets a cumann or club foolish enough to listen to him and say that Deputy Donegan and his group want to prevent the non-national from buying land here in Ireland.  Let us put it quite bluntly.  A register of this nature will not stop the sale of one acre of land to a non-national.</P>

      <P>Words are being put into my mouth now.  It is suggested that I said this could be kept in a jotter.  It was not my jotter.  It was Deputy McQuillan's jotter for a start and I immediately took it up and said &ldquo;a properly tabulated jotter&rdquo;.  I do not care how you keep the register.  I presume in the Department of Lands it would not be kept in a jotter.  The point is now being made by Deputy McQuillan that when the jotter is filled up, all you do is get another one; in other words, that nothing is done about this problem if it assumes major proportions.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of our amendments is to get this thing properly tabulated so that if the problem does assume major proportions, legislation can be passed in this House.  We do not believe that it has assumed major proportions but, in order to allay the fears of the people and of ourselves that it can go wrong, we believe there should be a proper register and, after that, we can, if we desire, legislate and give the Government an opportunity of voting against us if they want to.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear <Col N="344" /> Deputy Donegan yielding the point to Deputy McQuillan because, whether Deputy McQuillan is right or wrong, he is positive but the Fine Gael Party are not positive.  The register of which the Deputy speaks is merely a smoke-screen, of course, and the Deputy knows well that there is a register in the Land Commission already and that a register of the type the Deputy advocates would not be worth a pinch of snuff.  Whatever about the merits of Deputy McQuillan's amendment&mdash;and I do not agree with it because I do not think it is workable&mdash;I can certainly see no point in Deputy Flanagan's amendment.</P>

      <P>We had better go into this in detail.  Section 3 defines the land to be dealt with in this register as agricultural land, the purpose being to exclude everything else.  Amendment No. 4 is to insert a new section and gives the exact wording of that section and tells us exactly what we want to know.  It is not a general register of sales of land but a specific register with a specified name and there is a definition contained in subsection (2).  Section 1 indicates that the Land Commission must establish and maintain the register and subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>The register established by subsection (1) of this section may be called, and is in this Act referred to as, the Non-Nationals' Land Register, and shall be in such form as the Land Commission may decide.</P>
      <P>That defines that it shall be a Non-Nationals' Land Register.  There is a difference between that, as Deputy Flanagan pointed out, and the people who pay their stamp duty and the people who do not.  Payment of stamp duty is a different matter governed by different legislation and there is a serious discrepancy between the NFA document and the Minister's figures but in the counties of Louth and Meath, with considerable difficulty I have gone into this, and examined the details of the NFA figures and in my opinion, they are correct and I have as many dealings with farmers in that area as anybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is where the value of this particular register comes in.  We have the position where we have a discrepancy between the figures of a responsible farmers' organisation and the Minister's figures.  The Minister says he has dealt with that elsewhere. As an ordinary Deputy, I am not competent to go around saying that the Minister is wrong about the number of non-nationals, but I would be perfectly competent to take a list in the places I know in Louth and Westmeath and add up the number of holdings that have changed hands and the number of acres involved.  I have done that and I am fairly certain that the NFA are not too far wrong in regard to Louth and Meath.  So far as the question of this particular register, which I assume is a register of people who pay stamp duty, being correct is concerned it may be correct in its own content but it is not what we want.</P>
      <P>We want details of what the ordinary man in the street would describe as the amount of land bought by non-nationals.  That is defined in subsection (2) of the amendment.  Subsection (3) of amendment No. 4 is a most important subsection and we have gone to considerable trouble about it and have done so because it is so important.  It states:</P>
      <P>Certified extracts of the Non-Nationals' Land Register may be furnished by the Land Commission to any person appearing to them to have a <i>bona fide</i> interest in the information therein contained in relation to a particular property or properties, or generally.</P>
      <P>This leaves in the hands of the Land Commission the duty of behaving reasonably in relation to information; they must not throw it around.  But if any Deputy wants this information or some responsible member of the community in a district&mdash;such persons would all be clearly covered by this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This register is not something we <Col N="346" /> thought up in five minutes.  We did not want to go into the details of these amendments but the House has questioned whether we are serious in what we want to do and it is our duty to explain to the House why we phrased these amendments in this way and what we want to do and how we feel the amendments will effect the change.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 goes further to give the machinery by which this procedure may be carried out.  It is not easy to draft these amendments when the purpose is to get a watertight register.  If the NFA are at grave variance with the Minister&mdash;I assure the Minister I am honest in saying this &mdash;and if a Deputy from Louth and Meath who knows the area can agree with their figures&mdash;apart from my political work, I have very close contact with a large number of farmers in these counties and I know the NFA figures are pretty accurate&mdash;then there is necessity for a very clear series of amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 proposes:</P>
    <P>Before section 4 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  This section and sections * and * of this Act shall apply to every conveyance, transfer or lease of land where the person or body corporate to whom the land is conveyed, transferred or leased&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  being an individual person is not&mdash;</P>
    <P>Then we define most specifically the individual persons who will be covered:</P>
    <P>(a)  an Irish citizen, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a person who is for the time being ordinarily resident in the State and who was ordinarily resident in the State continuously during the three years immediately preceding the 15th day of October, 1947; or,</P>
    <P>(ii)  is a body corporate where any of the shares is held by&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) a person within paragraph (i) of this subsection, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a body corporate where any of the shares is held by a person <Col N="347" /> within paragraph (i) of this subsection.</P>
    <P>This is most important because, as well as the particular &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo;&mdash;if I may so describe it&mdash;of registering lands in the name of an infant born here of non-national parents, there is also the &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo; of the limited company or body corporate.  There is neither an auctioneer nor a solicitor in the country who is not expert at this operation.</P>
    <P>We want to make it quite clear that even to the extent of one share in a limited liability company, that one share shall mean that the purchase of land by the limited liability company or the public company shall be registered. You can get the information, for instance, that Cement Ltd. bought some land in the Swilly Valley.  That <Col N="348" /> is an Irish company and this we would not ordinarily include.  But you can have a limited liability company with a small number of shares held by a person who is named for life as the governing director of that company. The Minister is in the legal profession and if he follows company law, he knows that to be true as well as I do. Here you have a section in which the register he talks about, unless it has the important defence we have included in our amendments, will fall down and there is not a country solicitor or auctioneer who could not tell the Minister this, if he knows his job.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government in relation to the North Dublin Regional Water Supply Scheme (a) the total estimated cost of the scheme, (b) the estimated period required for completion in the North-East distribution system, (c) the estimated annual loan repayments to be borne by rates on completion of the scheme based on the estimated cost and the approximate rate in the pound, (d) the location of the reservoir from which the distribution system will radiate and (e) the estimated mileage of water main pipes <Col N="224" /> required to serve the main villages and towns included in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The total estimated cost of the North Dublin Regional Water Supply Scheme as already designed and approved is approximately £1,272,000; (b) the estimated time for completion of the North-East distribution system is 2½ years; (c) on a full loan of £1,272,000 the proportion of loan charges in the first year to be borne by the local authority would be £50,880.  The actual impact on the rates will, however, depend also upon the amount to be received from water charges.  The loan will be on the instalment system and the annual loan charges will reduce progressively during the loan repayment period; (d) the main reservoir is located at Ballycoolan.  Balancing reservoirs will be located at Hedgestown and Ballykea; and (e) the estimated mileage of water main pipes in the main portion of the scheme already designed is 30 miles.</P>
