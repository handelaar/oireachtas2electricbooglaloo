      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The British Prime Minister and I held an informal meeting in London on Saturday last.  It was in addition to the twice-yearly formal meetings between myself and the British Prime Minister.  We were joined in our discussions by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>At our meeting, we primarily reviewed developments relating to the Joint Peace Declaration and examined the prospects for a resumption of the three-strand talks process.  In this regard, both sides exchanged views on the means to advance jointly our shared objective of lasting peace with justice.</P>
      <P>The Prime Minister and I reaffirmed our total commitment to the Joint Declaration. We agreed that its principles will be the defining point of departure for both Governments towards a new political framework founded on consent and encompassing arrangements within Northern Ireland, for the whole island and between these islands.  The two Governments are in agreement that the Joint Declaration will form the anchor for a resumption of the three-strand talks process.  Such a resumed process would seek to develop the progress already made.</P>
      <P>The Prime Minister gave an unequivocal reaffirmation of his commitment to build up the declaration.  As he said in a statement after the meeting: &ldquo;We see the Joint Declaration as a foundation stone for the future approach of both Governments&rdquo;. Sir Patrick Mayhew's recent statements on it have contributed to its fuller understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Prime Minister and I agreed that the setting of a fixed deadline for a definitive response to the declaration would not be helpful.  Having regard to the difficult and delicate process of deliberation currently under way in the republican movement, there are reasonable grounds to hope that this process may yet yield a positive response, in terms of bringing an end to violence.  However, both Governments are determined that no party will be allowed to exercise a <Col N="163" /> veto on political progress.  Such a development would contravene the overwhelming desire among the people in both parts of this island for a lasting peace.  The durability of such peace can only be assured through the achievement, by agreement and consent, of a comprehensive political settlement.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister and I agreed to give fresh impetus to a resumption of the three-strand talks process in the context of the declaration.  To this end, officials from both sides will meet to work on a possible framework document for new talks in preparation for the next Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference meeting scheduled to take place on 10 March.</P>
    <P>In our discussions, the Tánaiste and I also raised concerns which have been expressed by various Northern parties over the report published on 20 January by the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland.  This report contains recommendations for new parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland. Although acknowledging the independence of the Boundary Commission and that these proposals are provisional at this stage, we stressed the importance of maintaining some degree of fair proportionality regarding the parliamentary representation of the two communities.</P>
    <P>It would be premature at this stage to make practical arrangements for a further meeting with the British Prime Minister. Our next meeting will take place at a time considered by both as being most useful to the advancement of peace and an agreed political settlement.  In the meantime, the two Governments will continue to keep developments under close and constant review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there general acceptance by both Governments that it seems unlikely Sinn Féin-IRA will accept the Downing Street Declaration? Second, arising from discussions last weekend was any time-frame established for the three-strand talks process?  Is this process being held up for reasons other than the failure of Sinn Féin-IRA to <Col N="164" /> declare a cessation of violence?  Third, arising from the controversy of the BBC &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme last night was the Taoiseach given any briefing by the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, as to what exactly the British Government had told Sinn Féin about its long term policy on Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add to the third part of the Deputy's question on what was or was not said at particular meetings.</P>
      <P>The three-strand talks process will resume as soon as all parties &mdash; or most of the parties &mdash; are in a position to do so.  Both Governments and their Prime Ministers made it clear on Saturday that no political party will have a veto on the resumption of those talks.  We are glad that the basis for the resumption of talks has been clearly defined: the peace declaration will be the starting point and the principles enshrined in that declaration will form the basis on which the talks process on a three-strand basis will proceed. It will not be on a single strand basis as some have been speculating for the past number of weeks.  The air has been cleared in regard to the basis for the resumption and nature of the talks.  There is agreement that the principles and parameters of the peace process will be the starting point for talks of a deeper nature than heretofore.  Both Governments are still hopeful that there will be a positive response from the Republican movement but, like everybody else, we can only speculate on that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach support the resumption of talks even without a cessation of violence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always said that I never saw the talks process in opposition to the peace process; I always held the view that if the talks could be resumed in a peaceful environment they would have a better chance of success.  I still hold that view but I will not hold up the talks process waiting for this to happen.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach <Col N="165" /> satisfied that the demand for clarification from Sinn Féin and the IRA in relation to the Declaration has now been fully met by both the Irish and British Governments and that, despite this, it is clear that neither Sinn Féin nor the IRA intends to accept the Declaration?  Will he indicate how soon he expects the three stranded talks to commence and does he foresee a timeframe being set within which those talks might conclude given the necessity to ensure that the desire for peace enhanced by the Declaration is not lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unrealistic to set a specific deadline for the completion of the talks process which can get under way as soon as everyone is ready. In this regard the liaison committee is due to meet shortly.  On the question of clarification which has been sought from both the British and Irish Governments, I have dealt with the matter very extensively in regard to the clarification sought from the Irish Government.  The statements made by the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, on Saturday and the many statements made during the past ten days or so by Sir Patrick Mayhew should go a long way towards clearing the air in relation to the explanations and clarification sought from the British Government but I am not aware of any matter on which the Republican movement is seeking detailed clarification from the British Government.  In any event it is a matter for it; it is not a matter for me to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is important that the three stranded talks get going so that there can be true reconciliation between the traditions on this island in the absence of violence? In that context does he agree it is important that the talks start before politicians in Northern Ireland start campaigning for the Euro elections and get into &ldquo;campaign mode&rdquo;?  Will he help that process by tabling Irish Government proposals, particularly with regard to the protection of the Nationalist identity in Northern <Col N="166" /> Ireland?  This is something the Government should do in Strand Two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has never sought to delay the resumption of the talks process and will not seek to delay it now.  Other parties in Northern Ireland said they were not prepared to go to the table for one reason or another. The problems have to be ironed out by the British Government and those parties. We will start work in the liaison committee as soon as possible.  I agree with the Deputy that there is a need for reconciliation between the two communities and the sooner this process can start at a political level the better because the 25 years of violence have driven those communities apart.  The problem is that there is a division between the two communities and we will have to see how we can bring them closer, to work together and to get rid of the fears and suspicions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keen to have the issue of clarification dealt with once and for all.  I understand that the Leader of the SDLP, Mr. John Hume, has renewed his call to the British Government for clarification.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the aspects Mr. Hume has in mind or does he feel that full clarification has been given at this stage and that no further clarification is necessary?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to clarify the matter for the Deputy.  On the question of clarification sought from the Irish Government, I have dealt with the matter very extensively and I am not aware of any particular point on which anyone is looking for further explanation or clarification. On the question of the British Government's attitude, fears and suspicions exist not alone in the Republican movement but also in the Nationalist community.  People want the British Government to make more definitive statements on the Declaration and its commitment to follow through on what is stated in it, especially in paragraph 4. <Col N="167" /> On Saturday the British Prime Minister made it very clear that he and the British Government are totally committed to the Declaration.  This should allay the concerns which have been expressed.  In addition, Sir Patrick Mayhew dealt with many points arising from the Declaration in the various statements and interviews he gave during the past ten days.  I am not aware of any particular aspects on which further clarification is required.  I am aware that John Hume made a statement on a television programme on Sunday but I am not aware of the details.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if the condition which applied to the last series of three stranded talks, that nothing would be agreed until everything was agreed, will also apply to the three stranded talks which I hope will get under way soon?  What is the status of the statement which formed the basis for the three stranded talks in the first instance given that the Taoiseach said today that the basis for the next set of three stranded talks will be the Declaration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The ground rules laid down in March 1991 &mdash; that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that there should be no pre-conditions &mdash; will apply to the resumption of the three stranded talks process.  Both Governments have agreed that the principles laid down in the Declaration will be built on in the new talks process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's remarks which I interpret as meaning that <Col N="168" /> the Downing Street Declaration will form the basis for any three stranded talks in the future.  Has he received any assurance from the British Prime Minister which he considers to be watertight in relation to that matter because this is absolutely essential?  Second, does he agree that clarification is now required from Sinn Féin and the IRA as to the difference between the Hume-Adams agreement, which they accepted formed the basis for a cessation of violence, and the Downing Street Declaration which would justify, morally and politically, the loss of a single life?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we say clearly that we will not be held to ransom for much longer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is an unequivocal yes.  I will quote from the statement made by Mr. John Major after our meeting: &ldquo;We see the Joint Declaration as a foundation stone for the future approach of both Governments.&rdquo; There will be a three stranded talks process, not one strand in isolation.  The three stranded talks process is the anchor on which those talks are grounded.  I agree with Deputy Currie that after the Declaration there is no justification for the taking of a further single life in the pursuance of the legitimate objectives of either the Nationalist or Loyalist communities, if the Declaration is studied in depth and all the explanations put side by side.  It is very difficult to understand how anybody could justify continuance of an armed conflict in circumstances in which not alone are the rights of both communities recognised by the British and Irish Governments on an equal basis but in which political objectives of each are recognised as legitimate and capable of being pursued in the democratic process with the condition that there be a permanent cessation of violence.  There is a solemn declaration by the British Government that it is a matter for the <Col N="169" /> Irish people to decide the future of the two communities on this island and that whatever agreement comes from that, a sovereign united Ireland or otherwise, both Governments will underpin it and legislate for it.  In those circumstances it is difficult to see how anybody could justify the taking of a single life in the pursuit of political objectives that can be pursued and solved through the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that on the essential elements of self-determination and consent there is not that much difference between the Downing Street Declaration and the Hume-Adams agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Both in this House and elsewhere I have always refrained from commenting on the Hume-Adams agreement. It is a matter for the two people concerned whether they publish it.  I go along fully with the suggestion that there is no justification for taking any further human life in the pursuit of political objectives that can be otherwise pursued. Everybody accepts that coercion will not achieve the results people think it will. We have had 25 years of violence and it has not achieved the political objectives everybody said it would achieve.  There will be no military victory on either side and common sense dictates that the only way forward is to get around the table, especially when there is no impediment and when both Governments have said they will be persuaders to finding an agreement between the two people on this island.  It is the only commonsense way forward.  I appeal to everybody to see it in that light and to stop the violence once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that, if we are to have peace and reconciliation, it is important that both communities should feel truly at home on the island and that they should realise and have it demonstrated to them that the only way durable progress can be made is by constitutional methods?  Will the Taoiseach agree that to achieve those <Col N="170" /> two objectives, the Irish Government should table proposals within the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement or strand two to specifically protect the Nationalist identity in Northern Ireland with regard to matters such as the position of the Irish language, the teaching of history, the use of the Irish language in road signs and other tangible and visible recognitions of the fact that there are two identities in Northern Ireland?  Will he agree that should be done now to show that constitutional methods can work and achieve something and that other methods do not?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach also agree he should look for concrete results in regard to the representations he made about constituency boundaries in Northern Ireland, because if we are to have a select committee in the House of Commons with virtually no representation &mdash; or only one representative from one community in the North &mdash; that will send all the wrong signals?  Will he agree that although such a committee is justified it is important it is composed in such a way that both communities are seen to have adequate representation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it quite clear at the meeting on Saturday that, at a time when the debate was continuing on the Downing Street Declaration, perceptions were most important as far as both communities were concerned.  The objective is to remove the distrust and suspicions that have existed over decades &mdash; and even centuries &mdash; in both communities. It is important that both communities reject coercion as a means of achieving their aims.  It is also important that both communities learn to live together and that the identity of each community is recognised as legitimate.  The challenge to all is to find a method by which the identity of both communities can be accommodated.  We must accept the diversity that exists in the two cultures. That is the job ahead of us in the talks process.  The Downing Street Declaration went a long way.  It is a historic moment and Governments have gone further than any previous Governments. <Col N="171" /> That is recognised by the vast majority of people on this island; 87 per cent of the Nationalist community contribute to that view as well.  We must find accommodation for all indentities and cultures and promote economic, cultural and social co-operation in future to demonstrate that the political means is the way to advance and find solutions to problems, not the bomb and the bullet.</P>

      <P>I will be as brief as possible.  In reply to the questions, the Taoiseach indicated that he would be making representations with regard to the proportionality of representation of the people of Northern Ireland in the context of elections to Westminster.  Will he agree it would be in order for him to suggest that elections to Westminster from Northern Ireland should be by way of single transferable vote in multi-seat constituencies and that this would overcome the obnoxious practice of seeking to try to count heads by religious denomination?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made clear to the British Government, and so has the Tánaiste at the recent Anglo-Irish Conference, my views on the Boundary Commission and the perception of the end result of its deliberations.  The present proposals are not the end result. <Col N="172" /> The Boundary Commission is an independent commission.  There is an appeals mechanism and I understand full use will be made of it in submissions from the SDLP about the number of seats, and the representation likely to result if boundaries are left as they are.  I agree with Deputy De Rossa that with the present boundaries we know what the result will be; the breakdown will follow the pattern it has always done.  We would love to break that pattern but it will take a long time to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred earlier to the necessity to preserve the cultural diversity of both communities in Northern Ireland, and I agree with him. Will he agree the only way that can be done is if there is self-determination for North and South respectively as the agreement indicates and not self-determination for the island as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 4 of the Declaration makes it quite clear where both Governments stand in relation to it.  The people of the whole island of Ireland have already determined their views and wishes in the context of support for the Downing Street Declaration.  Ninety-seven per cent of people in the South have determined that it is the road they want pursued and 87 per cent of the Nationalist community in the North have indicated the process they want pursued; even on the Unionist side there is a minority in support of this course.  The aspect of self-determination is clearly spelt out by the people on this island, North and South.</P>

When will he make proposals to protect the identity of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland?  Will he make proposals to change the terms of reference of the <Col N="173" /> Boundary Commission so that both communities are adequately represented?</P>

Will he accept that providing the Law Reform Commission with additional resources would assist it in completing its deliberations on such legislation?  Will the Taoiseach accept that the Whitaker report published in 1985 proposed that there should be not only additional resources made available to the commission but that a separate criminal law reform commission should be established?

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the impact, if any, he expects the 60,000 growth in the labour force he predicted by the end of 1997 at the launch of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work will have on the unemployment crisis.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated in my speech at the launch of the new national <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> on 14 February 1994, that the total at work should increase by more than 60,000 in the three years of the programme. That increase would be broadly equivalent to the best three-year performance achieved in the past.  I also stated that the increase would not fully match the expected labour force increase in the years 1994 to 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out that the recent measures announced in the budget, in addition to their direct impact in 1994, are intended to provide for more substantial increases in jobs in the years ahead, especially in developing small business, start-up enterprises and service firms.  I also pointed out that given even a slight increase in jobs in a reasonable percentage of the 100,000 small businesses in Ireland &mdash; as indicated in recent reports and surveys &mdash; unemployment would be further <Col N="176" /> reduced.  In addition, if growing areas of the services sector perform well, this would help reduce unemployment to more acceptable levels.</P>
    <P>The Government and social partners have agreed to reinforce these budgetary measures for the development of small business and start-up enterprises, and for the development of the services sector over the period of the PCW and, in particular, to increase the numbers on community-based work, work experience and training to 100,000 people, who would otherwise be unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government and social partners have also agreed that these reinforced policies for work will be pursued continuously and actively by the Central Review Committee throughout the period of the PCW.  The committee will take account of the views expressed and the positions agreed upon by the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Economic and Social Council in providing updated recommendations to Government as required in the light of the emerging trends in employment and unemployment.  The committee will oversee the development of effective, regular measures to monitor the numbers at work based on CSO data, FÁS sources, Revenue and social welfare information supplemented by new inquiries if required.</P>
    <P>I believe this hands on approach can be a key part of successfully applying the same national determination in creating work, as we did in 1987, in restoring financial stability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach state specifically from where the increases will come?  Will he accept that even in the best years of employment, namely, during the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> we only managed to increase net employment by 15,000 per annum? Does the Taoiseach not consider his figure is very optimistic?  Is it a &ldquo;top of the head&rdquo; figure or a properly calculated one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not operate like the Progressive Democrats in regard to <Col N="177" /> statements on employment and job creation by giving &ldquo;top of the head&rdquo; figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the national plan was being launched we were accused of being pessimistic in regard to figures.  As a result of the improvement in the economy and the new projectins from various bodies we are able to project an increase.  We introduced a number of measures in the budget which will help the operation of small businesses.  The results of a survey published yesterday showed that 65 per cent of small businesses hope to employ more people this year.  Therefore, with a combination of budgetary measures and an improvement in overall international trade we believe those figures are realistic.  We also propose to increase substantially the number of people on community development work.  I am sure most Members will agree that we should maximise community development work as far as possible because it is better that people be employed in such schemes than drawing social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8, 9, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 27, and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I indicated in reply to questions on 3 November 1993 that when I had concluded my round of consultations with party leaders and interest groups and had the opportunity to take their views into account I would bring forward my proposals on divorce for decision in due course by the Government.  I have now completed my series of meetings with Opposition parties.  However, there are still other groups which I propose to meet in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Martial Breakdown has helped to focus attention on various options for amendment of the Constitution and sets out the details of possible divorce legislation including the substantial powers which the courts would have to make orders in support of dependent spouses and children.  The White Paper sought views from interested groups and individuals and the wide range of submissions which have been received are being taken into account in the context of finalisation of my proposals.  I took the opportunity, <Col N="183" /> since coming into office, of writing to a number of groups to elicit their views on the matters raised in the White Paper and the replies I have received in response to that initiative are also being carefully examined.  I can say also that all aspects of divorce are being looked at not only in my Department but in other Departments also which are involved.  The clear intention of the Government is to deal with matters as comprehensively as possible in the lead-up to the referendum and to face all issues in a considered and responsible way.</P>
    <P>The definitive proposals of the Government for an amendment of the Constitution on divorce will, of course, be in the form of a Bill since a precondition of the holding of any referendum is the initiation of a Bill in the House.  The date of publication of the Bill will, to a large extent, be determined by the date on which the Government proposes to hold the referendum.  It is the Government's intention to proceed with the necessary legislative framework as quickly as possible with a view to the holding of the referendum in the autumn. I have already indicated to the House in reply to questions on 15 February 1994 that, as in the case of previous referenda, the Government intends to pursue an information campaign in the run-up to the divorce referendum.</P>
    <P>The timescale for the divorce referendum has not been affected by the decision of the Supreme Court on the Matrimonial Home Bill.  While the court's decision on that Bill was a disappointment to many, including the Government, I should like to emphasise that the policy which informed it was supported by successive Governments, and it was not framed so as to deal with instances of marital breakdown, be they separation or, for that matter, divorce, in the event of divorce being introduced following a referendum.  On the contrary, the Bill was aimed at the situation within stable marriages.  It was given priority in the Government's legislative programme and it formed part of the Government's programme of family law reform.  Having <Col N="184" /> regard to the Supreme Court's decision, it cannot now become law and, accordingly, the Government's decision is that it cannot proceed any further with the policy of that Bill.</P>
    <P>I am now giving priority to the other aspects of the Government's wide-ranging programme of family law reform. This involves at least three Bills, expansion and development of the legal aid system and of mediation services and increases in funding of counselling services. One of those Bills &mdash; the Family Law Bill, 1994 &mdash; is before the House awaiting Second Stage.  It is one of the most extensive of family law Bills to be initiated in recent times.  It has measures aimed at protecting and safeguarding the institution of marriage and it provides substantial powers to the courts to deal with the financial consequences of marital breakdown in certain cases.  Those powers will in substance be the same as the powers in any divorce legislation and they include wide powers in relation to maintenance, lump sums and property generally, including the family home and pensions.</P>
    <P>The position regarding children in the case of marital breakdown is of special importance and our constitutional and statutory provisions and administrative policies reflect that.  The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 provides that any court in deciding questions relating to children shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. The law in relation to children has been updated and developed on a systematic basis in recent years and we have a body of law that is comparable with the best in other countries.  Important provisions in relation to children have been provided for in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1991 and the Child Care Act, 1991.  A White Paper on education is being prepared in the Department of Education and a Juvenile Justice <Col N="185" /> Bill is being prepared in the Department of Justice.  The Family Law Bill, 1994 which I have initiated has important provisions in relation to maintenance of children. A Bill is also being prepared in my Department to strengthen the law on domestic violence.  Having regard to the extensive provisions which already exist in our laws in relation to children which are being constantly reviewed and developed by the relevant Departments, the question of the establishment of a commission on the status of children is not at present in comtemplation by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am aware of recent case studies in England of 152 children and their parents which seem to indicate that the children of separated parents may do better if the parents remain with them in the home.  I am also aware of a larger ongoing study in England of 17,000 children which has found that where there is parental conflict in the home it tends to be better for the children if the parents live separately from each other.  Under the law as it stands in this country, before granting a decree of judicial separation, the court must be satisfied that provision exists or can be made for the welfare of any dependent children of the family and, on granting a decree, the court must, in considering the matter of occupancy or sale of the family home, have regard to the welfare of the family as a whole and to the circumstance that it may not be possible for the spouses to continue residing together.</P>
    <P>Deputies would probably agree that the policy of that law is sound, on the basis that where the parties cannot reach agreement on the terms of separation the court is allowed to make orders on the basis of all the evidence before it in each case with particular reference to what is best for the children.</P>

      <P>The Minister indulged in a Second Stage speech, which illustrates the weakness of his case.  When the Government was formed a Programme for Government was set out in which the Government proposed to hold a divorce referendum.  I believe that the timescale for the holding of this referendum is unachievable.  There are a couple of reasons it will not be possible to hold the referendum in October, one of which is that the Government is divided on this issue.  Most members of the Government opposed divorce in the last referendum and not one has made a statement in support of the proposed referendum. While the Minister has done a good job as a persuader &mdash; he listed out all the things he has done &mdash; it will not be possible adequately to inform the electorate before the holding of the referendum in the autumn.</P>

      <P>I look forward to having many interesting exchanges with him. There is no reason that the timescale for the referendum will not be met.  Legislation is in hand.  The Family Law Reform Bill, one of the main Bills required to be put in place, has been published and <Col N="187" /> Second Stage will probably be taken this week.  I am sure, with the co-operation of Deputy Carey and other spokespersons on equality and law reform, it will speedily be enacted.  Other measures will also be ready.  As the Taoiseach indicated, it is the Government's intention to proceed with the referendum in the autumn.  I am sorry to disappoint Deputy Carey by telling him that the Government is entirely united on the holding of the referendum. It is set out in the Programme for Government and the Taoiseach, on many occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;including in his Árd Fheis speech, made positive references to Fianna Fáil support for the divorce referendum.  The Government recognises the need for this referendum.  My concern is not about the Labour Party or the Fianna Fáil Party, but I am beginning to have reservations about the attitude of the Fine Gael Party.  I trust that the policy outlined by the Deputy's predecessor and other spokespersons for that party will remain the policy of Fine Gael.  If not, they should spell out their policy on this issue.  I expect the support of parties on all sides of the House on this important national issue.  That support has been previously signalled.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to two issues, the first of which relates to the Matrimonial Home Bill, which was dropped by the Minister like a hot potato.  It has been said that the fact that this Bill was rejected by the Supreme Court was a rebuff to the Dáil.  However, we must remember that all sides of the House accepted this legislation.  It is up to the Minister to bring forward legislation that is acceptable to the Supreme Court.  I hope he is not inferring that his Department has neither the interest nor the expertise to pursue that matter.  When the Bill was considered by the Supreme Court it was not the principle that was at issue, it was, and I quote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will defer to your ruling on this matter.  It is the principle of this issue we are concerned with, and I ask the Minister to take that on board.  He should not simply ignore the Matrimonial Home Bill and pretend it never existed. The Minister knows my feelings on the divorce referendum and I have assured him of my support and that of my party on the issue.  However, has he considered that there are grave reservations on the part of many people in this regard?  In the light of the legislation that is about to come before the House, is the Government secure in the belief that the referendum can be successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to Deputy Keogh, I would point out that it was not I or the Government who dropped the Matrimonial Home Bill, as she put it, like a hot potato; it was the Supreme Court that dropped it.  The Government and all parties in the House were supportive of the Matrimonial Home Bill and the concept it enunciated.  but regrettably, to my disappointment and that of the Government, the Supreme Court found that it was not admissible under the terms of the Constitution.  I, together with the Attorney General, very carefully considered that judgement word by word, paragraph by paragraph, and by reason of the statement made by the Chief Justice in delivering the judgement of the Supreme Court, it was not possible to recast the Bill in a form that would bring about the possibility to introduce an automatic joint ownership in the family home.  Regrettably, that was not possible by reason of the way in which the judgment was framed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Matrimonial Home Bill was an important plank of the Government's family law reform programme, a Bill which the Government very much wanted to enact and to which I and my Department devoted extensive energies <Col N="189" /> over a period of time, it is not a measure that directly refers to the divorce referendum. That Bill was intended to deal with stable marriages, not marriage breakdown.  In the case of marriage breakdown not only are the family home and contents on the table for division by the courts but all the property of the marriage, including the family farm, business bank accounts and so on.  That has been the position since the Judicial Separation Act, 1989, and will continue to be the position under the Family Law Bill, 1994, which also includes pensions. In the case of marital breakdown, the family home as well as all other assets of the marriage are on the table for division by the courts in the appropriate manner.</P>

      <P>The time is fast running out for dealing with priority questions.  There are two remaining questions which the Chair is anxious to dispose of and I appeal for brevity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  The principle of joint ownership was not rejected by the Supreme Court, and it is up to the Minister to come back with legislation in that regard.  Notwithstanding his view about that legislation, the Minister said it was one of the measures included in the major programme of family law reform to which the Government is committed and which will culminate in the divorce referendum. Is what he said then true or is what he is saying now true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way in which the principle of the Matrimonial Home Bill, namely, automatic joint ownership of the family home, could be achieved is by having a separate referendum to amend the Constitution.  I considered that option and it was discussed by the Government. However, the view was it would not be appropriate or advisable to hold a second referendum on that issue.  No doubt all parties in the House will have an opportunity to discuss a general review of the Constitution at some future date and the matter could be considered in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> As I said, the Matrimonial Home Bill was an important plank in the Government's family law reform programme, but it applied to a position of stable marriages. It was not a condition for proceeding with the divorce referendum for the simple reason what when the courts decide cases of marital breakdown, separation and divorce, if that comes to pass, the most likely outcome is that the family home will not end up in the joint ownership of both spouses but will be ordered to be transferred in its entirety to one of the spouses, usually the wife.  This is only right and proper and is being done in many cases.  That is a much more likely outcome than a joint ownership arrangement in cases of marital breakdown.  This proves my point that the Bill applied to stable marriages; the intent was to give women who work in the home joint ownership in it.  Unfortunately, due to no fault of any party in this House who all wanted this measure &mdash; many Governments going back over ten years also wanted to achieve this position &mdash; our intentions in this area have not proven to be realisable.</P>
    <P>There may be other measures which can be considered on a different basis, not on an automatic joint ownership basis.  My Department is carefully considering other options in regard to property which will not require constitutional amendment.  If a decision is made to proceed along those lines and it is possible to do so, an announcement will be made to the House at the appropriate time.</P>

During a week when blind people have been put on a three-day week, I had hoped the Minister would say something other than simply refer to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. For example, I had hoped he would refer to the legislative measures he proposes to introduce in this area.

      <P>It is regrettable that, having asked the question, Deputy Carey did not listen to the answer.  If he had he would have heard me refer to important matters other than the terms of reference of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  I told him I am bringing forward legislation which will provide for legal redress in cases of discrimination against a number of categories of disadvantaged people, including those with a disability.  Two Bills in this area are at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department, one an anti-discrimination measure dealing with employment and employment <Col N="193" /> related matters and the other an equal status measure dealing with discrimination in the non-employment field covering the provision of goods, facilities and services, including recreational facilities, entertainment, transport, professional services, accommodation and the disposal of property.  These two major Bills will provide very substantial protection to different categories of disadvantaged people, including those with a disability.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the legislation introduced in the USA.  We have looked at this excellent legislation and drawn from it.  I would also mention to the Deputy for his research the excellent legislation introduced in Australia and a number of other countries, including the UK.  It is my intention to draw the best from all that legislation and to introduce two long overdue landmark Bills which will for the first time protect disadvantaged people in society.</P>

      <P>As matters stand, there is a wide range of provisions in place which are designed to provide spouses with a measure of protection in relation to the family home and property.  These include provisions under the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, the Succession Act, 1965, the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  The Supreme Court decision on the Matrimonial Home Bill has not diminished these protections. Furthermore, this House will shortly have the opportunity to debate the Family Law Bill which will provide substantial additional powers to the courts in a wide range of new areas.</P>
      <P>The Matrimonial Home Bill proposed to give each spouse equal rights of ownership in the matrimonial home unless they already had those rights.  The effect of the Supreme Court's decision appears to be that, because the Bill applied joint ownership to every matrimonial home and not merely to particular categories or instances, it could alter many joint family decisions, as the Supreme Court put it, freely agreed about the ownership of matrimonial homes.  This, the court held, would be a disproportionate interference by the State in the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the family to make decisions within its authority. Having regard to the fundamental nature of that decision, no Government could lightly embark on the road to a referendum on the matter and, as announced on 1 February last, the Government has no plans to bring forward a Bill to enable a referendum to be held on the question of automatic joint ownership of the matrimonial home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> I am aware of the deep disappointment felt by many people at the decision made by the Supreme Court.  I share that disappointment. However, I am convinced that our immediate priority must be to focus on other aspects of family law, including administrative measures, which need to be addressed and which are included in the Government's comprehensive programme of civil law reform.  As Minister with responsibility for this area, I look forward to implementing that programme in full and with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that the Family Law Bill, 1994, contains a range of substantive measures.  The position regarding the provisions contained in Part III of the Matrimonial Home Bill which impacted upon certain existing legislation, notably the Married Women's Status, Act, 1957, the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and the Family Law Act, 1981, is that they are also included in that Bill which is before the House awaiting Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that existing legislation clearly does not protect women in the home and that is why the Programme for Government made a commitment in regard to joint ownership?  Will he accept also that by jettisoning the principle of joint ownership he has thrown doubt over his entire programme of law reform and unless he takes action he will cast doubt over the possibility of a divorce referendum being won?  Will he accept there is an ideal opportunity to show consistency by holding a constitutional referendum on the question of joint ownership on 9 June because it must be separated from the divorce referendum?  If the Minister does not avail of that opportunity, the destabilising effect of the Supreme Court decision will be felt when he seeks support for the divorce referendum.  The Minister should (a) address the question of joint ownership on 9 June, (b) publish quickly in unequivocal terms his constitutional amendment which he intends to put to the Irish people and (c) accept <Col N="196" /> that there is a matter of grave concern relating to children.  His reply does not address that concern.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but many points were raised on which I did not have an opportunity to reply.  I tabled a question on this matter.  The Minister has on obligation to take advice not just from lawyers and not just in regard to property, but regarding the central issue of the case of children.  He must take advice also from the public and from professionals on how divorce can be managed in a way that minimises the impact on children and that must be couched in proposed legislation.  If that central question is not dealt with, many people will be fearful of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that existing legislation does not afford any protection to women in the home.  The legislation to which I referred in my reply, the Family Home Protection Act, the Family Law Act, the Married Women's Status Act and so on afford a measure of protection to women in the home by providing that the family home cannot be sold, mortgaged or disposed of without the consent of both spouses. However, that legislation does not vest a half share by way of joint tenancy in the family home and contents which was the intent of the Matrimonial Home Bill.  I regret that very much because that was the result which the Government desired to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite incorrect of the Deputy to say that the Government has jettisoned the principle of joint ownership.  The Government advocated the principle of joint ownership to the extent that it introduced to this House and to the Seanad and secured the passage of a measure to implement joint ownership of the family home.  It was the Supreme Court that held that that was not possible as a matter of principle under Article 41 of the Constitution. It would be open to the Government to hold a second referendum to <Col N="197" /> attempt to deal with that but in the view of the Government, with which I whole-heartedly agree, it would not be appropriate or prudent at this time to suggest a separate amendment to attempt to override the provisions of Article 41 of the Constitution.  There must at least be some doubt whether such an amendment would be welcomed by the Irish people at this stage.</P>
    <P>The only possible way of approaching this problem &mdash; there may be a way of doing so on a different basis &mdash; is by a different form of legislative change which would not have constitutional implications. All aspects of that matter are being carefully considered in my Department, in consultation with the Attorney General.  If it proves possible to proceed down that road, an announcement will be made to the House at the appropriate time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many women are in an impossible situation when they are called in by financial institutions and asked to agree to the family home being used as collateral against borrowings?  Out of loyalty to their spouse or otherwise invariably they have to agree to this.  Has the Minister any intention to caution women against taking this step?  Has he any proposals to meet representatives of financial institutions and request them to refrain from putting women in this impossible position?  I am aware of several cases where this happened to women on farms. The banks requested these women to agree to the family home being used as collateral against borrowings for the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have heard of cases of women being requested to release their rights under the Family Home Protection Act.  Obviously, they would need to consider that carefully, in consultation with lawyers, before they sign such documentation. I was asked in the House &mdash; I think by Deputy Ahearn &mdash; whether it might be possible to prohibit such signatures but, as I said on that occasion, that would not be possible because there <Col N="198" /> may be many occasions when spouses may wish to raise finance, to improve a farm, business or whatever, and that finance might not be advanced by a financial institution if the house was not used as collateral.  That might be disadvantageous to many families.</P>
      <P>It would represent an undue intrusion into their rights.  However, it would be important &mdash; I agree with Deputy Ahearn on this &mdash; that before signing such a document which might pose a threat to the family home, a spouse should exercise the greatest care and realise there is a risk that the family home could be put in jeopardy.  They should seek legal advice before doing so.  We made that compulsory in the ill-fated Matrimonial Home Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct that the Minister will re-examine the principle of joint ownership of the family home with a view to bringing forward legislation and that he will ask the Attorney General to examine that legislation?  If so will the Minister seek independent legal advice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Automatic joint ownership of the family home is not capable of revival for the reasons given and on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court on the Matrimonial Home Bill. Unfortunately &mdash; I say this with regret &mdash; it is not possible to achieve the principle of joint ownership.  However, it may be possible to secure, in certain circumstances, an interest in the family home for women who work in the home, but not an automatic joint ownership.  I think the Deputy knows what I am talking about.  That may be possible, but I am not certain as yet.  It is a complex matter involving the law of property, trusts, contributions to property in the name of another person and such matters. It requires very careful examination. If it is possible to achieve it without involving constitutional risk, I will certainly look at it very carefully.  We are examining it in the Department and consulting with the Attorney General but it is downstream at present.  The House <Col N="199" /> will be advised what progress may be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, if he does not produce an alternative, the flawed Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993 will have dealt a mortal blow to the prospect of any success in a divorce referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  Under no circumstances would I concede that point.  It is not in accordance with the fact.  The Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993, for the reasons I have already explained, was referable to stable marriages.  In the case of a marital breakdown, be it separation or divorce, extensive powers already exist under the Judicial Separation Act, 1989.  These will be extended further by the Family Law Bill, 1994, to enable the courts to distribute in the appropriate way, not only the family home but all the property and assets of that marriage.  In many cases the decision of the courts will be &mdash; and is already under the Judicial Separation Act cases &mdash; not the transfer of a joint ownership of the family home to one spouse but the transfer of it entirely to one spouse, usually the wife.  That is what people will be examining in the context of separation and a divorce referendum.  There is no basis for Deputy Carey's presumptive suggestion that the failure of the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993 to pass the Supreme Court would affect the outcome of a divorce referendum in any way.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it would be extremely reassuring &mdash; because of the lack of public confidence in the Attorney General's judgement &mdash; if he would take independent legal advice in relation to any proposal in regard to women in the home and ownership of that home, partial or otherwise, and also in relation to divorce legislation?</P>

      <P>The Attorney General is a constitutional officer of this State.  It is quite improper for Deputy McManus to call into question his professional abilities. He is a person of many years experience and under the Constitution he is the legal adviser to the Government.  His advice must be, and always will be, sought by the Government and followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite appropriate to say in this House what people are saying in the streets, which is that unfortunately some of the advice given by the Attorney General has turned out to be very wrong. If we cannot criticise that here, I do not know where we can do so since we have had a series of incidents in respect of which the advice given by the Attorney General has turned out to be wrong.  If we are asked to accept his advice, as we are continually in this House then we, the legislators, should have the confidence in the Attorney General that the office deserves.  I do not wish to engage in a personal attack on an individual but in particular instances, we do not have confidence in the advice given.  The Minister should take this criticism on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that it is wise and advisable for wives to seek legal advice when subjected to pressure by financial institutions.  I am not so concerned about those spouses who know their rights but I am concerned about the vast numbers of spouses who are in very vulnerable positions.  How does the Minister intend to ensure that legal advice is made available to such spouses and to ensure that it is mandatory for financial institutions to ensure that such legal advice is made available, thereby protecting spouses in very vulnerable circumstances?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Employment Equality Agency to draft a code of practice to deal with the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace in full consultation with the social partners and other relevant bodies.  The document is currently close to final stage and consultations are near to conclusion.  I understand from the Employment Equality Agency that the social partners have been most constructive in these consultations to date. When finalised the draft code will be submitted to me.  Once I am sure that the code is satisfactory I will arrange for its publication.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment in the recently agreed <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> it is intended to issue the code this year.  It will be promoted, monitored and reviewed by the Employment Equality Agency.  I also propose that it will be given statutory recognition under forthcoming revised employment equality legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that a code of practice will be published soon. I wonder whether we shall be afforded an opportunity to debate it in this House. How does the Minister intend this code of practice will be monitored?  Does he not agree there is great danger when the code of practice is established that the reality on the ground will not change because it will not be statutorily binding? Since the numbers of complaints of sexual harassment are increasing will the Minister not agree that, at the end of the <Col N="203" /> day, statutory obligation is the only thing that will have effect?  How soon may we expect legislation that will have an impact on this problem in the workplace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The drafting of the code of practice is nearing completion.  The latest information I have from the Employment Equality Agency is that they have secured acceptable co-operation and agreement in its preparation from both IBEC and the ICTU.  The code will be promoted, monitored and reviewed by the Employment Equality Agency who have already gained very considerable experience and expertise in advising workers and employers on this subject. The status of the code will be recognised under the pending employment equality Bill which is at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
      <P>It will be possible to refer to the code when appropriate cases come up for consideration by tribunals, the Labour Court, the Circuit Court or whatever.  The parameters set down in the code will be given judicial effect by the legislation.  The Employment Equality Agency takes it upon itself, as it has done on the question of sexual harassment, to promote information about it.  It conducts seminars from time to time and has information documentation.  Many people consult it on a regular basis in cases of sexual harassment. I am hopeful that when the new code is published and has been given statutory recognition in the employment equality legislation it will make a major contribution towards reducing instances of sexual harassment in the workplace.</P>

I am concerned about a programme of awareness in relation to the code of practice. Notwithstanding the fact that the EEA hold seminars on awareness is the Minister prepared to give funding to this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for promoting and monitoring the code and keeping its operations under review will rest with the Employment and Equality Agency.  It has a great deal of experience and knowledge in this area.  I will ensure that the EEA is adequately funded to enable it to take the necessary steps to ensure the widest possible dissemination of knowledge about the code and what is required of employers and employees in the workplace to bring the all too widespread instances of sexual harassment in the workplace under control.</P>
      <P>The EEA held a seminar on the subject recently in Dublin Castle and brought speakers and experts on the subject from Britain.  There was a wide ranging participation with over a couple of hundred people in attendance.  I addressed the seminar which was professionally organised. We can safely leave promotion of the code and the question of control of sexual harassment in the very capable hands of the Employment Equality Agency which does an excellent job.  The additional armoury of the new code, with the benefit of statutory backing, will be a major advance on this subject.</P>

      <P>The legislative programme for which I have responsibility <Col N="205" /> is very wide-ranging, covering civil law generally and equality matters.  As the Deputy will appreciate, decisions have to be made about the priority to be given to various proposals.  In reply to a question on 3 November 1993 at columns 872-874 of the Official Report concerning my legislative proposals for the next 12 months, I set out a list of 13 Bills &mdash; five of those measures have been published and the remaining eight are at various stages of preparation.  The list did not include the matter to which the Deputy refers.  However, the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to update the civil law of defamation and that commitment, taking account of the comprehensive work of the Law Reform Commission on the subject of defamation, will be honoured when the other important legislative matters on which I am currently engaged can be disposed of.</P>
      <P>Any proposals I may have on the subject matter of the question will be announced in the normal way in due course.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister share my concern about the increasing disturbing tendency recently in some sections of the media to say things about dead persons which they would not say when they were alive?  Is it his intention when updating the law on defamation to include the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission that the personal representatives of dead persons would be entitled to pursue actions in cases where the dead were defamed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about a number of recent instances regarding defamation of dead persons. The Law Reform Commission recommended a new course of action in relation to defamatory statements about a dead person.  It suggested the right to take such proceedings should be vested in the personal representative.  It also recommended that there would be an obligation in the first instance to consult the immediate family of the deceased &mdash; spouse, children, parents, brothers and sisters &mdash;<Col N="206" /> before any such proceedings would be instituted.  I suggested a limitation period of three years from the date of death of the allegedly defamed person.  It also suggested that the remedy available should be a declaratory order and, where appropriate, an injunction to restrain further dissemination of the defamation. Those recommendations will have my favourble support when the law on defamation is being examined generally.</P>

There is a heavy programme of important and extensive legislation which I consider has priority over this area.  That is not to decry the need to amend the law on defamation and libel generally.  However, I am hopeful that during the lifetime of the Government it will prove possible to bring in legislation on this subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no proposals to provide incentives to employers in respect of workplace child care facilities.  The question <Col N="207" /> of flexible working hours is primarily a matter for employers and employees at the level of the individual enterprise. However, I welcome the commitment by the social partners in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work &ldquo;to support voluntary initiatives at enterprise level on equal pay, equal treatment and equal opportunities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Many employers will be aware that the introduction of family friendly practices such as child care and flexible working hours offer significant benefits to the organisations.  These include helping employers to attract and retain committed, skilled and experienced staff by ensuring the safeguarding of investment in training and development and ultimately increasing efficiency and profitability.</P>
    <P>The report of the working party on child care for working parents, which I have just received, acknowledges the value of flexible working hours arrangements and workplace child care provision. However, it clearly recommends the need to develop a wider range of options for child care provision than workplace nurseries.  I am examining the working party's recommendations to determine what the Government can do to progress this area with the employer parent and community interests concerned.</P>
    <P>I have already secured Government agreement to the inclusion of a provision of £1 million in this year's Estimate for my Department to assist on a pilot basis the initiation of projects for the establishment of child care centres in disadvantaged areas involving partnerships between local employers and community groups.  This initiative while not targeted specifically at facilitating working parents will represent an important and worthwhile input by Government to stimulating increasing provision of child care facilities this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's reply.  He often said how much he appreciates the work of the Commission on the Status of Women in <Col N="208" /> recommending that allowances for capital costs incurred in providing child care facilities should be part and parcel of what happens in the workplace.  In this instance I ask the Minister to act as a persuader with the social partners.  It is not enough to say a wider range of facilities is needed than workplace nurseries. The workplace is one area where such facilities are not provided and it would be very valuable if the Minister supported the commission in this regard.  Is he prepared to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>All politicians are persuaders in one form or another.  Some employers, very sensibly, provide crèche facilities in the workplace and gain very substantially as a result.  They also facilitate members of their staff by allowing flexible hours of work.  Both those measures enable them to retain the services of skilled staff to the benefit of all concerned.  The report of the working party on child care for working parents, which I received within the past few days and which will be published in due course, contains a large number of recommendations.  Before undertaking any definitive steps I want to examine the numerous recommendations to see how we can progress the provision of child care facilities generally in places of work and community-based independent crèche facilities.  I have secured for the first time for my Department £1 million to set up a number of pilot projects for the establishment of child care centres in disadvantaged areas, involving partnerships between local employers and community groups.  I already had a number of discussions with groups with a view to getting such pilot projects under way.  There are great advantages to be derived from this because it will provide an objective for setting up training programmes for child minders who, when trained, will have outlets which they can take up in these pilot projects, thereby having a snowball effect which will increase child care facilities of different types throughout the country.  We are making progress on this issue and I assure <Col N="209" /> the Deputy that I remain fully supportive of the concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in placing child care on the political agenda is disgraceful. As the Minister is aware, we have the second lowest provision in Europe for child care.  The delay in bringing the report of the working party on child care for working parents to the Minister is also disgraceful.  When will the report be published and how does the Minister see himself playing a lead role in ensuring that greater flexibility is available to parents in the workforce?  This is a key issue, some employers have responded very well but far too many have still not provided the flexible arrangements we need, which every European and national report said is essential for equality of opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the report has been long delayed.  It contains a large number of recommendations which will have to be re-examined carefully to see which is practicable, capable of implementation and the costings.  As the Deputy is aware child care facilities cover different situations, some applicable to working parents and others to mothers who may wish to take up education.  I am particularly concerned about providing facilities in disadvantaged areas.  When the Estimates for my Department were being prepared I sought £1 million from the Minister for Finance for pilot projects which I would like to set up.  Indeed, if Deputies have any suggestions regarding the setting up of a pilot project, within those parameters, to serve disadvantaged areas I would be happy to consider them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no distinction between rural and urban areas.  Any area <Col N="210" /> can be considered for a pilot project.  The parameters are that it should be in a disadvantaged area and involve a plan for a partnership between local employers and community groups; areas of high unemployment where women wish to participate in educational or training courses or to take up employment. If any Deputy wishes to make proposals to me, within those parameters, I would be happy to consider them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recognise that one of the biggest obstacles to women taking up employment, particularly low income employment, is the cost of child care?  There are instances where women simply cannot afford to take up work and, indeed, employers complain about this.  Is the Minister aware that employers benefit immensely when child care facilities are provided?  Will he ensure that employers will contribute to and benefit from the provision of child care facilities?  I accept the Minister's point about disadvantaged areas but surely the most important way out of disadvantage is where people can take up employment and where child care is linked directly with the possibility of employment? The implications of child care are often fundamental in the decision of a woman to take up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments of Deputy McManus.  The Government <Col N="211" /> has allocated £1 million to a pilot project on this subject.  The Deputy's comments are well taken.  All the recommendations and suggestions in the child care report will be carefully examined and the report will be published in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that nothing has ever happened to promote women's or children's rights by virtue of a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude, that the Minister needs to devise solutions and that it is not enough endlessly to peruse the report from the Commission on the Status of Women and the new report?  I suggest that if the Minister passed this to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights some work might be done with it.  Would he not agree that he is deviating when he calls the area of disadvantage into this debate?  The issue of child care is a topic of the nineties, not just an issue of disadvantage.  It relates to equality for women, the proper functioning of families and the workforce.  It is an issue of huge importance with regard to children's rights.  The <i>laissez faire</i> attitude of the Minister is driving everybody insane.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Government I take this opportunity to express our deepest sympathy on the death of a former Member of this House, Mr. Patrick O'Reilly from Virginia, County Cavan.  He was elected to this House on seven different occasions, the first being 1951.  He was elected as a Member of Seanad Éireann in 1965 and he served in the Council of Europe.  He was a prominant member of Cavan County Council and was chairman of the council on two different occasions.  He was a great promoter and sound supporter of the community spirit.  He was best described by a former Member of this House who knew him very well as &ldquo;nature's own gentleman, the salt of the earth&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Government I take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathy to his wife, Maureen, to his <Col N="289" /> daughter, to his six sons and to all his relatives and friends who will miss him. Go ndeana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in expressing sympathy to the family of the late Paddy O'Reilly.  My information from that very reliable conveyor of news, <i>The Anglo-Celt</i> newspaper, is that Paddy O'Reilly was first elected to the Dáil in 1943 and served until 1948; he was re-elected in 1951 and served continously until 1965.  Having lost a seat in 1965 he was re-elected to this House in 1969 and served until he was finally defeated by a mere 309 votes by the future Tánaiste, Deputy John Wilson, in the general election of 1973.</P>
      <P>Paddy Reilly, as I knew him and served with him, was first elected as a farmers' TD, representing the agricultural interest, not as a member of a party but to represent one vocational group.  A review of his contributions to the Dáil over his long career shows that that remained an abiding interest for him.  He concerned himself with the problems of small farmers, of milk producers and pig producers who are typical of the county of Cavan to which he gave such great service.</P>
      <P>There are a few interesting highlights one would find in his long career.  He was committed to rural development and it is interesting to note that the second Parliamentary Question he tabled in this House on 2 March, 1944 related to the fact that in that year some rural houses did not have a daily postal delivery. Deputy O'Reilly was concerned that this be put right in the interests of rural development.  It is an interesting comment on changing times and perhaps on the persistent dominance of economics over social concerns, that the then Minister, Deputy Little, refused to agree to Deputy O'Reilly's request for daily postal deliveries in rural Ireland on the following grounds:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In present circumstances, the considerable additional expenditure which the provision of a daily delivery on all rural posts would entail would not be justified and accordingly I regret that <Col N="290" /> I cannot favourably consider such a proposal. </P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy O'Reilly lived to see his wish fulfilled and Deputy Little's concerns overcome.</P>
    <P>Another important initiative he took was on 12 December, 1951 when he proposed an amendment to the Underdeveloped Areas Bill which provides the basis on which the IDA continues to give a higher rate of grant in certain parts of the country than in others.  In 1951 he sought to have Cavan included as an underdeveloped area entitled to a higher rate of industrial grant.  Unfortunately, he did not persuade Deputy Seán Lemass of the wisdom of that and by 67 votes to 35 Deputy O'Reilly's proposal to have Cavan included as an area warranting a higher rate of industrial grant was defeated.  I am glad to say that his advice prevailed in due course and Cavan and Monaghan are now treated as areas deserving this treatment.</P>
    <P>Mr. Paddy O'Reilly was, as we all know, a Border Deputy and he took a great interest not in the larger questions of constitutional structures for this island or relations between this island and its neighbour but in the practical matters of cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that one of his first interventions in the Dáil when he was re-elected in 1951 was to ask for cross-Border free trade in agricultural goods between County Cavan and its neighbouring counties, Armagh and Fermanagh. Again, his counsel was succesful on that matter.  His very last intervention in the Dáil in 1972 concerned a proposal, still unrealised, for the drainage of the Erne River &mdash; a cross-Border project which would have been of great benefit to people both in this State and in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Those are just some of the landmarks of this man's career.  As the Taoiseach said, he was not a flamboyant political character but got on with the job of representing his constituency and did so extremely well.  I have had the privilege of knowing him, having served with him in the 19th Dáil.  He was very kindly.  It <Col N="291" /> is a tribute to his character and to his kindliness that the family tradition in politics continues.  His son Patrick O'Reilly, junior, was elected, topping the poll, in the Ballyjamesduff electoral area at the last local elections and continues the great tradition set by his father.</P>
    <P>I join with the Taoiseach and other Members whom I know will wish to contribute, in expressing our sympathy to his widow, Maureen, and to the entire O'Reilly family on the loss of a man who served the people of Cavan and of Ireland with great distinction.</P>

By any standard that is a period of long service to politics, to parliamentary democracy and to one's constituents.  I am aware, also, that Mr. O'Reilly had a great interest in agriculture, in particular, and pursued the interests of his constituents with great vigour.  I have seen many witty comments written about his time in both the Seanad and the Dáil.</P>

He was also a member of the county committee of agriculture and the vocational education committee.  He was a founder member of the Virginia Show Society, one of the foremost provincial shows in the country.  That body came together and built a second level school in the town &mdash; up to then there was no such facility within its catchment area &mdash; and handed it over to the local vocational education committee.  It will be for that unique achievement that the late Patrick O'Reilly will be remembered.  He was a man of the community and for the community.  He put his best efforts into helping the people who elected him and for whom he felt he could do most.  He will be sadly missed.  Had he lived he would be 88 years next month.

I think it would be useful if the House would agree that the Minister be allowed to take a few brief questions at the end of the discussion or alternatively, that he make an opening statement and a concluding statement in which he would respond to Members.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board informed me on Thursday, 17 February 1994 that evidence had emerged that there was a possible link between the product anti-D immunoglobulin and hepatitis C.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board made arrangements to change the product and this took place the following day, Friday, 18 February 1994. The board has introduced a new virally inactivated product which has been supplied to hospitals.</P>
      <P>Rhesus haemolytic disease of the newborn is a condition that affects Rh positive babies born to Rh negative women who have developed anti-bodies to the Rhesus factor.  These anti-bodies generally do not affect the first pregnancy but develop in subsequent pregnancies. The mother's anti-bodies cross the placenta while the baby is still in the womb and begin to destroy the baby's red cells. The baby can be thus affected by anaemia, brain damage or may be stillborn. Over 100 babies a year in Ireland were lost as a result of this condition.  Others, less severly affected, required treatment by exchange transfusions.</P>
      <P>In the late 1960s, it was discovered that the development of these harmful anti-bodies in the mother could be prevented by the administration of a substance called anti-D immunoglobulin.  A national programme for the production of this vital substance was initiated in 1969 and has been dramatically successful in preventing the condition with now fewer than five babies per year being severely affected.</P>
      <P>The hepatitis C virus was first described in 1989.  Infection with hepatitis C may cause jaundice immediately. More usually the infected person is totally unaware of infection.  In some cases, however, the virus may persist and cause chronic inflammation of the liver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of introducing a screening test for hepatitis C for donations nationally had been considered in 1989 and 1990.  During this period the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the <Col N="300" /> Department of Health examined the possibility of introducing such a test. However, a review of international practices and discussions with medical experts abroad revealed that there was insufficient scientific information about the test to approve its routine introduction. The position was carefully monitored and when the test was considered sufficiently reliable for the purposes of screening donations, it was introduced in Ireland. This occured in 1991 at the same time as this screening was introduced in the UK. I emphasise that cost is not a factor in the timing of the introduction of such tests and, in fact, £1 million for hepatitis C testing by the Blood Transfusion Service Board has been approved to date.</P>
    <P>In January 1994, as part of the ongoing monitoring of quality assurance procedures by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, it emerged that a disproportionate number of group Rh negative female donors had anti-bodies for hepatitis C.  On further investigation it was found that nine of the ten female Rh negative donors had received anti-D in 1977.  This was linked with an earlier report of six cases of jaundice which had been investigated in 1977 when no cause for the jaundice had been found.  It would seem that the anti-D manufactured in 1977 is potentially the cause of this problem.</P>
    <P>I commend the Blood Transfusion Service Board for carrying out this very thorough research which is essential in the monitoring and quality control of blood products which it produces.</P>
    <P>When this matter was brought to my attention, my immediate concerns were: (i) the protection of all future recipients of anti-D immunoglobulin and (ii) the identification of any risk, however small, for any mothers who received the anti-D immunoglobulin product in the past.  I agree, therefore, that the action taken yesterday by the Blood Transfusion Service Board was correct as the safety of blood products must be the first priority at all times.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board has announced its intention to follow up all of the mothers who may have been at <Col N="301" /> risk of contracting hepatitis C from the anti-D immunoglobulin product.  A special public awareness campaign has been launched to inform the public as to the possible risks.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements have been made to provide information to general practitioners who, in many cases, will be the first point of contact for the women concerned. Free telephone lines have also been put in place by the Blood Transfusion Service Board to provide information to people who might be anxious as to whether they are in the category of those who might be at risk.  The phone lines are open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each weekday beginning today Tuesday, 22 February 1994.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements for testing of women at risk have been made at the following locations throughout the country: Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Drogheda, Sligo, Tullamore, Clonmel, Killarney, Letterkenny, and Cavan.  Blood testing at the Blood Transfusion Service Boards centres and at general practitioners surgeries will be administered free of charge.</P>
    <P>I am determined that every woman at risk will, as far as practicable, be indentified. The BTSB is making specific arrangements to trace the cohort of mothers who were given the anti-D products in 1977 and are focusing on these mothers.  Because of changes of addresses it may not be possible to trace everybody and thus the public awareness campaign has been launched.  Because we cannot be sure that the problem is confined to 1977, the Blood Transfusion Service Board is advising any woman who has received anti-D to be tested. Decisions on the individual follow-up necessary will be made as a result of the ongoing testing process.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that all medical interventions, including the use of blood and blood products, carry some risks which require the balancing of the benefits and risks of particular treatments.  I would like to reassure the public that there is no need for alarm.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board has taken action to ensure the safety of blood and blood products as <Col N="302" /> far as possible.  The prevalence of hepatitis C in Ireland among blood donors is low and compares favourably with other European countries.  This implies that hepatitis C is not widespread in the population.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that approximately 100,000 women require testing, which will be provided within as short a time frame as possible.</P>
    <P>If any of the people give anti-D immunoglobulin need medical treatment for hepatitis C as a result of receiving this product, I confirm that whatever treatment is prescribed by the clinicians will be provided by the public hospital services free of charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement from the Blood Transfusion Board that many women may have been contaminated with hepatitis C following treatment with anti-D immunoglobulin in the 1970s has sent shock waves among mothers of children of 14 years and over.  Although the announcement refers specifically to administration of this substance in 1977, it is not clear whether women who had this treatment between 1970 and 1990, when hepatitis C was identified, should also be concerned and need checking.  I am glad the Minister implied they will because I got a call this morning informing me that women who had babies in 1974 and 1975 were told on the help line that they need not be concerned and did not need to be tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that this information is available, the responsibility falls on the Minister for Health to ensure that every woman who may have been affected is contacted and tested as quickly as possible.  I realise this is an enormous task but it is essential that all resources be mobilised to carry it out. It is necessary that the Minister clarify what actions have already been taken through hospital and general practitioner records to indentify the relevant mothers. It will also be essential to contact all adoption agencies in an effort to identify mothers who gave their babies for adoption. It will be essential to identify mothers who may have miscarried but may also have received the anti-D injection <Col N="303" /> after such miscarriage and may not have been recorded.  It is essential that groups working for sections of our society, such as travelling mothers, would assist in identifying mothers in that community whose addresses may not be readily available from hospital records or who may have changed their place of residence many times since the birth of their children in the 1970s.</P>
    <P>When a woman is shown to be infected, what treatment will she get and where will it be carried out?  Can this infection be passed on genetically to offspring or sexually transmitted?  The Minister has not answered these questions and they must be answered.</P>
    <P>I understand that many women have already received postcards in this morning's post telling them to go to their GP's clinics.  Will the Minister clarify how this group was identified?  I am disturbed by the fact that GPs were not immediately notified about how to deal with their patients when this information became known last week, particularly as it was clear that when a woman received a notice to attend her GP she would go immediately.  This morning I spoke to a number of doctors who told me they were unable to handle queries or to give information other than what was contained in newspaper articles.  The doctors themselves received nothing in their post about this issue.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern is that some of these women have been blood donors, particularly before 1991.  We are told that since 1991 all blood has been screened for hepatitis C.  What is the position with regard to blood taken before this screening process came into use?  Added to the concern of one woman who was in touch with me today that she might have hepatitus C is the concern that she may have given blood which, in turn, might have contaminated somebody else.  It is important that this additional worry is not added to the trauma already felt.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say definitively that all risk of infection has fully disappeared since 1991 or is there still a risk for mothers receiving the anti-D injection <Col N="304" /> today?  I do not wish to be alarmist or add to the fears of some women and their families.  However, it is important that the openness and transparency the Minister promised is continued.</P>
    <P>I am reminded by this instance of a time in the early 1980s when I received information about the possibility that blood donations could be contaminated by the AIDS virus and haemophiliacs suffering as a result.  I was wrongly criticised by the Blood Transfusion Service Board and others for being alarmist. Sadly, less than a year after that information was available my concerns became a reality.  Now we know that many people contracted the AIDS virus through contaminated blood.  I recognise the excellent work being done by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  At the same time problems arise and I want to ensure that this problem is dealt with fully and openly.</P>
    <P>From the information in the newspapers today it is clear that knowledge of this contamination was available some time ago, although there may not have been proof.  Clearly, research in Munster showed that earlier this year women who had babies in 1977 were identified as having hepatitis C.  Why was the alarm not raised then and mothers of children born in 1977 contacted?  A satisfactory answer has not yet been given for the apparent gap in making the knowledge public.</P>
    <P>In regard to the broader issue of medical information being made available to patients in general, one of the problems that will arise is the lack of real information and whether mothers will remember if they received the injection, or any other treatment, during their pregnancies. I do not remember what treatment I received during my pregnancies. I urge the Minister to use this opportunity to examine ways in which more medical data can be made available, as of right, to people in hospital and patients generally. Surely it must be possible to provide a card to patients leaving hospital identifying the drugs or any special treatment they received so that if questions arise in <Col N="305" /> the future it will be easy to contact the relevant people.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that there is no underestimation of the trauma this disclosure will cause to thousands of families, not just on the mothers affected.  I know the Minister shares my sense of urgency in identifying and treating the affected women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Members stated, there is no doubt that many thousands of women are deeply concerned and confused about the information received in the past 24 hours.  Many women have told me they cannot remember exactly what treatment they received when pregnant. They can remember being put on a drip or receiving injections but are unaware of what those injections were for.  Therefore, if it can be easily established that a woman did not receive an anti-D injection during her pregnancy and she returns to her GP or hospital, she should be examined and assured she is absolutely safe.  The Minister should make the net a little wider.</P>
      <P>In relation to the hepatitis C alert affecting more than 100,000 mothers who received the anti-D treatment since the early 1970s, the first key question to be answered is why it has taken from 1989, when the virus was discovered, and more specifically from 1991 &mdash; when the Blood Transfusion board learned of a link between the virus and the anti-D treatment &mdash; to alert the women concerned. The Minister stated he was only informed of the matter last week.  Was the Minister's predecessor or officials of his Department aware of it before then?  The length of time which elapsed before making the knowledge available at least to the medical community, if not to the patients concerned, is unacceptable.  The Minister did not clarify the reason for such a gap or why the information has suddenly been made available.  There are many questions in that regard which need to be answered and lessons could be learned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were all those involved in health care, notably surgeons, doctors, nurses and other specialists, notified of the link at <Col N="306" /> that time and if not why?  Who is responsible for the procedures in this area?  Is it the Minister, the Blood Transfusion Board or individual hospitals?  Have all the stocks of the anti-D treatment used here since its introduction been exclusively home produced or were imported batches used?  If imported stocks were used, have they been identified, when were they imported and from where did they come?</P>
    <P>What is the risk of developing hepatitis C from contaminated blood or blood products?  I understand four outcomes can arise from such an infection, two of which the Minister referred to.  Some people may have already contacted hepatitis C but are unaware of it because their immune systems have overcome it. People will have developed jaundice, but no further serious symptoms and are unlikely to do so.  Others will have developed chronic hepatitis &mdash; ongoing inflammation of the liver &mdash; which can lead to sclerosis and ultimately death and the one which will give rise to most concern. I do not wish to be alarmist, but people have already died from the infection. I would like the Minister to clarify the figure in respect of the number of people who received the contaminated anti-D treatment and as a result contracted hepatitis C.  Does the Minister know the percentage involved?</P>
    <P>This matter highlights the importance of tracing and identifying all women who received the anti-D treatment and establishing whether it is possible to do so. The Minister stated that the relevant people are being contacted.  Apart from a public awareness campaign, is the Blood Transfusion Board systematically going through all records to identify the people involved and writing directly to them? There was some confusion earlier in that regard but the Minister clarified the matter to some extent.  I take it that there are records of the people involved.  I understand it is mandatory to keep a record of all people who receive blood or blood products, not because they may have received contaminated products but because they may develop an allergic reaction to non-compatible blood or <Col N="307" /> blood products.  In other words, records must be available.  Therefore, there is no reason to suggest there would not be records of the women who received the anti-D treatment.  We need clarify from the Minister on the risks of developing hepatitis C from contaminated blood or blood products.</P>
    <P>Can this disease be sexually transmitted? The Minister and officials of his Department should consider the matter of compensation now so that they are not forced, kicking and screaming, to deal with the issue at a later date.  The matter of compensation should be made clear at this stage.  As people desperately need reassurance in regard to this matter, speedy action on all fronts in respect of contacting all those affected is vital.</P>
    <P>What information is available on the screening of health care workers in general? What percentage of health care workers dealing with blood products and at risk have been tested for hepatitis?  Is it Department policy that people at risk working in the health area are vaccinated against hepatitis?  I understand that a surgeon with hepatitis is not allowed operate in the United Kingdom.  Directives in this regard have been issued during the past 12 months.  Have those directives been adopted here?  Will the Minister indicate his Department's views in respect of measures to ensure that our general care workers who provide treatment have good health?</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing us the opportunity to make statements.  He decided yesterday to raise this issue through the media and, by doing so, has highlighted the need for screening.  This is a matter of great concern to everybody, particularly the large number of women directly affected.  The Minister's decision to raise this issue has heightened the level of anxiety among women.  Why did he not adopt the approach many people, particularly those working in the health care area, would have expected, namely, to inform those who will have to carry out the testing, screening and give advice?  In particular, <Col N="308" /> I refer to general practitioners. Most general practitioners were unaware that this matter was about to explode in the media.  Information landed on most of their desks today.  I accept an effort was made to communicate with all general practitioners, but some did not receive the information before it was highlighted through the media.  Hepatitis C is not a common condition and it is a newly discovered one.  General practitioners were put in the invidious position of having to answer questions even though they had not been fully informed of the answers.  I wonder if the Minister could have prepared the ground before going public on this issue.  It would not have taken a long time and it would have been helpful to engage in consultation with health care deliverers namely, hospital staff and doctors around the country, before he went public.</P>
      <P>From an organisational point of view the first 24 hours is vital in a project like this.  It is unfortunate that those 24 hours have been marked by confusion and lack of information.  I accept the Minister has put in place information systems, but there has been an overloading of systems and people are not always available to answer questions.  People have had difficulty getting through on the telephone lines and as a result have not been able to have their anxieties allayed.  I appreciate the Minister does not have the gift of prophecy, but surely this type of response could have been anticipated.  I am aware that the Irish College of General Practitioners was contacted earlier but it was short notice and family doctors as a whole did not receive the information until today at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Other questions arise which the Minister has answered in part.  We need a comprehensive report as to why there were timelags, particularly between the discovery of the necessity for hepatitis C screening and its implementation. Decisions were made which have major implications for the health of the women involved.  I accept the Minister is willing to provide as much information as possible. We need the full story in regard to the timelag involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> I appreciate it is easy to talk from the position of hindsight.  Why were the cases in 1977 not followed up in the light of the information that came on stream in 1989? The safety of the anti-D product was questionable.  A link between the condition and the product was known in 1991.  It is now 1994.  During that intervening period it is not clear if women were informed as to the potential risk of the product.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the high profile media campaign is a blunt way to approach this matter.  No matter how well organised the campaign is it will not reach everybody.  Women moving around who may be out of the country and who do not normally follow what is happening in the media will fall through the system. Those people would be more likely to come forward as a result of a focus on the Blood Transfusion Service Board's records mentioned by the Minister.  It is important that all women are informed about this matter.  Just because politicians are discussing this matter it does not follow that all women who are at risk will get the message.  It is an achievement for any woman to recall what happened during childbirth in the seventies.  I am concerned there is a focus on women delivering babies during that period when a person who had a stillbirth or a miscarriage is equally at risk.  That matter needs clarification.  It is also possible that males and females could have contacted hepatitis C from blood transfusions.  The Minister and the Blood Transfusion Service board need to clarify this matter. While the risk is small it exists and needs clarification.</P>
    <P>The information about the various forms of hepatitis is only emerging. Doctors know there is hepatitis A, B, C and D and many expect there will be other viruses implicated in hepatitis in the future.  What assurance can the Minister give that blood and blood products are treated in such a way as to ensure, even if there are, as of yet, undetectable viruses present in the blood, that the blood is treated to ensure they are killed and <Col N="310" /> consequently cannot be passed on to a recipient?</P>
    <P>It is important that the population's trust in our excellent national Blood Transfusion Service Board, which is the envy of Europe, is maintained and all possible measures are taken to ensure this occurs.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right to have full disclosure. He might have been advised to provide for it on a phased basis by consulting with the practitioners in the first instance.  It is a sound principle to make information as publicly available as possible. The Minister recognises we have a mature and sensible population.  It is important that information be available to avoid panic.  There should be consultation as to how information in respect of other questions raised, and not answered today, is to be disseminated. Apart from any media campaign the Minister has embarked on, it is important that he uses the information which may be accessed from hospital records and GMS records to track down the women involved.  He should not overestimate the capability of the media to reach those women.  It is more effective for hospital staff and doctors to be in a position to locate and advise their patients of the need to come forward for screening.</P>
    <P>There may be cases where it is not possible for the Minister's Department to locate some woman involved.  Attention must be focused on such women.  For example, we must focus on members of the travelling community who move around the country and who do not have GMS cards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to provide as much information to Deputies and the House as I can.  I said yesterday that I want to characterise this campaign with openness and by providing access to information I hope there will be a calm but thorough approach to this matter.  I do not want to leave anything undone in terms of identifying any possible risk.  At the same time I do not want people to be unduly alarmed.  I listened very carefully to all the points raised by Deputies opposite and I will do my best to respond <Col N="311" /> to them.  I will restate the offer I made of a full briefing on the matter from the officials of my Department, the Blood Transfusion Service Board and outside experts.  Until the end of last week I did not know very much about anti-D immunoglobulin and I do not pretend that over the weekend I have become an expert in it.  I am not the person to answer all the questions but I will provide the expertise to Members of the House to answer any question that may be raised in the context of reassuring every woman in the country.</P>
      <P>I accept the argument put forward by some Deputies that the campaign I authorised, which was proposed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, is a blunt campaign.  From the moment I heard about the problem I believed it was important to achieve two objectives.  First I wanted to ensure that women would safely receive anti-D immunoglobulin &mdash; that was done by importing last Friday a product that is virally inactivated. Second, I sought to begin a process of indentification.  Some Deputies opposite said I should have first notified or communicated with all general practitioners, but it would have been impossible to do so without giving rise to tremendous fears across the community.  If I did so, I would have had to answer questions in the House from Deputies opposite as to why doctors were alerted while women who potentially might be at risk were not notified. I agreed with the decision of the Blood Transfusion Service Board immediately to alert women that this potential problem exists and to provide free telephone lines and information to all general practitioners.  With the co-operation of the Irish College of General Practitioners, information was sent to all general practitioners yesterday and they should have had information today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for An Post, but it is very important that doctors have information &mdash; obviously <Col N="312" /> many of them will be well briefed already on hepatitis C.  If general practitioners do not have the information already, they will have it in a day or two.  I do not want to see anybody panicking about anti-D immunoglobulin.  Some women will have had this treatment ten or 15 years ago and they need not panic now.  We have put in place 12 testing centres across the country and up to 6,000 samples per day will be tested.  Our ambition is that all women will be tested within the next couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>On the question of responsibility to contact every woman, I have outlined what we are doing in this regard.  We have put in place a national media campaign and a huge number of women may be contacted through the media.  Information lines are very active in dealing with queries on the matter and I hope people will be calmed by receiving accurate information immediately.  Those who go to their general practitioners will be tested free of charge and the fears of the vast majority of women will be allayed when they find that results of tests are negative.  The identified cohort from 1977 has been contacted &mdash; we have written to 4,300 of the 6,000 women involved and we are doing our best to identify the remaining women.</P>
      <P>As regards the passing on of the disease, I will leave it to the experts to brief Deputies on the minutiae of the technicalities of passing on the disease.  I am not in a position to answer all the questions in that regard and it would be safer to leave it to the medical experts.  I will provide that information to Deputies as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>Clearly hepatitis C existed prior to its identification in 1989.  Tests in 1991 found that 0.03 per cent of donations, or three cases per 10,000, are affected.  Therefore there is a very low incidence of the virus in the donor population, lower than the European norm.  The virus also existed prior to testing and a categoric assurance cannot be given that it could not be contracted by way of blood transfusion. However, I wish to clearly state that it is a virus that is not readily transmitted by way of blood transfusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> I became alarmed when I heard about this matter on Thursday last.  I commend the tremendous hard work and diligence of my departmental staff and the Blood Transfusion Service Board who, from the moment the problem was recognised, put in place a very successful public awareness campaign which, once people are given the information and are tested, will build confidence, which is very important. As Deputies opposite have said, we are very fortunate to have a blood transfusion service that is the envy of Europe and I am most anxious that that position be maintained.</P>
    <P>In relation to the gap in notification of the problem, the accurate test became available in 1991 and it was introduced here at the same time as in the United Kingdom &mdash; both countries accepted that there was a reliable test available. Experts have told us over the weekend that there is no discernible increase in hepatitis C in the population.  Therefore there is no pool of infection about which we should be very alarmed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cullen raised the question of imported anti-D immunoglobulin.  None of this product was imported up to last Friday.  The new virally inactivated product, which ensures safety, was imported from Canada during the weekend. Health workers are not routinely screened for hepatitis C.  The incidence of the virus is so low in the population that it is not believed to be a risk.</P>

      <P>Deputy McManus asked if I could give a blanket assurance that no other virus will be passed on by way of blood treatments. In her previous contribution, the Deputy said I do not have the gift of prophecy, but I would need the gift of prophecy to give such an assurance.  I could not address that issue with absolute certainty.  We have a blood transfusion service that is the envy of Europe.  It has a tremendous record of service and has provided a huge life-giving resource to millions of Irish people in the course of its lifetime.  The board is determined, as I am, to ensure that that fine reputation is preserved, and that will be done in a completely open way so that people's anxieties are allayed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Extradition Acts, 1965 to 1987.  The Bill clarifies and extends the range of offences not to be regarded as political offences for extradition purposes, centralises proceedings relating to extradition in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, reserves decisions on the granting of bail in extradition cases to the High Court, and makes certain other changes, including technical changes, in extradition procedures.</P>
      <P>I will put the Bill in context in regard to existing legislation on extradition.  The Principal Act is the Extradition Act of 1965.  Part II of that Act gives effect to the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition.  It provides the basis for extradition between this country and most of the other Council of Europe member states.  It also governs our extradition arrangements with certain other countries, such as the United States of America, with which we have extradition agreements.  Part III of the Act relates to extradition between Ireland, on the one hand, and Northern Ireland, England and Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> In 1987 the 1965 Extradition Act was amended by two Acts.  These were the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, and the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  The first of the 1987 Acts is based on the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  The most important aspect of that Act is that it restricts the circumstances in which a person can avoid extradition on the grounds that the offence in question is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  I shall be referring mainly to this Act in the course of my statement and will describe it as the &ldquo;1987 Terrorism Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The second Extradition Act in 1987, the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, contains important safeguards in relation to extradition to Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  It gives the Attorney General power to veto a request for extradition unless he-she is satisfied (a) that there is a clear intention to prosecute or, as the case might be, to continue the prosecution of, the person named or described in the extradition warrant for the offence specified in the warrant, and (b) that the intention to prosecute is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  It is important to stress that this Act remains in place and the very valuable protection it affords, therefore, also remains fully in place.</P>
    <P>As the Bill proposes changes in the offences which may not be regarded as political for extradition purposes, it would be helpful if I gave some details on the background to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. The convention was an international move to combat terrorism.  Briefly, it provides that certain terrorist offences are not to be regarded as political offences for the purpose of enabling the alleged offender to avoid extradition.  This step was necessary because many countries, like our own, provide that extradition cannot be granted for an offence which is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  Our 1965 Act makes provision for that exemption. The move to take certain offences out of <Col N="317" /> the political exempt category stemmed from horrific terrorist offences during the 1960s and the 1970s.  Given the prevalence of terrorist attacks and the practice of their perpetrators to flee the country in which they had carried out the acts, the Council of Europe decided to deal with the problem at European level.  It decided to draw up a convention, the underlying principle of which was that perpetrators of acts of terrorism should not be immune from extradition by pleading that the act they had committed was a political offence.  We ratified the convention when we enacted the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to amend the 1987 Terrorism Act.  In November 1991 in the cases Magee, Mckee and Sloan <i>v.</i> Culligan 1992 ILRM 187 and 194, the Supreme Court decided that the Act should be construed strictly and that possession of an M60 machine gun and ammunition with intent to endanger life could be a political offence.  The cases gave rise to demands for amendments to the law, particularly amendments to ensure that offences such as possession and use of firearms, automatic or non-automatic, be excluded from the political offence exception.  The Government gave careful consideration to the Supreme Court decision and to the widely expressed views on that decision, and decided, as stated in this House on 26 November 1991, that legislation should be enacted to amend, clarify and extend the range of offences that could not be regarded as political for extradition purposes.  This is the reason the Bill is before the House.  I accept it has taken some time since the Government decided to change the law to bring the Bill before this House but Deputies will appreciate that we are dealing with a very sensitive and complicated area of law.  It was necessary, therefore, to give careful and detailed consideration to any possible changes.</P>
    <P>I will explain how the Bill changes the scope of the political offence exception. Section 3 (3) of the 1987 Terrorism Act sets out in a general way a list of offences <Col N="318" /> which cannot be classed as political.  The section follows the wording of Article 1 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  The offences include those relating to hijacking of aircraft, attacks on internationally protected persons, kidnapping and &ldquo;an offence involving the use of an explosive or an automatic firearm, if such use endangers life&rdquo;.  With regard to the latter offence, the courts have decided that &ldquo;use&rdquo; of automatic firearms does not encompass possession with intent to endanger life.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the 1987 Terrorism Act lists two general categories of offences which may be excluded by the court from the political offence exception, depending on the circumstances.  The offences in question are identical to those set out in Article 2 of the Convention and are: (a) a serious offence involving an act of violence other than one covered by section 3, against the life, physical integrity or liberty of a person; and (b) a serious offence involving an act against property, other than one covered by section 3, if the act created a collective danger for persons.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House amends in two ways the qualifications introduced by the 1987 Terrorism Act concerning the political offence exception.  First, section 2 (a) proposes to move the offences in section 4 of the 1987 Terrorism Act to section 3 of that Act, thereby removing the discretion of the courts to decide on a case by case basis whether a political offence is involved. In future, under the Bill such offences cannot be classed as political, regardless of the circumstances.  The effect of this amendment, combined with the existing provisions, will be that serious offences against the person or against property cannot be deemed to be political.</P>
    <P>Second, section 2 (b) of the Bill provides for the insertion of a schedule listing specific offences under Irish law which cannot be regarded as political offences. Most, but not all, of the offences listed in the schedule would come within the scope of the more general wording of the revised section 3 and the scope of the <Col N="319" /> Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. However, the schedule will ensure certainty of interpretation and, in particular, that offences involving possession of firearms or explosives with intent are excluded from the political offence exception.  It is important to stress that we are not talking about mere possession of firearms but of possession where there is serious criminal intent and, in particular intent to endanger life.</P>
    <P>The schedule lists 16 offences or categories of offences which cannot be political in the context of extradition.  The first group of offences, those under the heading &ldquo;Common law offences&rdquo;, and numbered 1 to 5, are murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, false imprisonment and assault causing actual bodily harm.  The offences listed 6 to 14, inclusive, are identified by sections of particular Acts.  The first category, under the heading &ldquo;Offences against the person&rdquo;, is made up of wounding with intent to cause grievious bodily harm, and causing grievious bodily harm.  The next group of offences, under the heading &ldquo;Explosives&rdquo;, covers causing explosions likely to endanger life or damage property, possession etc., of explosive substances, and making or possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances.</P>
    <P>The group of offences under the heading &ldquo;Firearms&rdquo; is made up of possessing firearms or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of firearms while taking a vehicle without authority, use of firearms to resist or aid escape, and carrying firearms with criminal intent. The &ldquo;Robbery and Burglary&rdquo; group of offences consists of robbery and aggravated burglary.  Damaging property with intent to endanger life or being reckless as to endanger life is listed under &ldquo;Criminal damage&rdquo;.  The group of offences listed under &ldquo;Offences in relation to aircraft and vehicles&rdquo; is made up of unlawful seizure of aircraft, unlawful acts against the safety of aviation, and unlawful seizure of vehicles.  The offences described at 15 deals with accomplices in any of the offences already listed, and category 16 <Col N="320" /> deals with attempts and conspiracy in relation to any of the offences.</P>
    <P>The Bill adds some new offences to the offences that, under existing legislation, may not be regarded as political.  The most important offences added are possession and manufacture of explosives and possession of firearms with criminal intent.  In the main, however, section 2 of the Bill and the First Schedule cover the offences that were in the 1987 Terrorism Act.  The manner in which they are set out now in section 2 and in the schedule will lead to much greater clarity. Under the 1987 Terrorism Act some offences could be regarded as political in certain circumstances.  Under the Bill these offences may not be regarded as political irrespective of the circumstances and, accordingly, offences such as possession of firearm with intent to endanger life and use of non-automatic firearm to resist arrest are clearly placed outside the political offence exception.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will note that the offences in section 2 of the Bill and in the First Schedule fall into the terrorist category.  They are the kind of offences that are committed in Northern Ireland and in Britain and in other European locations by terrorists.  They do not merit the description &ldquo;political&rdquo; in the sense that most people view the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; today.  Since the case of McGlinchey <i>v.</i> Wren 1983 ILRM 169 the courts have recognised that offences of the kind which can and do involve the slaughter of innocent civilians should not enjoy exemption from extradition on the grounds that they are &ldquo;political&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Extradition Act, 1965 and the 1987 Terrorism Act provide that certain offences, including some stipulated in certain international conventions, may not be regarded as political for extradition purposes.</P>
    <P>Examples in section 3 of the 1987 Terrorism Act are the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Civil Aviation.  The Bill before the House makes provision in relation to another <Col N="321" /> international convention &mdash; the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Section 3 of the Bill provides for an amendment to section 3 of the 1965 Act by providing for new definitions of &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; and &ldquo;revenue offence&rdquo; in the 1965 Act.  The changes in the definitions of these terms will exclude an offence within the scope of article 3 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances from the scope of the political offence and revenue offence exception categories.  This change will enable us to comply with the requirements of article 3.10 of the Drugs Convention.  It is intended to ratify that convention following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993 which provides for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.  What this means, briefly, is that we want to meet our international obligations to fight the drugs problem by insuring that offenders whose extradition is sought cannot hide behind the exemptions provided by either the political or revenue offence exemptions.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the changes proposed in the Bill in relation to offences and their exclusion from the political and revenue offences categories.  There are other changes proposed.  These deal with the following matters: confining of extradition matters to nominated judges of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court; bail in extradition cases; execution of a warrant by a Garda Síochána not in possession of the warrant; alleged offender intending to enter the State; the place at which a person to be extradited is to be handed over and the remand period for a person arrested on a provisional warrant.</P>
    <P>All of these proposed changes are prompted by experience in operating the Extradition Acts in recent years.  They will contribute to a smoother and more effective working of our extradition procedures. What follows is a brief outline of each of the proposed changes.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, extradition applications under Part III of the 1965 Act have been dealt with by judges of the District Court at various venues around the country. <Col N="322" /> Under section 4 of the Bill, extradition matters generally will be confined to a list of judges of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court nominated specifically for that work.  This will have a number of advantages.  It will enable the nominated judges to specialise in extradition cases and develop a high level of expertise in extradition legislation and procedure. This is an important consideration given the importance of extradition, its sensitivity, and its complexity both from the point of view of legislation and case law. Also, this change will make it possible to concentrate cases in one court location in Dublin which should have many beneficial results.  There is benefit from the point of view of security, both as regards the cost of security and the effectiveness of security measures.  There is benefit also in terms of efficiency in that lawyers and judges with the necessary expertise will be concentrated at the same venue for extradition cases.  It is to the benefit of persons whose extradition is sought and to the system of justice also that expertise is concentrated in this way.</P>
    <P>The Government has also decided that bail in extradition cases should be confined to the High Court.  The present position as regards criminal proceedings is that the District Court has jurisdiction to grant bail in most cases.  However, there are some offences of a serious nature where the power to grant bail is reserved to the High Court.  Like this latter group of offences the Government considers that the question of bail in extradition cases is such an important matter that it should be reserved to the High Court.  The importance of bail in extradition cases stems from the fact that these cases are more than a purely domestic matter &mdash; they relate to our international agreements with other states.  This change is made by providing in section 5 of the Bill for a new section 7A in the 1965 Extradition Act.</P>
    <P>At present a person wanted for extradition may be arrested only by a member of the Garda Síochána who has a warrant in his or her possession.  Circumstances arise, however, where an opportunity to arrest a person wanted for extradition <Col N="323" /> arises and the garda in question does not have the warrant in his or her possession. It is proposed to get over this difficulty by providing that the garda may make the arrest even though he or she does not have possession of the warrant at the moment of arrest.  However, the garda must produce the warrant within 24 hours and give a copy to the person arrested. Section 6 of the Bill makes the necessary changes by amendments to sections 26, 27 and 45 of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill amends section 43 of the 1965 Act.  Section 43 deals with the endorsement of warrants in respect of persons here whose extradition is being sought to Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  The amendment adds the words &ldquo;or may intend to enter the State&rdquo; to the wording of section 43.  The result will be that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána may endorse a warrant in respect of a person where it appears to him or her that the person is coming to the State.  Currently the position is that the warrant may be endorsed by the Commissioner only when the person sought is actually in the State.  The proposed amendment would facilitate situations where a person is known to be on board a ship or a plane on its way to the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to remove the need for the courts to specify the location at which a person will be handed over to the authorities of the requesting jurisdiction under Part III of the 1965 Act. This requirement has given rise to major security operations in the past on both sides of the Border and has caused major disruption to cross-Border traffic along with large scale demonstrations.  The necessary amendment to section 47 of the 1965 Act is provided for in section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The final change in this group of procedural changes is that the period of remand for a person arrested on a provisional warrant under Part III of the 1965 Act is being extended from three to seven days.  Provisional warrants are used in urgent cases and allow a suspect wanted in the United Kingdom to be <Col N="324" /> detained pending the physical delivery of the original warrant from the United Kingdom to Ireland.  Under the 1965 Act three days was considered sufficient as that gave adequate time for the necessary papers to be transmitted from the United Kingdom.  The Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 provides for examination of documentation and consideration of applications by the Attorney General prior to a warrant being endorsed by the Garda Commissioner. This requirement was not in existence when the three day period was specified under the 1965 Act.  The result is that the three days provided for in different circumstances is inadequate in the new circumstances obtaining since the passage of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  The Government feels that seven instead of three days is a more realistic period to allow.  This is provided for by section 13 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to other sections of the Bill.  Section 1 deals, <i>inter alia,</i> with the application of the amendments proposed in the Bill.  Subsection (2) follows the equivalent provisions in sections 3 of the 1965 Act and section 14 of the 1987 Terrorism Act &mdash; i.e. the Bill applies to offences whenever committed.  However, the Bill will not affect cases already decided where extradition was sought but refused on the grounds that the offence in question was a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  Subsection (3) provides that the changes made in the Bill by sections 2 and 3 will not apply to requests for surrender under Part II of the 1965 Act, or warrants for arrest under Part III of the Act or requests for the obtaining of evidence of criminal proceedings outside the State, issued before the commencement of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 7, 8, 9, 11 and 14 make some technical or minor changes and provide for the remedying of technical defects and the removal of doubt which may exist in relation to some provisions in existing extradition legislation.  Section 15 provides for the repeal of enactments listed in the Second Schedule to the Bill and section 16 deals with the short title, collective <Col N="325" /> citation, construction and commencement.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I want to say a few words about &ldquo;specialty&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Specialty&rdquo; means the general rule in extradition law and treaties that a person may not be tried for any offence other than the specific offence for which he/she is extradited except with the consent of the extraditing State.  This applies to the country to which he/she is extradited, and to any third country to which he/she might be extradited.</P>
    <P>At present, the arrangements for specialty as between Ireland and the United Kingdom are non-statutory arrangements.  The arrangements are intended to ensure that additional charges will not be brought after extradition and that a specialty principle will be observed.  However, it has been agreed for some time past that specialty as between the two jurisdictions should be put on a proper legislative basis.</P>
    <P>The necessary legislative provisions on our side will be made by Ministerial Order under section 3 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 which provides for the application by Ministerial Order of the specialty provisions of Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965 to the United Kingdom.  Last year the British Government passed the necessary primary legislation to enable them to have a statute-based specialty arrangement with us. They will have to make an order also. Discussions are in progress to ensure that the two orders are consistent with one another when finalised.  When the two orders have been finalised and signed they will be brought into operation on the same date as the provisions of the Bill before the House are brought into operation.</P>
    <P>The rule of specialty is an important safeguard in extradition.  Other safeguards exist in our law which are not being disturbed by the present proposals.  Firstly, the Attorney General will continue to exercise his or her functions under the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 whereby requests for extradition to the United Kingdom will be proceeded with only where there is a clear intention to <Col N="326" /> prosecute and such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence. Secondly, an important safeguard introduced by section 9 of the 1987 Terrorism Act will continue in force.  Section 9 amended section 50 of the Extradition Act, 1965.  It provides that the High Court may direct that a person arrested shall be released where the court is of the opinion that extradition is being sought for the purpose of punishing or prosecuting a person because of his or her race, religion, nationality or political opinion.</P>
    <P>Let me summarise by saying that the major changes provided for in the Bill relate to offences being excluded from the political offence category.  The Bill extends and amends the position in relation to these offences as originally legislated for, in particular in the 1987 Terrorism Act.  Court decisions in 1991 established that there were loopholes in that Act.  The main purpose of the Bill is to close those loopholes.  The Bill also gives effect to requirements relating to extradition in the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.  In addition, the Bill provides for some desirable changes in procedure in extradition cases.  All the changes proposed in the Bill are deserving of the enthusiastic support of the House.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and support its objectives, but I must criticise the Minister for Justice and the Government for the long delay in bringing it forward.  This Bill had been promised in succeeding Dáil sessions.  Last July in a telephone conversation the Minister explained to me that she could not meet the promised deadline and would not be able to introduce the Bill in that session. Neither was it forthcoming in the next Dáil session, despite promises given on several occasions.  For instance, on 6 October 1993 the Taoiseach said, in reference to this legislation &ldquo;I expect that it will pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas this session&rdquo;.  On 13 October <Col N="327" /> 1993 the Taoiseach repeated this commitment in the following words: &ldquo;I have already stated that it is on the list for this session and will be taken this session&rdquo;. On 16 November 1993 the Taoiseach was asked a third time about this and again said that the legislation would be published in that session.  He repeated that commitment for a fourth time on 24 November last.  It is plain from those answers that the legislation was ready.</P>
      <P>All the provisions of this Bill do is bring extradition procedures here into line with those existing between normal, civilised European States following court interpretation of previous legislation.  For example, it provides that a so-called political motive shall not prevent people from facing trial just because they choose to evade justice by moving to the Republic of Ireland.  Without such legislation this State could become a place where political criminals of many and varied persuasions would seek to avoid paying for their crimes.</P>
      <P>Government commitments to introduce this legislation go back at least three years.  The Minister was correct when she mentioned the date of 26 November 1991.  The Government should ask themselves how they would feel if someone close to them was a victim of an IRA or UFF attack and they knew the perpetrator was not going to face trial because of loopholes in the extradition law.  The Government's slowness in introducing this overdue legislation contrasts poorly with its ease and readiness to give Sinn Féin spokesmen for the IRA access to the airwaves.  The timing of the publication of this Bill gave a necessary law and order measure the taint of a bargaining carrot and stick process, given that its publication was unnecessarily delayed until a day when the section 31 Broadcasting Act restriction had been removed.  That was an appalling and uncivilised way of dealing with long overdue anti-terrorist legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attempts to rush through all Stages of this Bill this week seem to be, at least in part, politically driven.  Does the Government not want Deputy Bree and others <Col N="328" /> to have their say on this Bill, Deputies who, unlike the Opposition, are not prepared to stand squarely behind the Minister and support a hard line against terrorists?</P>
    <P>In the light of the Downing Street Joint Declaration it appears there has been a tendency to legitimise Sinn Féin and, by implication, the Provisional IRA.  It is important that the peace process does not cloud our judgment as to what is right and wrong.  Peace process or no peace process, terrorism is wrong and the State must not flinch from dealing with it.  We in the Republic may be facing an increased threat from Loyalist terrorism. There would be unspeakable outrage in the South if we thought that Loyalist terrorists could not be extradited from the North because of legal loopholes.</P>
    <P>A blight has descended over this land. It is the most damaging thing that has happened to this country since the potato blight and the resulting Famine.  On this occasion death and destruction are not taking place as an accidental side effect of the blight but as the planned and direct consequences thereof.  This blight is the antithesis of Christianity in a country which purports to be 98 per cent Christian, a peculiar mixture of Protestantism, Loyalism, Unionism, Catholicism, nationalism and republicanism, not fuelled by any noble tradition but by hatred and resentment, by intolerance, self-centredness and blind indifference.  The Christian way is: I was hungry and you gave me to eat; thirsty and you gave me to drink; a stranger and you invited me in; I needed clothes and you clothed me; sick and you looked after me; in prison and you visited me.  That this message has been replaced by: you were a Protestant so I resented you, a Catholic so I distrusted you.  I did not like your Nationalist or your Unionist views so I murdered you.  In the privacy of your home I terrorised you.  I maimed you and taught your children violent ways.  This is the way of the terrorist who seeks to claim &ldquo;political&rdquo; motives for their horrific crimes.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned nobody should be able to use &ldquo;politics&rdquo; for the <Col N="329" /> justification of murder.  The taking of life, whether called manslaughter or any other legal term, causing grevious bodily harm or in any way endangering the lives of people or in any way attempting any of these, or maiming or kidnapping or any act of terror cannot be excused by corrupt use of the word &ldquo;politics&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The 1987 Act went a long way to ending this corruption but, according to the courts, it did not &ldquo;depoliticise&rdquo; a number of offences which would ordinarily be part of the terrorists stock in trade.  It is true that offences, such as murder, the use of non-automatic firearms and possession of explosives, are not offences which were put outside the scope of the definition of a political offence by the 1965 or the 1987 Act.  It was intended that they would be but the courts took a different view.  However, under section 11 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, the courts were allowed discretion to enlarge the range of offences not entitled to so-called political exemption.</P>
    <P>The McGlinchy <i>v</i> Wren case (1982) and Shannon <i>v</i> Fanning (1984) indicate that section 11 made sense.  Shannon <i>v</i> Fanning had decided that the test as to what constituted a political offence fell to be determined in each case having regard to the act done and the facts and circumstances involved in each case.  The test, Shannon decided, was whether the person charged with the offence at the relevant time was engaged either directly or indirectly in what reasonably civilised people would regard as political activity.</P>
    <P>It is clear that section 11 of the 1987 Act allowed the courts to continue to refuse to give exemption to certain categories of non-political activity.  This was quite separate to the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the same Act which limit the scope of the political exemption in given circumstances.</P>
    <P>In Finucane <i>v</i> McMahon (1990) the Supreme Court decision suggests that the court was no longer prepared to adopt the test of Shannon <i>v</i> Fanning and because of this case, there is clearly a need to strengthen the legislation to ensure that <Col N="330" /> the political offence label is removed from offences including acts of violence against any person and from all offences relating to the use or possession of firearms of any kind and explosives.</P>
    <P>There are publichouse republicans who, over a few drinks, become misty-eyed, green-eyed and blinkered in their thinking.  They think extradition legislation is well intentioned and good as long as it is used in connection with those who attack civilians.  I wish to put the case for members of the RUC.  Last week in Belfast members of the RUC defended the Catholic community against lunatic psychopaths who were waiting to prey on them, sledgehammer their doors and shoot them dead in front of their children. The IRA, in the name of their particular perverted version of republicanism, murdered one of the policeman concerned.</P>
    <P>In a very good article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday it was stated that more than 7,000 RUC officers have been injured in the so-called troubles.  There is a Disabled Police Officers' Association with 160 members.  I will put on the record one or two cases where an RUC officer has been killed or maimed:</P>
    <P>It was a routine call, a primary school in Co. Armagh had been broken into and vandalised.  Harry was kneeling on the floor in the headmaster's study, picking up books.  The other detective went to the desk to use the telephone.  It was booby-trapped.  They gathered him up in pieces.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He was only 23&rdquo;, says Harry, &ldquo;and he left a wife and an 11-month old baby.  He wasn't just a collegue.  He was like a son to me.&rdquo;  Harry, then aged 39, lost an eye and was left deaf in one ear.  Twenty years later, he still hears a constant humming noise, &ldquo;like a dentist's drill&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He spent three months in hospital and had titanium plates inserted in his brain.  The bomb left him with severe epilepsy.  He had entered hospital as a hefty man of 13 stone.  He returned <Col N="331" /> home to his wife and four children as an eight-stone wreck....</P>
    <P>Hugh did not look under his black sports car before he drove away for lunch from Armagh courthouse in 1980.  He was 34 and the father of two young boys.  He had been in the RUC for 11 years.  &ldquo;You get complacent,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;checking at times of heightened paramilitary activity, not bothering when there is a lull.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The bomb exploded as he put the car into reverse gear.  &ldquo;I looked down,&rdquo; he recalls, &ldquo;and the front of the seat was blown away.  My trousers had been blown from my legs; my bones were sticking out.  Thankfully, I remained conscious....&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was Catholic and Irish&rdquo; says Sean, &ldquo;but I believed that we should have a mixed police force.  It was 1970.  Our politicians were telling us to join.  I was no West Brit.  I was just married and working as a clerk.  The wages weren't great.  The RUC was well paid.  Most of the other lads in the GAA ended up in jail.  I ended up in the RUC.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sean's father, John, was initially horrified.  As an Irish language activist, he had been arrested by the police.  He worried about the neighbours' reaction but he respected his son's decision. </P>
    <P>Sean claims, however, that there were great difficulties for him in the force.  He was shot by the IRA and his baby son was bathed in his father's blood.  The article continues in that vein.</P>
    <P>These are the great acts of valour perpetrated by terrorists who say they do so in the name of a Thirty-two County Republic.  If that is the price of a Thirty-two County Republic, I hope we never see one.  I should not like to see it written in the history books that the Six Counties were acquired that way, nor can we allow ourselves to be intimidated by the mad Loyalists psychopaths.  On both sides, the total lack of any form of Christian commitment has given way to almost satanic hatred, blind anger-driven hatred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> As legislators we must make it clear that anyone in this jurisdiction required to stand trial for offences of that kind will be extradited and will find no quarter here.  I hope we will get from the Government benches the same kind of unequivocal support in principle for this legislation as the Minister is getting from the main Opposition party.</P>
    <P>Following on the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, the creation of open borders will be of benefit to the Community generally.  However, it is clear that organised criminals will use these freedoms to further their own violent schemes.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that law enforcement throughout Europe should be considered not just the European Union but also by the Council of Europe.  The European Convention on Human Rights is one of the most important conventions created by the Council of Europe but it must not be used to justify those who deny the most basic of human rights to others, i.e. the right to life.</P>
    <P>It is my party's view that the best way to combat international terrorism is through a framework of law that provides effective enforcement right across European national boundaries, together with a system of rights to protect the innocent.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the scales of justice must be held in equilibrium.  We must question whether the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism put forward in 1977 and ratified ten years later by this country is adequate in today's Europe.  The number of offences that can be committed without fear of extradition on the basis of a supposed political motive is still far too wide.</P>
    <P>Surely it should be possible to reach agreement, especially within the European Community, where persons are charged with membership of an unlawful organisation.  This convention should be re-examined and tightened.</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing in this Act that the period of remand by the court following arrest under a provisional warrant for a person sought by the UK will be seven days.  At present a remand for three days is allowed while awaiting <Col N="333" /> delivery and endorsement of the original warrant from the UK.  The Minister states that this period has proved too short in the light of the requirements imposed by the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987. Whereas the period of remand by the court under a provisional warrant for a person sought by countries other than the UK remains unchanged at 18 days the Minister proposes to restrict this provision to seven days in the case of the UK.  I expect she has good reason for doing this.</P>
    <P>Perhaps she would enlighten the House as to why this is.  Most of the acts of terror, or so called &ldquo;political&rdquo; acts, refer to acts carried out in the UK.  Why then are arrangements with the UK to continue to be 11 days short of the arrangements with other countries?</P>
    <P>The Minister might also explain why requests for extradition to the United Kingdom will continue to be examined by the Attorney General to ensure that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  Will the Minister tell the House why it is considered necessary to have a separate arrangement for the UK?</P>
    <P>As a constitutional politician who would not in any way give succour to any uncivilised act, I wish to suggest that the British Government needs to look at the laws in Britain as they apply to pre-trial media coverage.</P>
    <P>The sensational coverage of some of the trials in the UK in advance of the verdict, would not be allowed in this country.  It is clear that they can have a prejudicial effect on a trial.  If you add to this the high security surrounding a trial, such as sniffer dogs etc., there is the danger that the trial of a foreign national can be prejudiced.  The British Lord Chancellor, Home Secretary and Attorney General would be wise to collectively address this matter with a view to ensuring that trials are fair and seen to be fair.  It undermines the whole collective action of the British and Irish Governments against terrorism if terrorists and their fellow travellers can use <Col N="334" /> these trials for their own propaganda ends.</P>
    <P>When some of these trials have been shown to be miscarriages of justice it is all the more easy for the terrorists to be equipped with this particular element of propaganda ammunition.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, provision is made for the Government &ldquo;as soon as may be after the first day of January in each year beginning with the year 1989&rdquo; to make a report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation in the preceding year of Part III of the Principal Act.  Will the Minister tell the House if this legislative requirement has been met in full and why no such statement has been made so far this year?</P>
    <P>I understand certain Members are unhappy with section 2 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, which amends section 44 of the Principal Act, 1965, in relation to the role of Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will say why is it necessary to treat Britain differently from other countries.  Those concerned with this provision suggest that a &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; proposal would be more satisfactory. However appealing this seems, it would undoubtedly cause lengthy delays in the extradition process and, furthermore, could cause a trial within a trial to be the order of the day.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the current Bill was published on the basis it has emerged that there were &ldquo;flaws&rdquo; in the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987.  This is not an accurate representation of the situation as the Minister made clear in her contribution.  The Government of the day was very keenly aware of the potential for gaps in the legislation.  One of the reasons these gaps were not filled was that, at the time, the Progressive Democrats were arguing for the inclusion in our extradition laws of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  Such a requirement does not fit in with the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  If the Government of the day had introduced such a requirement, it would have automatically <Col N="335" /> been outside the scope of the Convention.</P>
    <P>At least that is one reasoned and fair interpretation of the situation.  The introduction of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement would have been wisely seen as a new obstacle to extradition rather than as a facilitation, which was required at the time.</P>
    <P>A leading light in the Progressive Democrats of the day made it known he felt the Bill was an opportunity &ldquo;to change the legal map of Europe&rdquo;.  He thought we could use the Bill as a means of obliging the French, the Italians, the Spanish and Portuguese &mdash; not to speak of any others &mdash; to abandon the Napoleonic code provisions for dealing with accused persons and to adopt common law provisions.  This of course was never a realistic approach.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, therefore, took a very contrary view of the Bill on the basis of that rather naive approach.  The Government then concluded that the safest option was to adhere strictly to the terms of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and on that basis the Bill went through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, closely followed the text of the 1977 Convention.  I am advised this was done on the express advice of the Attorney General of the day.</P>
    <P>On the key votes on Committee Stage, the Government won by the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle.  I do not intend to make this important and necessary item of legislation a matter of controversy which would cause dissension or doubt as to where Fine Gael stands on the extradition of people accused of serious crimes.  In a real sense, the so-called &ldquo;flaws&rdquo; in the legislation being addressed by the current Bill could have been addressed in 1986 if those who resisted the Bill had taken a more rational and realistic approach to the matter.  I regret having to bring these matters up to put the record straight.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the High Court <Col N="336" /> might feel constitutionally bound to grant bail following precedent in relation to the 1966 ruling.  I sought advice on this matter and I understand, whereas we all have concerns about bail as the situation applies since the 1966 Supreme Court interpretation, that in the case of extradition it is even more likely that a person will be granted bail by the courts because he or she is unlikely to flee to Britain or to Northern Ireland because that is where in most cases they want to extradite them. There is a serious question mark about the bail legislation as it operates.  It is true that you are innocent until proven guilty.</P>
    <P>In all circumstances relating to extradition bail generally and bail for suspected terrorists, the 1966 Supreme Court ruling should not continue to stand.  These are exceptional circumstances, and what is fair and just in all circumstances should be the rule applied by the courts.  It is time this matter was addressed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I hope that precisely where I stand in relation to the trial of suspected terrorists is clear.  These provisions should apply to terrorists in the Republic, Northern Ireland, Britain or anywhere else.  In this regard I again call for the setting up of a select Dáil committee to be aided by a special investigator who would ferret out all the facts to inquire into the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the 1972 Dublin bombings.  Such a committee could use parliamentary privilege properly to put information which is clearly available to journalists on the record of the Dáil so that all the facts of those two atrocities could be made public.  Even now, we should seek to identify the culprits and should they be found to be in another jurisdiction, we should seek their extradition so they can face trial here for the heinous acts of terror.  We must be concerned with justice, not politics.  If we refuse to accept that politics can justify one act, we must be sure to show that politics cannot justify any ugly act of terror.</P>
    <P>In relation to specialty the Minister said that when the two orders have been <Col N="337" /> finalised and signed they will be brought into operation on the same date as the provisions in the Bill before the House. Will the Minister assure the House that there will not be any delay in bringing this legislation into operation, because until it is, cases will continue to be heard under the old legislation as interpreted by the courts, and that could give rise to people not being extradited for offences for which they would be extraditable under the new legislation.  When are we likely to see the provisions in this Bill in operation once it is passed by the Oireachtas?</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of the Bill but I will be tabling a number of technical amendments.  As a matter of principle I do not agree with taking all Stages in one week.  It is dangerous particularly when we are dealing with criminal legislation. The Opposition's request to take Report Stage next week will give us an opportunity to reflect on what has been said on Second and Committee Stages.</P>
    <P>For a number of months now I have been indicating that narcotic drugs are freely available on the streets of Dublin. I note that psychotic substances are now to be added to narcotic drugs.  I am even more concerned that psychotic substances are available.  Anything that can be done to extradite the people who are responsible for these shipments should be pursued with vigour.</P>

      <P>I agree with the previous speaker that there has been a certain degree of lethargy on the part of this Government and previous Governments in bringing forward measures to close the evident loopholes in our present extradition legislation.  Indeed, the question of the extradition of politically motivated offenders from Ireland to the UK has proved to be by far the most contentious issue to have troubled the relationship between our two countries over the last 20 years or so.  This issue has produced several false dawns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope an end to this lengthy legal saga is in sight in this Bill but much will depend on the availability of time for full scrutiny on Committee Stage.  I am glad the <Col N="338" /> Department and the Minister have facilitated the Opposition who pointed out that amendments on Committee Stage indicated that we were not just going through the motions but that we really wanted to get this legislation right.  It is because we wholeheartedly support this legislation that we are anxious to scrutinise every section.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats formally welcome the publication of the Bill and consideration of it.  Over the years there has been foot dragging on the matter and the obvious flaws in the 1987 Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act were confirmed in a sequence of judgements in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Before going through the details of the provisions in the Bill it is important to establish principles underpinning extradition which the Progressive Democrats believe are justified and appropriate.  The Government is anxious to get the Bill through the House as quickly as possible, and it has been presented as a relatively simple and straightforward amending Bill.  However it is politically disingenuous to disregard the complex historical and emotional baggage which the term &ldquo;extradition&rdquo; carries with it.  The matter concerns fundamental issues of sovereignty, constitutional rights, justice and political relations between ourselves and Britain in particular.  The specific and technical problems which this legislation seeks to solve were obvious and foretold.  Apart from the political landscape surrounding extradition and its interaction with republican violence, the difficulties in 1987 stemmed from trying to make compatible two parallel types of law &mdash; our own domestic law with its idiosyncrasies and the demands of European conventions.  The gelling of these two legal systems was bound to present problems.  Neither of the extradition 1987 Acts was adequate and the 1987 amendment Act was guillotined and rushed through the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill amending the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act is a measure of how far we have come from ambivalence <Col N="339" /> on paramilitary violence.  That is an important point to be noted by the public as well as the legislators.  For Fianna Fáil and some individual legislators in this House that journey has proved tortuous, and it would be folly to deny that.  We have come a long way from the situation which prevailed here during the seventies when the political offence exception was tolerated to allow a procession of people facing the gravest terrorist charges, including murder in Northern Ireland to simply plead in our courts that the offence was political, and thereby secure their release.  This political ambivalence about paramilitary violence seriously undermined relations between the Republic and the unionist community in Northern Ireland, not to mention the UK who were outraged that our courts and political system could tolerate the release of people who had freely admitted to various offences but claimed that their motivation could block their extradition to face trial.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the situation which pertained in Ireland throughout the seventies was not exceptional by international standards, the reality and the unique ferocity of our terrorist problem should have spurred us to tackle the matter with greater urgency and commitment. As part of a family of liberal democracies in Europe and as members of the Council of Europe, we need to have workable and just extradition provisions and we must also safeguard human rights while we are going about that difficult task.</P>
    <P>A measure of the extent of change in the ambivalent attitudes of the Irish Government and people generally on Republican violence is that today we are closing loopholes and reaffirming the criminalisation of such acts.  That is to be welcomed.  It is timely and very much in keeping with the spirit of the Downing Street Declaration, which aims to take the gun out of Irish politics.  For this reason, I warmly congratulate the Minister for doing what her two immediate predecessors managed to avoid without much political comment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> It is worth recalling also that under the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, the then Irish Government accepted the obligation to ensure there would be a workable extradition system between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The failure, as shown by a series of high profile cases to operate in practice such a workable system of extradition between Ireland and Great Britain, has been a breach of that understanding, and a clear breach of our duty to fellow Irishmen and women who live in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As I said already, it would be politically disingenuous to avoid recognising the political landscape which formed the background to the resistance to change and the legislative lethargy.  There is no point denying that successive Governments have engaged in a certain amount of horse trading on matters relating to extradition with the Government seeking a <i>quid pro quo</i> for RUC interrogation methods, Diplock courts and various miscarriages of justice.  No doubt the political landscape contributed to the lethargy and ambivalence in carrying through commitments on extradition.</P>
    <P>During much of the seventies there was a strict application by our courts of the &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; exception when extradition cases arose.  Attempts by the British Government to have IRA suspects extradited from the State were thwarted by a series of High Court determinations. To counter this problem, the Law Enforcement Commission was established under the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973.  That commission reported in the following year and recommended extra-territorial jurisdiction for violent crimes.  The Irish members of that commission had argued that Article 29.3 of our Constitution and international law provisions prohibited the extradition of persons for political offences or the enactment of laws denying political offence status to politically motivated crimes.  Ultimately, this led to the passage in 1976 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act which provides for the trial of people in this jurisdiction for political offences committed elsewhere.  While the Progressive Democrats never accepted the <Col N="341" /> premise that effective and workable extradition is in any sense unconstitutional, that view prevailed with successive Irish Governments until the early eighties and it was on this ground that Ireland failed to sign the 1977 European convention on the suppression of terrorism until 1986 &mdash; nine years later.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act had only limited application and the British authorities in particular were reluctant to utilise it and continued to submit extradition warrants.  It was left to the Judiciary to pick their way through the unhelpful and undefined political offence exemption which created an impasse where fugitive offenders were allowed to plead guilty to the most heinous crimes in our courts and yet walk free.  At the same time it must be remembered that the British authorities were intent on criminalising terrorist violence in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The first case to signal a new approach by the Irish courts was McGlinchey <i>v.</i> Wren in 1982 where extradition was sought in respect of the alleged murder of an elderly postmistress.  In an unprecedented judgment which marked a breakthrough in the old ambivalence and reflecting a change in public opinion and a hardening of views on terrorism, the Supreme Court ordered the extradition of McGlinchey, thereby signalling a major new departure on the part of the court which was to set the pattern for a series of further judgments and was grounded on a test of what might be regarded by fair minded and reasonable people as legitimate political action.  In his judgment the then Chief Justice, Mr. O'Higgins stated that:</P>
    <P>... the judicial authorities on the scope of the (political) offence had been rendered obsolete in many respects by the fact that modern terrorist violence, whether undertaken by military or paramilitary organisations ... is often the antithesis of what could reasonably be regarded as political, either in itself or in its connections.</P>
    <P>This line of reasoning was further elaborated upon in the Shannon <i>v.</i> Fanning <Col N="342" /> case in July 1984.  The applicant had been charged with the murder of two former Members of the House of Commons from Northern Ireland.  The Supreme Court rejected the defence that these were political offences saying that the offences in question were so brutal, cowardly and callous that it would be a distortion of language if they were to be accorded the status of political offence.  Judges were using their discretion on the brutality in the case.  Further judgments during this period led to further restrictions by the Judiciary on the extent to which political offence could be successfully used.  At the same time as the courts were restricting the definition of political offence, the Governments in Ireland and the United Kingdom continued to horse trade, to pussy-foot around the problem and just watch each other.</P>
    <P>Commenting on a sequence of judicial decisions, Kevin Boyle and Tom Hadden in their commentary on the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement wrote as follows:</P>
    <P>... in these cases, the Irish judiciary has radically altered the approach to the political offence exception.  In the past, the claim that the offence for which the extradition was sought was part of a Republican paramilitary campaign, was sufficient to bring the crime within the scope of the exception... the way was thus cleared for the extradition of Republican suspects, even before the ratification by Ireland in 1987 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, as promised in the Communiqué of the Hillsborough Summit Meeting on November 15th, 1985.</P>
    <P>In summary, the principles which the Progressive Democrats believe must underpin our extradition law is that politically motivated offenders who commit violent crimes in the territories of member states of the Council of Europe, including the United Kingdom, must be liable to face extradition as part of the ordinary process of the Irish domestic law.</P>
    <P>The Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) <Col N="343" /> Act, 1987, which is the subject of some key amendments in the Bill before us, was introduced towards the end of 1986 as a measure to give effect to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism in Irish domestic law.  That convention had been adopted in strasbourg in January 1977 but Ireland did not sign it until February 1986.</P>
    <P>A key objective of that convention was:</P>
    <P>... to assist in the suppression of terrorism by complementing and, where necessary, modifying existing extradition and mutual assistance arrangements concluded between member states of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the convention was the proposal to fill the vacuum relating to the political offences exception by &ldquo;eliminating or restricting the possibility for the requested state of invoking the political nature of an offence in order to oppose an extradition request.  This aim is achieved by providing that for extradition purposes, certain specified offences shall never be regarded as &ldquo;political&rdquo;, Article 1, and otherwise specified offences may not be, Article 2, notwithstanding their political content or motivation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the 1986 Bill, subsequently known as the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, was badly drafted, inadequately debated and then guillotined and the precise working of its key elements was never examined in detail.  That is why the Progressive Democrats wish for a full and open debate on this Bill together with a decent Committee Stage debate.  It is because we recognise the importance of getting it right that we have insisted on more time.</P>
    <P>A clear warning about the dangers now being addressed in the Bill before this House was sounded by the then leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, in his Second Stage contribution &mdash; Volume 370, column 2695 of the Official Report of 12 December 1986. In that speech Deputy O'Malley clearly <Col N="344" /> warned the Minister that sections 3 and 4 were defective.  He pointed out that section 3, which purported to give effect to Article 1 of the Convention, had narrowly defined the non-political offences set out in Article 1 of the Convention and that section 4 failed to give real effect to Article 2 of the Convention.  However, in its anxiety to have the matter passed, the then Government failed to act on the clear warnings about the loopholes mentioned by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>A former Minister has spoken.</P>
      <P>The criticism that can be made of section 3 of that legislation is that it failed to include within its ambit &ldquo;possession&rdquo; as opposed to the &ldquo;use&rdquo; of firearms, the latter being limited for purposes of the section to automatic firearms.  In addition, it is debatable whether offences involving the use of explosives or automatic firearms came within the ambit of section 3 where such use endangered a single person as opposed to persons generally.</P>
      <P>However, the most serious criticism has been levelled at section 4 of the Act. Section 4, essentially failed to give adequate effect to Article 2 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism which gave Ireland the option of providing by legislation that certain serious offences such as murder and manslaughter could not be regarded as political in nature.  Instead section 4 borrowed from the language of Article 13 of the Convention which was concerned with the right of contracting states to enter reservations in relation to Article 1 of the Convention and created a section which gave the courts discretion to decide that an offence which fell within the scope of the criteria laid down, initially in Article 13 and then incorporated in section 4, should not be regarded as a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to see how any principle of constitutional or international law could <Col N="345" /> distinguish between an offence of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and being an accomplice in the use of such a firearm.  Nevertheless section 3 of the 1987 Act made that distinction with the result that section 3 and 4 of the 1987 Act made our extradition law unclear, irrational, subjective and vague.  Those deficiencies quickly manifested themselves when the legislation came under judicial scrutiny in the real world of hard cases.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out in the Dáil on 12 December 1986 the combined effect of these sections was to create uncertainty, to ensure that virtually every case would be brought to the Supreme Court and to involve the Judiciary in subjective decisions in controversial and emotive cases.  Instead of bringing certainty which could have been achieved by setting out a clear Schedule of non-political offences the 1987 Act brought uncertainty and that is the reason we must clear up the mess.</P>
    <P>This parliamentary slippage was unfortunate. It was for this and other reasons that the Progressive Democrats took the initiative in May 1990 by publishing a comprehensive document detailing the amendments which are now essential to our extradition law.</P>
    <P>This Bill has good and bad points.  I will deal with the bad points first.  The Bill does not deal with the extradition of Irish nationals to other European states which is prohibited by SI No. 15 of 1989. It is unfortunate that successive Governments have acted deceitfully in the extradition of Irish nationals to European countries other than the United Kingdom.  The Departments of Justice and Foreign Affairs have consistently fudged the issue.  This meant, for instance, that the German Federal Republic spent considerable time and effort putting together an extradition case on terrorist charges in relation to Donna Maguire.  The Government, dishonesty, did not inform the Germans that a request from its jurisdiction for the extradition of an Irish national was futile. Instead the Germans were actively led to believe that their request for extradition was likely to be considered if the documentation <Col N="346" /> etc, was in order.  Privately, however, Ireland has conceded, in the context of the Northern Ireland talks, that there is no extradition to continental Europe for Irish nationals.  Our complaint is not so much that there is no extradition but that the Government actively misled the Germans into believeing that there was.</P>
    <P>There is an arrangement for the extradition of Irish nationals to Australia and America.  However, SI No. 15 of 1989 which deals with continental Europe makes no such allowance in the case of civil law European jurisdictions.  Thus, Irish nationality is a bar to extradition to Germany for the murder of a British soldier there but an Irish national will be extradited to America or Australia for any murder there.  This is a missing link in our relationship with mainland European countries.</P>
    <P>We also have a problem with the role of the Attorney General.  It is still the view of my party that the role given to him in the 1987 Amendment Act in respect of extradition to the United Kingdom is flawed.  Its chief defects are that it is secret, that no hearing is afforded on the relevant issues to the person affected, that there is no accountability to this House or the courts and that there is a perception that the process, notwithstanding its quasi-judicial nature, is still in the political sphere.</P>
    <P>The 1987 Act requires the Attorney General to veto all United Kingdom extradition requests unless he is of the opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute, based on the existence of sufficient evidence.  It requires the Attorney General to examine the evidence available in Britain and to arrive at a view as to whether it is sufficient. This process is secret and private and the public can never know whether charges that the Attorney General is being unreasonable are justified.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have always argued that the same process should be conducted in public by the High Court where it would be clearly understood and perceived to be a judicial act.  As a safeguard, the provision is <Col N="347" /> flawed.  An individual on whom an extradition warrant is served can only infer that the Attorney General did examine his case but that individual is not allowed to know the grounds on which the Attorney General acted.  While the High Court recently decided in Wheeler <i>v.</i> Culligan, 1989 Irish Reports 233, that the Attorney General's role is not a judicial one, it is far from clear that his function is not subject to judicial review.  If the basis of the Attorney General's decision is brought out in court by way of discovery of <i>subpoena</i> the process of extradition may become very complex and virtually unworkable.  Such a case has yet to come before the courts.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that two charges in the case of Father Patrick Ryan were not ultimately decided on the basis of that Act.  It was decided, in respect of those charges, on a wider constitutional basis, that is, the extent to which a fair trial had been prejudiced by political and media comment.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that the safeguard applied by the 1987 Act should be transformed in three ways: (i) it should be the responsibility of the High Court, (ii) it should be on the basis of showing probable cause in cases of requests for the extradition of Irish citizens &mdash; there is a precedent in the Irish-US Treaty &mdash; and (iii) it should be extended to all countries, not merely the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>This could be done in the Bill, it could transfer the hearing of all stages of contested extradition proceedings to the High Court.  In view of the accession of the United Kingdom to the 1957 and 1977 Conventions consideration should be given to putting all extradition arrangements on a single statutory basis, that is, an extradition agreement regulated by what is now Part II of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>At present the procedures are too cumbersome and drawn out.  Proceedings commence in the District Court which is confined to matters such as the proper identification of the suspect and ensuring that the offences named in the warrant correspond to offences known to our law. <Col N="348" /> There is then an appeal to the High Court which has sole jurisdiction to determine issues such as political offences and breach of constitutional rights.  It would be much more sensible if the High Court had exclusive original jurisdiction in all extradition cases.  The delays at present are unacceptable bearing in mind that there will be a further appeal to the Supreme Court in virtually every case.</P>
    <P>If the District Court jurisdiction was removed this would remove one tier from the present three tier appellate system &mdash; the District Court to the High Court to the Supreme Court &mdash; speed up the extradition process and ensure that all such extradition matters commenced in the court best equipped to deal with cases of such importance.  If extradition proceedings were to commence in the High Court in the first instance their status would be elevated.</P>
    <P>Does this legislation have any implications relating to the abolition of the death penalty?  I understand that the death penalty while abolished here is still in place in the United Kingdom for treason. Could there ever be a case where we would be asked to extradite a person to stand trial for an offence which carries a death sentence in the United Kingdom?</P>
    <P>It is also a matter of concern that the Minister maintains a role in section 50 of the 1965 Act to overrule the courts.  I was surprised to learn that the Minister, the Executive arm of the State, has this extraordinary power to overrule a decision of the Supreme Court.  We will have to ask the Attorney General, Mr. Whelehan, if this is constitutional.  Is the Minister happy that such a power should be vested in the Executive?</P>
    <P>The Bill fails to address the original issue of the presentation of an affidavit by the requesting State to show probable cause.  There is a precedent in our extradition treaty with the United States.  It might be appropriate to delete section 2 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, and replace it with an affidavit showing probable cause.  This would fall short of the controversial request of the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party in the past for <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> Instead of revising section 3 of the 1987 Act this Bill proposes to repeat the vague and loose language of the Convention. What offence could be covered by section 3 (2) (a) (iv) to (vi) which is not covered by the Schedule to be included by subsection (3A)?  The proposed changes to section 3 of the 1987 Act leave in place section 3 (3) (a) (iv) and (v) and the related definition in subsection (4) (c) of the same section.  What offence could fall within section 3 (3) (a) (v) that would not be covered by the Schedule incorporated by section 3 (3A)?  It would be more sensible to delete section 3 (3) (a) (v) and the accompanying definition.</P>
    <P>The Bill has plenty of good points.  We welcome the concentration in the Dublin District Court as an improvement but we would prefer the proceedings to commence in the High Court.  Given the delays brought about by a bifurcated procedure, we would also elevate the importance of extradition if it were placed in the High Court.</P>
    <P>We welcome the fact that in future only the High Court can grant bail.  That too was raised by the Progressive Democrats in Government.  In the past bail has been abused.  The Magee case was a particular tragedy because the person bailed absconded and then committed murder.</P>
    <P>The amendment of section 47 of the 1965 Act as to the point of departure from the State, which no longer has to be specified, is a good and common-sense amendment.</P>
    <P>The wider human rights dimension to extradition could still be said to be fraught with uncertainties.  The reasoning employed in both Finucane and Clarke is all very well, but a refusal to extradite suspects on the ground to apprehended ill-treatment at the hands of a requesting State could imply that the Irish courts could find themselves investigating conduct which has taken place or may take place outside the jurisdiction.  Would that represent an attempt by the Irish courts to police the Constitution in an extra-territorial dimension?</P>
    <P>The manner in which the personal liberty and personal rights provisions of the <Col N="350" /> Constitution have been interpreted has often resulted in decisions which greatly favour the criminal suspect and exasperated the authorities.  It should be no surprise that great controversy arises where extradition cases are concerned.  It would be disingenuous to claim that the Anglo-Irish extradition process is not steeped in sensitive politics in both jurisdictions. However, the slow abandonment of ambivalence about terrorist violence, culminating in the Downing Street Declaration, the widespread clamour for peace and the passing of this legislation must represent a fresh sense of confidence about the administration of justice in both jurisdictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Extradition is one of those issues which has bedevilled Anglo-Irish relations over the past decade.  A succession of problems with the law, a series of sometimes contradictory court judgments by our own courts and frequent complications with warrants presented by the British authorities have contributed to this unhappy experience. The result of the unfortunate saga has been that this country has quite unfairly been depicted as a haven for terrorists, Unionists suspicions of the bona fides of this State have been fuelled and right wing Tories in Great Britain have been provided with ammunition to engage in their favourite pastime of Paddy bashing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extradition of persons wanted in connection with serious offences is an important weapon in the battle against terrorism, but it is by no means a panacea for all our problems or a quick fix solution to the problem of international terrorism. Right wing politicians in Great Britain and Northern Ireland have, from time to time, tried to blame problems of extradition from the Republic for their failure to defeat terrorism.  However, the evidence suggests that this is a very minor problem and those politicians might well benefit from taking a harder look at their own security and political policies. Indeed they might usefully take a closer look at the effectiveness of this State in dealing with terrorism, an approach which has not had to rely on systematically <Col N="351" /> convicting the wrong people over a period of time.</P>
    <P>Despite tightening the law on extradition and the enactment of two amending Bills, it is astonishing that the number of applications for extradition to Great Britain and Northern Ireland has remained relatively small.  It is also astonishing, given the amount of controversy and political heat that surrounded the whole issue of extradition in the past, that we have not heard about the need for a degree of accountability in the operation of the extradition process.  Section 6 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, requires the Government to make a report to each House of the Oireachtas as to the operation of extradition to Great Britain and Northern Ireland &ldquo;as soon as may be after the first day of January each year&rdquo;.  The last report published is for 1991 and that was laid before the Oireachtas in January 1993.  No reports have yet been published for 1992 or 1993, an extraordinary omission, given the sensitivity of this issue.  When the Minister responds she should explain why these reports have not been published &mdash; hardly an onerous task, given the small number of applications for extradition. According to the report for 1991 just one application was made for extradition to Great Britain and one to Northern Ireland.  I do not anticipate any great flood of applications for extradition when this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern if even one person wanted for serious offences in Northern Ireland or Great Britain can avoid being brought to justice because of the shortcomings in our law.  It is particularly unacceptable that persons who have been involved in activities which may have resulted, directly or indirectly, in murder, injury or destruction should be able to evade extradition by sheltering behind the spurious claim of having committed a political offence.</P>
    <P>To the extent that this Bill seeks to close the loophole in the Extradition (European Convention of Terrorism) Act, 1987, it is a welcome development. However, given the difficulties we have <Col N="352" /> experienced in the past, it would be a brave &mdash; or indeed a foolish &mdash; person, who would forecast that this will be the end of our problems.  In some respects it is remarkable that the flaw in the legislation was not anticipated when the Bill was drafted in late 1986.  To most rational people it seems the height of nonsense that under the law the use of an automatic weapon could never be regarded in our courts as a political offence, yet the possession of a lethal weapon like an M60 machine gun could be regarded as a political offence and provide immunity from extradition.</P>
    <P>It is also most unfortunate that it has taken so long to introduce the legislation to close the loophole which was identified in court cases as far back as 1990.  The long delay and the repeated failure to meet promised deadlines for the publication of the legislation has allowed the finger of suspicion to be pointed at this State.  The whole process is complicated by the fact that while the Oireachtas enacts the legislation responsibility for interpreting it rests with the courts.</P>
    <P>During the past decade there have been considerable shifts in the way the courts have interpreted extradition legislation, particularly in regard to the meaning of the term &ldquo;political offence&rdquo;, reflecting the changing composition and views of the members of the Supreme Court.  Under the original 1965 Act, extradition for a political offence was ruled out but there was no definition in the Act of what this meant.  The courts had traditionally taken a very broad interpretation of the meaning of &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; and, in general, persons sought for terrorist offences or offences arising from the activities of paramilitary groups were not extradited.  In other words, if a fugitive pleaded political motivation he was normally safe from extradition.  Then in the McGlinchey case in 1984, the Supreme Court took a dramatically different view when the Chief Justice held that a political offence could only be what reasonable civilised people would regard as political activity. However, in a series of subsequent decisions the Supreme Court, made up <Col N="353" /> of different personnel, handed down a number of judgments which seem to be moving back towards the original broad definition of a political offence.</P>
    <P>Against this background it was incumbent on the Oireachtas to act to give the courts far more specific terms of reference.  There will, no doubt, always be some people who are trapped in the Nationalist time warp and they will oppose extradition to Northern Ireland or Great Britain no matter what offence the person is accused of, but these are a very small minority.  I am convinced the vast majority of people in this State will support extradition procedures which will protect the rights of those sought but also ensure that those wanted for serious offences have to answer to a court of law.  In particular, they do not want terrorists to be able to draw some artificial cloak of political respectability over their murderous activities.  The political exemption clause which was applied in this country is not unique.  It was used in many countries and was first introduced by the British.  It was part of a legitimate political tradition which believed that when opponents of unsavoury undemocratic regimes sought refuge in a country their plea for asylum should be respected and they should not, in normal circumstances, be handed over.</P>

      <P>The idea behind this Bill is worth while.  The capacity to understand crime and, ultimately, to deal with it is heavily dependent on having an adequate <Col N="354" /> statistical base from which to work.  Without such a base one is working in the dark and progress will be difficult.  In that context, the proposal of the Minister to establish a study group to examine in detail the present system of collecting data is commendable.  Deputy Mitchell's Bill may have helped to concentrate the minds of officials in the Department of Justice on the need for such action.  If that happens it will have fulfilled a useful function even though it may not make much progress in this House.</P>
      <P>To make progress in dealing with problems such as crime we must have the appropriate information statistics to allow the problems and trends to be analysed so that a reasonable estimate of the underlying causes can be made. However, the crime problem here will not be solved simply by having a good statistical base.  That will merely provide a means to the solution.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that it is very difficult to find a solution to the crime problem. Neither is there any doubt that there is a major crime problem here.  Most people have been the victims of some form of crime and the problem is particularly acute in the city of Dublin.  We do not need statistics to know that.  Anybody who is out and about or has an interest in current affairs must be aware of the problem.</P>
      <P>Some of the responses to crime here have been instant and populist in nature. There is a danger that a system of justice worked out over many years may be cast aside, downgraded or put in jeopardy arising from such populist instant responses.  There is a tendency to have a politically correct response to the problems of crime designed to adequately fit the new concept of a sound bite.  Many of those responses are short, shallow and populist.  We need to think long and hard about where some of those responses might take us.  Such responses are understandable in the short term but are not desirable in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the problems which need to be addressed have been considered in the context of a system of justice developed and generated over many years.  Having <Col N="355" /> regard to some of our responses to crime recently, there is a danger that a number of those principles of justice and procedure may be cast aside.  Indeed, as a country and as a Legislature we are to some extent schizophrenic in our responses.  We bemoan at length the inadequacies of the British system of justice especially in respect of the celebrated cases of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Winchester Three and so on while at the same time we enact legislation which could give rise to considerable concern.  Those concerns are detailed in a publication by Dr. Caroline Fennell of the Department of Law in University College Cork entitled, <i>Crime and Crisis in Ireland,</i> which is worth reading. She states that:</P>
    <P>Recent events in Irish public and political life indicate a readiness to view criminal justice solely from a particular perspective, and a failure to question the implications of that stance.  Discussion of the nature of the current system, the basis for change and the principles guiding adjustment are nonexistent. Assumptions abound as to the need for change, the effective resolution of crisis by legislation, and omnipresent is the conviction that the overall structure remains secure and cognisant of liberal values (individual rights). </P>
    <P>Those words are worth considering in any instant response to the problem of crime. I understand the reasons for an instant response but that might not be desirable in the long term.</P>
    <P>We have an enormous crime problem here and in my constituency considerable difficulties arise from the problem of drugs.  It is widely accepted that many crimes committed in the city of Dublin are linked directly to drugs and the anxiety of drug addicts to satisfy their need for a fix.  Would it be worth considering the responses to such problems in other countries?  Is there a case to be made for at least considering in depth making drugs available on a controlled basis to addicts?  I read with interest an <Col N="356" /> account of a speech by Professor Tom Raftery of University College Cork, a former Member of the Seanad and the European Parliament, who advocated such a response.  I am not saying that such a response is the best one but it is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The present system of dealing with the problem is inadequate and therefore it would be wrong of us not to consider in an open-minded manner all the alternatives. I do not have the expertise or experience to advocate one response as against another, but a comprehensive debate on such issues would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In referring to drugs I incorrectly excluded alcohol.  There is a serious problem in relation to the abuse of alcohol particularly by young people and the manifestations of such abuse is evident in public parks in the city of Dublin. Public representatives in Dublin receive representations from citizens, almost on a weekly basis, who are concerned about all night parties in public parks.  It is not the noise and the nuisance created by the people holding such parties about which people are concerned, but rather the fear that such parties engender in them.  They are concerned because people who go to such parties are liable to have a go at anything that moves.  The matter is regularly discussed at local authority meetings and members of such authorities devote a great deal of time and energy to trying to devise a piecemeal solution to the problem.  They have considered building walls around public parks, but such walls might be an attraction for young people to congregate for such parties.  It is a difficult problem.</P>
    <P>Attacks on tourists in Dublin is a serious problem.  An attack on a tourist is no less acceptable and should not be considered differently from one on an Irish person.  At a time when we are selling our tourist industry and creating an inviting and attractive image of Ireland it is dreadful that many tourists are mugged.  In many ways they are sitting ducks waiting to be ripped off by criminals because they do not know the score.  They are not as careful as people <Col N="357" /> with experience of driving in Dublin and going about their business there.  Such crime is unpleasant.  However, a crime is a crime and unacceptable regardless of whether a tourist or an Irish person is the victim.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donnell's point regarding the paucity and the gross inadequacy of research in criminology here. Such research would pay dividends.  I would like initiatives taken to develop a centre for research in criminology here in which the reasons such crimes occur and appropriate responses could be analysed.  We have a long way to go in terms of studying that problem in a systematic and scientific way and generating solutions based on careful analysis.</P>
    <P>Some of the initiatives announced recently by the Minister for Justice in her plans to deal with the problem of crime are welcome.  The increased recruitment of 407 gardaí in 1994 and 200 civilian staff to support the Garda is also welcome. Recruitment of the civilian staff will leave gardaí free to do police work instead of filling out forms, work which can be undertaken by civilian staff.  It is regrettable that extra places are required in prisons, but that is the reality.  They are necessary to enable us to deal with the problem of crime and I welcome their provision although I am concerned that there is a need for them.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to problem or delinquent children, or whatever the politically correct term is.  An analysis of some children's social circumstances and background will enable one to predict with a reasonable degree of confidence that, regrettably, they will go on to become criminals and live a life of crime. From my experience the capacity of the justice system to deal speedily with difficult and problem children is inadequate. The system is sluggish and has been turgid in providing appropriate places for problem children of two constituents. Those children were running wild around the inner city for six months or longer and places were found for them after the problem was highlighted on &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;.  That solution gives a perspective of the centres of power in our <Col N="358" /> society.  I raised the matter of their placement on the Adjournment and wrote to Ministers, but it was not dealt with. Shortly after this matter was raised on the airwaves a solution was found.  I do not know whether that was a cause and effect or a cause and coincidence but if it was a cause and effect, it highlights the nature of power in Irish society and the stimuli to which the political system responds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Upton, for sharing his time.  I read with great interest the proposals contained in the Bill.  They include the establishment of structures to carry out the following tasks, namely, to measure crime levels, prepare annual reports on those levels, compare and analyse trends and levels, issue interim reports on trends and examine annual reports published by prisons, courts and so on.  The bureau will compile its statistics on crime by using sampling or other scientific methods and will be made up of representatives from all areas of the criminal justice system chaired by the director of the Central Statistics Office.  However, it is not necessary to establish a new statutory body to achieve those aims.</P>
      <P>The law and order package published by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, in December 1993 contained provisions which will be effective in dealing with crime.  It allows for the recruitment of gardaí to be increased to 407 in 1994 and maintained at a level of 350 recruits per year for the period 1994-97 which will ensure the present strength of the force is maintained.  Extra gardaí will be released for operational duties as 200 civilian clerical and administrative staff are recruited during the period 1994-97.  A special information technology plan is to be put in place for the Garda and the internal communications network is to be upgraded.  The package includes provision for the installation of closed circuit television to combat city crime and special community based measures are to be further developed in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional 210 prison places and 50 <Col N="359" /> additional probation and welfare officers will be provided during 1994-97.  It is regrettable that there is a need to create additional prison places in our society. Recently, I noticed that many people hold the view it is best to lock up criminals and throw away the key but I do not agree.  People have come to me to plead for members of their family aged 17 or 18 years who, when they got into trouble, were taken out of society and put into prison with adults.  The Minister must consider this matter carefully.  Three additional judges are to be appointed to clear the log jam of cases.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the provisions in existing legislation regarding people released from custody on bail.  Witnesses to crime and victims of crime are often subjected to intimidation by an accused person when released on bail.  That position is unacceptable and poses a real threat to the efficiency of our legal system.  A person is innocent of a crime until proven guilty.  I am aware that everyone is entitled to a free trial but the authorities must carefully consider the bail arrangements in respect of those accused of serious crime.  That is an issue in regard to which I have received many complaints from gardaí and people involved in the legal profession.  When people are released on bail, in cases of serious crime, such as rape, the victims are often intimidated into not giving evidence at their trial.  That matter must be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is a cause of much crime in our society.  People steal to finance their habit.  They break into houses, particularly those of the elderly, and terrorise people for hours.  I have received a number of complaints in my constituency about this matter.  I know a case of a 70 year old woman who was terrorised for several hours by two or three people. That type of crime is increasing in society. The Cork coastline has proved one of the most difficult in the European Union to police.  We have heard of the amount of drugs recovered recently in the area but this is only the tip of the iceberg.  Drug trafficking is a very serious problem and <Col N="360" /> we will have to seek help from our partners in Europe to curtail it.  I compliment the Minister for Finance on his efforts in seeking extra finance from the European Union to modernise our Naval Service and customs service, thereby helping them in their fight against drugs.  I also compliment the Minister for Defence on initiating a recruitment campaign to increase the number of personnel in the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem of vandalism in our towns and villages.  In my town of Cobh the townspeople raised a large sum of money some years ago to build a swimming pool.  This pool was of great service to the people of Cobh up to a year ago, when vandals broke in causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.  To date the pool has not reopened and I doubt that it will reopen in the near future because we cannot get the finance to carry out the necessary repairs.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer again to young people in prison.  Parents of constituents have come to me on a number of occasions about this matter.  One case which came to light was that of a 17 year old who was raped while in prison.  It is an indictment of society that this should happen to young people who are put behind bars.  The prison system is not suitable for 17, 18 and 19 year old people. Some other schooling method should be arranged for them.  Many of the families of young people in prison are hard working, good living people who are disturbed about what is happening.</P>
    <P>I would again like to refer to the drugs problem, particularly off the Cork coastline. As a former member of the Naval Service, I know that service is under great pressure and does not have sufficient equipment to curtail drug trafficking.  The Naval Service polices our seas; the Customs and Excise service polices our borders; and the Garda police the land.  The Minister will have to consider increasing resources in these areas if the drugs problem is to be solved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this Bill by Deputy Gay Mitchell. It is generally accepted that in the <Col N="361" /> limited period of time he has been spokesman on Justice, Deputy Mitchell has excelled, particularly in the area of crime.  He has focused attention on the fact that while many current ills afflict Irish society, be they economic difficulties, redundancies, closures, unemployment, homelessness or deprivation, the single greatest problem facing the country is our inability to come to terms with crime.  There is no doubt that all the available evidence, written, graphic and otherwise, points to a major epidemic in crime, and unfortunately the position is getting worse.  At one time our daily newspapers devoted a corner of a page to criminal cases, but now on an almost daily basis these cases take up a page and a half or two pages &mdash; I am talking not simply about tabloids but about all newspapers.</P>
      <P>This Bill is timely.  I listened to Deputy Mulvihill praising the recent ministerial measures.  He said that 450 additional gardaí have been recruited, and of course they are extremely welcome.  The more gardaí there are on foot patrol the better. The Deputy commended the Minister for Finance for making available additional resources, which are always welcome.  He lauded the Minister's announcement that there will be more internal communications, closed circuit television, technology and hi-tech paraphernalia that is part and parcel of modern crime prevention and detection.  That is welcome, but one can never stray far from the adage that prevention is better than cure, and it is in the area of prevention that we have failed miserably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Crime is rampant and is increasing. Irrespective of the measures that have been announced &mdash; a plethora of measures have been introduced, many of them with high profile press conferences &mdash; at the end of the day they simply do not work and crime is hurtling out of control.  Every time a series of a certain type of crime is committed, you can wager your last dollar that a new initiative will be introduced.  A number of years ago in the wake of the tragic deaths of two gardaí, Henry Byrne and John Morley in Loughglynn, County Roscommon, for <Col N="362" /> which three people, Pringle, O'Shea and McCann, were sent to prison &mdash; one of these cases is a source of controversy at present &mdash; the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, in a knee-jerk reaction, announced that aerial support would be provided for the Garda, but that did not happen.</P>
    <P>It is all very well talking about combating crime and the heavy-handed approach to crime, but at times you have to be ruthless.  Definite deterrents must be put in place.  They will not always work.  There is much merit in recent initiatives, such as community service and so on.  I believe in rehabilitation programmes, but unfortunately they are far too few.  The Irish approach to crime has been simply a muddled amalgam of misinterpreted evidence, with the occasional naive ministerial assertion about the nature of crime which sounds great but which at the end of the day amounts to nothing.</P>
    <P>A promise was made last week, last night and tonight that a study group would be set up.  I do not doubt the Minister's good intentions in this regard, but the reality is that we have had study after study, commission after commission, advisory group after advisory group, task force after task force and reports galore, but at the end of the day we are no nearer to the key question, the basic question that must be answered, which is: what drives such a huge number of our population to engage in crime?</P>
    <P>People are born with a good disposition, not with a predisposition to evil. There are environmental and social reasons people commit crime, but it is not hereditary.  An indepth study must be undertaken into the reasons for crime. None of the bodies, commissions, task forces or study groups that has been set up has grappled with that question.  As Deputy Mitchell pointed out and as has been acknowledged in this House, these people work from a base of inadequate knowledge.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Upton that one can take too populist an approach to crime.  People make shrill soundings when crimes are committed and mass <Col N="363" /> hysteria is created.  However, it is difficult to avoid hysteria when you look at the statistics, read the newspapers and hear the victims of crime, as we heard on the airwaves today, graphically describing the reality of being confronted with a criminal on the street, in your home or on your premises.</P>
    <P>There has been a huge increase in the incidence of crime and there has been a change in the type of crimes committed. For example, 40 years ago even the most hardened criminal would not indulge in routinely beating up the elderly, as happens today.  In the past those crimes, which very often were robberies, were accomplished with the minimum of violence.</P>
    <P>It has been acknowledged that drugs are the root cause of crime, particularly in Dublin.  In such a situation it is unaccpetable that the 1988 report on prisons was not published until July 1993, five and a half years later.  By the time this report was published it was stale, five and a half years out of date.  The report is an important source of statistical and other information and gives graphic statistics in regard to the penal system which are invaluable not only to the Department of Justice but also to the law makers, the law enforcers and the general public in terms of their understanding of crime.  Nobody can arrive at any conclusion about the level of crime or make a planned, studied or accurate assessment of the problem, let alone plan for the future, if one does not have up to date, basic and accurate information.  It is unacceptable that the 1988 statistics were not published until five and a half years later.  In such a situation the Government is not grappling with the problem; rather it is dealing with stale statistics &mdash; the situation has changed &mdash; and is poking around in the dark.</P>
    <P>The late publication of reports is not the only problem.  For example, we have no statistics relating to the courts.  Community service orders were introduced in 1984 and it is generally agreed that these orders seem to be working well. However, the operative word in this <Col N="364" /> regard's is &ldquo;seem&rdquo;.  This system has been operating for ten years, yet it has never been evaluated &mdash; there has been no follow up, no post-analysis and no indepth examination to find out if the people who were subject to community service orders have been reformed, have mended their ways or have lapsed back into a life of crime.  Neither has there been a proper analysis of cell accommodation in prisons.  The last report on the probation and welfare service, which is supposed to be a fundamental plank, in our efforts to deal with crime, was published in 1989-90.</P>
    <P>Without scientific data, up-to-date statistics and precise bookkeeping, one cannot even begin to come to grips with the problem.  The solution to the present confusion and ignorance which exists in regard to crime and punishment is not a commitment to paraphernalia, hi-tech equipment, technology, closed circuit television or internal communications but rather a definite commitment &mdash; this is what Fine Gael is looking for &mdash; to increased investment and resources for scientific inquiries into crime, by which I mean the gathering of new information and the careful analysis and rational synthesis of all available data and evidence.</P>
    <P>Our society is in a crisis because the gap between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; is becoming greater all the time.  A huge number of people, particularly in huge areas of this city, believe they have no stake whatsoever in modern society. I know this sounds boring, particularly to the &ldquo;haves&rdquo;, but understanding this problem is vital.  I know it is a dry, laborious and boring business &mdash; people would very often regard it as academic &mdash; but it is vitally important that this issue and all the relevant complexities are examined in detail.  At a time of justifiable public alarm about the level of crime and growing crime statistics, it is vitally important that we analyse the problem in depth and get to the bottom of it once and for all.  Throwing resources at hi-tech equipment will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Our Government is almost unique among the governments of developed <Col N="365" /> nations in that it allocates next to nothing for research into criminal justice.  As Deputy Upton, and I think Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, we have no university department of criminology.  Other countries not only have one university with a faculty of criminology but most countries have their own independent department of criminology which offers independent analyses, monitoring and indepth examination of the causes of crime and makes recommendations.  In a country where crime is one of the biggest industries, it is ironic that none of our five universities has a department of criminology.  To show just how ludicrous the situation is, the Department of Justice which, in theory, is trying to combat crime, has no research unit attached to it.  This is a cause of major concern.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for this problem is that there does not seem to be any proper planning.  The Government has no planned programme of reseach into crime, involving the funding of independent criminologists and social scientists.  A small amount of research receives funding but unfortunately this research is carried out on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and does not contribute in an ordered, cumulative way to a body of knowledge on the crime scene.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from what I can only perceive as a lack of willingness to provide the vital statistics, there is a culture of secrecy within the Department of Justice which is quite legendary.  This culture of secrecy is both the cause and the consequence of the Department's distaste for independent research and compiling and publishing factual information.  The tragedy of all this is that even though basic information exists &mdash; there are files &mdash; unfortunately the information is not collated, or if it is collated then it certainly is not made available to the relevent agencies.  The Government has made openness and transparency one of its key principles of operation.  Yet there is a glaring lack of openness and transparency when it comes to knowledge about crime.</P>
    <P>I recently reread the Fianna Fáil-Labour Programme for Government <Col N="366" /> which states in black capital letters that: &ldquo;The time scale for the implementation of the Whitaker Report on Prisons will be decided&rdquo;.  I should like to know what exactly this means.  Does it mean that the Government intends to take the running of prisons out of the hands of the Department of Justice, or does it mean that it will reduce the number of prisoners to 1,500 by finding alternative sanctions for minor property offenders?  As the Minister of State knows, these are two of the key recommendations of the Whitaker report.  When will the Government spell out exactly what it means by its commitment to the Whitaker report?</P>
    <P>There is also the problem that quite a number of crimes are not reported.  This means that we are getting an inaccurate picture of the true level of crime in our society.  If crimes are not reported then they are not officially recorded.  It is acknowledged that many crimes involving sexual offences are not reported.  This applies also to many other types of crime where people regard the trauma of going through the legal system as simply too much, not worth it, and decide not to report a crime.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that children of 12 years are already committing crimes of larceny, bag snatching, etc.  The compulsory school leaving age is 15 years. Yet for the past seven years the Department of Education and Dublin Corporation have failed to appoint school attendance officers in large areas of the inner city.  At present there are ten longstanding vacancies for school attendance officers in Dublin as well as one in Dún Laoghaire and one in Cork.  Despite repeated pressure from me and other spokespersons in the House and from the School Attendance Officers' Association these posts have not been filled.  Surely the merit of a school attendance officer, particularly in a city where there is rampant crime among juveniles, is very obvious and well justified both financially and in every other respect.  There is no school attendance officer for the Dublin 8 area which is well known to contain two of the greatest drug complexes in this city.  The result is that hundreds of young <Col N="367" /> children who should be at school from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. are roaming the streets. Many crimes are committed during the hours that these ten, 11 and 12-year-olds should be in school.  It is a scandal that 119 national schools in Dublin are without the service of a school attendance officer.  The result is that 20 per cent &mdash; one in every five children &mdash; who are entitled to full-time, uninterrupted education are not only being denied this right but are mini-Fagans before they reach their teens.</P>
    <P>I remain convinced that there is a strong linkage between the absence of education and the prevalence of crime. There are areas of this city, for example, where the participation rate in university is less than one per cent.  There are large areas in this city, less than a mile and a half from here, where less than 20 per cent of the people enter secondary school.  There are large areas of this city where the relevance of education as a form of social lever or advancement mechanism is simply not appreciated. The results of this are obvious because it has been estimated &mdash; again we are talking about estimates, but they are accurate &mdash; that between 60 and 70 per cent of criminals in our prisons cannot read or write.</P>
    <P>I have asked many times in this House, during Question Time and on other occasions, the Minister for Justice to validate or contradict that figure to try to establish the causes of crime and the link between the deprivation of education.  I have asked that a survey of prisons be carried out to establish whether this statistic is accurate.  All that is required is for people to talk to the prisoners. Surely we can afford the personnel to talk to prisoners.  When a person is admitted to prison and a file is being opened, and when all the personal details and other data are being incorporated in that file, it should be possible to establish the level of education of these people.  One, two or three questions would be sufficient to elicit that information.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to establish how many prisoners achieved a level of primary <Col N="368" /> education or dropped out before they left primary school, the number who attended second level education or bothered to sit an Intermediate Certificate examination, the number who reached Leaving Certificate level and the number who achieved the elusive prize of a place in university.</P>
    <P>I listened to the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; this morning and heard Joe Duffy conduct an interview in Mountjoy Prison with the perpetrators and victims of crime.  Both groups exchanged views and ideas; it was a marvellous exercise but if one listened intently one could detect that those who committed crimes felt that their greatest lack was access to education.  Education as a social instrument is a key element in educating people away from a life of crime and that was echoed frequently on the programme.</P>
    <P>One of the Mountjoy prisoners bemoaned the fact that of the 400 people &mdash; I am not sure whether he was referring to his section or the jail as a whole &mdash; only 80 were able to get access to education programmes.</P>
    <P>According to a programme on dyslexia, it was discovered in a 1991 survey of the prisons in Great Britain that of the total number of prisoners in British prisons, 45 per cent were proven to be dyslexic.  That was an example of people who had much talent and many skills but who, because they did not have the opportunity to express themselves in either the written or oral form, or because they did not have access to the bulk of knowledge and data for which they had a thirst, suffered much frustration which led to a life of crime.  I do not wish in any way to associate the reading disorder of dyslexia with crime but there is a link between inadequate access to education and crime.  The prevention of crime is better than the cure at a later stage.</P>
    <P>On education, I frequently made the point here that while Youthreach programmes and other rescue initiatives have much merit in relation to helping people along the way, if the necessary resources were allocated at an early stage it would be more cost effective and beneficial. <Col N="369" /> Early intervention is the key and in that regard education is one of the main factors.</P>
    <P>There was reference tonight to the terrible spate of crimes against tourists and we will soon be discussing that seasonal problem.  Last year there were 1,200 attacks on tourists.  We talk about Discover Ireland, Ireland of the one hundred thousand welcomes and yet 1,200 people were attacked on our streets.  Nothing has been done to tackle this problem.  Of all the disastrous public relations exercises, none does more damage than tourists leaving this country without their credit cards or, worse, with a display of wounds after being attacked in the Phoenix Park or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We must have deterrents and I am in favour of adopting a strong line when dealing with criminals but there is little point putting these people behind bars if we have the type of situation referred to by one of the inmates in Mountjoy.  If we do not have the facilities for rehabilitation there is little point putting these people in prison.  Rehabilitation is vital because it has been proven that irrespective of how severe the custodial sentence, if we cannot show these people an alternative, a better way of making a living, they will leave prison and return to the same pattern of living that landed them in prison in the first place.  Habitual crime is a recurring theme and I cannot understand, from a cost-effective point of view, why more is not being done to rehabilitate criminals.</P>
    <P>For example, what form of policing is there of the thousands of video outlets? Very little indeed.  The number of prosecutions for larceny of videos is derisory. I acknowledge this is not simply a matter of the enforcement of the law but what is being done about parental responsibility? Little is being done.  I acknowledge that parental vigilance is essential but little is being done to promote that.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this once friendly city has now one of the worst reputations in Europe.  It is extremely sad that the once friendly Henry Street and Grafton Street have become fortifications, where every shop must be shuttered and metal <Col N="370" /> protection of every type and description provided.  It is wrong that people should be warned that there are &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas. Imagine, in a city such as Dublin there are areas where one simply cannot risk walking alone or even in twos or threes, not alone are there &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas for the ordinary citizen but for the Garda as well. That is one of the problems.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the advancement in terms of the mobilisation of the police force I really believe that the modern trend of moving away from foot patrols has been disastrous in small rural towns, in larger urban centres but particularly in the city of Dublin.  I believe in high-tech equipment.  I also believe that the presence of law officers on the streets, walking in foot patrols, in twos, is absolutely essential from the point of view of providing security for the person walking and a deterrent to the people who would have in mind committing a crime.  We have got to show, through a combination of measures, that crime does not pay.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for people to fully comprehend how one can draw a distinction between different types of crime.  One the one hand, there are certain categories of white collar crime, for example a Revenue offence which is punishable by jail, yet how many people here have been put into jail for Revenue offences for defrauding the State, for not paying their taxes, for welshing on their responsibilities? Not alone have such people not been put into jail but we actually introduced legislation to give them a tax amnesty.  In terms of the massive chasm between the haves and the have-nots it is easy to understand how people with no job can say that, if evading tax is legitimate and is even legislated for in terms of concessions, why should they not indulge in the black market economy in terms of making a living?</P>
    <P>I believe that crime can be solved but there has to be a multi-faceted approach. We must revert to the genesis of this Bill which is, first, the compilation on up-to-date statistics on a regular basis; second, an examination of those statistics in detail; third, an examination of their implications and, fourth, probing the <Col N="371" /> root causes of crime because, until we get to the root causes of crime, all we are doing is treating the symptoms while the causes of crime persist.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be afforded an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I should like to congratulate Deputy Gay Mitchell on introducing this Bill, although I cannot agree with all of its provisions.  For example, I agree we should review the manner in which our official statistics are compiled but, as the Minister pointed out last week, it is very difficult to separate the functions of recording and reporting of crime from its investigation.  There is need for an integrated approach in tackling the very serious problems of crime in this country. As Deputy Jim Higgins said, its incidence is not confined to cities, it is very much a rural problem also.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the position obtaining in rural areas. There were many attacks against the elderly in rural areas at a time when such people kept too much money in their homes and a big campaign was initiated to persuade the elderly in particular &mdash; if they had any money in their homes &mdash; to lodge it in saving accounts.  Nowadays the type of crime we witness in rural areas is perpetrated against business premises. Public houses, small shops, supermarkets, hardware stores, or sports or clothes shops, all have suffered attempted attacks or break-ins in recent years.  In fact even the humble post office, probably because they are authorised to sell national lottery tickets, has been the subject of many attempted robberies in recent months; there were break-ins in three post offices in my area last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must concentrate our remarks this evening on the measures to be taken to prevent such attacks.  It is only right to point out that usually such attacks take <Col N="372" /> place between the hours of 2 a.m. and 7 a.m., in most cases instigated by groups from outside the locality.  In East Galway recently groups from as far away as Dublin, Cork and Limerick were apprehended and arrested.  Indeed, I would attribute the success of the Garda in their apprehension and arrest to the fact that the community policing scheme operating in parts of my constituency is working very well.</P>
    <P>It is also important to have Garda stations open.  Many of my colleagues have said this and the Garda themselves feel they should be on the streets tackling crime, not sitting in offices.  Indeed the question of opening Garda stations in the evening might also be examined, during hours when people might need to call them having returned from work.  I think a review of the community policing scheme was promised at six monthly intervals.  As far as I am concerned the scheme is working well but it could be further improved by opening more Garda stations and providing additional patrol cars and vans in rural areas.  This scheme is working well in the Ballinasloe and Loughrea district headquarters.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the position concerning the Tuam district headquarters and whether there are proposals to introduce community policing there. One town falling within the remit of the Tuam station is Glenamaddy whose residents say they should be given extra Garda presence.  There were some serious disturbances in that town before Christmas, reported in a very negative manner by the media.  It was not pointed out that that town had received a national award presented by the President for their social services work, or that it can boast one of the most radical social services committees nationwide with a day centre and a community hospital, provisions unique in a small town.  The townspeople feel there should be extra Garda presence there to prevent any recurrence of those earlier disturbances.</P>
    <P>We are told that much of the crime committed is drug and alcohol related, a point which came across forcibly this morning on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; which <Col N="373" /> was broadcast from Mountjoy Prison when prisoners and victims of crime told their stories.  I should like to congratulate all involved in an excellent programme. It was interesting that prisoners spoke about having served so many months or years in prison whereas victims spoke about the devastation for life they faced because of attacks on themselves, their homes and property.  For example, one person spoke about not having been able to sleep since having been subjected to such an attack.  That illustrates the manner in which criminals prey on soft targets, for example, the elderly living alone or in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Last evening in Tuam there was such concern about allegations of drugs pushers in the town.  A major seminar was held on drugs and drink when the Garda and civil leaders launched a concerted effort to ensure that the drugs problem did not take root in Tuam and surrounding areas.  The Garda were very much to the forefront in organising that seminar.  They appealed to everyone to attend, particularly parents, teachers and secondary school students.  There were rumours in the town that business people were subject to extortion demands and that the Temple Jarleth graveyard was used as a dumping ground by drink and drug dealers.  I hope the message has gone out loud and clear to drug pushers that they will not succeed.</P>
    <P>Dr. Mick Loftus, who has been campaigning for a long time against the abuse of alcohol, made a strong statement in the <i>Tuam Herald and Western Advertiser.</i> He said that alcohol is glamorised in advertising but very little mention is made of the damage it can cause.  He suggested there was need for a health warning and made the point that in 1958 the Government granted 5,000 bar extensions while in 1993 the number was 60,000.</P>
    <P>As a result of the seminar, the chamber of commerce and the Vintners Association stated they would fight these godfathers' proposals to promote drugs in the area.  The Vintners Association will challenge the granting of a licence to any <Col N="374" /> premises where the owners are aware such activity takes place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recruitment fo 407 gardaí in 1994 announced by the Minister. The annual intake of 350 recruits for the period 1995-97 will maintain the strength of the Force at its present level. I hope some of these gardaí will be assigned to rural areas.  The Minister also mentioned the Statistics Act, 1993, and the study group which I hope will deal with the issues Deputy Mitchell raised in his Bill.  The bureau must not duplicate the work of the Garda whose main activity must remain fighting crime.</P>
    <P>The community alert scheme has been most successful.  Communities who operate this scheme fight the godfathers of crime and have been successful in crime detection and the gardaí are happy with such groups.</P>
    <P>I hope the measures announced by the Minister will be successful in combating crime.  One professor in the teacher training college I attended echoed the words of Fr. Flanagan in <i>Boys Town:</i> there is no such thing as a bad boy.  However, in today's world there are many bad influences and I hope the measures we take will enable us to fight the godfathers of crime who are intent on causing evil in our cities and counties.</P>

        <i>(Laois-Offaly):</i> I thank Deputy Kitt for sharing his time with me. I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate and congratulate Deputy Mitchell for bringing this issue before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the basic tenets of the argument he makes cannot be contested, that is, that the lack of adequate crime statistics is a barrier to the formulation, implementation and review of policy in relation to crime and punishment.  He suggesed that one of the ways this could be remedied was to set up a bureau of crime statistics which would not constitute a charge on the Exchequer and would comprise the director of the CSO, the Comptroller and Auditor General, an officer from the Office of the DPP, an assistant Garda commissioner, a prisoner governor, a High Court judge and a representive of <Col N="375" /> the probation and welfare service.  I have no doubt that such people would do an admirable job but I cannot see how setting up such a group would not constitute a charge on the Exchequer.  They would be absent from their normal work and, as a group, would need to be resourced.</P>
    <P>It does not add anything to the argument to claim that extra public resources would not be needed.  The formulation of crime and punishment statistics is something which could justifiably be charged to the Exchequer.  The lack of such statistics impedes the formulation of a rational and objective system of punishment for crime.  The need for such statistics is evident.  We have evidence of this in the Whitaker report, from the Law Reform Commission and from various researchers in the criminological area who have all stated that it is difficult to come to conclusions and make recommendations regarding the system of crime and punishment because the statistics provided are inadequate; I am not referring specifically to Garda statistics. There was a great deal of argument about the fact that if a crime is not reported it is not regarded officially as having occurred.  There is very little one can do about that.  The fundamental way in which crime is recorded is by people reporting it.  The Minister explained this in detail last week.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic to separate the functions of recording and reporting crime from the investigation of crime.  I agree with the Minister that the Garda is the best qualified State agency for recording crime and reporting on crime levels. However, there are many other areas in relation to crime and punishment for which statisics need to be recorded, for example, the courts, the probation and welfare service, the prison service and the effectiveness of sentencing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the special study group to consider co-ordinating the data available to the Department of Justice following the recent meeting <Col N="376" /> between that Department, the Garda authorities and the Central Statistics Office and the Minister's commitment to provide resources for this group.  The group should address the area of sentencing and its effectiveness as well as reports on prisons, places of detention and the probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P>I am glad there has been an effort to produce more recent reports on the probation and welfare service and on prisons and places of detention.  The statistics contained in those reports are comprehensive and useful, but I am not saying that improvements cannot be made.  In any debate or consideration of crime and punishment, statistics are helpful.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the good start which has been made in having these statistics produced quickly will be continued so that we can have, similar to the Garda Comissioner's report, statistics for a particular year available to us and to other members of the public early in the following year.  It should be possible to do this in these days of computerisation.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing for a consideration of statistics just for the sake of it.  The point is that unless we have up to date information we cannot review existing policies, we cannot consider what policies need to be implemented for the future and we cannot therefore review those policies as they are put in place.  I am confident that the good start the Minister has made in having these statistics produced more promptly will be continued. Something which has been clearly shown by separating the criminal law area under the Department of Justice from the civil law area under the Department of Equality and Law Reform is that both sides have become much more productive. That is welcome and is evidenced by the volume of legislation coming through the Houses of the Oireachtas from both Departments.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the package of measures announced by the Minister to combat crime.  I welcome the <Col N="377" /> recruitment of extra gardaí this year, the decision to recruit 350 Garda trainees per annum from 1995 to 1997 to maintain manning levels and the recruitment of civilians to release gardaí for the job for which they were trained.  I welcome in particular the increase in resources for community based measures in areas of disadvantage as well as the additional resources and staffing for the probation and welfare service.  I should like to address these in more detail.</P>
    <P>One of the most underrated and undervalued services is the preventative and low key work done by the Garda in the various Garda stations by those on the beat and through the juvenile liaison officer system.  I can instance many cases of action by the gardaí at local level where young offenders were apprehended for particular crimes.  They were dealt with in a way which not only warned the offender concerning the consequences of re-offending but also ensured that the victim got some measures of compensation, particularly in relation to damage to property.  Many gardaí have been diligent in following up those cases at local level, warning the offender and giving restitution to the victim.  That type of work should be encouraged in the Garda Síochána. There is a danger that by concentrating on the high tech side &mdash; communications, cars, helicopters, as mentioned earlier by Deputy Higgins, all of which are needed &mdash; the low key, person to person work carried out by the Garda Síochána at local level will be overlooked.  This type of work is possibly more effective in many areas than many of the high tech solutions because it helps prevent people ending up in the net of court, prison and the probation service.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the juvenile liaison officer system expanded.  The training provided to gardaí entering this area of duty has improved in recent years, as have all other areas of Garda training.  In my own area I have seen how this can work effectively.  Young offenders are <Col N="378" /> apprehended and warned.  Contact is made with the family in an effort to ensure that parents discharge their responsibility in co-operation with the Garda Síochána so that the young person does not reoffend and end up in the net from which it is difficult to escape, as indicated by the available statistics.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to direct the maximum amount of resources to the neighbourhood watch scheme, the community alert scheme and the new business watch scheme announced last week. Other Deputies have referred to the effectiveness of those schemes and I can attest to that in my own constituency. Where the Garda work with community alert groups and neighbourhood watch groups they can be effective in not only preventing crime but in building up community spirit, in organising socials and in attempting to provide alternative facilities for young people.  It is not a high tech, computerised, glitzy area, but it is an effective area of work and I urge that the maximum amount of resources be devoted to it.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the additional resources being provided for the probation and welfare service.  I have had contact with this service through my previous work with young people before coming into this House.  I have a very high regard for the commitment and training of the officers working in the probation and welfare service. Unfortunately, the areas they have to cover are often large.  For that reason I welcome the fact that an additional 50 officers will be appointed in the 1994-97 period and that additional facilities and back-up will be provided.  They have been innovative in getting involved in community-based initiatives with a view to preventing crime and dealing with it when it occurs, especially with first time offenders.  Their work has been shown to be effective as well as cost effective, a matter I would like to stress in this debate.  We heard from some Deputies last week the easy cry to lock them up.  I realise that 210 places are being provided <Col N="379" /> in the crime package, and they are necessary. When we compare the cost of imprisoning a person for a year with the cost of effective intervention at community level, we will see that community organisations such as neighbourhood watch, the local Garda, the juvenile liaison officer or the local probation and welfare officer are more successful in preventing people from re-offending.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to rural policing. This is an area where we could improve our reporting statistics.  A review has been carried out of the rural policing initiative commenced by the Garda Síochána.  At management level it is necessary to redeploy resources to maximum effect.  In my own constituency we have experience of the rural policing initiative and there are mixed views on it.  In a village not far from me people complain that there have never been as many members of the Garda Síochána present and that they have never been stopped to be checked for seat belts, insurance and drink driving as often as they have been since this initiative was introduced.  In another village there is a perception that the crime level has increased due to the change in the staffing level of the local station and also because the gardaí do not live in the area and do not have the same level of contact and local intelligence as in the past.  Perhaps we could examine how the community alert scheme can be improved and put on a better footing to increase the intelligence available to the Garda at local level.</P>
    <P>I wish to address briefly the overall perception of the increase in crime. Deputy Higgins mentioned the need to approach this in a fairly rational manner and Deputy O'Donnell mentioned it last week also.  While we take our responsibilities in this House seriously in relation to crime, it is important that we do not get carried away by media circuses which arise from time to time.</P>
    <P>A very useful publication is Paul <Col N="380" /> O'Mahony's book <i>Crime and Punishment in Ireland,</i> which was recently reviewed by Judge Keane.  It is important to remind ourselves of the statistics in that book and in the review.  It is important to stress that the exaggeration of crime figures is unhelpful in this debate.  Available figures do not show a massive increase in crime, although certainly there has been an increase in crime from the 1950s to the 1990s as we have gone through the process of modernisation and urbanisation. An increase in crime is possibly an unavoidable side effect of modernisation and urbanisation, but who wants to go back to the 1950s?  Judge Keane, in reviewing the book, said:</P>
    <P>There is a widespread impression that our crime rate has grown dramatically in recent years, that crimes of violence have in particular significantly increased and that the figures have now reached record proportions. The statistics, according to Mr. O'Mahony, tell a different story. Over the period of his survey, from 1973 to 1991, there was undoubtedly a very large increase in indictable crime but a peak was reached in 1983.... Crimes of violence remain at roughly the same level as in 1975. </P>
    <P>It is important to keep a perspective on this.  The belief that the country is experiencing record levels of crime is questionable. The levels of crime here, despite the increase, are still lower than in other countries; and, while the growth of crime is not as significant as in other countries, it is important to remember that there has been a disproportionate increase in crime in rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is within the competence of the Department of Justice with the resources already there to produce statistics more quickly.  When statistics are produced it is a policy function of the Government and the House to use them to review trends and set out a policy for the future. In order to assist with that process I would like the Minister to consider set-Labou <Col N="381" /> ting up the study group on a long term footing and to consider providing funding for liaison with a criminological institute or research facility in one of our third level institutions so that the area of crime and punishment is kept under constant review and the most effective and efficient policy is put in place to enable us to deal with the problem in an effective level headed manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the interest in this topic displayed by the main Opposition Party which has resulted in this Bill coming before the House.  Everybody in this House should be concerned about the rise in crime and the introduction of new ways to tackle it.  However, I would dispute the narrow view of crime and its causes as represented in this Bill. The fundamental causes of crime are economic and social and rising crime levels can often be associated with increased unemployment and greater levels of poverty.</P>
      <P>Crime is a very complex problem which should be approached in a broad fashion, taking into account all the factors relating to crime.  The Government adopted a two-pronged approach to tackling crime. On the one hand it increased spending on housing, education and health.  A new emphasis on this kind of expenditure will give people a better standard of living and better life opportunities, creating a more socially just society.  This is one way of tackling crime.  On the other hand, the Government is spending £66 million this year in order to directly combat the rising levels of crime.  That is a substantial contribution towards defeating the crime problem.  We are providing more resources to the Garda, who are in the front line against crime, to employ new methods of tackling crime.  This will lead to greater confidence in the fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent budget the Government proved its total commitment to creating a socially just society by increasing spending in the areas of health, education and housing.  Lack of housing puts pressure <Col N="382" /> on people, affecting the way they behave in society.  A sum of £12 million has been allocated for local authority housing to ensure a repeat of last year's 3,500 house starts.  This year there will be over 7,000 houses under construction, creating approximately 14,000 jobs in the construction sector.  Unskilled labour directs its attention towards the construction industry, so we can look forward with interest to the development of that employment programme, and I hope contractors will ensure that local employment is used.</P>
    <P>A sum of £5 million has been provided for the secondary school building programme. This will enable us also to address unemployment and it will provide for investment in schools and colleges. A sum of £3 million has been given to the regional technical college in Tallaght and it will be of great benefit in developing that third level institution.  It will provide employment and it will enable young people to acquire the skills that will help them to make a more positive contribution towards society.  The school extension in the Greenhills area will be of great benefit to my local community and I hope it too will increase employment in the area.</P>
    <P>The Government spending of £100 million to address the long-standing problems of the health boards is welcome and it will enable health boards to pay off their debts.  Small business that have waited so long for benefits will be able to engage more people productively.  These are concrete ways in which to deal with our crime problem.</P>
    <P>The Government has put more resources into the fight against crime on the ground.  Last December the Minister for Justice unveiled a comprehensive law and order package which includes acceleration of the recruitment of over 400 gardaí in 1994.  That will be a major morale boost for the Garda Síochána. The Government has also given a commitment to ensure an annual intake of 350 Garda recruits during the period 1995 <Col N="383" /> to 1997 in order to keep the strength of the force up to its present level and 200 civilian staff will be recruited to release that number of gardaí into operational duties.</P>
    <P>The Government has provided 210 extra places to deal with over-crowding in prisons.  There was a very interesting broadcast on the radio today from Mountjoy Prison which discussed the views of victims of crime and the people who perpetrated crimes.  It was an interesting confrontation on radio.  It is a lesson for us all to hear the attitudes of people who carried out dastardly deeds.</P>
    <P>The package will also strengthen the hand of the Garda in the fight against crime.  A comprehensive information technology plan will be implemented as a key part of the fight against crime. In addition, the Garda will upgrade its communications network and rely more on closed circuit television to combat crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the urban renewal scheme, particularly for those who genuinely need extra time to complete the development.  I wish to raise the issue of interpretation difficulties with the guidelines on the extension of the designated areas scheme published on 27 January following the budget announcement to get specific answers to questions in relation to them. It appears that a Fianna Fáil Minister &mdash; I cannot be sure which &mdash; tipped off his pals in the construction industry that an extension of the scheme would be announced in the budget in spite of the fact that all correspondence prior to the budget from the Department of the Environment to the Construction Industry Federation indicated clearly that no <Col N="384" /> extension would be available and that the Minister for Finance in abolishing the 30 November 1993 foundation laying deadline emphasised that the overall deadline for the scheme would remain 31 July 1994.  He also said that urban renewal incentives would be available in respect of whatever qualifying expenditure has been incurred during the qualifying period to that date in July 1994.</P>
      <P>A builder closely associated with the Fianna Fáil Party said, three weeks before the budget, that the scheme would be extended.  Given the time the planning process takes, assuming that no additional information is requested by the planning authority and that no objections to the application are lodged necessitating a trip to An Bord Pleanála, it takes 60 days plus a further 28 days determination period, almost three months, to get permission in the normal process. Given the high cost of commercial planning applications, no developer in his right mind would waste thousands of pounds in submitting new planning applications in designated areas two days before the budget.  I have a list of the planning applications and I invite the Minister to check with other relevant planning authorities for applications submitted a matter of days or weeks before the budget.  An application was submitted on 24 January 1994 for 64 apartments in an area covered by the designated areas scheme which would have cost a minimum of £20,000 to lodge. It would have been a waste of money if the builder did not know the scheme was being extended two days later in the budget.  At the very least these last minute applications do not pass the &ldquo;smell test&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now turn my attention to the published guidelines.  Will the Minister clarify the meaning of paragraph 3 (1)? Prior to that, paragraph 2 (2) states that any submission by a developer wishing to avail of the extension should include certificates from a professionally qualified quantity surveyor or valuer incorporating <Col N="385" /> the following information &ldquo;a detailed breakdown of expenditure incurred on the project before 26 January &mdash; budget day and that expenditure must show as per paragraph 3 (1) that at least 15 per cent of the total project cost will be assessed&rdquo;.  Does that mean 15 per cent of the site purchase cost, 15 per cent of the contract to purchase price or 15 per cent of the total cost?  Will the Minister please clarify this?</P>
    <P>Questions have also been raised about the ambiguity of paragraph 1 (4) which says that the formal notification by the developer wishing to avail of the extension should include the following information: &ldquo;Planning permission reference number and date of issue&rdquo;.  Does this refer to the date of issue of the planning permission which must be included in the formal notification to be made by 3 February last to the appropriate authority? If so, all those last minute applications made on the basis of a tip-off could not have come through the due planning process.  Does it refer to the date of issue of the planning reference number?  We need clarification.</P>
    <P>These schemes have been very successful in stimulating construction activity and renewing rundown parts of designated towns and cities since their initial introduction in 1985 by a Fine Gael Minister for the Environment.  There must, however, be a level playing field so that all involved in the construction industry can avail of the incentives in this scheme in addition to the extra benefits from related budget announcements of accelerated capital allowances for industrial buildings, the doubling of the existing residential owner-occupier allowance for construction expenditure in the case of refurbishment work, rates relief on a sliding scale for ten years and the continuation of the allowance for rented residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>The old pals act is not acceptable, nor should those involved in the construction industry need to be card carrying members of a Fianna Fáil cumann to <Col N="386" /> benefit.  There is a lesson in this &mdash; the leopard does not change his spots.</P>

      <P>A new urban renewal scheme will come into effect on 1 August 1994.  In his Budget Statement and in the Principal Features the Minister for Finance announced certain transitional arrangements between the existing scheme and the new scheme. The purpose of the arrangements is to give a short extension to the closing date for the existing scheme in cases where developments were well advanced but which, for one reason or another, might not be in a position to make the 31 July 1994 closing date.  Specifically, the arrangements provided that where 15 per cent or more of the costs of a development project have been incurred in an existing designated area before budget day 26 January, as certified by the relevant local authority before 23 February 1994, on the basis of guidelines drawn up by my Department, the closing date for the existing scheme will be extended from 31 July 1994 to 31 December 1994.</P>
      <P>This is a generous gesture by Government towards people involved in development projects in designated areas.  The areas have been designated for some considerable time and the termination dates had been extended on a blanket basis before.</P>
      <P>In some cases, such as in Wexford, the original deadline of 31 May 1991 was extended to 31 May 1993 to 31 May 1994 and to 31 July 1994.  In the case of the five county boroughs the original deadline was as far back as 1989.  I do not think that anybody can justifiably claim that they were not given a fair crack of the whip in so far as the time constraints applying to the scheme are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure that there was an awareness of the transitional arrangements, my Department took out advertisements in the daily newspapers on 28 January 1994 informing people of the availability of the time extension and advising them to <Col N="387" /> contact their local authority for certification.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment wrote to local authorities on 27 January 1994 asking that they ensure developers who may need to avail of the extension were contacted and advised of the procedures and giving the local authorities guidelines to assist in the certification procedure.</P>

      <P>The local authorities could issue a certificate to developers where they were satisfied that at least 15 per cent of the total cost of a project was incurred before 26 January 1994 &mdash; in other words that there was a real and substantial commitment to the project.</P>
      <P>In assessing the total cost of a project the guidelines allowed a wide degree of latitude.  The total cost includes not only construction costs but all other development costs such as land acquisition costs, planning application fees, development charges and professional fees.  The one restriction we applied was that payment had to have been made; contracts to purchase were not acceptable.  Is it not reasonable to assume that a person who had not even purchased land by 26 February 1994 could justifiably claim that he had taken all reasonable steps to complete his scheme by the deadline of 31 July 1994?  I am satisfied that the wide interpretation of &ldquo;total cost&rdquo; which the guidelines permit is fair and allows those who had taken all reasonable steps to ensure completion of their development by 31 July 1994, a little extra time to cover unforeseen delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a prerequisite of the transitional arrangements that planning permission should have been received by budget day.  It is conceivable that an individual could have purchased land and applied for planning permission which, for one reason or another such as a <Col N="388" /> third party objection, may not have come through.  The guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment ask the developer to submit details of the development, including the planning permission reference, commencement notice under the Building Control Act, 1990, and, where relevant, photographs of the development in progress.  This is not to suggest that all these are a prerequisite to the issue of a certificate.  A developer whose planning permission had not yet come through, but who otherwise met the 15 per cent requirement is entitled to a certificate from the local authority and clearly would not be expected to produce documents he had not got.  The information requested was required merely to assist local authorities in reaching a decision.  The acid test to qualify for certification was whether 15 per cent of the cost had actually been incurred.</P>
    <P>I am entirely happy that the guidelines were clear and fair and allowed those who were fully committed to projects a short few months of grace to complete them.  I reject the inference in the Deputy's speech that there was sleight of hand or favouritism to certain individuals.  This area comes within my remit in the Department and I assure the House that there was no tip-off or that anyone had special advantages.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is present as I wish to stress the urgent need to complete the refurbishment scheme. Bray has had the misfortune of being used as an experimental ground in the past for various housing policies.  An architectural experiment in the provision of large numbers of low cost housing schemes in the early seventies did not work.  These were constructed to meet the housing need.  This poor quality, substandard housing accounted for 30 per <Col N="389" /> cent of the housing stock and it began to deteriorate almost as quickly as it was constructed.  It was a disaster and it is only now that it is being put right.</P>
      <P>For many years the residents of Oldcourt Estate had to live in the most atrocious conditions: ceilings were falling in, roofs were leaking and windows were falling out.  It was to the credit of a previous Minister for the Environment, a member of the Labour Party, that the work was started.  This is now nearing completion.  I hope that this Labour Party Minister of State will not fall at the last fence.</P>
      <P>One job remains to be done to make it a complete success, that is, the provision of front gardens.  The quality of life of the residents of the estate has improved enormously but there is a danger they will be short changed.  I am not talking here about any extras or luxuries but rather about what is the norm in any other council estate.  A front garden in Oldcourt Estate, albeit a small one, would make the difference between privacy and nuisance, between harassment and peace.  Because the residents do not have front gardens their privacy has been invaded by way of nuisance and noise.  The Minister of State has the power to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>The residents responded generously to the directive issued by the Department on tenant participation.  When the Department, not the council or the residents, stipulated that the residents should be consulted the residents put in a lot of hard work to come up with a proposal to meet their needs and which was feasible. It is vital that the Department does not fail them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Hazelwood Estate, I cannot over-emphasise the need to commence a refurbishment scheme.  Seventy-six houses are involved.  Again, roofs are leaking, the timber panels are rotting and the infamous Conserva heaters which gave rise to liability claims in Dublin are being used.  On this cold, dark, snowy night six families have no form of heating <Col N="390" /> while in another 12 houses the heating systems have reached a critical point and no spare parts are available.  It is vital to ensure that these people do not face another cold, harsh winter without the commencement of a refurbishment scheme.</P>
    <P>This is the area with the highest unemployment rate in Bray and the residents do not have the resources to deal with the problem, but there is a rich community spirit.  Again, they have responded to the request from the Department for tenant participation.  I wish to stress that we will let them down in their drive to develop a strong community spirit if we do not show the same generosity of spirit.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has an opportunity to follow through on the directive on tenant participation on these two estates in Bray.  I ask him to take this opportunity and respond by showing the same generosity of spirit that the tenants of those two estates have shown in relation to this desire to see co-operation and a partnership between the Department on the one hand and the tenants on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the estates mentioned by the Deputy I should like to say a few words about the remedial works schemes in general.  I want to make it clear that the management and maintenance of their rented dwellings are matters for the local authorities to be funded from their revenue resources.  The remedial works scheme was introduced to assist them in tackling major structural problems which, it was recognised, would put an undue strain on these resources. Eligible works include the refurbishment of dwellings built under &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; arrangements, pre-1940 dwellings in need of structural repairs, modern sanitary facilities and certain run-down urban estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of 1993 almost £100 million had been allocated to authorities to meet their expenditure on approved remedial scheme projects.  The 1994 provision of <Col N="391" /> £20.7 million &mdash; an increase of £3.5 million on the 1993 figure &mdash; is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to the scheme.  This allocation will enable work to be accelerated on the 70 projects which are underway throughout the country and will enable a number of additional projects to be designated for funding under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The 1994 capital allocations to individual authorities for the remedial works scheme and their other housing programmes are being considered in the Department and will be notified to the authorities as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Oldcourt Estate in Bray is one of the &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; estates which has been transformed with the assistance of remedial scheme funding.  The estate consists of 240 low-cost houses, built between 1973 and 1976.  The refurbishment work involves the provision of blockwork walls, pitched roofing, replacement of external doors and windows, improved heating systems and environmental works.</P>
    <P>Up to the end of 1993 almost £4.7 million had been allocated to Bray UDC to fund the Oldcourt project.  Work is now nearing completion and I understand that only seven houses remain to be done, together with landscaping and environment works.  Revised proposals from the urban district council for the landscape-environmental aspects of the project are under examination in my Department and I hope shortly to be in a position to notify the council of the extent to which these works will be eligible for funding under the scheme.  The Deputy may rest assured that the further capital required to fund approved work to this scheme will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>An application for funding under the scheme was received from Bray UDC in November 1993 in respect of the Hazelwood Estate.  The works proposed to the 78 houses involved include wall panel replacement, major roofing work, provision of chimneys where none exists, <Col N="392" /> replacement-improvement of existing heating systems and extensive environmental works, at a cost of about £1.6 million.  This application is being examined at present and a decision in the matter will be conveyed to the local authority as soon as possible.  Bray UDC received £325,000 under the bathrooms sub-programme to assist them to provide adequate sanitary facilities in rented dwellings which lacked them.</P>
    <P>The amount of public finance being expended on remedial work schemes in general is substantial.  It is essential that authorities take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the management and maintenance of their estates will protect their investment and that the benefits of the refurbishment continue in the longer term.  I assure the Deputy that the tenants in Bray will not be short-changed and that we will not fail to meet the case she has made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to thank you for allowing me to raise the matter of the enormous dissatisfaction with the orthodontic service in South Tipperary.  This is not due to the staffing in the county clinic in Clonmel but rather to the restructuring of the scheme by the South Eastern Health Board.  Parents are at the point of desperation, not knowing if or when orthodontic treatment will be available to their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second time in the past three years that I have raised this issue in this House and the numbers worried about the delay in obtaining orthodontic treatment continue to increase.  I have had no success in getting information about when orthodontic treatment will be available to particular students.  This is frustrating for me but exasperating for the parents, who rightly feel obligated to have their children's teeth treated.  Children often suffer severe embarrassment and sometimes personality problems <Col N="393" /> because of protruding or crooked teeth. This can hinder a young person's overall development and interfere with school performance.</P>
    <P>I have given details of just one girl in South Tipperary who has been on the waiting list for four years.  She is now in fifth year and she and her parents are desperately worried about whether she will receive orthodontic treatment before she completes second level education. She is just one of many in this situation. This is unacceptable and unfair.  When I contacted the health board in regard to this student I could not get any information as to when treatment would be available.</P>
    <P>The last time I raised this in the House I was told that the delay was due to the lack of an X-ray machine.  That has been provided, but now there seems to be some other problem.  I cannot understand why there is no information about how many are on the waiting list and whether a student will be seen in three months, in six months or within a year.  The health board should be able to give some idea of when the service will be available and that would relieve parents of some of the frustration.  Because of the lack of any guarantee from the clinic that orthodontic treatment will be provided, I have seen parents who cannot afford to do so resort to trying to provide private treatment, and we all know how expensive such treatment is.  It is unfair that any parent should be put in such a situation. I cannot understand why we cannot be told how many are on the waiting list, where a student is placed on the waiting list and when the treatment will be available. The lack of information is totally frustrating.  The problem is compounded by the fact that I, as a public representative, cannot get the information either.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply in the hope that he can give some explanation. Most important, a directive should issue to health boards to tell people how long they must wait for this <Col N="394" /> service.  Above all, I hope the Minister can give me an assurance that the orthodontic service for people on the waiting list in South Tipperary will be up and running and that there will be some cut in the waiting time over the next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of orthodontic treatment to persons from the South Tipperary area is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board.  I have obtained information from the South Eastern Health Board regarding this case.  The board have informed me that an appointment will issue to this person next week to attend the regional orthodontic unit to begin treatment within the next two months.</P>
      <P>Children requiring attention are categorised according to the severity of their condition.  The most urgent cases, or category 1 &mdash; for example, cleft palate &mdash; are treated immediately.  Other categories are dealt with in order of severity and in the order in which they are placed on the waiting list.  Category 2 cases can have a severe functional handicap such as a marked overbite or overjet relationship of the teeth and jaws, while category 3 cases are non-handicapping and have a lesser need for treatment.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic treatment can take from 18 months to two years to complete and according as treatments are completed new cases are brought into treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past few years special additional allocations have been provided to the South Eastern Health Board specifically for the development of their orthodontic services.  A full time consultant orthodontist has been employed by the South Eastern Health Board since 1992.  Facilities for the consultant orthodontist have been provided at Waterford Regional Hospital and will come on stream in April this year.  Part of the consultant orthodontist's role will be to train health board dental surgeons to sub consultant-secondary care level and in <Col N="395" /> this way significant improvements can be made in the number of treatments carried out.  To this end, initially, two dental surgeons will be working with the consultant orthodontist on secondary care cases in the Waterford Regional Hospital facilities.  This will result in more cases receiving treatment.  Additional dental surgeons will be appointed to the orthodontic team as resources allow over the Programme for Government.  In addition, health board dentists work in each community care area carrying out simple orthodontic work under the supervision of the consultant orthodontist.</P>
    <P>The Minister is committed to the development of the health board orthodontic services as outlined in the Programme for Government.  As part of an overall development of the dental services it is the Minister's intention to provide additional resources to the health boards to develop their primary and secondary care orthodontic services.  In 1993 the Minister provided £85,000 to the South Eastern Health Board for developments in the orthodontic services and he will be providing additional moneys this year for the further development of the services through the employment and training of health dental surgeons to carry out orthodontic work at secondary and primary care levels under the direction of the consultant orthodontist.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Deputy's request, I am somewhat surprised at the lack of communication from the South-Eastern Health Board in regard to people on waiting lists etc.  I will communicate tomorrow with the chief executive officer of the health board and request that performance be improved in relation to communicating that type of information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity of raising this matter.  A serious problem has arisen at the De La Salle post primary school, <Col N="396" /> Dundalk, in the last couple of days.  On this day last week I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister in relation to the proposed extension to this school and was told that the Department had had discussions with the school authorities with a view to establishing the appropriate range of accommodation to be provided and that the Department was currently awaiting documentation from the school in that regard.  I was satisfied with that reply.</P>
      <P>However, over the last weekend a letter has been received by about 50 parents of children on the list for this school, some since they were three or four years of age.  The letter is from the principal of the school and states:</P>
      <P>For the past four years we have been trying to cope with increasing numbers. Each year we are pressed to accept extra classes while negotiating with the Department of Education for extra accommodation.  We expected to have an extension completed for September, 1993, but it did not materialise. Our intake depends upon suitable accommodation and since it does not seem to be in the estimates for the next few years we must review our planned intake.  We regret, therefore, that we cannot now offer your son a place for 1994 for the reasons outlined.</P>
      <P>I understand that the school will be taking in about 120 pupils in September 1994 but that there is an overflow of about 50.  Obviously, the parents are extremely worried.  Many were taken completely unawares by this situation.  I raised this matter around this time last year when I received information that there would be a problem in the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and, perhaps 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the matter in a general way because a number of parents in the Dundalk area indicated it had been brought to their attention.  The Minister gave a comprehensive reply which I <Col N="397" /> accepted.  She indicated her inspectors had not received information to the effect that there would be any severe difficulties. If I recall correctly, she stated that applications had not been received from any of the schools in the post primary sector for extra accommodation at that time.  She indicated that if problems arose she would be sympathetic to the demands of the school authorities and, if necessary, provide either temporary or permanent accommodation.  The Minister indicated that the hump in the population graph at entry to post primary level, which has manifested itself throughout the country, is a problem about which planners were aware and that some action would have to be taken, not only in Dundalk, but in other major urban areas.  It is too late for the pupils who have been refused entry to the De La Salle College in Dundalk to go to other schools in the town seeking places because they are full.  Even the vocational school in Dundalk may be full.  I understand that a number of the 50 pupils who were refused entry to the De La Salle college are seeking places in the vocational school and other schools in the town, but I doubt if they will be successful.</P>
    <P>A meeting of concerned parents will take place tomorrow night to establish why their children have been singled out in this way.  Therefore, will the Minister take on board the demand of the school management and principal for accommodation, temporary or permanent, as soon as possible?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give brief details of the background of this case.</P>
      <P>De La Salle College, Dundalk is a post primary school with an enrolment in the 1993-94 school year of 713 boys.  There is co-operation between De La Salle and the neighbouring St. Louis girls' secondary school.  Accommodation at the school consists of traditional buildings and two prefabricated classrooms which the Department grant-aided in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application for additional accommodation was received in April 1992 and <Col N="398" /> following discussions it was agreed to give an all-in contribution of £40,000 towards the provision of four general prefabricated classrooms, six temporary classrooms in all.</P>
    <P>The school authorities did not take up the Department's offer and in September 1992 submitted an alternative proposal for covering in the courtyard, which would provide a general purpose area, and building four classrooms and toilets on top.  For a variety of technical reasons this proposal was not acceptable to the Department.  However, the school proceeded with covering in the courtyard without further discussion with the Department.</P>
    <P>A further application for grant-aid towards the provision of additional, more extensive, facilities at the school was submitted to the Department by the school authorities in May 1993.  This development was planned and tenders invited without any reference to or approval by the Department.  The lowest tender for the work is £222,000.</P>
    <P>Officials from the planning and building unit visited the school in December 1992 to discuss the most suitable course of action.  It was agreed that a fundamental examination of the school's curricular policy for the future was required.  To this end, an educational worksheet was sent to the principal to be completed in consultation with the senior inspector from the building unit.  Following receipt of the completed form in January 1994, further discussions took place with the school authorities.  Additional information on future curricular structure is now awaited.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance that the most appropriate range of accommodation to be provided at De La Salle, Dundalk, is established at this stage.  It is with this in mind that my officials have had such lengthy discussions with the school authorities.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that, when received, the documentation from the school will be processed without delay. A decision on the matter will be conveyed to the school authorities as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> I will take on board the points made by Deputy Ahern and Deputy Bell earlier about the overall availability of places in schools in the Dundalk area so that we will be able to respond as soon as we receive the documentation from the De La Salle College.  Also, because of the blip in the population graph to which the <Col N="400" /> Deputy referred, we must sort out the problem temporarily, not only in Dundalk but in other areas.  I undertake to keep in contact with the Deputies of that constituency.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 23 February 1994.</P>

      <P>The group's proposals are relevant to my Department's activities in the context of the local development programme for disadvantaged areas.  The group has been advised, in this context, that the best way to advance the proposal is through the Dublin inner city partnership, a structure specifically designed to act as the catalyst for local development.</P>
      <P>In considering whether to allocate funding to a project of this nature a number of factors have to be taken into account including the long term capacity of a group to undertake and manage such a project.</P>

      <P>The Irish Aid Strategy Plan, which was published in July of last year, has already taken account of the very welcome developments in South Africa.  It undertook to provide increased assistance to South Africa, in particular for education and the improvement of the public administration.  Work has begun on drawing up a programme of co-operation aimed at underpinning the democratic process in that country by promoting development.  The recent establishment of an embassy in Pretoria will facilitate the identification of suitable projects for Irish funding.</P>
      <P>The commitment to assist South Africa will not be made at the expense of the poorer countries in sub-Saharan Africa, in particular the priority countries which are recipients of Irish aid.  Three of the four countries concerned &mdash; Lesotho, Zambia and Tanzania &mdash; are neighbours, or near neighbours of South Africa.  They are understandably apprehensive that the lifting of sanctions could see foreign aid and investment diverted to South Africa. These countries may be assured that Ireland will not be changing the basic focus of its aid policy as a result of the democratisation of South Africa.  Over the next four years we plan to increase assistance to the existing priority countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the expansion of the aid programme means that we can increase the number of priority countries.  Co-operation agreements are currently being negotiated with Ethiopia and Uganda, under which programmes of assistance will be implemented.  This will bring the number of priority countries to six. <Col N="217" /> Ireland will also be participating in a rehabilitation programme for Mozambique, which has suffered directly as a result of South African policy and which should gain greatly from a peaceful solution in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The Irish Aid Advisory Committee, which I appointed last November, will have an important role to play in advising me on policy aspects of Ireland's aid programme and matters relating to development co-operation in general.  The committee has met four times since being established.  I am looking forward to working closely with the Committee and will take full account of its views in the implementation of the aid programme.</P>

      <P>Negotiations are under way between the Irish Government and European Commission officials on the proposals set out in the National Development Plan with a view to agreeing the community support framework which will set out investment proposals to be financed by the EU Structural Funds.  As the formal negotiations have just commenced it is difficult to assess the timing of their completion.  I am hopeful that these can be concluded over the next month or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These negotiations relate only to Structural Funds programmes that are included in the community support framework and not to Community initiative programmes to which a separate procedure applies.  The European Commission has only recently finalised its guidelines for Community initiatives for the period 1994 to 1999.  These will now be the subject of consultation with <Col N="218" /> the European Parliament and a management committee of the member states.  It is likely to be the summer before the Commission formally adopts any initiatives.</P>

      <P>While the live register is considered to be a good short term indicator of unemployment trends, the official estimates of the true level of unemployment are based on the annual labour force survey which is carried out in April and May of each year.  This survey forms part of a simultaneous EU-wide survey which uses a common procedure and methodology.</P>
      <P>The estimated number of persons unemployed in April/May 1993 &mdash; according to the 1993 preliminary labour force survey estimates &mdash; was 230,000. This compares with live register totals of 294,600 and 289,900 at the end of April and May, respectively.  The labour force survey data are derived from the responses of those surveyed as to their usual economic status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is not correct in stating that unemployment is rising: last month was the first January on record in which the live register fell.  Measured in seasonally <Col N="219" /> adjusted terms, the fall was over 6,000.  Furthermore, the live register at end-January last was over 5,000 lower than at end-January 1993.  The live register forecast underlying this year's budget is for a fall as compared with the 1993 average and a fall in unemployment based on the wider labour force survey definitions is also expected.  Since the budget the Programme for Competitiveness and Work has been published which provides for faster employment growth than was anticipated in the National Development Plan and which therefore will provide a significant number of extra job opportunities for the unemployed.</P>

      <P>In line with Government tax policy in recent years which has concentrated on reducing the tax burden on income earners generally using the proceeds of base broadening and the curtailment of reliefs, the tax allowance for incapacitated children has not been increased.  Policy in this regard has also taken account of the position that the income tax code is not the appropriate vehicle for making provision for the special needs of incapacitated taxpayers; this is better done through the direct expenditure system, where benefit can be more accurately related to need and where trained personnel are available to assess the level of need in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents of incapacitated children, in common with other taxpayers will of course have benefited from the tax policy pursued since 1987 which has resulted in the standard rate being reduced from 35 <Col N="220" /> per cent to 27 per cent and the top rate from 58 per cent to 48 per cent while the standard band has been widened by 74 per cent.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the extension from 1 January 1994 of tax clearance to farmers applying for headage payments from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The Deputy will recall that this was originally intended to take place in 1992.  However, a deferment was granted to allow certain farmers more time to obtain a tax reference number.</P>
      <P>In the interim the tax clearance procedures have been adapted specifically to accommodate those farmers who would not have an RSI number for tax purposes but who are receiving a means-tested social welfare payment.  In future such applicants for headage payments will be able to quote the RSI number under which the social welfare payments are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1 January, 1994, all applicants <Col N="221" /> for headage payments of £500 or more have to comply with the same tax clearance procedures which already apply to all other applicants for public grants and subsidies.  The general tax clearance scheme has for many years applied to applications for public grants of £500 or more and I have no proposal at present to change this threshold.

      <P>The extent of poverty in Ireland was the subject of a research study carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1987 which was partially funded by my Department.  The ESRI study made use of a number of different approaches to this question.  In particular, it estimated the number of people living in households with incomes below certain arbitrarily chosen percentages &mdash; 40 per cent, 50 per cent and 60 per cent &mdash; of average incomes adjusted for household size.  It must be stressed, however, that nowhere in that, nor in any other study, is there a definitive conclusion as to what constitutes a &ldquo;poverty line&rdquo; or how many people live in poverty.</P>
      <P>As this survey is now seven years old, in this year's budget I provided £150,000 towards the funding of a new ESRI study on poverty in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The period since 1987 has seen substantial increases in the real level of all weekly social welfare payments.  In this year's budget, I provided for a 3 per cent increase in rates of payment across the board with effect from July.  This increase applies to personal rates, adult dependant and child dependant allowances. Over 822,000 people and their 627,000 dependants will benefit, including pensioners, widows, lone parents and people who are out of work because of illness or unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the general 3 per cent increase, a further 3 per cent increase (or £1.60 a week) will be given to all short term weekly payments in order to bring them up to the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rates.  The short term payments in question are disability benefit, unemployment benefit, injury benefit, short term unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance and unemployability supplement. One hundred and eighty-five thousand people will benefit.  This means that all social welfare rates will have reached the <Col N="226" /> priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I am also introducing further significant improvements for child benefit in line with the overall approach of developing child benefit as the main element of child income support.  This year, the higher rate of £23 will be increased to £25 and, in addition, is being applied to the third and subsequent children.  The new payments structure from next September will be £20 for each of the first two children and £25 for each thereafter.</P>
    <P>While the primary function of social welfare continues to be the provision of an income for those who, through illness, unemployment or old age, are unable to support themselves or their families, an adequate and efficient income maintenance system cannot, of itself, be regarded as a complete response to the needs of those most at risk of poverty. The 1987 study shows that the greatest single factor which places families at risk of poverty is unemployment.  Over the years, I have introduced a range of measures aimed at helping the long term unemployed to reintegrate into the workforce. These initiatives include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a back to work allowance aimed at additional employment in indigenous industries and the voluntary-community sectors,</P>
    <P>&mdash;second-chance education opportunities for those who wish to undertake second and third level courses,</P>
    <P>&mdash;special incentives for unemployed people in disadvantaged areas who wish to participate in paid employment, self-employment and the Community Employment Development Programme,</P>
    <P>&mdash;allowing unemployed people to work with voluntary groups,</P>
    <P>&mdash;introduction of successive PRSI exemption schemes for employers who take on new employees from the live register.  </P>

      <P>Prior to October 1988, there were two fuel schemes in operation with two separate eligibility criteria.  The urban fuel scheme was administered by the local authorities and people in receipt of a contributory or a non-contributory widow's pension had an automatic entitlement to a fuel allowance regardless of their income from the date of application. Under the national fuel scheme, which was administered by the health boards, an applicant had to be in receipt of a long term social welfare or health board payment and had to satisfy a means test before a fuel allowance could be paid.</P>
      <P>The urban and national fuel schemes were amalgamated in October, 1988 and I introduced a single fuel scheme.</P>
      <P>A widow who had been in receipt of a fuel allowance under the urban fuel scheme but failed to meet the qualifying conditions under the new Department of Social Welfare fuel scheme retained her entitlement to the fuel allowance under a &ldquo;saver&rdquo; clause, for as long as her circumstances remained as they were prior to the amalgamation of the two schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dublin area, there are approximately 12,900 widows in receipt of the fuel allowance who previously qualified <Col N="228" /> for the allowance under the old urban fuel scheme.</P>

The projects encourage local community and voluntary groups to develop partnerships with each other and statutory agencies in their area with a view to tackling the problems faced by the community.</P>
      <P>An additional £700,000 has been provided in the budget for the community development programme, bringing the overall allocation in 1994 to £2.2 million. With the additional resources which have been made available this year, I intend to extend the programme to a number of new areas around the country.  A number of proposals for new projects have been received in my Department, including one for Finglas West.  These proposals are being examined at present.  My intention is that decisions in relation to new areas for inclusion in the programme will be announced in the coming months.  The Deputy can take it that the Finglas West area will receive every consideration in this years extension of the community development programme.</P>

    <P>On 31 December 1984 the Registrar of Friendly Societies appointed two inspectors to examine and report on the affairs of the Society, including an in-depth examination of the books and records of the Society.  The Garda, in consultation with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, decided to await the results of this examination. The inspectors produced their first interim report on 25 January 1985, their second interim report on 5 October <Col N="232" /> 1988 and their final report on 31 January 1990.  The second interim report of the Inspectors was forwarded by the Registrar of Friendly Societies to the Director of Public Prosecutions who in turn referred it to the Garda Commissioner. The Garda investigation proper commenced in January 1989 and was completed in July 1991 when a comprehensive file was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question was arrested on 8 March 1990 and after being detained under the provisions of Section 4, Criminal Justice Act, 1984 was released without charge.</P>
    <P>Charges, as directed by the Director of Public Prosecutions and drafted by Senior Counsel, were preferred on 10 December 1992 when the person concerned was again arrested and brought before the Courts.</P>
    <P>An application was lodged in the High Court seeking an Order prohibiting the Circuit Court from proceeding further with the hearing of the charges against the defendant.  The application was based upon the contention that an excessive delay on the part of the prosecution in bringing these charges to a hearing resulted, in the applicant being prejudiced in the preparation and presentation of his defence and denied his constitutional right to fair and speedy trial. The High Court judgement which was delivered on 21 January 1994 found in favour of the applicant.</P>
    <P>On 15 February 1994 the Director of Public Prosecutions directed the Chief State Solicitor to appeal the decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court. The hearing of this appeal is awaited</P>

      <P>In my reply to Dáil Question No. 292 of 26 January 1993, columns 1538-1539 of the Official Report, I explained that an Employment Regulation Order, which applies to all catering establishments in areas outside of Dublin, contains a provision governing the disbursement of service charges, where levied, in such establishments. There is no provision in the Employment Regulation Order in relation to the disbursement of tips as such.  I also explained in my reply to Dáil Question No. 292 that a new Joint Labour Committee for the catering industry in Dublin is preparing proposals for an Employment Regulation Order.</P>
      <P>Employment Regulation Orders are drawn up by Joint Labour Committees which consist of representatives of employers and employees in the relevant industries.  These Orders are varied from time to time.  Any proposals to make provisions in relation to tips and other gratuities in either the existing Order for the catering industry, which applies outside Dublin, or in the new Order which will apply in Dublin, may be submitted to the Joint Labour Committees concerned. It would be a matter for each Committee to consider whether or not these provisions should be incorporated in the Order concerned.</P>

    <P>A survey carried out by the Motor <Col N="235" /> Insurance Advisory Board in 1992 showed that the average premium per registered vehicle in Ireland; the United Kingdom; France and Finland, respectively was IR£401; IR£268; IR£266; and IR£130.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Claims-Awards</i>
    </P>
    <P>Statistics available to my Department show that the average cost of motor insurance claims for 1991 in Ireland and the United Kingdom was IR£4,205 and IR£995 respectively (in 1992 prices).  For 1992 the comparative figures were £4,574 for Ireland and £1,003 for the UK.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out by the Irish Insurance Federation at the request of my Department showed that personal injury compensation represented 67 per cent of the total cost of 1991 motor insurance claims in Ireland, although in terms of numbers of claims personal injury claims equate to about 35 per cent of claims, a survey by independent consultants confirmed similar statistics for 1992.  It has further been established that the pain and suffering element represents about 75 per cent of the total cost of personal injury compensation.</P>
    <P>The total number of employer's liability claims in 1982 was 6,990 at an average cost of £9,818 (1992 prices) per claim. This compares with a total of 8,823 claims in 1992 (there has been a drop in claim numbers since 1989) at an average cost of £10,556 per claim.  The total cost of employer's liability claims for 1992 is now put at £93,131,000.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the involvement of a company (details supplied) in the cable television sector of this country, considering the links between this company and Independent Newspapers Limited, constitutes too much control of media interests in this country; and the regulatory framework, if any, he intends to put in place to prevent over-dominance of Irish media interests.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal activity of the company referred to by the Deputy is the provision of cable and multi-channel distributions system (MDS) television services in its franchised areas rather than participation in television broadcasting. Cable and MDS services are subject to regulation by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  The company is owned 50 per cent each by Indepdenent Newspapers plc and a consortium of US investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that a recent proposal by the company to further increase its interests in the cable and MDS sector was referred by me to the Competition Authority for futher investigation. In the event, because the proposal did not proceed the investigation by the Competition Authority did not take place.  Notwithstanding this, my decision to refer the proposal to the Competition Authority was indicative of my <Col N="237" /> concern that further control of this sector by the company might not be desirable with regard to the common good.</P>
    <P>The proposal was notified to me by the parties in accordance with the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Newspapers) Order, 1979.  This Order provides that any proposed merger or take-over involving enterprises at least one of which is engaged in the printing and/or publication of one or more newspapers must be notified to me.  On receipt of a proposal I have the power to:</P>
    <P>&mdash;refer the proposal to the Competition Authority for investigation,</P>
    <P>&mdash;on receipt of the report of the Competition Authority I may either allow the proposal to proceed, or if I think the exigencies of the common good so warrant, may make an Order prohibiting a notified proposal either absolutely or except on conditions.  </P>
    <P>In addition, the Competition Act, 1991 states that any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in trade for any goods or services in the State or in a substantial part of the State is prohibited.  Any person aggrieved as a consequence of an abuse of a dominant position has a right of action in the Courts for relief including damages.</P>
    <P>I have recently received Government approval for the introduction in the Oireachtas of a Bill to amend the Competition Act to provide the Competition Authority with additional powers of enforcement.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that the present regulatory system when taken with the proposed amendment to the Competition Act, can deal satisfactorily with the concerns raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Aid is not available from the EU to deal with flooding of county roads or its consequences.</P>
      <P>In view, however, of the serious damage to roads in many areas, arising from bad weather, the Government increased by £15 million the funds available from the Exchequer for nonnational roads bringing the overall Exchequer provision for their maintenance and improvement in 1994 to a record £101.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have now notified local authorities of their discretionary block grant allocations (which account for £67.8 million of the funds available this year for nonnational roads) and it is primarily a <Col N="239" /> matter for each authority to determine the programme of works to be carried out with these grants.  I will be allocating the balance of the funds available, £33.6 million, as specific grants for improvement projects put forward by local authorities on the basis of their contribution to employment and economic activity in industry, tourism, fisheries, forestry, and rural development, including agriculture.</P>

      <P>The person named has already been paid an advance under the suckler cow premium scheme based on the number of suckler cows on which he received payment for 1992. Payment of the balance due under that scheme cannot be made until all applications received from him in the course of 1993 have been processed.  This is necessary to ensure compliance with EU regulations covering in particular the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density. An advance was also paid to him in respect of his 1993 cattle headage scheme.  His 1993 cattle headage application is being processed further and any balance due will be paid in the near future.  His 1993 sheep headage grants were paid in full on 17 November 1993. He has been paid the first and second instalments under the 1993 ewe premium scheme and it is anticipated that the final instalment will be paid in March-April 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 to 103 inclusive together.  From contact with the Deputy's office I understand that all of these questions relate to the ewe premium scheme.</P>
      <P>Ewe premium entitlement is payable in accordance with EU regulations. Expenditure on the scheme by my Department is reimbursed from the EU on the third working day of the second month following month of expenditure. Normally payments are made by way of three instalments fixed by the European Commission.  In 1993 it was decided that the first and second instalments could be paid together.  In Ireland's case payment of the first and second instalment commenced on 27 July 1993.  On Friday last, I announced that the European Commission has now fixed the third, i.e. final instalment of the 1993 ewe premium and following publication of that decision in the Official Journal of the EU, payment will be made to flockowners.  It is anticipated that payment of the final instalment will commence in late March.</P>
      <P>To date 48,888 payments of first and second instalments have been made amounting to £70 million on foot of 52,684 applications.  The estimated value of the third instalment is £50 million.  The position in regard to payment of the first and second instalments in Counties Wicklow, Carlow and Kildare is as follows:</P>

    <P>Some of the cases awaiting payment of the first and second instalment are the subject of queries.  Flockowners who were first time applicants for the ewe premium scheme in either 1992 or 1993 did not have an automatic entitlement to <Col N="252" /> ewe premium quota and payment of the first and second instalment could not issue in these cases.  Flockowners in this category were entitled to apply for quota to the national reserve.  The vast majority of applications to the reserve have now been processed and full ewe premium entitlement will be paid to successful applicants when the final instalment is being paid.</P>

      <P>In general, the scheme of grants under the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes are designed to bridge the difference between the slaughter price and the cost of an equivalent replacement animal.  The prices being paid for reactor animals by meat factories are relatively good and this together with the appropriate reactor grant equates to a reasonable level of compensation.  Where herds are restricted, additional grant payments may be made in the form of income supplement or depopulation grants as appropriate. Reactor grant rates are reviewed on an ongoing basis having regard to developments in market values.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission must use compulsory procedures to divide the commonage at Dooaghs because some of the shareholders are objecting to its division.  The Land Commission is awaiting the final result of a High Court case involving the compulsory division of a commonage in County Mayo.  Judgment was given in the Mayo case in March 1992 when the court directed that certain matters in that case should be clarified before returning the case to the court.  Among these was the question of compliance with planning legislation.  Subsequently the matter was referred to An Bord Pleanála.  Last year the decision of An Bord Pleanála was appealed to the High Court.  This second appeal must be concluded before the initial appeal is resolved.  This is the first referral of the legislation used in the compulsory division of commonages to the High Court and the Land Commission will reassess the procedures it uses in these cases in the light of the judgment of the court.  In the meantime if the shareholders reach agreement on the question of the division of the commonage they should apply to their local Land Commission office for assistance in dividing the commonage using voluntary procedures.</P>

Based on the acreage which he declared on his sheep headage application form he already received under the cattle headage scheme the maximum grants which could <Col N="258" /> be paid under all headage schemes. However, he did declare a bigger acreage on his 1993 area aid application which, if correct, will qualify him for a balancing payment under the 1993 sheep headage.

Payment is in respect of each animal removed from herds in which there are 100 animals or less on the date of restriction. Animals in transient herds or in feed lots do not qualify for income supplement.</P>
      <P>By its nature this is not an open-ended scheme and the parameters are devised to make the best use of limited resources and to focus the assistance towards herd-owners who are most in need of it.  The normal reactor animal grant is of course payable for each reactor removed.  A change in the income supplement arrangement is not envisaged at present.</P>

      <P>I should point out that, at the date of first setting up as a full-time farmer, an applicant for installation aid must be under 35 years of age.  However, the scheme allows the applicant up to two years from the date of setting up to attain the appropriate labour input &mdash; one man work unit &mdash; and educational qualifications. In these circumstances the applicant could be up to 36 years of age and still qualify for the scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> Regarding MMDS, I should say that I am not aware of any current difficulties caused by the system giving rise to reception problems in West Waterford.  I understand, however, that some two months ago the Multi-Channel TV franchisee for West Waterford made some changes to the cable systems in the towns of Lismore and Tallow in order to increase the number of available TV channels.  Difficulties with the frequency settings for the new channels resulted in interference to the reception of RTE 1 and Network 2.  I am informed that these difficulties were overcome and I am not aware of any problems with TV reception now in the area.</P>
    <P>These difficulties arose out of the operation of the cable systems in the areas concerned and accordingly have no bearing on the MMDS system.  I am satisfied that MMDS is eminently suitable for the purpose of which it was intended &mdash; to provide high quality multi-channel viewing choice to the non-cabled areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent visit by EC officials to Aer Lingus was made on foot of a formal Commission Decision of 2 February, 1994 requiring Aer Lingus to submit to an investigation pursuant to Article 11 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3975/87 of 14 December, 1987.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3975/87 lays down the procedure for the application of the rules on competition to undertakings in the air transport sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> The regulation provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Commission, acting on receipt of a complaint or on its own initiative, shall initiate procedures to terminate any infringement of Articles 85.1 or 86 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Regulation empowers the Commission to undertake investigations into undertakings and associations of undertakings. The Commission may, at its discretion, request the competent authorities of the member states concerned to undertake the investigations. In the case referred to by the Deputy, the Commission did not request the Irish authorities to undertake an investigation.</P>
    <P>As required by the Council Regulation, a Commission official advised my Department in advance of the visit that the Commission, acting on foot of complaints made to it by Ryanair and by British Midlands, had adopted a formal decision requiring Aer Lingus to submit to an investigation (i) for the purpose of establishing its pricing strategy on certain routes between Dublin and UK provincial points and its competitive strategy towards Ryanair in general and on those routes in particular; and (ii) for the purpose of establishing its pricing strategy on the Dublin-London route and its competitive strategy towards British Midlands in general and on the Dublin-London route in particular.</P>
    <P>The Commission confirmed in writing to my Department on 3 February, 1994 that it intended to carry out an inspection on the premises of Aer Lingus under Regulation No. 3975/87 and that the Department was obliged by Community Law to avoid giving the company any advance warning of the proposed inspection.</P>
    <P>The Commission acts, when necessary in applying competition policy rules throughout the Community.  There are regular proceedings where alleged infringements happen and subsequent action, where appropriate, by the Commission is recorded in the Official Journal and, indeed, by the media.  There are no grounds for believing that Ireland is being particularly targeted.</P>

    <P>The attached tabular statement outlines the total full-time enrolment, where available, in third-level courses in each aided institution for the period 1990-91 &mdash; 1993-94 inclusive.  The Deputy will note that between 1990-91 and 1992-93 enrolments in Aided Third Level Institutions increased by 18.7 per cent, in line with the increasing demand for third level places generally and the additional provision which my Department has made to meet that demand.</P>

      <P>A total of 1,187 candidates sat for music examinations in the leaving certificate examinations in June 1993.  This represented an increase of approximately 13 per cent on the previous year.  A total of 8,941 candidates, which represents an increase of approximately 2 per cent took music in the junior certificate examination in 1993.</P>
      <P>The corresponding figures for Latin in 1993 examinations were: leaving certificate: 285, representing a decrease of 8 per cent on the previous year; junior certificate: 891, representing an increase of 4.5 per cent on the previous year.</P>

      <P>The education and training needs <Col N="279" /> of handicapped children are responded to in a number of ways depending on the particular capacities of the children concerned and the degree of handicap involved.  For many such children participation in courses at ordinary second-level schools is the most appropriate response.</P>
      <P>In the case of more serious handicaps, special schools are provided to cater for children up to the age of 18 years.  Such schools are dedicated to the needs of pupils with a particular category of handicap and are fully resourced to provide the special supports which are required in the particular situations involved.</P>
      <P>In the context of the 1994 budget allocation, I have arranged for a number of initiatives to address the needs of handicapped children of post-primary age.  I have allocated an additional sum of £2 million to provide for a dramatically increased level of capitation funding for handicapped children.</P>
      <P>Additional teaching posts are also being allocated to the special education area.  I have provided £50,000, for the first time, for the provision of equipment for children with special needs attending ordinary second-level schools throughout the country.  I have arranged that a major pilot project will commence this year on the development of appropriate curricula for children with special needs of second-level school-going age.</P>
      <P>These measures will allow for the provision of special teaching supports to schools dealing with handicapped children, including those up to 18 years of age.  It is not possible to say how much of the additional provision will be allocated to schools in the Cork region.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 172 together.  A major building project has been approved by my Department for this school.  However, it has not been possible to include it in the 1994 national school capital programme because of other demands deemed to be of a higher priority which had to take precedence.  It will continue to be considered for inclusion in the programme in the light of available resources and other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 163 together.  Senior cycle provides students with a degree of choice as regards the subjects they study and the level at which they study them.  The choice students make is generally informed by their expectations and aspirations. European continental languages are perceived by students to be very important in the area of career choice and to enhance employment prospects. German and French enjoy an economic prestige that attracts Irish students.  The kind of motivation that this attraction creates is not replicated in the case of Irish which is not normally associated with economic utility.</P>
      <P>The special position of Irish as a national language and a vehicle for much of what is distinctive in our culture is, of necessity, reflected in the course objectives and structures as well as in the assessment criteria that apply at leaving certificate level.</P>
      <P>The grades awarded reflect candidates' performance in relation to those objectives and criteria.  The number of native speakers of Irish is too small a percentage of the leaving certificate cohort to have a significant effect on the overall result. Many of the primary Gaelscoileanna were formed in recent years and their past pupils have not yet sat the leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>Continental languages are taught nowadays with a strongly functional bias to equip young people with the linguistic skills to interact with native speakers of the languages and to survive in the natural environment of those languages.  This functional approach is reflected in the certificate examination in modern languages.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate therefore in the case of French, German, Spanish and Italian that a set of course objectives and examination criteria should apply that differ substantially from those of Irish.  Naturally a different outcome in terms of results must be expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> The number of A grades awarded in French is an accurate reflection of how candidates performed according to the objectives of the course and of the examination in that subject.</P>
    <P>Course objectives and examination criteria in the case of Irish and of the four modern languages on the leaving certificate programme are currently under review by the NCCA.</P>

      <P>The role of the resource teacher is to act in support of ordinary teaching staff in dealing with the special needs of children with disabilities attending ordinary classes.</P>
      <P>The resource teacher model is a recent innovation and is used in appropriate circumstances, as an alternative to the visiting teacher service which is also targeted on supporting children with disabilities in ordinary schools.</P>
      <P>At present, 12 resource teacher posts are in place throughout the country.  One such teacher is based in County Kerry and serves ten schools in the Cahirciveen area.</P>
      <P>I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review as part of a broader commitment to appoint additional support teachers in the special education area in the coming year.  The needs of all schools, including schools in the Dingle Peninsula, will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The educational needs of children with specific learning disability, sometimes referred to as dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. In addition the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>

      <P>A sum of £6 million has been included in the National Development Plan for capital developments at DCU.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that the Government in 1985 approved an investment programme of £23 million for a Phase II development at DCU.  Subsequently, however, the Government in 1987 deferred this project along with a number of other third level capital projects.</P>
      <P>The total Exchequer capital allocation to DCU under the Department of Education Vote for the period 1983-1993 amounted to £22 million (excluding Exchequer funding made available by other Departments).  A high proportion of this allocation was targeted at accommodating the expansion in student numbers since 1985.  DCU's current student stock is 3,642 (full-time day) while the 1985 Phase II Plan provided for a student stock of 3,800</P>
      <P>Further capital investment outside of the recently announced National Development Plan will be considered on an individual project basis and in the light of the outcome of the study which is at present being undertaken by the Higher Education Authority on the future development of the higher education sector in Ireland.</P>
