Now that the Government has started making announcements outside the House about changes in the family home tax, will the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, who are both in the House, agree that they would be better off, politically and from every other point of view, to drop these proposals altogether and not to dig the hole any deeper?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I agree with Deputy John Bruton, many of us do not have an opportunity to again contribute to this debate because we have already spoken.  Indeed the Minister and Tánaiste have already spoken.  It would be helpful to the many concerned citizens if we could have a clear statement of the intentions of the Government, and not the daft suggestion by the Minister of State who wants to further penalise PAYE taxpayers. What about the other people?</P>

      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton is in possession and he has some 15 minutes left of the time available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be most appropriate to start with a quotation from the Minister for Finance in his budget speech.  When referring to last year's budget he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a second, major, step in the implementation of the strategy for economic and employment growth which lies at the heart of the Programme <Col N="1143" /> for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>We would have to classify the Minister for Finance as the great Don Quixote of economic reform.  He is great at casting aside his crumpled armour, donning his golden shirt and expressing his wild ambitions to attack every windmill. When it comes down to real change that can produce economic progress his effort is sorely wanting.  He has no problem in expressing his ambition.  If one refers to last year's budget one will see evidence of that.  He announced, with great flourish, that we would have a jobs fund.  This was to be a multi million pound fund to carve out a new direction for economic progress and job creation.  We have not heard one word since the 1993 budget about that jobs fund.  It vanished into thin air like the mists on a spring morning.</P>
    <P>Equally, we heard the Minister promise in his budget speech that 9,000 extra jobs would be created in the building and construction industry during 1993 as a result of the Governments new leap forward of economic investment.  A Cheann Comhairle, you will know what happened to the building and construction industry in 1993.  That industry suffered the most severe decline in several years and lost 6,000 jobs.  In 1993 the Government collected from the taxpayer an extra £950 million, in the name of its employment strategy, and received from the European Union in excess of £1,000 million to fuel a so-called economic leap forward. Instead we had a dismal performance from the Irish economy in 1993.</P>
    <P>The Minister likes to pride himself on his ambition to reform our tax code, but let us look at his efforts to date.  The 1 per cent income levy was the most anomalous tax ever imposed in this country.  Thanks to the efforts of the trade union movement and the Opposition parties we succeeded in getting the Minister to withdraw that tax.  The 2 per cent probate tax, introduced last year, extended to unemployed families who would inherit their parents home.  They <Col N="1144" /> were expected to pay perhaps £1,000 for their inheritance.  How can an unemployed family pay that amount of money? This was a dismal tax and I am glad the Minister has started the process of dismantling it.  His third great innovation was the imposition of the 10 per cent DIRT tax on deposit accounts.  This year he makes great virtue of the need to shift economic resources away from safe havens of investment into job creation and forgets about the 10 per cent DIRT tax.  He reserved the lowest tax rates for people who take no risks, who sit on investment accounts, while people struggling to create employment in the service sector bear 40 per cent tax on their profits, 21 per cent VAT on produce sold to consumers and 21 per cent PRSI on the workers they employ.  The reality is that many service employers are just glorified revenue collectors.  For every pound spend in a typical shop in the service sector the Government takes 60p, and there is little left to keep either the business or the worker in operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who boasts that he is protecting the interests of Dublin, is presiding over a situation where not only do we have this insidious residential property tax but a decision that 4,000 jobs should be taken out of Dublin and transferred to other parts of the country, despite the fact that unemployment in Dublin is now higher than in the rest of the country.  The Government has presided over a 30 per cent decline in Dublin's industrial base.  That is the reality of what it is to live and work in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister say this morning that the residential property tax reforms would be made more fair and that there is no question of this being the thin edge of the wedge.  I would like to quote what the Minister for Finance said on 29 January 1992 &mdash; Official Report, column 371 &mdash; when he lowered the thresholds:</P>
    <P>The thresholds will be indexed in future years in the usual manner... The new levels of these thresholds will continue to ensure that only those properties which are at the upper end <Col N="1145" /> of the property market will be subject to the tax.</P>
    <P>How hollow those words were in the budget of 1992.  The Minister is trying to tell the public today that although he misled them in 1992 he now means what he says.  He is a great bed convert, claiming he will not sin again.  The record speaks for itself.  The promise in today's newspapers was made previously and it proved hollow.</P>
    <P>I do not need to rehearse the inequities of the residential property tax.  I ask the Taoiseach to listen to his own councillors in Dublin Corporation who would be more eloquent than I on the inequity of taking account of the mortgage on that property, the inequity of totting up all household incomes regardless of whether those people can contribute to the tax, the inequity of Dublin's much higher house property values.  Even ordinary families will soon be in that margin.  The talk about indexing in future years and ironing out anomalies was hollow and the imposition of the 1 per cent levy was a serious blunder.  Let us go back to the drawing board and correct them.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the more serious issue of employment in this economy.  It is important to review what happened during the course of the last national plan and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> because later this week the Taoiseach will publish ambitious plans to illustrate how partnership will create the leap forward, how things will be transformed and how we will have EU money and things will never be the same. We shall hear once again that this Government is committed to employment. During the last national plan unemployment grew by 81,000, emigration, according to the Taoiseach's figures, increased by 98,000, 90,000 of whom were young people under the age of 25.  Long-term unemployment grew by 40,000 to an astonishing figure of 150,000 people, who have been out of work for more than a year and whose prospects for finding work is grim.  This occurred at a time when Ireland enjoyed the highest rate of economic growth in Europe and <Col N="1146" /> transfers of £1 billion per year from European funds.  Those transfers amounted to 11 per cent, cumulative, of GNP for the years 1989 to 1993.</P>
    <P>We achieved economic growth because we got transfers from Europe, but it is clear that Government policy proved incapable of transforming these transfers into real jobs growth.  The only thing that grew during the period of the national plan was Government spending which grew in excess of consumer prices by 5 per cent per year.  There was a relentless growth in spending but it did not trickle down to the unemployed or create new employment opportunities.  During the course of the national plan new industrial start-ups which were a core strategy of the plan, fell by 50 per cent as a direct consequence of the taxation policies pursued by the Government throughout that period.</P>
    <P>The Government continued its emphasis on foreign industry.  The amount of grant-aid during the period of the national plan available to a foreign industry meant that a foreign industry creating a job received 66 per cent more to create that job than an Irish firm.  What sort of strategy was that?  The policy was pursued in the name of national consensus and national partnership.  What has six years of consensus produced for the unemployed?  It has produced nothing, and any fair assessment would agree.</P>
    <P>There is a strange lethargy that condones the failure of the last national plan as if it was inevitable.  Because no one else is doing any better, we should not blame the Government which is doing its best.  Will the Taoiseach read a document called <i>Employment in Europe</i>, 1993, which shows Ireland's employment performance at the very bottom of the scale? Every other country is performing ahead of Ireland.  That is the most recent document on employment in Europe.  We received the lion's share of Structural and Cohesion Funds to transform our performance but we sank to the bottom of the league.  The Taoiseach must re-examine the policies being pursued.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is concentrated among young people here.  There are currently <Col N="1147" /> 84,000 unemployed people under the age of 25.  The rate is twice that of the rest of the population.  The number of children who left school without a qualification grew by 36 per cent and these children experience 62 per cent unemployment. What kind of blot on our record is that? This is the rate of unemployment among young people after 90,000 of them left the country during the course of the last national plan.</P>
    <P>We will hear ample talk from the Government about our high growth rate, our great balance of payments surplus, our low borrowing and our low inflation but behind these aggregates are the grim realities of economic life, unemployment, emigration, a decline in new business start-ups and districts of chronic disadvantage, particularly in the city of Dublin.  The inescapable conclusion is that our policies have failed to convert growth in output and wealth into economic growth that creates jobs.  I earnestly request the Taoiseach to look again at the serious flaws in the policies being pursued, the very inadequate response to the Culliton report which called for an end to the grant culture and a rationalisation of our industrial schemes.  The Taoiseach has given us 36 new grant-giving, form-filling bodies but this is not the way to deal with the serious challenge of creating employment in our economy.</P>

      <P>The budget this year was first and foremost about jobs.  In fact, it is more employment-orientated and pro-enterprise than any previous budget. There are an unprecedented 20 or more measures, designed to promote or support employment.</P>
      <P>The budget had three interconnected aims: to boost economic activity and employment creation; to begin in earnest a new phase of tax reform and to continue the development of an enlightened and caring social policy.</P>
      <P>We anticipate that the budget will boost economic activity and contribute to the creation of a net 21,000 new jobs in 1994, the largest increase in employment since 1989-90.  Since 1987 net employment increased by 56,000.  In putting 21,000 more people to work, we will not just have reserved the employment decline of the mid-1980s, we will have more people at work than at any time since the early 1950s.  The end-January figures, which show a large seasonally adjusted decrease on the live register of over 6,000, are the best in years.  Improving trends are beginning to assert themselves.</P>
      <P>This is an ambitious and progressive budget.  While most European countries have had to raise taxation to counter budget deficits, far above the Maastricht guidelines, we are virtually the only country to have stayed within the guidelines, while at the same time reducing taxes.</P>
      <P>Good economic and Financial management made an imaginative and innovative budget possible in 1994.  We are now able to translate our healthy economic data simultaneously into more jobs, better services and lower taxation, as well as a continuing decline in the debt burden.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer borrowing requirement continues to be under 3 per cent. The current budget deficit, once a major problem, will in 1994 be under 1 per cent of GNP.  The debt-GNP ratio was reduced from 127 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 100 per cent in 1992.  Devaluation caused a slight blip in the downward trend, which will resume this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> Ridiculous accusations have been made that the Government is embarked upon a policy of &ldquo;tax and spend&rdquo;.  Total Government expenditure was 52 per cent of GNP in 1986.  Public expenditure in 1994 remains more than 10 per cent lower of GNP, around 41 per cent, recent EC figures show that Ireland now has the lowest public expenditure as a percentage of GDP in the Union &mdash; so much for the allegation of higher and higher expenditure.</P>
    <P>The increase in current expenditure has, in fact, been on a declining trend since the Progressive Democrats resigned from office.  Current spending increased by 7.8 per cent in 1991, by 8 per cent in 1992, but under this Government increased by 7.3 per cent in 1993 and by 5.6 per cent in 1994, taking the public service pay deal just agreed into account. The underlying trend has been set in train by this partnership Government.  The underlying position is even better, because that increase includes once-off expenditure resulting from the tax amnesty. Opposition parties who believe we should cut expenditure faster might indicate their choices for cuts in services in health, education or social welfare.</P>
    <P>We have always aimed to spend less on unproductive debt servicing and more on worthwhile public services.  This shift is now occurring.  We have every intention of maintaining Government expenditure very well under control.</P>
    <P>Taxation was crushing during the mid-1980s, with a 1 per cent income levy, a 65 per cent top rate of tax, and a 35 per cent standard rate of VAT.  The Border regions were crucified by lack of competitiveness. We were very careful in this budget to keep indirect tax increase at a modest level, to prevent a recurrence. One of the key components in public expenditure is public service pay.  Failure to control public service pay was one of the principal causes of budget over runs in the past.</P>
    <P>The pay increases of around 8 per cent under the new programme over three years are comparable to the 7.5 per cent agreed under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> rather than the 10.75 <Col N="1150" /> per cent under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  We have capped the additional cost of any outstanding claims and those arising from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, at 3 per cent over three and a half years.  The era of large special pay increases is over.</P>
    <P>The budget helps to underlin the new programme, by ensuring that employees gain real wage increases, when nominal wage increases and tax reductions are combined.  I congratulate all the social partners on their achievement in reaching a draft agreement.  It reflects a shared conviction that this is the path to improved competitiveness, industrial peace and stability and balanced economic and social progress.  Social partnership is a better way of managing our affairs, despite right-wing criticisms from people who dislike national programmes because of an antipathy to trade unions. The central aim of the new programme is to increase the number of people at work and to reduce unemployment.  An important contribution to the programme came from the National Economic and Social Forum, which includes representatives of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The tax changes in the budget, which benefit low and middle income taxpayers, resume the process which I started in 1989 of reducing tax levels.  Our tax policy will alleviate the burden on workers with low incomes particularly those with families, and will raise the threshold for the higher rate.  The increase in personal allowances is the largest in ten years.  The standard tax band has been increased by nearly 7 per cent, far beyond indexation Those on lower incomes will benefit by exemption from health and employment levies amounting to 2.25 per cent.  This April, employees on less than £9,000 a year will notice a significant improvement in take-home pay.</P>
    <P>Higher income groups will benefit from the abolition of the 1 per cent levy and from the personal allowance and band changes.  We said the 1 per cent levy was temporary and we demonstrated it when circumstances improved.  It is easy to claim now that last year's levy was not <Col N="1151" /> necessary.  Ireland has an oversupply of hindsighted decision-makers.  The 1993 budget triggered a huge fall in interest rates.  The mortgage rate today is only about half what it was a year ago.  Overall, most taxpayers with mortgage gain substantially.</P>
    <P>We continued to recognise the needs of first-time house buyers, giving them 100 per cent mortgage interest relief for the first five years and exempting them from the <i>de minimis</i> reduction.  We also maintained the higher ceiling of £5,000 for a married couple.</P>
    <P>The residential property tax was introduced over ten years ago by a Fine Gael Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes.  In 1986, he abolished the tax allowance for children.  I reinstated it in 1990.  Who, then, was anti-family?  Where does the cap fit best?  In the late 1980s, Fianna Fáil recognised that the tax had a certain usefulness in dampening down inflationary pressures at the upper end of the property market, pressures which led to deep recession in the British economy.</P>
    <P>Higher income taxpayers stand to gain substantially from the budget changes taken as a whole.  Marginal relief on incomes up to £30,000, as well as child relief, will go some way towards mitigating the impact of the new thresholds for residential property tax on most taxpayers. The Government is prepared in the Finance Bill to look at possible anomalies in the extension of the tax that may arise in particular circumstances, as the Minister for Finance said yesterday.</P>
    <P>This Government will not reintroduce rates, which were found unconstitutional and iniquitous, and will continue to encourage the widest possible level of home ownership.  The reaction from the Opposition parties to the budget show that they have no serious commitment to tax reform.  Fine Gael's election manifesto states that in Government they &ldquo;will immediately go ahead with their comprehensive programme of action&rdquo;, set out in <i>Towards the Jobs Economy</i> in May 1992 which states on page 15:</P>
    <P>Tax cuts in work and enterprise will <Col N="1152" /> have to be funded... Among the areas, we shall be examining to fund this switch are... to raise more revenue from property taxes, and to define more strictly the terms on which tax allowances are granted.</P>
    <P>That last phrase means, in other words, curtailment of mortgage interest relief and VHI relief.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael planned in Government to raise more revenue from property taxes. What could that mean?  Does it mean a revival of the wealth tax, which exempted the family home or are they now saying that property tax does not include tax on household property; more inheritance tax on family farms and businesses; a land tax on farmers; a lot more from residential property tax or do Fine Gael intend to introduce a general property tax on all householders?  Logically, it must have been not just one but many of those things.  It is a fair bet that Fine Gael's proposals involved raising a great deal more than the extra £5 million this year from the residential property tax. My advice to Fine Gael is not to try to fool all the people all the time.</P>
    <P>The distasteful public spectacle of the main Opposition party enbracing a special interest group outside Leinster House, trying to whip up public resistance, runs directly counter to the political testment of former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  In his last speech as Taoiseach, delivered in this House on 19 December 1986, he warned that there needed to be a concerned stand against the demands of interest groups who played the parties in this House off against each other and who have promoted distortions in the tax code.  He said as reported at columns 3843-44, volume 370, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>If one party, through its leader or through a Front Bench representative, gives a particular group reason to believe that their claim for special benefits at the cost of the taxpayer will be met if only the group put their organised strength behind the party in question, then not alone is the public interest put in grave jeopardy, but our democracy <Col N="1153" /> is itself devalued....  We all know that it is wrong, desperately wrong to succumb to the kind of pressures that I have referred to.  As Leader of Fine Gael, I pledge my party to hold fast on these issues.</P>
    <P>Did Fine Gael hold fast to that pledge? No, it did not.  Regrettably, it is prepared to let democracy be devalued in the interest of short term political expediency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney stated on television last week that the Progressive Democrats had never advocated a property tax.  Yet, its 1988 policy document &ldquo;Employment, Enterprise and Tax Reform&rdquo; advocated the vital elimination of mortgage interest relief, leaving a miserable credit of £300 for a married taxpayer.  It also proposed to introduce a poll tax or local community charge on every household, other than those on social welfare.  It aimed to raise £125 million, or more than eight times what we expect to raise from the increase in residential property tax.</P>
    <P>During the review of the Programme for Government the Progressive Democrats produced another document looking for &ldquo;the radical elimination of tax reliefs and allowances&rdquo;, the abolition of the PRSI ceiling for employers and employees, which, by itself, would have a negative impact on middle class incomes, and the abolition of the PRSI allowance with the overall objective of reducing the top tax rate to 44 per cent.  It rings hollow for the Progressive Democrats to oppose any increase in the PRSI ceiling, when it wanted the ceiling abolished.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell once said the Progressive Democrats has to be radical or redundant.  It has obviously opted for redundancy.  A party that once claimed to be policy driven is now reduced to policy incoherence.  Its leader's claim that 40 per cent of households in Dublin have an income in excess of £25,000 and a house worth more than £75,000 is an example of such incoherence.  There are no statistics to back up this silly claim, made only to frighten people.</P>
    <P>It was extraordinary to listen to Deputy Rabbitte attack the extension of the residential <Col N="1154" /> property tax.  There used to be an old socialist saying that &ldquo;property is theft&rdquo;.  Now, as a new middle class revisionism takes over Democratic Left, it is a tax on property that is theft.</P>
    <P>This budget is a further instalment in tax reform, not the first step.  The introduction of self-assessment in the late 1980s was a major and very successful reform of the tax system, as was the reduction in excessively high tax rates when I was Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Our policy is to combine tax reform with an overall reduction of the tax burden.  A KPMG-SKC study published in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> ten days ago showed that the tax on take-home income of a married person with three children and a salary of £40,000 a year has dropped from 38 per cent of income in 1986-87 to 32 per cent in 1993-94.  If that represents increased taxation or war on the middle classes, I am sure they would like more and more of it.</P>
    <P>The Culliton and Moriarty reports and the Task Force on Services stressed that the priority must be to build up indigenous industry and small businesses, now the main source of new employment in Europe and America.  Business start-up rates are low in Ireland.  The budget, above all else, creates a better climate for small business.</P>
    <P>We reduced employers' PRSI to 9 per cent for those earning less than £173 per week.  This will help labour intensive industries, such as clothing and footwear, and numerous small commercial services. We are reducing the cost of finance to small business.  Providing £100 million of cheap European loans to business, at 3 per cent below the market rates, is a key measure.  We are alleviating VAT obligations on small firms through a substantial raising of the VAT threshold, and also through an easing of procedures. We have raised the company value ceiling for BES relief for an enterpreneur's investment in his or her company.  We are reducing capital gains tax on shares in unquoted companies, from 40 per cent to 27 per cent for shares held for five years.  We are increasing capital allowances for cars to a more realistic level. <Col N="1155" /> This will also give new confidence to the motor trade, a big employer.  We are improving the annual capital allowances for hotels to encourage tourism, a labour intensive industry.  We have eased the capital tax situation for family transfers of small businesses, and exempted spouses from probate tax.  We have made it more attractive to work in the family business, by extending the PAYE allowance to the children of proprietary directors and the self-employed.  We provided £100 million from the amnesty to pay off health board debts.  This will help solve the problem of late payments seriously affecting many small businesses.</P>
    <P>They are just ten ways in which the budget is helping business and jobs.  The Finance Bill will do more.</P>
    <P>The extra £15 million provided for county roads increases the total grant for their upkeep and improvement by a massive 36 per cent from £75 million in 1993 to £102 million in 1994.</P>
    <P>Construction will benefit, through the 9 per cent increase in the Public Capital Programme affecting the industry.  The budget added an extra £29 million, including large projects at Dublin Castle, and Collins Barracks.  Lower interest rates and the pick-up in economic activity will also help construction.</P>
    <P>We are deeply committed to urban renewal.  It has vastly improved our towns and cities, as well as stimulating new business. A further 12 towns are now included.  A new scheme in August will include a more targeted approach in our main cities, and accelerated allowances for industrial buildings, to promote inner city employment.  We are doubling the allowance for refurbishment work.  There is also an incentive to encourage people to live over business premises.  These measures represents part of a larger move over recent years to more enlightened planning policies.</P>
    <P>The budget benefits farmers also.  They have already enjoyed a 37 per cent income increase over the past two years. We have greatly eased probate tax and capital acquisitions tax, so that most <Col N="1156" /> family farms being handed on will incur no major tax liability.</P>
    <P>We are speeding up the payments of premia, an increasingly important part of farm income under CAP reform.  Those who employ workers on their farms will benefit from a reduction in PRSI.  Family members employed will now receive the PAYE allowance.  We are bringing a range of EU-backed schemes into effect such as early retirement, the installation aid, the agri-environment scheme, and improved forestry incentives.  Under the new national programme we are providing improved capital allowances for all farm buildings and additional funding for headage payments in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The budget complements measures in the National Development Plan aimed at unemployment.  It promotes the expansion of small indigenous enterprises and provides additional education, training and work experience for the unemployed to facilitate their ultimate re-integration into employment.</P>
    <P>Given better economic conditions foreseen for 1995 and thereafter we should be able to achieve under the new programme a net increase in employment of 20,000 a year.  We are also stepping up community employment, FÁS training and other vocational schemes from 56,000 to 71,000 this year and to 100,000 a year by the end of the programme.</P>
    <P>A feature of unemployment everywhere is that the number of long term unemployed does not decrease significantly, even in times of economic growth.  This reflects a combination of poor educational attainment and length of time out of the workforce.  People feeling that they might be less well off moving from welfare to employment or to training opportunity is also a factor.</P>
    <P>Community employment is a major feature of our drive to tackle unemployment, particularly long term unemployment. It builds on the experience of the social employment scheme, Teamwork and the community employment development programme operating in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> partnership areas.  Community <Col N="1157" /> employment will apply nationwide and will include up to 40,000 participants by the end of the year.  It incorporates on-the-job training and own-time training. In certain cases participants may be re-engaged by sponsors for periods in excess of one year.  It targets the older long term unemployed, with 25 per cent of places reserved for those over 45 and unemployed for three years or more.  All participants retain their secondary and other benefits.</P>
    <P>We can no longer sustain a situation where a large section of the population is not able to contribute productively to the community and are being relegated to the margin and to the end of the queue. Community employment gives people the opportunity to use and develop existing skills and restores a sense of pride in being part of the workforce again.  It should be the first step in a progression to better education, improved skills through training, to an end result of sustainable jobs or self-employment.  The budget provides for additional places in education and training.</P>
    <P>This is not a &ldquo;make work&rdquo; programme. Many laudable voluntary groups have operated SES, CEDP and Teamwork schemes with great benefit to participants and to communities served by these organisations.  There are many good projects waiting to be undertaken, including environmental, heritage, cultural and tourist improvements, and many badly needed improvements in all our local authority areas.  Community employment will have a particular focus on disadvantaged areas designated under the local development programme of the national plan.  It will serve as a building block in the re-integration of the unemployed into a more productive life in the community.</P>
    <P>A distinctive feature of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was a focus on an area-based response to long term unemployment.  In Tallaght, in April 1992, I stated my own commitment to this approach.  Ensuring that everyone is able to participate in the benefits of economic growth is now a core element of the national plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> I am happy to announce that another element of the local development programme has now been put in place with the designation by the Government of areas to be targeted under the programme. Tackling long term unemployment and disadvantage will happen through a concerted effort to bring about local socio-economic development.  The focus of each partnership is on local action to meet area needs by using the full range of services and incentives for employment, education, training, and economic development.  Twelve areas were chosen under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pilot initiative and, based on very satisfactory experience, the Government has now decided to expand the area-based approach to the pivotal element of the local development programme.</P>
    <P>In designating the areas, the Government focused on coherent areas characterised by long term unemployment, under-employment and social exclusion. The Government took careful note of the views of the National Economic and Social Forum.  Given differing circumstances, there will be a greater variety in the size of partnership and range of activities to be provided, and in the rate of progress towards the ultimate aim of a full partnership structure.  The 12 areas chosen as the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pilot areas will continue, with extensions to boundaries in some cases.  Eleven new urban areas will be included in the programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has also decided to designate ten disadvantaged rural areas to have the full benefits of the partnership structure.  Ultimately, these areas will benefit from the new LEADER programme now being negotiated with the European Union.  The exact boundaries of these areas are being decided following local consultation.  Underlining the central importance of this approach and my personal commitment to it, the local development programme and community employment in these areas will operate under my Department.</P>
    <P>This is also a socially caring and progressive budget.  For many years we have <Col N="1159" /> given general increases somewhat in excess of the expected rate of inflation. There are special increases to fulfil the Commission on Social Welfare recommendations. For the second year there is a targeted increase in child benefit, concentrated on the third and subsequent children.  Child benefit is a more equitable way of helping all families than the child tax allowance, which the Fine Gael Party abolished eight years ago.  As a contribution to equity, we are introducing a pension for widowers.</P>
    <P>There are many other social measures in the budget.  We have provided money for a further initiative on hospital waiting lists.  We have given extra funding for those with disability.  We have provided extra money for post-primary school building.  We have topped up resources for social housing, for remedial works, and for the special task force for the elderly to improve their living conditions. We have at last rectified the sense of injustice felt by former Irish Shipping employees.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other welcome features of the budget.  This partnership Government is continuing its vigorous support for cultural development.  The additional £1 million for the Arts Council brings funding to £13.25 million, more than the £12-£13 million committed in the programme for Government.  We have also given the go-ahead for the development of the National Museum at Collins Barracks to display stored collections.</P>
    <P>We are giving financial support to a number of bodies involved in North/South reconciliation and which organise holidays for children, such as Glencree, Iniskeel, Between, Children's Community Holiday Scheme and the Irish School of Ecumenics.  For many years these bodies have brought communities together and given children from the areas worst affected by the Troubles a real holiday.</P>
    <P>The year 1994 will see economic growth of 4 per cent to 5 per cent, buoyed by the lowest interest rates in 20 years and the lowest inflation rates in 30 years <Col N="1160" /> and more consumer spending.  The completion of a new National Agreement between the social partners, the first year of our National Development Plan, and this expansionary budget, that will benefit nearly 1 million people, will provide a framework for visible progress.  All those factors continue to increase the Government's determination to meet the challenge of creating more and more jobs for our people.</P>

      <P>Deputy Treacy will not be missed, but I am sorry to see Deputy Mattie Brennan go.  He made a huge impression in Europe, a much better splash than even the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>I sometimes wonder if there is any need for a Budget Statement because the contents of the budget are nowadays sometimes known weeks in advance.  This year's budget was no exception.  Two years ago, when the present Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, the new tax rates were known in advance and were announced on RTE radio on the morning of the budget.  As a Member of this House and as a Cabinet Minister, I always assumed that leaking of highly confidential information was a criminal offence and would be dealt with under the Official Secrets Act.  I still think that is the case, but it is being ignored by the authorities.  It is a shameful way to operate.  If the Official Secrets Act does not cover Ministers then it should be changed so that it does cover members of the Government.  The Budget Statement becomes irrelevant when the details are leaked in advance.  It is criminal for people to benefit by knowing the details in advance and to make a killing on the Stock Exchange, in property dealings and financial dealings of any kind.  It is a dangerous precedent that has been set in this House for the past two years at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell so much on the mechanisms and structures of the <Col N="1161" /> budget as on the manner in which it is perceived.  I want to deal also with the question of jobs and the lack of an approach in the budget conducive to reducing substantially our unemployment level.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be unkind to people, but if I am to tell the truth I must be.  The most nauseating spectacle I have witnessed in my 20 years as a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas was the moral cowardice shown by Government Deputies during the past two weeks in the way they ran scared in respect of the residential property tax issue.  I am speaking mainly about Dublin Deputies in that regard.  They have shown no backbone in relation to this issue.  It was not a question of whether the measure was correct but of whether it was politically popular.  Unfortunately, this House has become a forum where people frequently look over their shoulders and count votes in regard to certain issues and speak accordingly afterwards.  I recognise, of course, they must vote according to the party whip.  They size up the matter to ascertain if it is a vote loser or a vote gainer.  I have seen some despicable examples of cowardice in this House.  We need a more manly approach to all issues. The level of manliness or &ldquo;womanliness&rdquo;&mdash; I must include all genders or I will be berated &mdash; in this House has declined during the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Our forerunners in the Dáil of 1923 and subsequent years may not have been as highly educated or qualified as most Members of the House today, but they had backbone and principle.  I do not see much of that around nowadays.  An approximation of what I believe makes a politician of any standing is a person whose make-up consists of about 75 per cent &ldquo;bottle&rdquo;&mdash; it would be unparliamentary to use the other word &mdash; and 25 per cent ability.  That would equal commonsense, which means that people act according to their instincts and for the betterment of the country.  I am worried about the consequences of people running scared because they are afraid of losing votes on an issue.  Everybody in the country should be worried, too.  That <Col N="1162" /> is an unsavoury form of politics.  Is it any wonder that this House is regularly brought into disrepute and that the public are cynical about the activities of politicians? This happened to a lesser extent in the past week or two in respect of the two new county councils, namely, Dublin South and Fingal.  We heard members swearing they would not vote for service charges, that they would allow the council to be abolished before doing so.  Yet, yesterday they meekly voted in favour of service charges because they thought they could scare the Minister for the Environment, to whom credit is due for standing up to them and calling their bluff.  One of the most interesting radio programmes I heard recently was an interview with the chairman of Fingal County Council on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. He was asked why he did a U-turn and we were greeted with ten seconds of silence. He did not have an answer.  It is pitiful that elected representatives have not got the gumption or backbone to stand by decisions.  The future of democracy may not be as secure as we might believe.  God help Ireland when Dáil Deputies, whom people should be looking up to, MEPs and Euro candidates, who are supposed to be top rankers in politics here, run scared because an issue might be politically unpopular.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be better if many of our representatives had less education and more backbone, similar to those who represented this country in the 1920s and 1930s.  From an educational point of view the quality of Members of this House may be far greater than that of Members in the 1920s and 1930s, but the quality of Members today, when it comes to standing their ground in respect of unpopular issues, is pathetic.  A large number of Members of this House have a qualification.  I am a school teacher and there are many more school teachers in politics.  There are also many farmers, solicitors and doctors, highly qualified people, in politics.  However, high educational qualifications do not make good politicians.  We might be better off with a few dozen Paddy Sheehans and down <Col N="1163" /> to earth people in this House, as long as they have principles.</P>
    <P>As I said already, the reaction of Government Deputies to an issue which might be politically unpopular was nauseating. I witnessed another nauseating spectacle in this House approximately eight months ago which made me lose faith in the sincerity of people.  The public elect many candidates nowadays because they are supposed to be feminists and represent a certain constituency.  Last June criminal justice legislation relating to the legislation of homosexual acts was introduced in this House and a number of sections of the legislation imposed increased penalties on prostitutes for prostitution and the running of brothels. Those penalties affect probably the most unfortunate element of our society.  At the time I stated that I did not believe it was correct to introduce such measures under the Criminal Justice Bill.  Not alone was I greeted with silence and antagonism, but Members seemed to disappear as if I had the plague.  Where are the people who are elected to defend the rights of the underprivileged?</P>
    <P>A few months ago I wrote to the Council for the Status of Women asking if it made a submission to the Minister for Justice to defend that most unfortunate section of our society, but I did not even get a reply.  One of the most unfortunate groups in society were effectively let go to hell by some representatives who were elected on the basis of promising to represent that group.  Other supposedly interested bodies and movements, mainly middle class, tend to label associating with such a group as &ldquo;dirty&rdquo;.  That view is blatant hypocrisy.  Some Deputies in my party were of the opinion that I would be crucified for advocating that instead of pilloring unfortunate elements of society such as prostitutes, prostitution and brothels should be legalised.  My constituency, like that of the Acting Chairman, is mainly rural and my constituents are mainly conservative.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that my constituents supported my view.  That unfortunate <Col N="1164" /> group need support and it is hypocritical to pretend otherwise.</P>
    <P>The public are much more discerning and intelligent than politicians give them credit for.  They see through hypocrites. A politician might consider a man they meet in their local pub to be thick but he could teach many Deputies lessons in common sense and principle.  Many people get fed up dealing with people who have no principles, they despair and turn to drink.  I do not blame them because of what I saw in the House during the past year, particularly in regard to episodes eight months ago and in the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>The practice of counting votes and Deputies deciding how they will react is dangerous because they will cave into pressure groups who now have the more respectable name of interest groups. Pressure groups may lobby Deputies on the run up to a general election and claim they can deliver 500 votes if Deputies back them on a particular issue, such as itinerant halting sites.  There is a poor future for this country if politicians can be bought by pressure groups.  Such practices challenge the relevance of this House and if the right type of people are not elected it will become more and more irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I see no improvement in the performance of this House despite the debate on Dáil reform in March last year, the establishment of the committee system and televising the Dáil.  Because of the committee system we are enacting more legislation but it is not being implemented.  The Wildlife Act, 1976, was one of the most complicated Bills to pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was approximately one inch thick but I am sure that less than 2 per cent of that legislation was implemented.  It dealt with the protection of wildlife, habitats and so on.  One or two wildlife rangers were appointed in each county but most of the provisions of the Act were not implemented.  The manner in which it was treated is indicative of much of the legislation passed in this House.  We do not seem to have the will to follow through the legislation and <Col N="1165" /> implement it.  I am not impressed by people telling us that we passed twice as much legislation here this year than ever before due to the establishment of the committee system.  The public &mdash; and Deputies &mdash; are interested in the implementation of legislation.</P>
    <P>The advent of televising the Dáil has proved interesting although it has led to stupidity.  I have not stood in this part of the Chamber for some time, I generally sit in the back row.  I am not one of the celluloid stars of the RTE television era. I am told I do not smile enough.  I probably do not wear glamorous clothes or get my hair styled by David Marshall. What happens in this House does not just affect Dublin 2.  The area where I am standing is of prime importance.  The television cameras can zone in on Deputies on the Front or back benches and they will be viewed by their constituents, an appearance on Oireachtas Report is as important as a Deputy tabling 25 questions on the Order Paper or making a two hour speech every week the Dáil sits.  It is important for Deputies to get in the picture.  People will say they saw you on television last night, that you looked great and were wearing a lovely tie.  It is a great pity &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo; was dropped.  Perhaps Gerry Stembridge and Dermot Morgan would give the boys such a lashing that they would not retain their posts on the Front Benches and would have to retreat to the back benches.  The Acting Chairman is also in a disadvantaged position but I am in it of my own free will.  The television of the Dáil has become a charade.  It would be better if we had live coverage of some Dáil proceedings, not necessarily of debates of this kind.  The Dáil debate has become irrelevant.  I will not give details of facts and figures and blind Deputies with percentages of what our party promised and what the Government parties promised.  I am speaking about the nittygritty of what makes this House irrelevant. Three Deputies are present for this debate, four including the Acting Chairman.</P>

      <P>For many debates only two Deputies are present which highlights the irrelevance of Dáil debates.  The public are fed up with debates in this House as they have heard it all before.  Some, Dáil proceedings, particularly Question Time and the more interesting debates, should be broadcast live.  RTE will have to be more discerning in respect of its television and radio coverage.  It tries to keep everybody happy.  It reports that Joe Bloggs spoke on a particular Bill regardless of whether his contribution is relevant.  Its intentions are good but it is not serving the public interests.  It must separate the wheat from the chaff and I hope it will be more discerning in regard to its coverage of Dáil proceedings in future.  I understand that in certain public places these people are called &ldquo;posers&rdquo;. There are also the prima donnas &mdash; I am talking about highly educated people. Some of us are graduates, but one of these people has been known to preface her remarks to committees by saying: &ldquo;I would like to let you know I am a practising lawyer&rdquo;.  I am a practising politician and that is as far as it goes.  There are enough prudes around without my zoning in on any particular one.  Practising politicians is what we need here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question which I am sure we all ask is, who runs this country?  One gets the impression, particularly at budget time, that the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Minister for Finance and the Cabinet are running the country, but I have my doubts.  I sometimes think that a traffic warden or a garda has much more power than any Dáil Deputy, and sometimes more than some Ministers, depending on the strength of the Minister concerned and the way in which he imposes his will, personality and character on his brief in the Department he controls.  Power is more centred in the Department of Finance than it is in the Government.  I am sure that sounds shocking to members of the public.  We often get the impression that the strings are being pulled by senior <Col N="1167" /> officials in the various Departments, particularly Finance.</P>
    <P>Power is based to a considerable extent not just within the senior echelons of Government Departments but in State and semi-State bodies, the great untouchables. If I ask a question in this House about a State or semi-State body, whether it be CIE, Telecom Éireann, An Post, Aer Lingus or whatever, the relevant Minister will tell me, &ldquo;It is not a matter for me or my Department, it is a matter for the body concerned&rdquo;.  We as politicians have as little influence on those bodies as we have on the man in the moon.  It is about time we had more influence over State bodies, what they do and how they spend their money.  If that was the case the disasters that occurred in companies such as Aer Lingus might not have occurred.</P>
    <P>An Oireachtas Joint Committee was set up to examine the affairs of State bodies, but I do not believe that committee has the time or the professional back-up to investigate these bodies. Because of the make-up of committees it could take two, three, four or five years before they get around to examining a specific State body.  If this committee was on its toes and was informed would we have experienced the massive scandals that arose in the Sugar Company and Telecom Éireann?</P>
    <P>These State bodies are monstrosities and their lack of accountability and reporting back to this House is a disgrace. They act as if they are independent empires, as if they are not to be touched, and that is not good enough.  Massive sums of public money are involved and these bodies should be answerable to the politicians, who in turn are answerable to the public.  However, this is not the case.  It is a case of remote control &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;remote&rdquo;.  These bodies have as much as, and perhaps more power than, any Government Department, and we are absolutely powerless when it comes to looking into their affairs.</P>
    <P>I wish to dwell on the position with regard to jobs and to ask a relevant question, <Col N="1168" /> but I know I will be shouted down and criticised if I do.  In terms of the national wage agreement, is the trade union movement more concerned with the unemployed or the employed?  I get the impression that its first obligation in all these negotiations is to the employed, and God help the unemployed.  Who will look after those 300,000 people?  What hope is there for them in the future?  I was surprised there was no reaction to a comment on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last week by the President of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, Dr. Pat Loughrey, in which he stated that instead of trying to reach a wage agreement if there was a wage freeze 50,000 jobs would be created.  I am talking about sustainable, productive jobs, not about training courses or temporary schemes.  I would like to ask the experts, the Government, is that true?  If so, there is something seriously wrong that we cannot discuss it.</P>
    <P>Is it true, as has been alleged to me, that massive overtime is being paid to employees in major State companies and that the unions support the paying of that overtime rather than the taking on of additional workers?  If overtime was eliminated as many as an extra 50,000 people could be taken on.  Could it be that in some of these State companies there are skilled people earling as much as £600, £700 and £800 a week while there are comparative skilled people on the unemployment register?  Another 50,000 could be taken off the live register through job-sharing.  The number of people on the live register could be halved if the will was there and if there was less protectionism.  I would say to the unemployed that they are getting a raw deal from the people they expect to represent them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution by the previous Deputy was thought-provoking and I agree with many of his sentiments. If politicians do not stand up and say what they believe in, the attacks that have been made on them, particularly in recent years, will continue.  All the U-turns that have been made have done <Col N="1169" /> nothing whatsoever for the profession of politics.  I hope in the future that people will give the facts and tell the truth instead of being opportunistic on all occasions.</P>
      <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;This budget forms part of a coherent medium term strategy designed to give a substantial impetus to sustainable employment in Ireland&rdquo;. That objective must continue to be the Government's foremost concern because on its success depends real and lasting social progress.  In 1987 Fianna Fáil inherited an economy whose finances were at an advanced stage of crisis.  Since then Fianna Fáil-led administrations have achieved a dramatic turn about through prudent management of the economy, including changes in the taxation system, the elimination of wasteful expenditure and the negotiation with the social partners of national agreements such as the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which have resulted in a stable economy and set the scene for the progress achieved over the past number of years.  Another agreement will shortly be announced.  Such an agreement is essential if we are to make the necessary progress in solving the problems facing our small economy, particularly the problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Between 1983-87 the Exchequer borrowing requirement ranged between 13 per cent and 16 per cent of GDP.  Since then the EBR has been reduced to 3 per cent or less.  It is essential that the Government continues to keep control of our EBR.  If in the years ahead we are to avoid a repeat of the situation which faced us in the mid-1980s we must keep control of our Exchequer borrowing requirement.  If this is not achieved debt servicing will gobble up the resources which are urgently required in many areas, for example, social welfare, tax reduction, job creation, road improvements and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in interest rates, the tax amnesty and improved tax compliance gave a great boost to the Exchequer coffers <Col N="1170" /> last year and gave the Minister an opportunity to make improvements, one which was not available to many Ministers in previous years.  I hope the hiccup in regard to interest rates in the United States during the past few days will not have an adverse effect on the Irish economy. The Minister had room for manoeuvre in this budget and the general consensus is that he introduced a well balanced budget.</P>
    <P>Accusations by Opposition speakers that the Government is a tax and spend Government are meaningless because every Government taxes and spends.  The important issue is the amount of tax deducted and collected and the way in which that tax is spent.  Under the Fine Gael-led coalition Government from 1983-87 VAT reached a rate of 35 per cent, income was increased to 65 per cent, there was a 1 per cent levy and huge increases in excise duties.  However, the expenditure of the tax collected under these measures did very little to improve social services or infrastructure.  During that time the national debt doubled from £12 billion to £24 billion which put an intolerable burden on succeeding administrations. The repayments on that debt seriously restricted the ability of succeeding Governments to make improvements in our economy.  Under Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1987 we have seen a reduction in income tax and VAT rates and a control on Government expenditure which has increased the confidence of investors and financial markets in our economy, a factor which is critical for future growth.</P>
    <P>This budget continues the improvements already made in the taxation system.  Tax allowances have again been increased and tax bands have been widened. The Government has shown its continued concern for the lower paid by increasing the tax exemption level, increasing allowances for children and reducing the marginal rate of taxation from 48 per cent to 40 per cent.  Over many years in my business I have heard concern expressed by the children of self-employed people, for example, proprietors and those engaged in farming, <Col N="1171" /> that they were not eligible for the £800 PAYE allowance even though they were working as hard or harder than many of those who were receiving this allowance. I am delighted the Minister has decided to grant that allowance to the children of the self-employed and proprietors.</P>
    <P>The probate tax was a source of great concern to the husband or wife of a deceased spouse.  This tax was unfair in that it did not take into account the fact that many of the surviving spouses did not have enough cash to pay the tax.  This tax which applied to small shops, small farms and other types of businesses, many of which were eking out a living, was responsible for putting many people out of business.  I am glad the Minister has decided to do away with the payment of a probate tax by the surviving spouse and has given some reliefs for agricultural land.</P>
    <P>As previously stated, job creation is of prime importance.  The Minister has taken note of the necessity to introduce some tax changes which will boost employment, for example, increasing the BES limit to £250,000 and extending the urban renewal scheme to many towns. However, I am disappointed that some of the towns in my part of the constituency, for example, Youghal and Cobh, which have been badly hit by unemployment in the past ten years and which need an incentive to develop&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the inclusion in the scheme of Mallow, a fine town with a high unemployment level which needs all the help it can get.  The Minister should review the urban renewal scheme and not limit it to towns of a certain size. Rather he should look at the needs of an area and include it in the BES if it deserves it.  Instead of including one or <Col N="1172" /> two towns in a constituency he should look at each case on its merits.</P>
      <P>The need to help new industry and businesses, particularly small enterprises, has been recognised by the Government as essential if it is to make inroads into reducing the high level of unemployment.  The measures taken in this regard include the setting up of the county enterprise boards to provide grant aid of up to £50,000 for new businesses which will employ up to 12 people.  I am aware that a number of small businesses set up in my constituency have been aided by the county enterprise boards and I am confident that many similar businesses will be established in the future.  The success of this scheme &mdash; I predict it will be an outstanding success &mdash; will depend to a large extent on the chief executive of the board, and if there is a bad chief executive the scheme may be a failure. Most of the chief executives with whom I have had dealings are doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>The provision of £100 million for low interest loans is timely and vital.  The provision of grants did help in the setting up of new industries but offering a loan is a better incentive to help people succeed. In many countries grants are not paid but low interest loans are offered to people wishing to set up businesses and they tend to have a greater degree of success.</P>
      <P>The reduction of PRSI by 25 per cent for lower paid workers and for industries such as the clothing industry is most welcome. I have had a number of letters already from people in the clothing industry and other low paid industries who are delighted that their costs have been reduced.  The removal of the employment and the training levy has also reduced employers' costs and these are welcome provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cash basis of accounting for VAT where turnover is less than £250,000 per annum is something which I demanded for many years because many businesses were burdened by having to pay their VAT on an invoice basis.  Payment by creditors at times can be very slow but the Revenue Commissioners are obliged <Col N="1173" /> to pursue VAT payments that are due and this places severe pressure on many businesses.  I am glad that some concession has been given in that area. Indeed, the increases in the exemption limits was long overdue.</P>
    <P>Tourism is one of our fastest growing industries and the £5 million for its promotion is most welcome.  In my area of east Cork, which was not a noted tourist area, there has been great development in the past two years, mainly due to the opening of the Midleton Heritage Centre, the Queenstown Project and Fota.  Approximately 500,000 people now visit the region and every assistance must be given to this service industry.</P>
    <P>The community employment programme announced recently is most welcome. The social employment scheme, which the programme will replace, played an important part in many community projects over the past number of years but some of the drawbacks of those schemes, such as the 12-months limit and the age limit of 25, will now be abolished. The three-year term limit and reduction of the age limit to 21 will be of great benefit to the people partaking in those programmes.</P>
    <P>Farming is an important sector in our society and despite remarks by some Deputies over the past week or two I have seen at first hand an increase in the tax take from farmers due to their increased incomes and a reduction in the capital allowance available to them. Where capital expenditure is incurred because of compulsory pollution/ environmental work, capital allowances up to 100 per cent should be available in the year of expenditure.  The two main concerns in the tax area expressed to me by the farming community over the past year related to probate tax and stamp duty.  I am glad that the issue of stamp duty is being addressed under the new agreement because a great burden was put on young farmers taking over land and who then would have been required to pay family settlements in addition to putting new investment into the farm.  The addition of stamp duty <Col N="1174" /> placed a great burden on these young farmers.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the additional funding for Teagasc.  This country needs a research institute peopled by scientists of high calibre to carry on research continuously in order to ensure that new products are developed to keep Ireland in the forefront of the world markets. Teagasc is highly regarded in the agri-scientific world and its development must be continued and supported.  The allocation of additional funding is an indication that the Government is thinking on those lines.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the budget is basically for people.  It is for those who are employed, it is for pensioners and it is for those who are dependent on social welfare payments.  The Government will give general increases of 3 per cent to social welfare beneficaries which is above the rate of inflation and, in addition, a further 3 per cent to short term weekly recipients in order to bring them up to the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  During my years in Dáil Éireann I have met many widowers who had to give up work in order to rear their young children but who had no pension whatsoever.  I am especially glad that the Minister, Deputy Woods, has extended social welfare insurance to cover widowers and this year 4,500 people will benefit with more people benefiting in each subsequent year.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Deputy Woods introduced a carer's allowance to give an income to carers who had no income. This year he has made a significant step forward by providing for the disregarding of £100 income in respect of working spouses which will mean an extra income for existing carers and will also bring hundreds more into the scheme.</P>
    <P>Money lending has been the scourage of our society and many people have been helped by the current projects to combat the problem.  The Minister is setting up additional projects in 1994 and these, together with the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other agencies, will help to rid our society of the scourge of money <Col N="1175" /> lending.  Other welcome developments in social welfare are the introduction of an adoptive development scheme and the increase in unemployment assistance for single persons living at home from £5 to £10.  This is a recognition of the dignity of those individuals.</P>
    <P>Under the free travel scheme the spouse of a person who has a free travel pass can travel with that person but if travelling alone has to pay.  However, there are cases where the spouse with the free travel pass is in hospital, the companion is required to travel to and from the hospital to visit and is obliged to pay for travel on those occasions.  I would like the Minister to consider those cases because in hardship cases the companion should also be afforded free travel.</P>
    <P>As a result of the budget allocation of £100 million, the Minister for Health will be in a position to clear the debts of the health boards and the other voluntary hospitals which may be in deficit.  It is important that statutory controls be introduced as soon as possible to ensure that wasteful spending is not incurred which may result in debts accruing again.</P>
    <P>On many occasions in the past requests for donors have appeared in the newspapers and have been heard on television and on radio.  At any one time there could be up to 150 patients awaiting transplants in this country.  I suggest that everyone should be considered a donor.  Of course, there would have to be an opt-out approach for those not wishing to participate in any donor programme.  This could be achieved several ways, for example, by the holding of a non-donor card, by ticking a box on one's income tax form, by registering on a countrywide non-donor urban registry or simply informing one's doctor or family that one did not wish to participate.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would request the Minister to consider granting a 10 per cent tax rate to the proposed industrial park at Cork Airport.  Shannon Free Airport Development Company has special concessions which attract industry to that area to the detriment of Cork, Waterford <Col N="1176" /> and other regions of the country.  The Financial Services Centre in Dublin was also granted special concessions and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this budget.  It is very significant in terms of taxation reform and specific employment initiatives which will assist the overall employment problem.  In many cases the Minister has signalled a fundamental shift in taxation in favour of lower paid employees.  We have had considerable debate in recent years on the relationship between our taxation structures and employment creation.  It has been generally agreed that at the lower end of the scale taxation has been too high for people on low incomes and for those on social welfare, the difference between coming off social welfare and taking up employment has not been sufficient to justify taking up that employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there was a clear need to deal with that tax wedge or poverty trap. This budget, more than most, moved significantly and progressively on that front. It should be pointed out that in excess of £350 million in a full year will be the cost of the taxation measures proposed in this budget which will alleviate the position of many low paid workers.  Indeed, in <Col N="1177" /> many ways this budget has been very favourably disposed towards lower paid workers.  That fact should be put on record.  I predict that people will begin to realise that only when the full impact of these taxation measures flow through to their pay packets.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise this matter of the relationship between taxation and employment growth.  Perhaps we have focused overly on this issue to the detriment of others which can also contribute to employment growth.  In my view there is not political consensus on taxation reform.  In 1983 we had a top rate of 65 per cent under the then Fine Gael led Government and a VAT rate as high as 35 per cent.  It will clearly be seen that there has been significant progress over the past ten years, particularly since 1987, in reducing taxation rates and widening the bands but there remains that lack of consensus on such measures and implementing tax reform.</P>
    <P>By and large, there is no great stomach on the part of our people for any more fundamental taxation reform.  We had the reaction to the residential property tax, which would affect quite a number of people and it would appear there would be absolute opposition to the reintroduction of rates.  There have been continuous nationwide campaigns in relation to service charges.  Therefore, it appears that any new taxes or significant moves to introduce new taxes would not meet political consensus in this House or throughout the country.  Let us be honest, we have had our share of hypocrisy on the part of other political parties in this House in relation to tax reform.  For many of them it is time to put up or shut up because they are not embracing any significant tax reforms.  Indeed, their stances now, as opposed to those they adopted while in Government, are quite different.  For example, for some time the Fine Gael Party proposed the abolition of employers' PRSI while in a recent policy document, it rescinded that and proposed an increase.  This budget does something practical in that regard, in that it reduces employers' PRSI for low-paid workers.  The figure is £173 which has <Col N="1178" /> been welcomed by many labour-intensive industries employing a significant number of low-paid workers.</P>
    <P>In my view the critical issue, apart from personal taxation and so on, is that we reduce the cost to an employer of recruiting staff.  If we take into consideration the entire gamut of legislation governing the recruitment of an employee, in addition to the taxation involved &mdash; I am referring to the financial commitments into which an employer must enter &mdash; we see there a significant obstacle to employment. In future budgets I would prefer that the emphasis be placed on the cost to the employer of recruiting an employee, particularly small businesses who may employ just two or three people.  For those concerned it will be a big decision to recruit one extra person because of the legislative and taxation constraints.  That is a very important issue.  The budgetary provisions move very significantly in the employment area.  Certainly taxation reform will help to an extent but it is not the only issue or obstacle to employment creation.</P>
    <P>We should focus more on industrial policy.  We have had the Culliton report and so on but it appears that we have not considered how to attract mobile investment here.  There was a regrettable attack on and condemnation of attracting overseas industries here in the early 1980s when we heard phrases such as do not bother bringing in multinationals as they will take the grants and run away after five years.  That type of over-simplistic view gained ground to the extent that we appeared to shift focus away from actively competing in order to attract mobile investment here.</P>
    <P>The recent NESC report on cost competitiveness in our economy indicates that overseas industries still play a critical role in our economy in terms of direct and indirect employment creation and of contributing to tax revenue.  I predict that we shall encounter a major problem in this respect in future years, not only in maintaining what we have in terms of overseas investment but in attracting more here.</P>
    <P>We must attack the issue of employment <Col N="1179" /> and our industrial policy within a European context.  We must approach our European partners and appeal for greater cohesion, greater benefits for peripheral member states.  We must remember that the most developed member states within the European Union offer the most attractive rates and financial incentives to industries from America, Japan, Asia and so on to locate in their countries to the detriment of us and other peripheral member states.  That is the critical issue because the gap between our incentive package and those of other member states has narrowed considerably over the past decade resulting in a significant decline, compared with the 1970s, in the amount and degree of investment here.  We have not focused on that area sufficiently.  It would be my hope that the new bodies under the aegis of the Industrial Development Authority will examine the packages we offer to overseas investors to ascertain whether we can improve them leading to a fresher, more innovative or aggressive approach to attract foreign industry here.  Such an exercise could well have a greater influence on forcing the European Union into developing strategic policies and a cohesive approach to industrial promotion in the case of peripheral member states.</P>
    <P>Due to our demographic base and other factors we will have a significant unemployment problem obtaining to the end of this decade, if not into the next century.  Therefore, I warmly welcome the improved budgetary measures within the context of the community employment development programme which will, hopefully, provide 30,000 places this year and, eventually 40,000.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we honour this commitment because many people would much prefer to participate in a community development employment programme than remain on the dole.  For far too long we have not considered the demoralising effect being on the dole can have on an individual.  The debate tends to focus on finance, how much we spend on social welfare; the old stereotype view that one is either in receipt of social welfare <Col N="1180" /> benefit or in employment, that there is nothing in between.  There is an inbetween. I know people who participated in schemes run by Cork Corporation whose lives were rescued socially and psychologically in terms of self-development through such participation.  That is a significant point.  There have been too many people knocking and undermining the value of such schemes.  Indeed, a whole range of activities and people have benefited significantly from the old social employment schemes; they are not just &ldquo;cleaning up the cemetery&rdquo; type schemes.  For example, practically all art organisations have benefited significantly, as have many educational establishments, by much creative work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome this budget, the most significant, progressive one on the taxation front for many years in that its provisions will significantly assist the lower paid. That fact should be placed on the record.  In addition it contains many strong employment measures, such as the community development employment programme, and the measures proposed to assist small businesses.</P>

      <P>The budget certainly will go down on record as one of the biggest botches in modern Irish politics. The Government with an historic 35-seat majority and some flexibility in relation to spending options had plenty of time to put together a credible, well through out economic incentive package to generate greater economic activity and make serious inroads into the unemployment crisis.  What we got instead was a budget that sought to be too clever by half.  The Minister and this administration, weighted down by advisers, programme managers and handlers of all kinds, attempted to be popular with everyone but ended up falling between all stools. <Col N="1181" /> Their &ldquo;one for everyone in the audience&rdquo; approach ended up, inevitably, satisfying hardly anybody.  Altogether we have witnessed a totally wasted opportunity to set some proper direction for the Irish economy and to provide real incentives for people to invest, to employ and to work harder.  These facts are graphically borne out by this week's <i>The Irish Times</i> opinion poll where no fewer than 89 per cent of those polled felt that their living standards would remain static or fall and a mere 7 per cent felt that their standard of living would actually improve.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly the reductions in employer's PRSI liabilities for workers on lower pay, up to a ceiling of £9,000 or £173 per week, is welcome.  It will improve the take home pay of people in that wage category and enhance the employment potential in sectors such as clothing and textiles.  However, it is absolutely stupid for a Government allegedly committed to tackling the unemployment crisis to levy an additional £550 per year for every worker employed at a wage of up to £25,000.  That is one aspect of the budget provisions that seems to have received little or no attention, even though it is a very serious matter, because the point at which employers' PRSI has to be levied will be increased by a gross figure of almost £5,000.  This is a blatantly anti-employment measure and it dramatically increases the cost of employing people in middle income ranges.  Already one major company, Guinness Ireland, has indicated that this will add £1 million to its payroll costs this year and many other employers have indicated that it will certainly prevent them from taking on extra workers.  There are many firms here, firms bigger than Guinness Ireland, employing highly skilled people at the wage rates common to Guinness Ireland. I have in mind many of the electronics and software companies in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appalling contrast between the Government's positive measure in relation to alleviating the payroll cost of workers earning less than £173 per week and the totally unacceptable imposition on workers at middle income levels highlights <Col N="1182" /> the lack of coherence and the lack of a thought-out strategy in this budget. These two measures simply do not hang together; they totally contradict one another.</P>
    <P>One of the most misleading contentions in relation to this year's budget is the attempt by various Government speakers to suggest that every taxpayer is better off.  The key to this subterfuge is to include in the calculation the abolition of the nefarious 1 per cent income levy introduced last year.  To classify the removal of this further levy on work as tax reform is preposterous.  This is a levy that should not have been introduced and indeed, was not necessary to the Exchequer last year.  Its removal was not only essential but constituted nothing more than restitution to the workers here, who will have paid out approximately £130 million by the end of the current tax year at the beginning of April, when the levy expires.  It is therefore utterly misleading to include the removal of the 1 per cent levy in estimating how taxpayers fare on foot of the various changes in the budget.</P>
    <P>More than anything else, the budget of 1994 represents an ill-thought out, anomalous and contradictory assault on people on middle incomes.  They are the people who are paying through the nose for everything and who have to carry the necessary burden of funding essential public services and the welfare entitlements of the elderly and the disadvantaged in our society.</P>
    <P>A central figure that gives one a clue as to what really happened in this budget and how we stand so far as personal taxtion and tax reform is concerned is the following.  I am quoting from the calculation on the budget of the RTE economists. After mentioning a small increase in personal allowance and a small extension of the standard rate band, which is only a fraction of what was obviously needed at this time, they say that the threshold at whch the higher tax rate becomes payable for a single person will now be £11,636 per annum.  In weekly terms that means that a single person <Col N="1183" /> earning £223 is liable for tax at the higher income tax rate.</P>
    <P>Ireland must be the only country in the world where the managing director earning £100,000 or more pays the same rate of tax as the typist in his office earning £223 per week.  Any country would regard that situation as lunacy.  It makes no sense that somebody in such a junior and relatively lowly paid position, earning such a small sum of money, pays the same rate of tax as the highest earner in the country.  If this is a step towards tax reform, God help us.  I want to lay emphasis on the figure of £223, because that is the figure at which people pay the top rate of tax.  That, above all else, is what is crucifying this country and leads to the levels of employment experienced here.  I emphasise the fact that nothing worth while has been done towards tax reform.  In that context I wish to speak briefly about the property tax, which has caused such a furore.</P>
    <P>I would have no objection, nor would my party, to some form of tax on assets that would help alleviate tax on work if it were being introduced at a time when a genuine effort was being made to reduce tax on work; but that is not the case.  An enormous increase in the residential property tax will affect not only the 10,000 or so extra homes the Minister for Finance talked about, but perhaps 50,000, 60,000 or 70,000 additional homes and families.  The residential property tax is being introduced at a time when an opportunity existed for tax reform, tax reduction and tax rationalisation; but that opportunity was cast aside.  The proof it was cast aside is that somebody earning £223 per week pays the top rate of tax in this country.  I repeat that that is lunacy.</P>
    <P>I have always said that it would be preferable if we had some form of levy or tax on unproductive assets.  What we have now is a tax on assets imposed on people with relatively low incomes where the net worth of their assets may be nil. It is no wonder that, at a time when there is no real relief on income tax, there should be an outcry that this should <Col N="1184" /> happen at the same time.  I can see why people regard that as unacceptable.  It is regrettable that the matter was handled in such a way that it seeks to make it even more difficult to have future reform of the taxation system.  There is a feeling here that assets are sacrosanct, when they should not be.  People feel so strongly about it because they are so heavily penalised on their income no matter how small it is.  They feel that this is a double assault on whatever limited assets they have &mdash; in net terms they may be almost nothing &mdash; and it is unacceptable.  The Government has planned this extremely badly and it has caused something of a public outcry.  I would contrast that with the lack of a public outcry about a far greater scandal in terms of taxation last year &mdash; the so-called tax amnesty.  That was, and I described it as such at the time, probably the most retrograde step taken by any Government in the history of this country in terms of equity between citizens and observance of the law and of one's obligations as a member of society. Is it not curious that the outcry on that was so muted compared with the outcry on something which the Minister for Finance claims will raise only £5 million?</P>
    <P>If we have time we would be well advised to analyse why the reaction is different to two things, one extremely serious and the other very much less serious.  The residential property tax, which seems to cause such a furore and which causes the Minister to backtrack from what he announced in the budget, is, at worst, political misjudgment.  It is not anything more than that.  It may be something with which one disagrees, but it is not any more than a matter of misjudgment. On the other hand, the amnesty was a disgrace and it has caused little or no furore.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance announced in today's papers that there will not be any further increases in the residential property tax and that the thresholds both for income and property value will be index-linked and that therefore things cannot get any worse in the future.  If anybody believes that, he is very naive indeed.  The residential property tax that <Col N="1185" /> existed in a rather mild form for the past ten years or so was index-linked up to about two years ago, but that did not prevent any Government from changing it.  An assertion by the Minister for Finance that he will not change it in the future is not binding either on him or on any future Government; there is no way that he can bind this House or any of his successors.  If that is his way to placate public anger, people would be very native to accept it, because it is a pathetic effort simply to dampen down the anger which people feel.</P>
    <P>It is only right that people should feel anger, but their anger is misdirected.  The thing people get most angry about &mdash; and this is one of the great quandaries of all in politics &mdash; is often the wrong thing. The property tax does not matter that much.  There are so many other things that matter, and the particular thing that matters here is that a single person pays the highest rate of tax at £223 per week. That is what people should be angry about and striving to change.  The reason we have extraordinary penal rates of personal taxation and taxation on work is that our expenditure is extraordinarily high.  The Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement went to great lengths to point out that the Government this year will remain within or below the Maastricht guideline on borrowing, which is 3 per cent of GDP.  What the Minister did not point out is that there are two guidelines strictly laid down under the Maastricht Treaty.  The other one, totally ignored in this country because it does not suit the Government, is that the public debt/GNP ratio should be 60 per cent.  Our figure in the past year has increased to 103 per cent, while a few years ago it was as low as 100 per cent. We are the second most heavily in debted country in the OECD.  Instead of aiming for the Masstricht guideline, which our partners in the years to come will insist on, we are going in the other direction. This is a very serious matter, caused by the incredibly high level of public expenditure, which appears to continue unabated.</P>
    <P>There is a far more significant matter <Col N="1186" /> in today's papers than the backtracking or U-turning of the Minister for Finance allegedly in regard to some aspects of the residential property tax.  A far more significant matter is an article in page six of <i>The Irish Times</i> by Mr. Jackie Gallagher, the industry and employment correspondent, drawing attention to what the headline calls &ldquo;Concessions to public sector in pay deal&rdquo;.  I would recommend that Members of this House read the article.  I do not have to recommend it to members of the Government because they presumably already know about it. There is a very ominous ring about what has now apparently been agreed.  This new deal was to be launched tomorrow but I understand that because of difficulties in agreeing much of the detail, it is to be put back until next Monday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could draw attention to some aspects of what this article addresses today I might be doing some service in giving it a wider audience than it might otherwise have.  Mr. Gallagher says that the Government has made significant concessions to the public sector trade unions in order to win their support for the new national pay agreement and he sets out in some detail what the concessions are.  He says that the agreement title has been slightly altered from &ldquo;A Programme for Work&rdquo; to &ldquo;A Programme for Competitiveness and Work&rdquo; and that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo;, which is a buzz word of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, reflects the deal's emphasis on pay matters rather than on unemployment. I am afraid it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the competitiveness in increasing the employer's payment of <Col N="1187" /> PRSI on middle income people by £550 a year, adding £1 million to the payroll cost of one medium-size firm alone, and preventing the employment of workers by countless firms throughout the country? When I saw the deal that had been done in the context of these talks between employers and unions in the private sector, I thought it was extremely damaging to competitiveness.  I could not understand how IBEC agreed because it was damaging to its member firms, industry and business generally and the creation of employment.  I thought that increases in the public sector could not be as high because, by definition, every firm in the private sector must be solvent or it would not survive.  The Exchequer is the most insolvent institution in the country, it owes £28.5 billion.  Therefore, it clearly cannot afford to pay anything like the rate solvent and mainly profitable private sector companies pay, but what do we find?  Not alone does it pay the same, it pays more and I see the seeds of enormous difficulty in the years to come.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Cox, our party spokesman on Finance said on budget night &mdash; Official Report, 26 January, column 1861:</P>
    <P>From 1990 to 1993 the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the public service pay bill went up by £880 million from a base of £3.16 billion.  It was an increase of 28 per cent when the cumulative inflation was 8.2 per cent.  That is not sustainable.</P>
    <P>How right he is &mdash; it is totally unsustainable, but we now have a situation where inflation is even lower.  The latest official figure for inflation is 1.5 per cent for the year to mid-November last. According to Mr. Gallagher, industry and employment correspondent with <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>The public sector deal has been the most controversial.  It provides for increases of 11 per cent over 3.5 years with a pay pause to June &mdash; a general rise of 8 per cent and another 3 per cent for productivity increases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> The concessions made to the unions in effect give automatic entitlement for every public servant to the first 1 per cent pay of the 3 per cent for productivity on April 1st, meaning that the pay pause will only last for three months rather than five.</P>
    <P>To qualify for the 1 per cent, public servants need to be &ldquo;in negotiations&rdquo; for special rises.  Almost every group of public servants is in this category.</P>
    <P>Where are we going?  Will this simply be a repetition of what happened under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress?</i>  What did the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> achieve in terms of employment creation?  It increased the number unemployed by over one-third.  Deputy Cox continued by saying how unsatisfactory it is that major decisions regarding the economic strategy for this country for a number of years to come are made behind closed doors by unelected and unaccountable people.  How right he is.  In the Chamber normally we have a succession of Members from the Government backbenches or Government Ministers reading out prepared scripts to tell us all is well.  If the last programme, whose major feature was this enormous increase in public sector pay, increased our rate of unemployment by more than one-third what can this be expected to do?  We should ask ourselves the real questions in relation to these matters rather than the superficial things in the budget that are commented upon.  This was a great opportunity for a major revamp, a fundamental strategic change in how we would approach taxation and expenditure, but that has been lost.  The public sector pay bill is the most crucifying single element of the problems that face us.  At the end of the article in <i>The Irish Times,</i> Mr. Gallagher said that the public service deal is not conditional on the unions accepting a new pay-determination system.  In other words we are back to what we have had for years and years.  I give away no secrets when I say that time and again I heard the Minister for Finance say that the pay determination <Col N="1189" /> system would have to come to an end, that we had an opportunity around this time to bring it to an end and that if we failed to grasp that opportunity we were condemning ourselves to another ten or 15 years of the kind of lunacy we have seen in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir.  The system under which pay is determined in the public sector generally is crazy because if an increase is given to some small group of people, who are working for way below what they should be working for in particularly stressful or difficult jobs and in anybody's judgement are underpaid and entitled to an increase, that pay increase is given not only to that group of 50 or 100 people but can apply automatically to 10,000 or 20,000 others who say they have a relationship in terms of pay with the first group.  If this report is right, and I have no reason to believe it is not, we are in a very perilous position because the public pay bill is likely to get out of hand under the new programme which has been negotiated in private and which is just handed to people when it has been agreed by those who are unelected and unaccountable to the public.  If it will have the same effect as the last one, I think we are in a very serious situation indeed because of the figures I quoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would love to have the opportunity to talk about industrial development and the situation that now exists but I have only a minute or two remaining.  If, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I had presided over what has gone on during the past 12 months in what is now the Department of Enterprise and Employment and caused the mess I venture to think I would be hounded out of office and almost hounded out of this House.  It is an absolute disgrace that almost two years after Culliton reported we are still in the situation that all we can do to try rationalise the industrial development, of which he was very critical, is to do the direct opposite of what he <Col N="1190" /> recommended.  We now have something like 40 quangos where previously we had three or four.  That is a great tragedy and a matter which should be properly debated in this House.  Unfortunately, I do not have the opportunity to do so now but I hope that others will take that opportunity as they get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget contains compelling evidence of the Government's commitment to the creation of real and lasting employment.  The strategy which underlies all our efforts is to create economic and social conditions where this objective can be achieved.</P>
      <P>We must maintain, and build upon, the financial stability and confidence which are the preconditions for investment and growth.  We also need to foster enhanced competitiveness and productivity to sustain real economic progress. A coherent taxation system and modern infrastructure will assist in this. Finally, we need to keep public policies generally under review to ensure that they are increasingly supportive of employment and investment.  Although our economic and social difficulties cannot be resolved overnight, the climate for growth which this budget creates, will in time provide the additional jobs our economy, and our people, desperately need.</P>
      <P>While working for growth and employment we must at the same time acknowledge that the less fortunate in society &mdash; those without employment or with limited means &mdash; must be catered for in the short term also.  We are, therefore, increasing the value of social welfare payment in real terms and we are ensuring through a range of other social measures, that those who are underprivileged are provided for.  The expanded housing programmes for which I am responsible are but one example of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A central component in our overall economic strategy is the reform of the <Col N="1191" /> taxation system where policy, which, in common with most budgetary measures, is directed at creating the conditions to resolve our difficult unemployment situation. In a nutshell, our tax system must not be a disincentive to work.  For this reason there is a growing consensus that the burden of taxation should fall less heavily on earned income and that low to middle income earners should be assisted through raising the tax thresholds.  The Government has taken steps in this budget to address both these concerns, to focus tax reliefs or similar incentives on areas of greatest need and to modify the impact of PRSI.  We will continue to simplify and streamline tax legislation to ensure that, consistent with maintaining effective collecting machinery, the system is as employment-friendly as possible.</P>
    <P>Income tax is not the only tax measure which impacts upon employment &mdash; there are wider implications to be considered.  The decision in last year's budget to reduce the VAT rate across a whole range of labour intensive services is being maintained, at least for the medium term.  Similarly, it is our intention to maintain the <i>status quo</i> for the construction industry.  In doing this, we are availing fully of the transitional period afforded by the European Union VAT Directive but we will press for the retention of the current position in relation to labour intensive services and the construction industry in the review of the VAT regime to be carried out at European level.</P>
    <P>Sufficient time has now elapsed since budget day to allow most commentators to have their say.  We have been treated to the usual diversity of views, some well informed, others less so, especially where they originated across the floor of the House.  One conclusion which can be drawn from reaction so far is that there appears to be an expectation that the Government should be able to continue its programme of tax reform in such a way that the outcome is uniformly favourable for everyone.  This is nonsense.  The penny must drop sometime.  If the word <Col N="1192" />&ldquo;reform&rdquo; is to mean anything, the consequences cannot be to confer equal benefits in each and every individual case. Reform in taxation, in addition to leading to a more rational, equitable and effective tax system with a greater incentive to work, must inevitably affect some of those who derived particular benefits from the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>Much the same point can be made in relation to the other aspects of the budget which draws together numerous strands of Government fiscal and economic policy.  It is, by definition, a complex undertaking.  It is easy to single out a particular item, or items, for criticism just because someone, or some vested interest, stands to lose out.  Budgetary policy cannot be argued, or at least argued cogently, from the particular to the general.  In passing judgement on the budget, the overall impact of its provisions has to be assessed, both at the level of the individual and for society as a whole.  In other words, the budget is a package and should be considered on that basis.  Looked at in this way, I am convinced that this budget is an excellent medium-term stimulus for the economic growth and social progress our country needs.  Recent opinion polls, which indicate a continuing upturn in the Government's rating, suggest that the electorate think so also.</P>
    <P>I will devote the remainder of my remarks to the programmes for which I am directly responsible.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length about budgetary policy to show that difficult choices must sometimes be made to serve the common good and that attempts to please all the people all the time are the opposite to what good Government is about.  I was particularly disappointed, therefore, at the failure of South Dublin and Fingal County Councils to adopt their estimates of expenses on schedule and strike rates for 1994.  The adoption of annual estimates is one of the fundamental responsibilities of local authority elected members and where a local authority fails to adopt an estimate steps must be taken quickly and effectively to avoid causing serious hardship to the general <Col N="1193" /> public, employees of the local authorities concerned and those in other employments whose jobs are dependent on the continuance of essential local services.</P>

      <P>For the reasons given I indicated in unequivocal terms that I would have no alternative but to remove the councillors from office in the absence of a clear and unambiguous commitment from those councils that they were willing to discharge their statutory obligations in a responsible manner by the adoption of estimates of expenses.  I welcome the response I received from both councils yesterday and I responded immediately by giving them extensions of time until Thursday, 17 February 1994 to enable their decisions to be given full statutory effect.</P>
      <P>The well-being of the construction industry is influenced principally by the prevailing economic climate.  Nevertheless, the Government plays an important role in stimulating activity in the industry through influencing private sector investment and by direct expenditure on a range of public sector projects. Through the Public Capital Programme, we continue to make a real contribution to maintaining a strong and vibrant construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public Capital Programme expenditure affecting the industry is estimated at £1,480 million this year, an increase of £124 million, or 9 per cent, on last year's outturn.  This will benefit the industry in general, help to secure the jobs of those who work in it and create additional <Col N="1194" /> employment.  In real terms, Public Capital Programme expenditure affecting the industry has arisen by about a quarter since 1990.  It is a pleasure these days to drive down the canal in this city and see the cranes and activity which has been stimulated by Government decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The industry is a cornerstone of the employment market, giving direct employment of about 71,000 and a further 29,000 or so indirect jobs in ancillary industries and services.  In other words, about 10 per cent of those at work depend on the industry for a living.  The Public Capital Programme allocations will be the catalyst for creating a net 2,600 direct jobs in the industry during 1994 &mdash; with a significant number of indirect jobs being created in ancillary industries also.  The recovery of private demand for general contracting should be substantially boosted by projected economic growth under the national plan, low interest rates and the recovery in business and consumer confidence.</P>
      <P>For the second year in succession, the water and sanitary services programme will enjoy an historically high provision. The capital provision of £122 million is a major injection to the programme and will enable continued progress to be made in the design and construction of new and improved water and sewerage facilities.  A considerable proportion of 1994 expenditure will receive aid through the various European Union programmes. Selected projects will be cofinanced through the Cohesion Fund, ENVIREG, INTERREG and the Structural Funds programme attracting estimated aid exceeding £89 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, the Cohesion Fund will again give a major boost to the programme. Thirty-four major water and sewerage projects have been submitted for approval since the inception of the fund.  These include projects which will provide new and improved sewerage <Col N="1195" /> facilities, along with sludge disposal arrangements, for Ringsend, Howth and Dún Laoghaire in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Wexford.  In addition, water supply projects at Ballymore Eustace, Limerick, Tuam, Lough Mask and Ballyjamesduff have been put forward for assistance.  Aid of almost £41 million has been approved for 23 projects under the Interim Cohesion Fund Instrument and additional approvals are expected in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The 1994 capital provision will ensure that the necessary funds are available for construction work to continue on new and improved water and sewerage facilities located throughout the country, including Clonmel, Killybegs, Kanturk, Baldoyle, Tuam, Ballina, Nenagh, Athlone, Monaghan, Dublin, Edgeworthstown and Inagh in County Clare.</P>
    <P>New sewerage treatment plants are being constructed at a number of coastal towns under the ENVIREG initiative. Construction work will continue in 1994 on several major schemes, including those at Greystones, Dingle, Kenmare, Killorglin, Caherciveen, Ballybunion, Tralee and Drogheda.</P>
    <P>The water and sanitary services programme is not concerned solely with compliance with European law, important though this undoubtedly is.  It builds up infrastructural capacity and helps to ensure that economic activity is environmentally sound and sustainable.  It assists in the achievement of balanced economic development and job opportunities through the regional location of industry and other economic activity.  It contributes to the competitiveness of industry by helping to reduce capital and operational costs.  It is crucial to the development of tourism, which is largely dependent on a clean, attractive environment, and to the exploitation of natural resource-based industries, including food and fish processing.</P>
    <P>My Department, as part of an ongoing process, will continue to assess and prioritise the economic and environmental importance of all projects in the programme <Col N="1196" /> to maximise the benefits of proposed investment.  All schemes must be fully cost effective.  Adequate capacity, which allows the potential for development, must be incorporated at design stage; but overcapacity for its own sake is not acceptable.  Treatment methods must be effective and appropriate to the needs of the particular scheme.  The construction phase must be completed on time and within budget and due regard must be taken of ongoing operational costs.</P>
    <P>The plan for social housing put in place a wide range of responses to the needs of those households who are unable to secure decent accommodation from their own resources.  These responses include the direct provision of local authority and voluntary housing accommodation and other measures, such as the shared ownership system, to assist low income house purchasers.  We must maintain and develop this range of responses to meet increasingly numerous and diverse housing needs.</P>
    <P>In 1993 we made real progress in all of our social housing programmes and this year we will see the benefits in greatly increased social housing output.  This year local authority, voluntary and other programmes, together with vacancies arising in the local authority rented housing stock, will secure accommodation for 9,000 households compared to 7,000 in 1993 and 6,100 in 1992.  Put another way, social housing output will increase by 50 per cent in just two years.</P>
    <P>About 3,800 local authority houses were started last year and 1,500 were completed or acquired by local authorities. In 1994 the vast majority of last year's starts will be completed and a further 3,500 dwellings will be started to maintain the impetus of the programme. This is being achieved without recourse to large-scale local authority housing on greenfield sites.  The emphasis in the programme remains on the provision of smaller infill sites and on developments which are integrated with existing communities.</P>
    <P>Each local authority will be notified shortly of the number of new starts they <Col N="1197" /> may undertake this year.  The capital allocation for the programme was increased by over 60 per cent in 1993 and, taking account of the budget increase of £12 million, we are providing for a further increase of almost 95 per cent to £129 million in 1994.</P>
    <P>For voluntary housing, a total of £33 million &mdash; an increase of 70 per cent &mdash; is being made available to provide accommodation for special category housing needs, including people with disabilities, elderly persons, homeless persons and family households on the local authority waiting lists.  This will give rise to 1,000 additional units of accommodation. The shared ownership system is proving increasingly attractive and £40 million &mdash; funding about 1,100 transactions &mdash; is being provided for shared ownership in 1994.</P>
    <P>Last year we provided the highest allocation ever for the remedial works programme at £17.2 million.  In 1994 this provision is being increased to £20.7 million, a further increase of over 20 per cent.  This will allow local authorities to accelerate progress on the 70 or so existing remedial works projects and will allow designation for funding of a number of other estates during 1994.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government commitment to a £4 million programme to provide bathroom facilities in local authority dwellings which still lacked them has been honoured.  The allocation for the bathrooms sub-programme has been increased in the budget from £2.5 million to £4 million this year to accelerate progress.</P>
    <P>A special allocation of £3 million has been made in the budget towards a window replacement programme for local authority flats.  This once-off provision will supplement the internal resources of local authorities and enable them to address quickly and effectively a source of long term dissatisfaction among tenants.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the provision for the scheme of special housing aid for the elderly has been doubled, from £2 million to £4 million.  Under this scheme, which is funded by my Department <Col N="1198" /> and operated by health boards, essential improvements are carried out at no cost to the applicant to the houses of old people who are living alone in unfit or unsanitary accommodation.  As a result, many old people have been able to stay in their own homes instead of moving into local authority accommodation or health board care.  About 20,000 applicants have already been assisted since the scheme was first introduced.  The increased allocation will allow work under this scheme to be speeded up.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to home ownership and our concern for the position of first time purchasers is reflected in the mortgage interest relief changes announced in the budget.  For the first five years of the mortgage a first time purchaser will now enjoy two important benefits: relief can be claimed on 100 per cent of interest, compared to 80 per cent for other mortgage holders; and the minimum threshold will not apply.  In other words, the first £200 of interest paid in the case of a couple will not be disregarded for income tax relief.</P>
    <P>These concessions will be applied so that first time owner occupiers who purchased in the 1990-91 tax year or any time since will benefit in 1994-95.  In making these changes the Government is targeting mortgage interest relief at the category of greatest need and ensuring that wider changes in mortgage interest relief will not adversely affect the ability of potential house owners to acquire their first home.</P>
    <P>The year 1994 is a pivotal year for our road network.  On 1 January the National Roads Authority assumed responsibility for the development of national primary and secondary roads.  Starting this year, investment of over £1,250 million pounds is planned for national road improvements over the period of the national development plan, and almost half a billion pounds is allocated to regional and county roads over the plan period.</P>
    <P>Over the period to 1999 we plan to spend £1,137 million on improving the national primary network and £115 million on the national secondaries.  This represents an increase of almost £500 million <Col N="1199" /> in investment in national primary roads compared with the period 1989-93 and almost a doubling of investment in national secondaries.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority now has the mandate and legislative framework necessary to provide a strategic focus to the development of the national network.  The Authority will draw on and exploit the expertise and experience of local authorities in undertaking projects. It will also be able to explore a range of financing options.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with nonnational roads today, because I have addressed the issue as recently as last Tuesday in this House.  I will simply point out that the overall provision for non-national roads for 1994 is £101.9 million as against £75.3 in 1993, a massive increase of 35 per cent.  These figures speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>The built environment will also benefit from the budget.  Despite the success of the present urban renewal scheme, much work remains in revitalising the physical and economic condition of core inner areas of our cities and towns.  The new urban renewal scheme announced on budget day will continue to build on progress already achieved.  It will place greater emphasis on residential accommodation and on the restoration and refurbishment of existing premises.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal policy must encourage people to move back into city and town centre communities.  Recent experience has shown that the right incentives, together with environmental improvements in inner city areas, will create and sustain a demand for urban living.  For this reason the new scheme retains the owner-occupier allowance for new residential units.  We are also doubling this allowance in the case of refurbishment works to promote the restoration of existing buildings.  This will assist in preserving the integrity of our streetscapes and the historic character of our cities and towns.  The &ldquo;section 23&rdquo; allowance in respect of the provision, improvement and conversion of private rented accommodation is also being retained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> Other new initiative involve increasing the floor area limits of apartments which qualify for incentives and an accelerated capital allowance of 50 per cent for industrial units.  These will facilitate family size apartments, avoid the crude carve-up of buildings such as old Georgian houses into multiple units that have no regard for their existing character, and exploit the scope for a variety of small industrial type ventures in many inner urban areas.</P>
    <P>The scheme is being extended to the 12 towns of Ballinasloe, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Killarney, Mallow, Monaghan, Mullingar, Navan, Nenagh, Newbridge, Roscommon and Wicklow to build on what has already been achieved elsewhere.  The designated areas in the existing provincial towns will in general be retained, while those in the five county boroughs will be reduced to about one quarter of their size to sharpen the focus of the scheme to specific areas in these cities.</P>
    <P>We face complex challenges in creating the economic progress necessary to give employment to all our people.  There never are simple answers to complex questions.  But the strategy which underlines this budget is good for employment and social progress.  It will foster the economic and social development on which our country depends.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment, I am glad to be able to report record spending and the greatest support ever for local authorities at £850 million for capital and current expenditure this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to preface my remarks by heartily congratulating the Minister on a job well done.  This budget is pro-jobs and pro-economic growth. For the first time a beginning has been made in fundamental tax reform.  On the crucial underlying issue of the national debt, our debit ratio to GNP will be well within Maastricht limits.  Last year, I was critical of the budget's lack of progress in the areas of tax reform and debt reduction.  I felt an opportunity, albeit a very limited one, had been missed.  This <Col N="1201" /> year, I can reasonably offer no such criticism.</P>
      <P>On the question of income tax, every serious study of our economic affairs in the past 20 years has concluded that we must shift taxation from earned income. This year that work has begun.  To balance the equation, we must as a society decide if we will forego spending in the form of State services, or maintain spending and consequently widen our tax base.</P>
      <P>There is no general willingness to reduce State services on a significant scale.  Accordingly, to achieve the aim of reducing personal taxation, we must broaden our tax base.  This has been a generally accepted principle for some years.  To the credit of the Minister, Deputy Ahern, it was he who pushed the boat out on budget day.  Unfortunately, for the quality of economic debate in Ireland, Deputies Yates, Cox and Rabbitte lost their nerve at the last minute.  I sincerely hope that this fit of opportunism will not have a long term negative effect on the maturity of our deliberations.</P>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to point out that the positions adopted on the property tax by the Opposition are a direct contradiction of its long standing positions. The long term widening of the tax base, coupled with prudent management of public expenditure, can alone permit fundamental tax reform in Ireland.  Any pretence to the contrary is cant and hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightfully removed the variety of 1 per cent levies.  They were nothing more than a crude form of fund raising measures.  Taking the basket of measures adopted by the Minister to ease the tax burden on the low paid as a whole, an incisive pro-employment measure has been taken.  If we want at the same time to reduce unemployment and squeeze the black economy, we must leave people better off at work than on the dole. Change in this direction has begun and I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The residential property tax, if people's incomes and ability to pay are taken into account, is a reasonable measure.  The Minister's decision to take account of hardship in assessing individual <Col N="1202" /> cases is welcome.  The position of Deputies Yates, Cox and Rabbitte is complete hypocrisy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has taken a high ground.  Reason, common sense and good economic management are all behind this measure.</P>
      <P>When negotiating its participation in Government in 1989, the Progressive Democrats explicitly demanded a reduction in the level of tax relief on mortgage interest and VHI premiums. That is a matter of public record.  Deputy Cox now describes the same policy as an attack on self-reliance.  Indeed, the Progressive Democrats in an earlier policy document entitled <i>Employment, Enterprise and Tax Reform</i> called for local government change.  The levy, so far as their proposal then was concerned would be paid by a wider group of people than the proposed arrangement.</P>
      <P>It was Fine Gael in Government in 1983 who introduced a property tax in the first place.  The position of the Opposition is untenable.  I am convinced that by reason of its argument, the Government can and should prevail in respect of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now outline how this budget affects the constituency of Wexford.  One year ago, on my return to this House, I decided that my priority in 1993 would be to improve the educational infrastructure in my county.  With the co-operation of the Minister for Education, Deputy <Col N="1203" /> Bhreathnach and the Minister of State, Deputy Alyward, great progress is being made in that respect.  Moneys have been allocated to Raheen national school, Ramsgrange community school and Adamstown vocational school.  Existing buildings will be repaired and new buildings will be constructed.  That is an investment by this Government in Wexford's future and I am grateful for it.  The morale of teachers, parents and pupils will be raised by this recognition of their long campaign for a quality education infrastructure.  However, there are some inequities in respect of education grants. For example, it was brought to my notice recently that a person earning £27,000 per annum and with two children attending college did not receive a grant.  The take home pay in that case was £16,800. It costs approximately £5,000 per annum in rural Ireland to put a child through third level education.  The person to whom I refer had a mortgage of £2,500 a year, leaving him with approximately £80 and £90 per week on which he and his family had to live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have shown those figures to the Minister for Finance in which case he might not have introduced the residential property tax for those same people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Many worthwhile provisions were introduced in the budget, but I hope the inequities to which I have referred are examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of the generally favourable trends in agriculture, farmers in south Wexford suffered badly this year. Weather conditions were horrendous and caused devastation.  The RathanganBridgetown area was particularly badly affected where yields fell dramatically. In that area beet production, which is normally 18 tonnes per acre, decreased to five or six tonnes per acre.  Barley production, which is usually between two to two and a half tonnes per acre, decreased to between 0.5 and 0.7 tonnes per acre.  At the same time, farms were awash in more than 200 per cent of <Col N="1204" /> normal rainfall.  Merchants have discontinued credit facilities and many farmers are relying on relief from the South Eastern Health Board.  However, from discussions I have had with officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has submitted a proposal for aid to Brussels.  This is the first time in my 20 years in local and national government that there has been a plea from the farmers of south Wexford. Therefore, I ask the Minister to take their case on board.  I commend the budget to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is a major disappointment to the ordinary people of Ireland.  It is a mean budget and lest the Minister think the Government's problems are over following the residential property tax debacle, in my view the meanest and most subversive element of the budget is the attack on widows in terms of contributory pensions.</P>
      <P>I will illustrate to the Government the opportunities it lost in preparing this budget.</P>

      <P>The most recently published migration figures relate to the 12 month period to mid-April 1993 during which it is estimated that outward migration exceeded inward migration by 6,000 persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Official annual estimates of net <Col N="1205" /> migration are derived in conjunction with the population estimates for mid-April each year, taking account of appropriate data on births and deaths.</P>
    <P>They are not obtained as the difference between separately estimated gross outward and inward flows.  The Central Statistics Office is at present at an advanced stage in exploring the feasibility of estimating the gross flow data using the annual labour force surveys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information. The net flows in one or other direction are based on different sources. They include the register of electors, payment of child allowances, surveys of estimates of migratory flows, new registrants from Ireland with both the national insurance scheme of Great Britain and the national health service and the registration of births and deaths.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this matter before.  Emigration and migration are matters of human resources.  It should be possible to set up some type of precise statistical measurement, analysis or tracking system to establish to where people have emigrated and from where immigrants come.  Such statistics should be compiled not only on a provincial basis but on a county by county basis to provide for social policy and economic planning and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a method of collecting such statistics, but I am sure Deputies and the public would reject it out of hand.  It would involve introducing a system whereby everybody would have to account for their movements.  People would have to give details of where they are travelling to or coming from each time they wanted to leave the country. Accurate statistics could only be compiled by the introduction of such a <Col N="1206" /> system.  I am sure that nobody would support that type of procedure as it would not be practical or in keeping with the free movement of persons within the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy is not suggesting such a measure but would accept a more realistic one.  The labour force survey may provide some assistance in that regard.  It will enable us to track the usual place of residence of people now and for the previous year.  On that basis we will be able to estimate the number of people who have returned from abroad. That survey provides more accurate figures and goes as far as we can in the direction the Deputy wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 42 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics recently published by my Department indicate that Irish hazardous waste production increased by 36 per cent between 1988 and 1992.  Of the total of 99,000 tonnes produced in 1992, there was an increase in the proportion recycled-recovered, and in the proportion incinerated, and a decrease in <Col N="1207" /> landfilled hazardous wastes.  Waste exports have also increased.</P>
    <P>All hazardous waste is to some extent intractable, in the sense of requiring special treatment to deal in an environmentally safe way with its toxic or other properties.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear, most recently at the conference on hazardous waste management options which was organised last month by Trinity College Dublin and my Department, that Irish policy on hazardous waste must focus both on the promotion of waste prevention and minimisation, and on our capacity properly to manage remaining wastes.  I am currently developing an overall national hazardous waste strategy based on this dual approach.</P>
    <P>I have regularly stated that I am not opposed to properly regulated incineration as a waste management option. Proposals for improving our waste management infrastructure, in relation to hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, will soon have to be finalised in the context of the operational programme for environmental services.  I will have regard to the proceedings of the recent conference, as well as to other views and submissions put to me, in finalising these proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's hierarchical system for dealing with waste management and the emphasis he gives to waste prevention and minimisation followed by waste management.  He stated that all hazardous waste is intractable, but I disagree with him.  Will the Minister indicate the amount of the 99,000 tonnes of hazardous waste revealed in his Department's survey that is intractable? Will he indicate the amount of intractable hazardous waste that would need to be disposed of in an incinerator for which all other methods of disposal and recycling are not suitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, all hazardous waste is to some extent intractable and requires special treatment to deal in an environmentally safe way with its toxic <Col N="1208" /> and other properties.  It would not be possible to answer the question in the way in which the Deputy has phrased it, but I will refer to the experience of other countries.  Countries which appear to have the greatest concern for environmentally safe ways of dealing with hazardous waste have all found that in the long run properly managed incineration which meets the most strict environmental considerations is the safest way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>All hazardous waste is not intractable.  More than 50 per cent can be recovered or recycled.  Regarding the hazardous waste that requires incineration, will the Minister consider using the net figures of intractable waste of 37,000 tonnes instead of the gross figure of 99,000 tonnes of waste generated in discussing this issue?  I suggest that the Minister is using the gross figure of waste arising to justify his personal preference for a national incinerator.  We should concentrate on the figure of 37,000 tonnes of intractable waste.  Will the Minister indicate how he proposes to deal with that waste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to debate this subject in that context.  We export approximately 11,000 tonnes of waste and currently incinerate 26,000 tonnes on site here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 86 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I wish to extend my sympathies to the families and friends of the two men who died in the fire and <Col N="1210" /> indeed to all who suffer the consequences of fire.  I am advised that the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed that the Garda should continue its investigations into this incident and, on completion, submit the full file to him for consideration and direction as to further action.  In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any particular aspect of the incident.</P>
    <P>Statutory provisions are in place which deal comprehensively with fire safety requirements in buildings such as flats and apartments.  The Fire Services Act, 1981, sets out responsibility for fire safety in a wide range of premises, including living accommodation such as flats and apartments, and it gives fire authorities powers of inspection and enforcement.  It is a matter for fire authorities to exercise these functions on the basis of priorities which they determine in the light of local circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Building Control Act and the building regulations made under the Act prescribe fire safety requirements in relation to a wide range of new buildings and material alterations and changes of use in existing buildings.  Technical guidance documents have been published which indicate how these requirements may be complied with.  A code of practice which would provide fire safety advice to owners and occupiers of existing flats, has been prepared by my Department, with the assistance of senior local authority fire officers; this will be published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards other aspects, I refer to the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 1993, which came into operation for private rented dwellings on 1 January 1994 and which oblige the landlords of such dwellings to ensure that they comply with certain minimum standards in regard to structural condition, provision of sinks, toilets, baths, showers, and so on.  Enforcement of these regulations is the responsibility of the housing authority for the area in which the rented dwelling is located.</P>
    <P>Local authorities were recently requested in a circular letter from my Department to secure the highest degree <Col N="1211" /> of compliance with the standards regulations, and to take prompt and effective action in relation to breaches of the regulations, complaints or inquiries.  They were also reminded of their inspection and enforcement powers in respect of a wide range of premises including flats, apartments etc. under the Fire Services Act, 1981, and the Building Regulations, 1991.  As safety from fire is extremely important in residential premises, authorities were advised that they should accord the necessary priority to the question of fire safety in discharging their responsibilities in this matter.  The question of introducing a system of compulsory registration to assist local authorities to identify rented dwellings is under consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in expressing my sympathy to the relatives of those who died tragically in this fire and I accept his reasons for not wishing to say very much about the matter.  Is the Minister aware that there were 16 bedsits in this one house and that at least some of the windows were barred?  Will he agree that throughout this city there appears to be a very large number of similar buildings &mdash; I say &ldquo;appears to be&rdquo; because I can get no figures on this matter?  This is one good reason for a house survey, not only in Dublin but throughout the State.  Will the Minister also agree that many people, particularly parents of students in this city, are very concerned about the standard of accommodation in which their children are living and very disturbed by incidents of this nature?  These buildings are fire traps.  I am surprised by the Minister's complacency in reply to this question because it is a very disturbing problem which causes acute concern to many people.  Urgent action is required to ensure that tragedies of this nature to not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject out of hand an accusation of complacency on my part or that of my colleagues, officials in my Department or in local authorities.  As <Col N="1212" /> I explained, I introduced a number of controls since I became Minister for the Environment.  I also assisted the Fire Services Council in a number of programmes to highlight the dangers associated with the areas mentioned by the Deputy.  I cannot go into specific details but, regrettably, because of security and other considerations, the ground floors of buildings are often barred up.  There is a conflict between what people find they have to do for security reasons and what is necessary for safety reasons.  I do not wish to go into this matter in further detail except to say that everything possible will be done at local authority level in the provision of notice which will enable people to ensure that fire regulations are met to the fullest possible degree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his sentiments do not compare with those expressed by his Minister of State in interviews after this tragic event in which he said it was necessary to take urgent action in the matter?  In view of the fact that the legislation introduced after the Stardust tragedy dealt mainly with places of public assembly rather than private houses, flats and bedsits when will such action be taken?  Will the Minister say why he cannot introduce legislation, for example, to make it compulsory to have smoke alarms in these premises, considering their success elsewhere, particularly in the United States?  In that country five out of six private homes have smoke alarms, resulting in a reduction by half in deaths by fire.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28, 30, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 58, 59, 60, 61, 63, 64, 65, 66, 71, 72, 74, 79, 82, 84, 85, 87, 89, 92, 94, 95, 96, 98, 102, 104, 131, 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's decisions on local government reorganisation at sub-county level were outlined in a statement issued by me on 27 January 1994, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that the town-based local authority system should be retained and modernised.  Elections to all the existing urban authorities will be held in tandem with the elections to the European Parliament on 9 June 1994. Necessary boundary alterations to encompass built-up environs of towns will be implemented by means of a Local Government Bill, which will be brought forward urgently.  This will enable residents of these areas to vote at the forthcoming elections.  County managers have been asked to submit boundary alteration proposals, following consultation with the elected councils concerned, by 31 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed Local Government Bill will provide for the establishment of a statutory reorganisation commission, the role of which will be to make recommendations <Col N="1224" /> within 12 months as to the appropriate future classification of urban authorities; the functions for each class of authority; and the class within which each existing authority would fall.  The commission will also be required to look at the position of towns which currently have no separate local authority.  It would be premature for me to speculate about the position of particular towns in advance of the commission's report.</P>
    <P>With regard to functions, the first priority will be for the commission to consider the appropriate allocation of existing functions.  Questions relating to other functions would have to be considered in the light of this allocation and of the commission's recommendations regarding classification of sub-county authorities.  Legislation providing for the transfer of additional functions to local authorities in a number of fields including road traffic regulation and the control of casual trading is already before the Oireachtas.  I intend that the Local Government Bill will contain further provisions designed to enhance the discretionary powers of local authorities and that work on the development of other devolution proposals will be carried on, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>It will also be a matter for the commission to bring forward recommendations regarding the appropriate relationships between the county and sub-county levels and to consider the related financial effects.  The precise steps to be taken to ensure that the financial effects of any recommended changed are satisfactory and that the position of the county council as the primary unit of local government is protected, will fall to be determined in the light of the report of the commission.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that one would have to come to the conclusion that the long awaited reform of local government is again being long fingered, particularly when one recalls that the 1984 local elections were postponed to enable reform to take place?  The elections <Col N="1225" /> took place in 1985 without reform, while the 1990 elections were postponed in 1991 to enable reform to take place. They were postponed in 1991 to 1992, in 1992 they were postponed to 1993 and in 1993 they were postponed to 1994.  It is extraordinary that no proposals have emanated from the Department of the Environment in regard to reform of the function and funding of local authorities during that period, despite the fact that the Barrington committee of experts reported on the matter, that several other studies of the local government system have been published and that work has carried out within the Department.  Will the Minister agree that it is difficult for people to accept anything other than that local government reform is on the back burner and that, apart from minor changes, very little will be done in this regard?  What criteria&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I expect the circular letters in regard to the boundary changes issued to the county managers to be submitted to me by 31 March and these can be made available to Deputies.  It is true that those towns which have no local <Col N="1226" /> authority, a town commissioner or urban council at present will not have the opportunity to participate in the next local elections, which will be held in June. The proposed Local Government Bill will, for the first time this century, make provision for such participation at the subsequent local elections in 1996.</P>
      <P>The Deputy complained that no decision has been made and no action has been taken.  This is the first time this century that a Government has accepted the need for the retention of town-based authorities and that there will be a detailed boundary extension of local authorities.  In the case of some urban authorities three times as many people are living outside the existing town boundary as are living within it and these people have no opportunity to participate in the elections.  For the first time I, as Minister for the Environment, will give these people an opportunity to participate in the local elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The data referred to is from the National Database on Waste published by an Foras Forbartha in 1986.  It does not represent total municipal waste but only waste collected and/or disposed of by local authorities.  Some 450,000 tonnes of non-muncipal waste, in the form of <Col N="1232" /> sewage sludge, is included in the figure referred to.</P>
    <P>The national database to which I referred implies that the total amount of municipal waste generated in 1984, including wastes dealt with both by local authorities and the private sector, came to some 1.5 million tonnes.  A recent municipal waste survey commissioned by my Department, and which is still being completed, indicates that the corresponding figure for 1993 is of the order of two million tonnes.  This would represent an increase of over 30 per cent for the nine year period since 1984.  Pending completion of the 1993 survey, it is not yet possible to indicate the breakdown of the two million tonne total into its materials sub-components.  I will let the Deputy have this information as soon as it is available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be grey by the time that information becomes available.  May I ask the Minister how he calculates these large tonnage figures?  Does he realise, for instance, that a number of local authorities are to a large extent dreaming up figures for recycling, and indeed are clapping themselves on the back as they continue to wallow in the waste they are creating?  Does he accept that the exclusion of firms and the public makes the figures totally unacceptable for carrying out any type of planning and also makes it difficult, for instance, to see what the future will be for Kerbside, which has 50 employees facing redundancy in July?  Does the Minister not believe that a period of 19 years since the last waste directive is a long time to be dragging one's feet on this issue while the mountain of refuse is increasing yearly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I would not like to criticise the efforts being made by the local authorities in the area of recycling.  The analysis we are presently undertaking is almost complete and until such time as that is available the only other figure we have is that of the two million tonnes.  I would remind the Deputy that figures from the ERM study of 1991 indicate that there was 1.97 million <Col N="1233" /> tonnes of household and commercial solid waste in Ireland, 62 per cent of which was household waste and 38 per cent was commercial waste.  Therefore, two million tonnes, which seems to be the acceptable figure, appears to be emerging from the survey we are undertaking at the moment.</P>

      <P>When the Minister talks about recycling, would he focus his thoughts on the possibility of reducing, as his senior colleague has said, hazardous waste?  In the demographic layout of Ireland it was possible at one time not to have such widespread collection and to deal with much of the waste <i>in situ</i>.  Composting and the feeding of animals would have taken care of a considerable amount; 30 per cent is compostable at present.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for licensing by the agency, on the basis of integrated pollution control, of activities with significant polluting potential.  Environmental Protection Agency licensing, which will commence on a phased basis shortly, will extend to certain waste disposal and treatment operations, including incineration of hazardous and hospital wastes.  Waste management operations, other than those carried out by a local authority within its functional area, are licensed at present under the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has both a general supervisory role in relation to the performance of environmental protection functions by local authorities, and more specific powers as regards certain related matters, including landfill and sewage discharges.  The supervisory regime for landfill provided by the 1992 Act envisages both the publication of criteria by the agency and a monitoring programme in relation to local authority landfill sites.  I intend that these provisions should be made operational as soon as possible.  I have also made it clear that the waste Bill, which is now being drafted, will provide for full scale licensing by Environmental Protection Agency of local authority operations.</P>
      <P>Trade effluents discharging to sewers can be licensed under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990.  There is provision in the 1992 Act for regulations which would more directly control sewage discharges themselves, inter alia, by the setting of standards and by a related authorisation system to be operated by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Provisions of this kind are being addressed in the context of implementing the EU Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quill that the scheme is worthwhile from a number of points of view.  It was slow to get off the ground but in the past couple of years the take-up has improved considerably.  I am sure the Deputy is familiar with a number of the new projects which have been designed and put in place recently.  Approximately £750,000 has been invested in the artistic embellishment scheme but I propose to make a number of important changes.  I thought that the original requirement to locate the artistic element on the particular site, such as the roadway or wherever, was <Col N="1243" /> inappropriate and that we should seek a place in a town or village where there would be facilities to view it as distinct from racing by at 70 miles per hour.  I have been in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, in regard to a number of important changes and we hope to make further progress.  I am delighted there is considerable interest in the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Is it proposed to extend the current limit of £20,000, which is particularly low, in relation to major schemes such as the underwater tunnel in Cork?  If the ceiling were lifted and if 1 per cent of the overall cost of that project could be used for artistic embellishment, it would create an enormous amount of work and make a major difference to the artistic life of Cork city.  Is it proposed to make the scheme mandatory, bearing in mind that as of now a number of local authorities make little or no use of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that we have a broader response to that scheme. Some local authorities are making good use of the scheme while others are slow to avail of it.  So far the ceiling has not presented a problem.  Admittedly some adjustment may be made in a major scheme but that would probably have to be compensated for, at the other end, in smaller schemes.  Even though the sum involved is only 1 per cent, every 1 per cent counts when there is pressure to provide a group water scheme or some other alternative when choices have to be made.  I am anxious to ensure that the scheme develops and I will facilitate a number of important changes.  I will look at the overall question of limits in particular cases &mdash; I do not wish to indicate that it would be open to all cases &mdash; when these are brought to my notice.</P>

I also regret that a number have reduced from their own resources their contribution to county roadworks and the difference between the best and the worst is eight times.  That is unacceptable.  Of course there is the overall question of how much the Government can afford to provide for county roads.  I am glad I was able to make a 36 per cent increase over the 1993 figure for this purpose and I will continue, in the context of the national development plan, to provide record funding for this very essential area which I accept is below par.</P>

Much as the Minister might like to, he cannot deny that. In the allocation of the funds to which the Minister is adding the £15 million from the tax amnesty, will he direct the funds towards counties like mine with more than 3,000 kilometres of county roads, 60 per cent of which are deficient and dangerous?</P>

An Irish citizen, or any resident in Europe may contact the European Commission about any scheme in Europe and I can do nothing to stop that happening.  I disagree fundamentally with some of the requirements of the European Union in relation to this and I <Col N="1251" /> have raised this at Council meetings but as funding is being provided for the first time for county road schemes, it has to go through the process of negotiation in Europe for agreement for the money to be provided for that purpose.  As Members may know this was not done up to now and it is being done on a project basis.  The project has to stand up to economic analysis under stiff criteria. It would make my job much easier if these decisions were taken at local level where I could provide an aggregate grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 27 and 100 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already notified local authorities of their rate support grant allocations for the current year; these were determined on the basis that each authority's allocation would be increased by 2.5 per cent. A report by the Institute of Fiscal Studies was commissioned in 1991 specifically to look into the distribution of the rate support grant.  It outlined equalisation models, based on various assumptions, in an effort to make it possible to compare the effects of a range of possible indicators for the distribution of the grant <Col N="1253" /> by reference to needs and resources.  The report is based on the use of statistical techniques and their application to selected criteria.</P>
    <P>A number of grant distribution options were examined in the study, and each of these suggests significant redistribution of rate support grant between authorities &mdash; some would stand to gain and others to lose significantly.  Most local authorities made observations on the report's findings, some favouring implementation of the recommendations in one form or another, and others wholly opposing them. This polarisation of views is directly related to the predicted outcome of a redistribution of grant allocations on the basis of the options outlined in the report.</P>
    <P>Many authorities suggested that the report's findings, which were based on analysis of the 1991 spending estimates only, needed to be tested on more than one year's spending to establish more conclusive indications of the extent of redistribution that might arise.  I accepted this view and asked my Department to undertake a further analysis of the distribution criteria by reference to the 1993 local authority estimates.  The results of this further analysis suggest that the distribution criteria outlined in the report would lead to relatively unstable grant allocations from year to year, a factor which could give rise to further difficulty.</P>
    <P>The present system of rate support grant allocations has evolved over a period of some 15 years.  Adjustments of the system made over the years have generally been financially neutral for the local authorities.  Where increased overall allocations for the grant have been made available in the Estimates for a particular year, the additional funds have generally been allocated on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis among the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Any proposals for a new distribution system must take realistic account of the present allocations so as to ensure that no local authority suffers unnecessarily. Any new basis of allocation must also take account of the particular difficulties experienced by some local authorities. Where imbalances may exist under existing arrangements, they did not come <Col N="1254" /> about overnight and it would be imprudent to try to solve them otherwise than on a phased basis, possibly over a number of years.  For these and other reasons, I am convinced that redistribution of the kind indicated by the IFS findings is inappropriate in present circumstances.  I intend, however, to review the position on the basis of the most up-to-date information available to my Department before the 1995 allocations come to be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that as valuations are based on the 1977 figures that certain counties which have higher valuations now are discriminated against?  Does the Minister agree that there is a need for a radical overhaul of the system of distribution because of the anomalies not the least of which is that counties which enjoy a higher take in commercial rates are getting a larger rate support grant than other counties?  In turn this has led to the inability of certain counties with higher mileage of county road to invest in them compared with counties which have lesser miles of county road.  Would he further agree that the present system of distribution means, in effect, that poorer counties are becoming poorer and richer counties are getting richer and that this is entirely inequitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    <P>One of the difficulties I faced when I examined this report in the context of its application was that there were both winners and losers and, unfortunately for me, some of the losers were already in financial difficulty.  A further imbalance would make it even more difficult for those local authorities to survive.  I have, however, taken steps to deal with some of the problems outlined by the Deputy. There are other ways open to me, as distinct from the rate support grant to <Col N="1255" /> deal with those imbalances and I am considering them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the report of the Institute of Fiscal Studies on the State funding of local authorities shows that the system that exists in this country is highly inequitable, that under this ad hoc system arbitrary decisions are made by him and his Department on an annual basis and that we have, in fact, the most inequitable method in Europe for funding local authorities? Does the Minister agree that this is intolerable and cannot be allowed to continue, particularly now that the evidence is available following this extensive expert study of our local authority system and the way it is funded by central government?  The Minister has to accept that the present system &mdash; where no obvious criteria are applied but we have merely percentage increases each year &mdash; is unsatisfactory and unfair to some local authorities and over advantageous to others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my opening statement before lunch, many people are very disappointed with this budget.  They had great expectations, given the many opportunities open to the Minister for <Col N="1324" /> Finance in preparing the 1994 Budget. There was a great build-up to it and the Minister for Finance and other Ministers made good use of the PR opportunities available to point out that the money that would be saved would be used to benefit the people in terms of tax reform.</P>
      <P>However, as the days pass and the budget is analysed, it can be seen there are many &ldquo;sleepers&rdquo;, as they are sometimes described.  Already difficulties have been caused by the residential property tax.  Another proposal in the budget which has not yet hit the headlines but will &mdash; I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare is present in the House &mdash; is the proposal to attack the incomes of widows.  This is going to come back on the Government.</P>
      <P>It is not just a question of the Government selecting one of the most vulnerable groups in society to attack &mdash; the Minister referred to some of their benefits as perks &mdash; it is an attack on the entire system of social insurance which people pay into. Before I became a Member of this House I worked in industry and paid into the social insurance fund.  I did so in the knowledge that at a certain stage I would be able to benefit from these contributions in terms of pension rights and so on.  People understand that if one pays into this fund they will receive benefits and that they will not be attacked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In attacking the contributory widow's pension in the budget the Government has undermined the entire system.  While people accept that the various allowances, such as unemployment assistance, will change from time to time, they did not expect when they started to pay contributions to the social insurance fund that their benefits would be attacked by the Government.  As time goes by, people will come to realise that they will be affected.  I realise that existing recipients of widow's pension will not be affected, but sooner rather than later all widows and widowers will have their contributory pensions means tested.  It is reprehensible for the Government to introduce on the one hand a widower's pension &mdash; this is to be welcomed as there <Col N="1325" /> must be equality on these issues &mdash; but on the other to place the burden on widows.</P>
    <P>The Government has driven a wedge between widows and widowers.  Widows who have been affected will deduce that they are being hit because the Government decided to bring in pensions for widowers.  It is the most subversive proposal in this budget with regard to our system of social insurance and, as time goes on, the Minister and her colleagues in Cabinet will begin to realise what they have done to the social insurance system. It is difficult enough to make people recognise how important it is to prepare for retirement and old age.  Now they will feel that if they make any provision and are thrifty and careful they will be hit. People will be frightened by this measure.  Men will worry because many women outlive their husbands and, therefore, there are more widows than widowers.  The Minister has not heard the end of that element of the budget.</P>
    <P>I listened to a series of speeches from Government backbenchers.  However, I have not heard any since the flurry of parliamentary party meetings so even as I speak a new bombshell could be dropped by some Government backbenchers who pretend that they were not really aware of what they were voting for on budget night and that it is their right now to cherry-pick between the bits they like and the bits they do not like.  The Labour Party and Fianna Fáil formed a Government with a majority of over 30 and they must take what goes with that.  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot have a group of Fianna Fáil backbenchers demanding a meeting with Minister Ahern to negotiate changes and, on the other hand, take all the perks of office.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government is beginning to realise the mistakes made in the budget, but this is not the right way to do business.  At the very least it is incompetent to start renegotiating the budget when the ink is hardly dry on the page. As far as this side of the House is concerned this debate is a bit of a farce because we do not know from day-to-day what behind-the-scenes deals might be <Col N="1326" /> going on and what changes might be made.  We are told we will see it all in the Finance Bill, but that will not be out for a number of weeks.  Maybe it is the Government's hope that opposition to various elements of the budget will die. Let the Minister be warned, it will not die and, as some of the elements of this budget take hold and affect people's wage packets, many of the issues will come back to haunt the Government.</P>
    <P>There were high expectations of this budget.  Every 1 per cent decrease in international interest rates gave us a saving on our repayments of £285 million. This budget did not give back even 1 per cent of a drop in interest rates.  The total package given back in the budget is £194 million when all its elements are taken into account.</P>
    <P>Of course there are elements in the budget with which I do not disagree.  I am glad that widowers are getting pensions.  I am glad to see extra money going to a number of groups and I am glad that some areas have been singled out and given money in he budget.  We are disappointed in the lack of an overall thrust in view of the fact that this Government, more than any other for many years, had the opportunity to make relevant changes in the taxation system.  It had the money, the flexibility and the majority &mdash; it was not on a knife edge as many Government's have been for the last ten years. The Government could have got anything through and this was exactly the year when there should have been fundamental changes in tax.  However, all the Government has done is tinker and some of that tinkering is very damaging.</P>
    <P>When the history of this time is written Minister Smith will be remembered as the Minister for potholes, although he did have a competitior; Minister Pádraig Flynn was known for a while as the Minsiter for potholes.  However, they were baby potholes.  Now we have fathers and mothers of potholes on our roads and I am not talking about roads which do not have heavy traffic.  Every road needs attention bar, perhaps, some of the new main roads.  Everywhere I go in my constituency there are potholes, and ditches <Col N="1327" /> collapsing.  The reason is that for years we have not looked after our county roads. Because of the cutback in the rate support grant county councils have been allowing things like clearing and filling in ditches to go by the board.  As a result water gathers on the roads so that now you have almost to be a stunt driver to make your way along some of them.  You must have a very good lock on steering to manoeuvre round potholes.  I am not talking about Cavan; I am talking about places like Rush, Lusk, Balbriggan, Malahide and Swords, towns on the outskirts of this city where the daily traffic movements are double and three times the traffic movements on some of our national primary routes.</P>
    <P>On the Malahide Road coming out from Dublin there is a daily traffic count of over 12,000 vehicles.  That is an enormous level of traffic.  Many of our national primary routes would not have that level of traffic in a week, let alone in a day, and yet we cannot convince the Minister for potholes, Deputy Smith, that it is his responsibility.  In the budget £15 million was allocated from the tax amnesty.  This was an opportunity for the Minister to say that for every £1 spent on a road beginning to deteriorate another £10 is saved.  If roads are allowed to deteriorate badly a decent job will cost ten times more than it would if councils were allowed to cut out bad bits and redo them instead of throwing in a bucket of tarmacadam and tamping it down with the back of a spade which most of the councils are now forced to do.  They just about manage to keep a hole filled until the next shower of rain.  The Minister spoke about the large sums of money he spent on the roads, but if he is spending that kind of money it is not effective and he must take the blame for the condition of roads all over the country.</P>
    <P>The budget may be good for some people but not for those who pay a mortgage and VHI, own a house worth over £75,000, drive a car and have a frequent drink, a frequent &mdash; or even a casual &mdash; smoke.  If you are not a widow and do not do all those other things there are <Col N="1328" /> some good elements in the budget.  I do not like using a word like &ldquo;mean&rdquo; about a budget because I do not think politicians necessarily set out to be mean.  However, elements of this budget are mean and that is the only way I can describe them. It is a direct attack on the perceived wealth of the middle income earners.  I do not know if that is the result of Labour's participation in Government.  The message, loud and clear, of the Tánaiste the other day was that this is a joint budget and that one side cannot be sniping at the other.  In other words he was saying that people should put up or shut up.  This budget was prepared by a Coalition Cabinet, but it has mean elements and attacks middle class people.  I am not talking about people who have vast wealth.</P>
    <P>There is a perception in the Labour Party that if people own their houses, pay health insurance, have two cars to allow the husband to travel to work and the wife to take the children to school and, also, perhaps, go on a continental holiday every two or three years that they are very wealthy.  I listened to a Fianna Fáil backbencher earlier today make a plea for educational grants for rural people. He instanced a typical person earning £27,000 per annum, who would be over the income limit in respect of the property tax if his or her house is valued at more than £75,000.  More than likely that person pays PRSI, a mortgage and so on. The Deputy gave a breakdown of the income to make a case for a third level grant for his client who, he stated, had only £80 or £90 per week to spend after paying the bills.  I suggested to the Deputy he ought to have shown those figures to the Minister for Finance when he was preparing his budget and arranging to squeeze the 350,000 people in the so-called well-off middle income group. Those people, many of whom live in the suburbs of Dublin, Cork, Galway and Wexford, provide for themselves and their families, but the Minister has gone out of his way to deprive them of their last bit of self-reliance, self-provision and effort.  They cannot take any more.</P>
    <P>People living in areas perceived to be good middle class areas do not have a <Col N="1329" /> spare pound to give to collections in their areas because they are on such a tight budget providing for themselves, paying for their health care, etc.  They pay for their children's dental treatment, school outings, third level education and so on. They are always just above the limit in respect of third level grants and medical cards and receive very little from the State.  Many of them live in hope of getting free travel if they live long enough but, of course, some of them may end up widowed and suffer in another manner. That is all they hope to get for what they have put into society.</P>
    <P>I am not talking merely about middle income PAYE families, but about many middle income self-employed people who create one or two jobs.  Yesterday I received a letter from a constituent who runs a small nursery business.  She employs her daughter and another young relative who might otherwise be on the dole.  Last year her business was severely affected by bad weather and all her stocks were destroyed.  She has practically nothing left from her investment and needs a little assistance to maintain her business.  She has paid every step of the way and now her business will go down the Swanee.  She is not entitled to any assistance to make up for that natural disaster because she is outside the limit which applies to schemes for other horticulturists. I am at a loss as to where to advise her to go for assistance to keep her business operational.  It will be by the inexorable effort of such small businesses &mdash; but which this budget has hit hardest &mdash; that we will make inroads into our high unemployment level.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic about attracting large firms here which will create 500 or 1,000 jobs in certain areas.  Recently I visited Taiwan with the chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan.  It was a very interesting exercise.  They have experienced an economic miracle there.  For example, 20 years ago their <i>per capita</i> income was $500 per head compared with $10,500 today.  They have a good work ethic and people there work very hard.  They also face many problems.  The country has <Col N="1330" /> suffered severe environmental damage which they are trying to rectify.  I spoke to many owners of small businesses employing approximately ten people who told me their government gives them an opportunity to get on their feet.  It does not hound them about owing £185.30 in VAT.  Regulations are set down and new businesses are allowed an opportunity to reinvest the money they make in their first few years of business.  In that way, businesses can expand.  In contrast, when people here start a business we batter them down with a host of regulations.</P>
    <P>People often ask why big businesses who get into trouble have been allowed to run up such high bills in tax, PRSI and so on, to the State.  They wonder how they get away with it to the point where the amount owing is frequently millions of pounds, while a small business person running a shop on a main street is hounded each month by somebody knocking on the door looking for payments.  The system is inequitable and the drift of this budget, the second introduced by this Government, is to squeeze those who the Labour Party, and perhaps Fianna Fáil, believe are wealthy.  It has been the Labour Party's line for a long time that those people are not paying their fair share, but if they revolt the result will be serious.  If they are squeezed to the limit and can take no more, they will react.</P>
    <P>Middle income families are willing to pay their fair share but they would like to see value and effectiveness for the money they pay.  They are not getting value for money at present and that is why the Minister is getting the backlash about the proposed residential property tax charges.  They do not take into account the fact that in general the people it will affect do not own their houses; the banks and building societies own them.  I recently heard a person on a radio programme say that the bills should be sent to the banks and building societies because they own most of the houses in this city and in other cities and towns around the country.  Many people with their own houses will die before they have paid for them and only if a mortgage protection <Col N="1331" /> policy is taken out will the children inherit a non-encumbered house.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks we have had a débâcle in respect of the Fingal and South Dublin County Councils.  In his budget speech the Minister referred to the new Dublin councils and stated:</P>
    <P>...this marks a quite historic change as these are the first new county councils established since the last century. The new arrangements will ensure more relevant and accessible local government in the Dublin area with a stronger focus on the needs of the areas served.</P>
    <P>Those are wonderful words, but we did not get adequate finance to deal with the huge start-up costs of the new councils. We received £1 million to cover the start-up costs of the three new county councils after inheriting a debt of £21 to £22 million from the former county council.  That is like tying a heavy weight around the neck of a baby and expecting it to learn to walk, and carry the weight wherever it goes.  Members of Fingal Council and South Dublin Council were forced to decide whether to allow democracy to die in the counties and an individual to do the Minister's bidding, or to protect people's rights in a democracy by way of council members remaining as the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment comes in here and adopts a parish priest image.  He raises his hands, his voice softens, he nods to Deputies and gives a little homily as if he were in the pulpit; but that is not good enough.  He is responsible for ensuring that local government is local.  At a time when he knew that councils would be forced into making either drastic cuts or introducing charges, he sat at the Cabinet table and allowed the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, through the extension of the residential property tax, to raid the money a council might be able to collect from people to enable it provide better local services.</P>
    <P>I hope the public recognises who is to blame for the condition of local services. The blame lies with the shenanigans of <Col N="1332" /> Fianna Fáil in 1985, when it abolished charges at a time when people had become accustomed to them, and the games it played during the past five to six years when it was responsible for Dublin county.  During that time it raided development levy funds, which were properly used to provide services for people, but not for the services for which it had been hoped to use them.  The Government might consider matters are difficult now because of the introduction of the residential property tax, but they should beware of the muster of widows, the unemployed and the many other groups who have been meanly attacked in the budget.  As they say in the best parlance, &ldquo;You ain't seen nothing yet, Minister&rdquo;.</P>

I am confident this budget will be recognised as one of the best budgets for enterprise and jobs for this country. I do not want to be side-tracked by some of the issues focused on.  I understand the Opposition focusing in a narrow way on one or two of the component elements of the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to consider this budget in its totality.  I am heartily confident that the public will appreciate the <Col N="1333" /> tremendous strides made in transforming the economy during the past 12 months and which are reflected in the budget. The January unemployment figures, which highlight a real growth in sustainable jobs &mdash; this has not been the normal January pattern &mdash; are heartening.</P>
      <P>I wish to focus on the area of responsibility for which I have at Cabinet level, namely, the health services.  The 1994 Budget and Health Estimates clearly reflect the Government's continued strong commitment to the health services of this country.  Our health services are facing new challenges in the nineties and the performance of this Government will eventually be judged by its willingness and ability to meet these challenges.  Our population is beginning to age, the number of elderly people will rise significantly over the next ten to 20 years and we will have to provide increasingly for high dependency groups in the population such as adults with a mental handicap and persons with AIDS.  The series of developments announced by me as part of the 1994 Health Estimates and those announced in this year's budget reflect the changing direction and emphasis of health service delivery towards a service which not only seeks to treat and cure but a service which above all cares for people.  The provision of additional funds for mental handicap, child care, care of the elderly, dental services and HIV-AIDS services represents a real commitment to the development of high quality community based services.  The additional provision in this year's budget in the areas of hospital waiting lists, charges, dentistry and services for the disabled build on these new developments and those begun in 1993 and demonstrated the commitment of the Government to real improvements in the caring services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1994 net Health Vote, when the additions in the budget are taken into account, is more than £1,900 million.  The provision for health represents more than one-fifth of all Government spending on supply services this year.  In comparing the provisions for health services for 1993 <Col N="1334" /> and 1994 it is necessary to take account of the significant volume of once-off expenditure which occurs in both years. When the substantial pay arrears in 1993 and the financing of health boards' debt are taken into account the increase in the post budget net vote in 1993 is approximately £148 million or 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>In 1994 we will make significant progress on the objectives set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government. In all there are eight items affecting the health services in the budget.  These are: financing health agency debt, waiting list initiative, review of hospital charges, Dublin Dental Hospital, pilot sheltered employment scheme, health cash allowances, transport for disabled people and the refund of VAT on donated research equipment.  I would like to comment in some detail on these items.</P>
    <P>The special allocation of £100 million announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech will address the problem of the accumulated excess debt of health agencies.  This excess debt was funded by high bank overdrafts and by running up extended periods of trade credit with suppliers, with consequent effects for job creation prospects for small suppliers up and down the country. These have imposed a heavy burden on small family businesses, who have had to wait a long time for payment, and on health agencies themselves through interest charges and through their inability to secure best value for food, services and other supplies.</P>
    <P>While technically this excess debt was attributable to overruns between 1984 and 1992 much of the expenditure was unavoidable and beyond the control of the agencies.  For example, the Exchequer did not have to meet the full cost of demand-led schemes until 1991. The principal demand-led schemes are the drug refund schemes and the disabled person's maintenance allowance. Between 1984 and 1990 the health board's had to meet £40 million of expenditure on these schemes for which they were not recouped.  In addition, no supplementary Estimates were sought in <Col N="1335" /> the mid-eighties in respect of other expenditure which would normally be recouped from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The injection of £100 million into the service will enable the agencies to deal with their banks and creditors on a normal commercial basis.  It will assist traders and voluntary organisations in receipt of health board grants.  It will enable the agencies to operate more efficiently in their purchasing and financing. We have talked about this problem for the past ten years.  This Government has shown that it does not talk about problems it addresses but resolves them. This is a once-off allocation which will not be repeated.  Legislation will be introduced by me shortly to strengthen financial control in the health agencies and to prevent a recurrence of the build-up of this type of debt.</P>
    <P>The waiting list initiative I announced in 1993 has led to a significant reduction in the number of people on hospital waiting lists.  I promised an additional 17,000 operations in 1993.  In fact the number of additional operations provided was 18,768.  In June 1993 there were over 40,000 people awaiting admission to acute hospitals nationally.  At the end of December 1993 this figure had been reduced by 14,757 to 25,373, a reduction of 37 per cent.  A matter of particular satisfaction was the progress achieved in relation to adults waiting more than 12 months and children waiting more than six months.  In the problem specialities, I have reduced the list from around 14,000 to around 6,000.  Similar progress was made in relation to general surgery.  I would like to pay a special tribute to those hospital staff who co-operated so whole heartedly in the Government's waiting list initiative, thereby making this reduction possible.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious to build on the success of the 1993 waiting list initiative.  The continuation of the initiative in 1994, with the special allocation of £10 million announced in the budget, will enable further major inroads to be made in problem areas.  The principal objective will continue to be the elimination <Col N="1336" /> of waiting times in excess of 12 months for adults in the problem specialties and six months for children for ENT and ophthalmology.  A detailed review is under way on the experience gained during 1993 and the Department will be discussing with the health agencies in the coming weeks the arrangements to be put in place during 1994.</P>
    <P>I am sure that all Deputies will be pleased with the progress now being made to ensure that no patient has to wait an inordinate length of time for treatment.  It has been most gratifying to be associated with this development and I want to thank everyone in my Department and throughout the service who have made it possible.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the system of hospital charges has been reviewed and reformed. In March 1993 the existing charge of £10 in respect of the first treatment for any particular condition was replaced with a new charge of £6 which applied to each visit, subject to a maximum of £42 in any 12 month period.  These changes in charges were necessary because of the difficult budgetary situation at that time and the need to ensure that essential health services were maintained.</P>
    <P>I signalled my misgivings about the operation and application of hospital charges and I announced the establishment of a review group on hospital charges last April.  Having considered its recommendations, I have decided to make the following changes which will take effect from 1 March 1994: the present anomaly which leads to a double charge for people admitted to hospital overnight will be removed.  For example, a person admitted in the evening and discharged the following morning is often charged for two days.  I will now amend the regulations to remove this anomaly; I am happy that the £6 charge for attendances at out-patient departments will be abolished.  The review group had identified a number of anomalies and inequities in relation to the application of the charge to out-patient services and I have accepted the group's view that these would be impossible to rectify fully, other than by the abolition of the charge; the <Col N="1337" /> £6 charge at accident and emergency departments will also be abolished. However, persons who attend the accident and emergency department directly, without a referral note from their general practitioner, will be liable for a charge of £12 which will apply only to the first visit for any episode of care. Any subsequent treatment during that episode will be free of charge.  Patients referred by the general practitioner will not have to pay this charge.  The present exemptions will continue to apply, the main exempted category being medical card holders.</P>
    <P>These reforms will remove the anomalies-inequities in the present system; support the development of primary care, particularly in urban areas, by removing the incentive to use the accident and emergency department for the treatment of conditions which would be more appropriately dealt with by the general practitioner; reduce the costs of public hospital services to patients and greatly simplify collection and administration procedures in hospitals.  The cost of these charges in 1994 will be £5 million.</P>
    <P>I have commenced a major series of improvements in our dental services in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  The existing Dublin Dental Hospital and School, normally referred to as the Dublin Dental Hospital, was originally built 95 years ago.  The facilities are spread over two sites, the main hospital building at Lincoln Place and Dunlop-Oriel House at Westland Row-Fenian Street.</P>
    <P>The school is an important academic centre for the training of dentists, for their post-graduate training and for the training of dental auxiliaries.  It currently provides undergraduate training in dental science for 35 students each year. The students play an important role in providing patient services.  Over the years the Dublin Dental Hospital has performed an essential role in meeting requirements of the dental services. When originally built it was designed to cater for 2,500 patients per annum.  It currently has 87,000 patient attendances <Col N="1338" /> per annum.  It provides a wide range of services, including routine primary dental care and specialist services to Dublin city and the Leinster area in general. It provides tertiary care on a national basis outside the Munster area which is serviced by Cork Dental Hospital.</P>
    <P>For a number of years the buildings of the Dublin Dental Hospital have been in a poor state of repair and a cause for concern because the existing structures have not been capable of being modified to meet required fire safety standards. The fact that throughout this difficult period the hospital has managed to provide an excellent service and to maintain an excellent academic standard, despite the poor state of the premises, is a tribute to all involved but particularly to the staff and students, and I would like to pay a tribute to them on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Early last year the three Ministers involved &mdash; Education, Finance and Health &mdash; accepted that the present situation could not continue.  An inter-departmental group was established to address the issue.  The report of the group recognised the need to locate a dental hospital and school in Dublin and recommended the refurbishment and extension of the existing buildings at Lincoln Place and Westland Row.  The Government accepted the report and the Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Statement that he will provide £1 million in 1994 to commence the refurbishment and extension of the Dublin Dental Hospital in Lincoln Place and Westland Row which will be completed over the next four years at an estimated total cost of £8 million.  This is a most welcome development. This allocation will ensure the future of the hospital as a first-class public dental facility availed of by thousands of citizens each year, many of whom would otherwise have difficulty in getting dental treatment.</P>
    <P>Changes in the overall labour market in Ireland in recent years, in particular, the increase in the rate of unemployment, have brought about a significant deterioration in the job prospects of people with disabilities.  In this situation, there <Col N="1339" /> is general agreement that there is a need for a more structured system of sheltered employment for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The pilot scheme announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget is designed to assist viable enterprises established to employ people with disabilities. It is envisaged that the scheme will have two elements: (i) a capital fund to assist the establishment and development of such enterprises.  This would be in addition to grant aid which might be available from sources such as Forbairt and the County Enterprise Boards, and (ii) an employment subsidy grant to be paid to the enterprise.  Workers would retain the secondary benefits which they held prior to employment in the enterprise.</P>
    <P>The £2 million provided in 1994 comprises £0.75 million in respect of start-up costs and £1.25 million in respect of the employment subsidy.  Proposals for the development of such enterprises have been received from the Rehabilitation Institute and preliminary discussions and examination of these have already taken place.  The scheme now announced will not, however, be confined to Rehab and the establishment of viable enterprises by other organisations or companies will receive equal consideration by my Department.  The programme will be overseen by the Department of Health. It is envisaged that the programme will run for a pilot period of three years.  I will be particularly concerned to ensure that only viable enterprises are supported through this programme.  It will not be helpful to anyone in the longer term if the enterprises do not prove to be viable on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>Arrangements will be put in place to ensure that all Departments concerned with issues of disability will be involved in its operation and monitoring.  Further discussions will take place immediately between the relevant Government Departments and the agencies involved to agree the detailed arrangements for the introduction of the pilot programme as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A sum of £100,000 has been allocated <Col N="1340" /> to assist voluntary organisations to improve transport arrangements for people with disabilities, particularly for adapting vehicles to facilitate easier transport.  This expenditure will have a marked improvement on the quality of everyday life for many disabled people. The details of this expenditure will be planned jointly with the Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>With effect from July 1994, an increase of 3 per cent will be applied to cash allowances and cash grants such as disabled persons maintenance allowance, blind welfare allowances and payments under the long term illness scheme.  This is in line with the increases in social welfare and will more than maintain the value of these payments and protect them against inflation.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced in his Budget Statement that he is extending the present refund arrangements relating to donated medical equipment to cover donated research equipment used in the medical laboratories of universities and similar institutions. While the details of the arrangements have yet to be worked out, it is likely that the system will work on lines similar to those introduced in 1992 for a full refund of VAT on qualifying equipment purchased by or donated to hospitals through voluntary donations.</P>
    <P>In framing the 1994 Estimate the Government is determined to provide the best possible standard of health service and to direct additional resources to areas of special need.  The provisions made in the budget for the health services are clear evidence of the Government's commitment to the development of a first class health service.  Strict control of health spending and more accountable management will continue to form key elements of health policy.</P>
    <P>We in the health services have a special role to play to ensure that the large proportion of national resources spent on health is used wisely and effectively.  I look forward to a year in which, working together, we will build on the significant progress achieved in 1993 and continue to provide services of the highest quality <Col N="1341" /> and standard, responsive to the needs of all who depend on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I want first to refer to the effects of the budget on the lives of ordinary people.  I have followed the budget debate very carefully and listened to the contributions of both Government and Opposition Deputies.  Some of the points I wish to make have been made by previous speakers but as a public representative I believe it is my duty to highlight the lack of financial provisions in the budget.</P>
      <P>Many speakers referred to the poor conditions of roads due to the lack of adequate finance for local authorities. County roads in particular are deteriorating at an alarming rate because local authorities have not been given adequate resources to repair and maintain them properly.  In parts of Connemara tá na bóithre ró-uafásach.</P>
      <P>Because of neglect over the past number of years and the hilly nature of the countryside, the condition of roads in Connemara is particularly bad.  It is false economy for the Government not to allocate proper funding for the maintenance and upkeep of roads, particularly county roads.  If roads are neglected surfaces become damaged and potholes appear.  Once the surface is worn away water running down from hills, as in the case of Connemara, and rainfall in the case of other roads, washes away the foundation.  It will cost the Government billions of pounds to restore these roads to a proper condition in the future than it will now cost them to fill in potholes and maintain county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The condition of the roads in some parts of County Galway and other counties have gone beyond a joke; it is now a serious issue.  The funding made available to Galway County Council for county roads will only enable the county engineering staff to surface-dress the roads every 45 years.  This intolerable situation cannot be allowed to continue.  County councils must be given adequate funding to enable them to surface-dress county roads every few years.  If this work is not carried out it will cost billions of pounds <Col N="1342" /> more to restore county roads in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is in the House because I want to raise a question I am often asked by my constituents: when will grants due to farmers be paid?  It is now almost impossible to get through to Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry offices on the phone and the staff are more than fully stretched in dealing with these applications.  Farmers who phone the Department or call into their local office cannot get the information they require.  This situation is causing a lot of frustration among applicants who are legitimately entitled to this money. For example, many farmers who applied for their premium payments in January 1993 have still not been paid.  Furthermore, the staff in the Department cannot deal with inquiries about these cases because the system is completely bogged down.</P>
    <P>Because of the forthcoming European elections perhaps we will go back to the situation of 1992 when grants were paid in reasonable time.  I am informed that second payments for cattle and suckler cow grants, promised by the Government at the end of January, will not be made until April or May.  This intolerable situation cannot be allowed to continue and I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to investigate this problem so that he can tell farmers at the beginning of the year that they will receive their payments when they are due.  That would save much time, effort and frustration on the part of farmers and the Minister's staff who are stretched beyond capacity in dealing with daily inquiries to their offices.  If that was the only thing the Minister did in his term of office it would represent a great day's work and he would be remembered as the Minister who had tackled and resolved the problem.</P>
    <P>I read the various contributions on this budget to see what proposals there were in regard to jobs and solving the serious problem of the 300,000 people unemployed. Nothing in this budget will relieve the unemployment problem, <Col N="1343" /> people who are genuinely looking for work but who cannot get it.  Job creation is taxed as much now as before this budget.  The Minister for Health referred earlier to the fact that the effects of this budget will only become apparent later but already some of the budget proposals have made headlines.  It will become increasingly obvious that nothing has been done in the budget to relieve the plight of the 300,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>Last week in Galway the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, attended a press conference at which he announced the possibility of the creation of 500 jobs.  I also welcome Boston Scientific to Galway, we are happy to have those jobs following the announcement a year ago of the loss of 780 jobs in Digital.  At that time a task force was set up to see how the crisis as a result of the layoffs in Digital could be handled, I compliment those who worked on the task force and the people of Galway who did not throw in the towel but tried to redeem the unfortunate situation.  That work has proved fruitful; we have now almost replaced the number of jobs lost in Digital.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with one aspect of the Minister's visit to Galway.  He seemed to indicate that the task force had achieved its objective and could now be disbanded.  I do not believe that is the case in Galway, no more than any other city.  In Galway county 19,000 people are unemployed, in Galway city the unemployment figures have increased in the past two and a half years from over 5,000 to almost 9,000.  Therefore, no one can be complacent although it might appear to people in other parts of the country that we are doing well in Galway, that jobs are being created and that local people are making a great effort, with the assistance of State agencies, to secure jobs for the city and the county.  Great efforts have been made but, lest anyone get the wrong impression, there is much work still to be done in Galway.  The task force should not be abolished.  It should be renewed and perhaps channel its energies in the direction of assisting local <Col N="1344" /> people to set up their own industries and create jobs.  There is a tremendous amount of work for this task force in Galway, the work is not complete and if the Minister has not yet made a final decision to disband it I ask him not to do so because it is essential to allow it to continue its work on behalf of the people of Galway in reducing the figure of 19,000 unemployed.</P>
    <P>One of the more controversial proposals in the budget is the property tax or rather the tax on people's homes.  The campaign against this tax has been taken up by members of the Opposition and the media, in a vigorous manner and, from what I read in the newspapers, with some success.  I also read about the concessions the Government is now prepared to make.  The Minister for Finance was quoted this morning as saying he would give a categorical assurance that he would not increase the threshold of this tax and that the house value thresholds would not be further reduced.  I read the Minister's January 1992 budget speech in which he gave a categorical assurance that the levels would not be reduced so I am not sure whether we should believe him now.  I hope he is expressing his true feelings but certainly what he said in January 1992 proved not to be the case because he reduced the house value threshold from £91,200 to £75,000 and the income threshold from £28,100 to £25,000.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this measure which I consider a step in the wrong direction is that the £25,000 income threshold might be regarded as a large income.  Those interviewed at a shopping centre in Dublin yesterday thought that £25,000 was a very good income and saw no reason people would not pay tax on their homes.  However, the provision in the budget is in regard to a total family income of £25,000.  I was so surprised by this provision that I queried it with officials in the Department of Finance on the morning following the budget and I was assured that the figure was £25,000 per household to bring people into the property tax net.  That is an anti-family <Col N="1345" /> measure because, for example, if a husband or wife earns £16,000 or £17,000 and have two adult children living in the house earning £4,000 each, and if the value of that person's home was in excess of £75,000 they would fall within the residential property tax net.  It would appear to me that that would place pressure on some young people because if one of the children in that home was not a wage earner or living in the home, they would not fall within the ambit of the tax net. The easiest thing for such a parent to do &mdash; the regulation would place such pressure &mdash; would be to put pressure on the young person to leave the family home and move to rented accommodation. That constitutes an attack on the family.</P>
    <P>I raised the point previously with the Minister for Social Welfare about the attack on the family from the other end of that scale &mdash; I note no budgetary provision to rectify this matter &mdash; whereby young unemployed people in the family home who apply for unemployment assistance are deemed to be ineligible because they are living with their parents. If that same young person moves out of the family home into private rented accommodation, in Galway city or elsewhere, he or she is eligible for unemployment assistance.  As he or she is now in receipt of unemployment assistance and living in rented accommodation, the following week or so they can apply to the relevant health board and receive a rent subsidy.  It will clearly be seen that in the long run, this costs the State much more money that had such people been granted some social welfare allowance and been permitted to remain in the family home.  It was and is a crazy stipulation that young people living in the family home did not qualify for unemployment assistance while those forced to move out of the family home were deemed to be eligible.</P>
    <P>In that regulation, applied between the Departments of Social Welfare and Health, it is obvious there is no liaison between Government Departments on what might affect one Department's budget so long as the budget of the other <Col N="1346" /> Department was all right.  Similarly, in the case of the tax on homes, it is clear that no consideration was given to the fact that this was an anti-family tax.  I read in this morning's paper that the Minister was considering taking the income of the principal earner in the home only into account in the assessment of this tax.  If that is the case it would appear that the vigorous campaign in the media and elsewhere is having an effect on the Government, forcing it to rethink.</P>
    <P>One other budgetary provision, elaborated on by the Minister for Social Welfare in his contribution, is something about which I have spoken in every budget debate for the past three years.  I refer to the carer's allowance scheme, introduced three years ago, which I welcomed provided people were allowed to qualify under its provisions.  In giving the Minister full recognition for its introduction, I stated that any scheme under which an allowance would be paid to a person caring full-time for somebody who might otherwise be in a health board institution is very good.</P>
    <P>The rate on its introduction was £45 which has now been increased to £57.10. Unfortunately, three years after its introduction, out of an approximate 100,000 carers, no more than 5,000 qualify for this allowance and some are eligible for part only.  The fears I expressed then were well founded since people are not qualifying under its provisions.  I note that the Minister for Social Welfare said that, under the budgetary provisions, an extra 500 carers will now qualify for the allowance and a further 350 existing carers will receive increases.  The figure of 500 extra carers is very small compared with the approximate 90,000 carers at present outside the qualification limits.  I raised this matter very often with the Minister, as have others.  The Carers Association have constantly raised the matter with the Minister but, unfortunately, we do not seem to have the same effect that the lobby against the residential property tax had in the short period since the Minister's Budget Statement. Possibly that is because carers are so involved, on a 24-hour, 365 days of <Col N="1347" /> the year basis, caring for people they have not had time to form an effective lobby group to bombard the Minister about the inadequacies of the regulations pertaining to the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>I ask the media, who so gallantly took up the case on behalf of home owners who will be brought within the residential property tax net, to take up the case of carers.  I shall at every possible opportunity highlight the inadequacies of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>I raised individual cases with the Minister for Social Welfare.  A woman I know who applied for the carer's allowance is minding a doubly incontinent bedridden person in her home.  Her husband had 12 cattle and 40 sheep and that amounted to the total of his farming activities.  As a result of several visits by a social welfare officer that woman &mdash; caring for that person 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year &mdash; was deemed to be ineligible for the carer's allowance because her income was nine pence above the guidelines.  Lest the Minister present, or the Minister for Social Welfare who may be listening or read this debate, might think I am not speaking factually, I shall give the reference number in that case which is, 24/5687580B.  That case should be investigated.</P>
    <P>The last time I quoted such cases in the House in the presence of the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister informed me that if I was concerned about any cases I should document them for him and he would take a personal interest in their investigation.  I wrote to the Minister several times, the last occasion being 10 November 1993.  I am sorry to say I received no reply to any of my correspondence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to quote another case to which I received no reply following my representations, the reference is, 23/5696621N.  I am highlighting cases of which I have a thorough knowledge and in respect of which I know in <Col N="1348" /> my heart and soul the carer is entitled to the allowance.</P>
      <P>Whenever I telephone the Department of Social Welfare in Sligo and speak to the appropriate officer I am told that my views may be correct but Deputies are the people who lay down the regulations and the officials merely implement them. I take no responsibility for a regulation that disqualifies the type of people about whom I speak from the carer's allowance. Eligibility for the carer's allowance should be based on the income of the carer rather than on that of the household. The carers to whom I have referred will continue to care, because of their Christian charity, for the people concerned. However, the fact that they are snubbed and insulted by the Department of Social Welfare is a severe body blow to them.  Those people are only seeking recognition for the wonderful work they do in caring for people who would otherwise cost the State £300 to £500 per week in institutional care.  Once the Department of Social Welfare keeps its budget in order it does not seem to matter what it costs the Department of Health to pick up the tab.  There ought to be more liaison between the various Government Departments so that if an obvious saving can be made to the State as between different Departments, it will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Galway Carer's Group made a submission prior to the budget seeking the removal of the means test clause in the case of both the carer and the person being cared for.  The following examples might highlight the ridiculous nature of the position.  To receive the full carer's allowance, a person must not have an income of more than £2 per week.  That is ridiculous.  Any income in excess of that amount is deducted from the allowance. In other words if the carer is in receipt of over £59 per week, or is deemed to have an income in excess of that amount they are disqualified from receiving the allowance.  Any couple whose joint income exceeds £95 per week will not qualify.  That is a ridiculous cut off point for a person who is doing such wonderful work, as acknowledged by the Minister for Social Welfare, in his several <Col N="1349" /> addresses on this matter here.  Elderly people should retain their entitlement to electricity and fuel allowances in the event of a carer having to move in with them as happens sometimes because of distance or because the person being cared for cannot be left alone at night.</P>
    <P>I could easily have spent my entire 30 minutes speaking on the issue of carers. Because those people are not in a position to make a case for themselves they must depend on their local representatives and on people in the media to highlight their position.  I can assure carers that if their case is taken up by the media and if they become a lobby a group, like the lobby group to oppose the residential property tax, their campaign will be successful, too.  We have made a slight breakthrough in the budget but it will help only a minority of carers who are ineligible at present for the carer's allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh) Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Power.  I am pleased to participate in this debate on a budget which I believe is good for the overall economy and good in particular, for the sectors of agriculture, food and forestry for which I have responsibility. The farming sector has had two good years in 1992 and 1993.  Aggregate farm income net of interest payments increased by 37 per cent over the two years.  I believe that the provisions in the budget will assist the farm sector in making further improvements in income in 1994 &mdash; and beyond.</P>
      <P>In discussing the agriculture, food and forestry sector, it is also necessary to acknowledge that budget decisions will only ever fill in one part of the policy picture.  There are other major policy measures &mdash; both EU and national &mdash; which are of vital importance to the people working in the sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the various EU price and market support schemes are central.  The CAP reform accompanying measures, relating to farmer retirement, agri-environment and forestry, will have an important role in 1994 and beyond.  The <Col N="1350" /> National Development Plan for 1994 to 1999 will provide substantial resources from the EU Structural Funds.  The plan has, of course, yet to be agreed with the European Commission, and negotiations on the plan with the Commission will soon commence.  But already, certain provision has been made in the 1994 Estimates for the matching national funding to get certain schemes underway.</P>
    <P>So the various market supports, income supports, investment incentives and taxation arrangements represent a complex and interlinked policy for the agriculture, food and forestry sectors. They also represent, in my view, a coherent policy for the sectors.  I am very pleased, therefore, that these various strands of policy have been brought together in the new National Programme for Competitiveness and Work.  Within this programme, there will be, for the farming, food, forestry and rural sectors, a programme for competitiveness and rural development.</P>
    <P>This programme represents an agreed agenda between the Government and the farm organisations.  The Government has undertaken to do certain things, either at national level or in the context of negotiation at EU level.  This agenda will provide the framework within which Irish farming and the food industry must increasingly take its own responsibility for its wellbeing.  We all know that cost efficiency and quality levels must improve.  Government can, and will, assist in this process, but the industry itself must rise to the challenges which confront it.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight a number of decisions taken in the budget and in the Estimates which already make a major contribution to the programme for competitiveness and rural development.</P>
    <P>The first issue relates to CAP premium and headage payments.  As 1993-94 was the first year of CAP reform, there was a major increase in the number and complexity of EU schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The total number of applications was in the order of 650,000.  This has admittedly given rise to problems, <Col N="1351" /> both for the administrative system within the Department and for farmers.</P>
    <P>The position is that more than 500,000 payments amounting to over £377 million were made to farmers under the various premium and headage schemes in the year ended 31 December 1993.  This compares with total payments of £350 million in the year ended 31 December 1992. The high payment levels in 1993 were achieved against the background of EU regulations which preclude payments under the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes before 1 November and even then limit the payments to 60 per cent advances.</P>
    <P>The efficient and timely payment of CAP premia and headage payments is a major priority for me and for the Government. As an indication of that priority, the Estimates had provided £2.8 million for computer facilities and the budget provided an additional £2 million for additional staff.  This is of course in addition to the extra staff I have provided as a result of the £4.4 million.  I secured in the 1993 budget allocation.  A large proportion of the resources for additional staff and the computer equipment will go towards the provision of an on-line system linking the Department's local offices to headquarters.  This system should be in place by end-June 1994 and should play a key role in delivering a more effective and prompt service in making payments to farmers.  I wish to make those payments to farmers when they are due.  That is the objective.  The year 1994 is the first year of the implementation of the full CAP reform scheme.  The payments are no more than what farmers are entitled to and it is the function of the Department to administer those schemes and make those payments. There is no excuse, and I am not making any excuse here.  Farmers should be paid when payments are due.</P>
    <P>The new computer and on-line facilities and additional staff should play a critical role in assisting us to meet the commitment which has been entered into in the context of the programme for competitiveness and rural development &mdash;<Col N="1352" /> that there will be a further improvement in the delivery of all CAP compensatory payments in 1994 relative to 1993 and that in 1995 payment of all eligible premium claims will be made within three months of application where this is permissible under EU rules.  If I do that, as Deputy McCormack said, the people will put up a statue of me in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister every credit, and I will invite him down for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further important commitment in the programme for competitiveness and rural development, which has a consequence for the agriculture and food Vote in 1994. Additional resources will be provided during 1994 as a first step to moving progressively, over the three years of the programme, to a position where all valid claims for headage payments will be paid by October of the year in question.</P>
      <P>The budget was a tax reforming budget and farmers, like other taxpayers, will benefit from the substantial changes in regard to income tax levies.  I particularly welcome the extension of the PAYE allowance to the children of farmers, as well as to self-employed persons, working at home.  This is a positive measure to support the family farm unit.  In the Year of the Family I am glad that we could do a number of things that would assist farm families.</P>
      <P>On the capital taxation front, there were substantial improvements in the budget and these have been further built upon in the programme for competitiveness and work.  I want to be quite clear as to the thinking behind these decisions by Government.  Farming is a highly capital intensive business, producing relatively low income returns per unit of capital.  The taxation code has traditionally acknowledged this and this year's changes are a further example of that acknowledgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget increased the agricultural relief and the thresholds for gifts and inheritance in relation to farm land and buildings.  In addition, a relief to gifts <Col N="1353" /> and inheritances of other farm assets&mdash; including livestock and machinery &mdash; was introduced for the first time in the budget.  For the probate tax, a 30 per cent relief for agricultural land and buildings was introduced in recognition of the special circumstances of farming.  In addition, farmers, like other taxpayers, gain from the introduction of a full exemption for spouses and the retrospection of these reliefs to the date of its introduction on 18 June 1993 will mean that no spouse will have to pay probate tax, and all credit is due to the ICA for highlighting that anomaly.</P>
    <P>The Government has also made a commitment in the programme for competitiveness and rural development that there will be improvements in the 1994 Finance Bill in relation to capital allowances for farm buildings and structures and in relation to stamp duty for farm transfers to trained young farmers.  As Deputies know, Macra na Feirme, particularly, are concerned about the cost of stamp duty in transferring land to young farmers.  The move on stamp duty is designed to accelerate the transfer of farms to younger people &mdash; something which I see as important in preparing for the more competitive days ahead.  This change in stamp duty should also work hand in hand with the farmer retirement scheme to promote such transfers.  I should also mention that the budget increased the allocation for this scheme from £5 million to £7.5 million in light of the considerable interest expressed in the scheme.</P>
    <P>In summary, on taxation, we have put in place a taxation system for farmers which recognises the capital intensity of their business and which should promote the type of farm transfer and structural change which will be necessary if the competitive challenge of the future is to be met.</P>
    <P>The food industry is at the centre of this Government's policy for both the industrial and the agricultural sectors.  It is a major source of manufacturing jobs and value added.  The industry has to increasingly link with the farming sector to meet consumer demands.  A number <Col N="1354" /> of the taxation changes in the budget, both in relation to income and capital taxation, should benefit the food industry. In addition, £7 million is provided for institutional R and D in the food sector.  This will be part-funded by the EU.  The long term future of the food industry is in producing higher value products and I want the industry to have the necessary R and D base to achieve this.</P>
    <P>Work is continuing at an accelerated pace on the legislation to set up An Bord Bia, the new Irish Food Board.  I expect that the legislation to establish An Bord Bia, will be introduced in the House during this session.  The establishment of An Bord Bia is part of the Government's response to the challenges facing the food industry.  It will provide a more co-ordinated and streamlined approach to the promotion and marketing of our foodstuffs and should provide new impetus in this area.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia has been allocated £2.6 million in the budget in addition to funding available to existing food promotion agencies.  This will enable the new agency to make an immediate impact on the food markets throughout Europe and the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the new programme places such importance on rural development. For 1994, funding for Leader and INTERREG is, at £21 million, being more than doubled.  The year 1993 saw a process of review and assessment by individual Leader groups with better evaluation of projects.  For the future, the emphasis must be on harnessing local community leadership and initiative to further develop our rural areas.  I am committed to negotiate a substantial increase in funding for a new comprehensive Leader programme to be operated by my Department.</P>
    <P>Spending on forestry-related activities will be at an all-time high in 1994.  The public capital programme provides for an expenditure of over £80 million in 1994 in this sector, which is almost 90 per cent greater than the outturn for 1993.</P>
    <P>The substantial commitment of additional resources this year reflects the <Col N="1355" /> Government's determination to develop the forest sector's potential to provide employment opportunities and create wealth in rural Ireland, often in remote areas where opportunities are otherwise limited.</P>
    <P>The development of the forest sector is fully consistent with both the Programme for a Partnership Government and the Budget Statement of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who, in his speech, stressed the importance of improving the country's infrastructure in order to achieve further economic progress.  The establishment of new plantations will continue to be the main focus in 1994 and beyond.  This is very much a case of infrastructural improvement which will result in the creation of new jobs.  A very recent example of the kind of development opportunity presented by the forest sector is the Oriented Strand Board Mill in Waterford which will be a major boost to that region, along with the modernisation and the further expansion of the Medite Plant in Clonmel.</P>

      <P>I welcome my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, to the House.  A number of the other areas dealt with in the budget were useful in laying the groundwork for a more competitive agriculture and food industry, and a more diversified rural economy.  An additional £5.5 million was provided for Teagasc which is doing such an excellent job in supporting the development and improvement of agriculture.  The Government is fully committed to the promotion and development of the horticultural industry which is a highly labour intensive sector.  An additional £175,000 has been provided for An Bord Glas bringing its grant-in-aid for 1994 to £1.316 million.  I was pleased to be able to make £50,000 available for Macra na Feirme on their 50th anniversary celebrations, in recognition of the outstanding work they have done for <Col N="1356" /> agriculture and in developing farm leaders throughout their 50 years.</P>
      <P>The allocation for the horse racing industry in 1994 is doubled to £6.55 million. This is being made available in the context of my proposals for a new structure for the industry which I hope and trust will become the vehicle that facilitates the achievement of the industry's full development potential and secure the long-term future of this valuable sector. I expect to introduce legislation to Government in the next week or so and to have the Bill circulated later this month.  I hope to have some exciting finishes in this industry before the year is out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That will include trotting. With regard to residue testing, an extra £1.5 million was provided in the budget for the programme of residue testing in meat.  In the future we will be able to give an assurance that meat will be safe to eat, free of any harmful or illegal residues.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased that £1 million has been made available in the budget to ease losses incurred by horticultural farmers following the severe storm damage in 1993.  Advertisements appeared in the newspapers this week so people can apply in good time for such assistance.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, got many things right in this year's budget and honesty demands that those who called for certain things should acknowledge they have been done.  One would have to go back a long time to find a budget as friendly as this to the interest of workers, farmers and indeed the business community.  The living standards of workers will be protected by lower taxes; unit payroll costs of employers will fall when the new agreement to replace the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> comes into force.  Changes in the capital taxation regime go a long way to meeting the long standing demands of farmers.  Trade unions and farm organisations have done particularly well in the budget and the 1 per cent levy has been abolished.  It received a great deal of publicity last year when it was introduced in spite of the Minister's assertions that it was a short term measure but its removal has been ignored by the Opposition parties.  There have been significant increases in tax allowances and a series of measures which make it easier and more profitable to do business.  The former Taoiseach, the late Mr. Seán Lemass said that when farming is doing well, the whole country is doing well and one has only to look at the recent Central Bank figures of farmers' deposits at just under £1 billion to realise the considerable purchasing power in the sector which will filter through to the rural economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, who presided over the great recovery in farm incomes.  Despite the predictions of the prophets of doom and gloom he steered the industry to the point where farm incomes are at an all time <Col N="1358" /> high.  I am sure the Deputies opposite will agree.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in the budget, with the measures now being negotiated in the new programme, will help to consolidate the spectacular progress in the agricultural sector.  The improvement in the capital acquisitions tax, which includes a relief on livestock and machinery, will facilitate the transfer of viable farm businesses <Col N="1359" /> from one generation to the next. This is very important as most land transfers are between members of the family rather than on the open market.  Greater land mobility can be achieved by promoting inter-family transfers than through any other measure.  As a result of recent changes, the vast majority of farmers will not have to pay capital acquisition tax when taking over a farm. For those farmers who still have to pay the tax, the changes in this year's budget will reduce the amount payable quite considerably, for example a son or daughter taking over a farm valued at £500,000 will now have to pay £26,000 inheritance tax compared with £82,000 last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

      <P>A family member inheriting a farm with a total value of £250,000 will have to pay only £4,000 as a result of the changes in this year's budget.</P>
      <P>The changes in the probate tax are also very significant.  In this year's budget, spouses are exempted from the tax and the agricultural relief reduces the value of land, quota and buildings by 30 per cent for probate tax.  The farm organisations now admit that the back of the probate tax has been broken and that it will no longer be a major problem for most farm families.</P>

      <P>A new single national computer network that will make the old blue card system redundant is planned.  When it is operational it will be possible to establish the whereabouts and background of any animal.  It will also be possible to pay all premia and headage payments, where EC regulations permit, within three months of receipt of application when the new computerised system is fully in place.  With the extra resources envisaged under the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> deal it will help to ensure that 100 per cent of headage payments are made in the calendar year in which they are due.  These developments are welcomed. Now that these payments are worth over £600 million each year to livestock and tillage farmers and constitute a major portion of their income it is important that cheques are paid on time.  Our record in this regard leaves a lot to be desired but we look forward to improvements in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on making an additional £5.5 million available to Teagasc for development and restructuring. I understand that approximately £2.5 million of this is to be used to fund an early retirement scheme within the organisation.  Teagasc will be significant beneficiary of Structural Funds over the next six years under the terms of the National Development Plan.  The organisation has gone through a rough patch <Col N="1361" /> in recent years because of pressure on its finances.  Shortly, for the first time, Teagasc will be able to plan its finances as well as its research, advisory and education programmes on a medium-term basis knowing what funding to expect over a defined period.  I understand also that the case made by the Government to the European Union Commission on behalf of Teagasc envisages an enhanced role for the organisation in the areas of rural business, forestry and community development as well as its traditional farming role, which is welcomed.  I am also delighted with the £500 provided from the Estimate and that the allocation is being increased by a further £500,000 in the budget.  It is clear from the huge turnout at the information meetings on the scheme organised by the Department with Teagasc that there is a huge interest in the scheme and this will undoubtedly help to improve the structure of Irish agriculture.</P>

      <P>Most people appreciate these informative meetings, which are particularly relevant to people who are considering availing of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Given the bad publicity about the use of angel dust and illegal hormones in meat production I am glad that extra resources are being allocated for technology to develop rapid screening systems for the detection of residues in meat.  This will enable further specific guarantees to be given in relation to the status of our meat production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the features of the budget I am not emamoured with is the growth in public spending, described by some people as an explosion.  Day-to-day Government spending will rise by approximately 8 per cent to a projected £9.3 billion.  There is slippage between the increase in public spending and the taxes needed to fund it.  If we do not control this upward spiral taxes will inexorably have to be increased further to bridge the gap.  While I acknowledge much progress has been made in this <Col N="1362" /> regard since 1987 it is estimated the national debt increased to 102.25 per cent of GNP at the end of last year compared with 99.6 per cent at the end of the previous year.  This trend must not be allowed to continue.  I have no wish to hand on an economic straitjacket to the next generation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1990 the National Treasury Management Agency was established. I had the privilege of visiting its offices and found it a very satisfying experience to see the experts, led by the chief executive, Mr. Michael Somers, managing the national debt in a professional way.  We can gain some comfort from this.</P>
      <P>With regard to the semi-State bodies, as we are all aware, Aer Lingus finds itself in serious financial difficulty.  At the end of 1992 it had debts of more than £500 million while Aer Rianta had debts of almost £40 million.  Earlier this year Bord na Móna had debts in excess of £180 million while in the middle of last year Telecom Éireann had debts of more than £1,000 million.  While a number of excellent people work in these bodies the debts incurred are not being managed in a professional way.  In this regard large savings could be made.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Finance to extend the remit of the National Treasury Management Agency to include semi-State bodies and, possibly, some of the local authorities.  Even though this agency has been operating only for a few years it has secured tremendous savings for the State.  Given the size of the national debt it is important that it is managed in a professional way and that we get the best value for money.  I wish to pay tribute to those involved in the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In previous budget debates I called on the Minister for Defence to commence recruitment to the Defence Forces.  I am delighted therefore that the Minister, Deputy Andrews, has decided to do so. Different arrangements have been made <Col N="1363" /> on this occasion in that people will be recruited on a five year contract.  In this regard the fears expressed by some people &mdash; they are of the opinion we are going to recruit what they refer to as &ldquo;yellow packs&rdquo;&mdash; are groundless.  The truth is that any man or woman will be able to join for a period much longer than five years.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the budget which, according to many commentators, was one of the best ever introduced. While the Fine Gael Party, and other parties in Opposition, find it difficult to analyse it the fact is we are prepared as <Col N="1364" /> a party to debate the positive aspects in any forum, including this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party in particular has tried to cloud the budget and decided to run with one dry bone but there is nowhere else for it to run except down a cul-de-sac as is clear from recent opinion polls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

      <P>I travelled more than 150 miles in my constituency last weekend and met hundreds of people and not one of them mentioned the items referred to by Fine Gael.  I am sure there are people in my constituency living in houses worth more than £75,000 but, as has been pointed out by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, who is present, irrespective of the small contribution to be raised in broadening the tax net, their take home pay will increase by some £600 this year. That is what tax reform is all about; it involves much more than lowering taxes as advocated by Fine Gael.  It should be remembered also that it has advocated expenditure cuts.</P>
      <P>In general the budget has been well received.  Some people are anxious about various aspects of it which may affect them and we have an obligation to explain the position to them.  Some of the best paid commentators have used the airwaves to promote their own vested interests.  I would say to those people that this budget is about job creation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 300,000 people unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to give people an opportunity to re-enter the labour market.  I ask the Opposition to look again at the budget as it contains an abundance of good measures in this regard. The Deputy is correct in saying that almost 300,000 people are unemployed <Col N="1365" /> but that problem has been addressed in the budget as the Deputy, and everyone else, believes it should be addressed.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that one member of the Opposition is listening because usually when I rise to speak Members opposite get so upset that they do not want to listen.  I wish to draw their attention to the fact that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, announced a package of measures which will address some of the problems.  Under the community employment programme, there will be an enterprise fund of £100 million for small and medium-sized businesses. That programme will provide jobs in local authorities and in the private sector for some 40,000 people by the end of this year.  This measure will address the needs of the unemployed and, more important, the long term unemployed, in a manner that will give those people the opportunity to re-enter the jobs market. This innovative programme has been developed through experience with other schemes such as the social employment scheme, the community development programme and the VTOS which is run by vocational colleges.  The Minister should look at the area addressed by the Teamwork scheme, particularly as used to assist in schools for the handicapped and places where people with special needs are cared for.  The teamwork scheme was specifically designed for younger people who had just left school and were prepared to apply themselves on a vocational basis to help younger disadvantaged people and in the process gain experience that would help them to get into the workplace later.  Before we abolish Teamwork we should look at the need it met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must give the long term unemployed a second chance &mdash; in some cases a first chance &mdash; to reintegrate into the labour market.  It is imperative that we reawaken the economic potential of people who were previously ignored by Government although not by this one.  This Government, with a Labour Party input of which we are proud, has also introduced the most innovative enterprise scheme ever devised.  A total of £100 <Col N="1366" /> million is being made available at fixed interest rates for ten years.  This was done in response to proposals from the Opposition, the task force on small businesses and the Culliton report.  This budget is pro-enterprise, pro-jobs and pro-small businesses.</P>
    <P>The budget has been good also for those in jobs.  Let me start with the low-paid. Some 60,000 people earn £10,000 or less and the Government specifically targets them for help.  The health and employment levies, amounting to 2.25 per cent of people's incomes, has been abolished and that helps the low-paid. The employers of the low-paid also accept that it is a help.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The people Fine Gael are worried about, who will make a small contribution of £100 or more, will benefit by some £600 as a result of the removal of the 1 per cent income levy.  Despite our critics we have kept our promises. We worked hand-in-hand with the trade union movement and others.  We said the levy would be temporary, and it was.  Its abolition proves that, as usual, our critics were wrong.  As a result of these measures the average take-home pay of those on low incomes will be increased by about 3 per cent.  The Opposition have lost sight of this because they are running with this dry bone they have in their mouths.</P>
      <P>There has for the first time been radical reform of taxation.  The social and economic council which consists of employers, trade unions, farmers and others also said that any Government that was serious about tax reform should address the question of taxation of capital and of property.</P>

Personal allowances have been addressed and this year will rise to a figure exceeding the amount by which they rose in the past six years.  The standard rate tax band has been widened by four times the rate of inflation.  All of these measures will make people better off in the long run and it is difficult to listen to the Opposition trying to dictate the agenda and blind people to the benefits that everybody, including the Opposition, knows are in the budget. This budget is about creating jobs and jobs will be created in spite of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when we were campaigning. If Fine Gael had behaved it might be in Government today.  I see nobody on the Opposition benches who has the courage to implement widescale tax reform.  This Government has started on the process of tax reform which it intends to continue irrespective of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>In addition to spreading the tax burden to other sectors of society the Government has committed itself to significant levels of social spending.  I know there are Members who are worried about social spending.  The main Opposition spokesperson on Finance has a worry about it. He accuses us of being a tax and spend Government while every week he comes into the House calling for additional spending.  He does not say where the money is to come from but when we make an effort to reform the taxation system to enable spending he complains. He went so far as to suggest in his submission to the NESC report that the anomaly in regard to the cut-off point for high-paid workers on PRSI should be addressed.  It was addressed in the budget and he criticised that.</P>
      <P>Last year we built 3,500 local authority houses.  The Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Bruton, complained about building local authority houses for people in need despite the fact that we need another 30,000 houses to meet demands.  We will keep up the momentum in 1994 and I am sure Fine Gael members of the local authorities will be pleased because their constituents also need houses.  People want good services and amenities and they do not want to be confronted with stingy penny-pinching attitudes by the Opposition, particularly their Finance spokesperson who seems to have difficulty in knowing what his party want him to say or do.</P>

      <P>In regard to housing I wish to highlight all the benefits of the urban renewal scheme in Clonmel.  We have extended the deadline to allow its completion. I would like to see this scheme extended to other towns in my constituency such as Cahir, Cashel and Tipperary. However, we must proceed cautiously in regard to this.  The scheme has demonstrated how urban decline can be halted in a few years by providing incentives.  It has dramatically transformed run-down, underutilised areas in what would normally be a thriving business or residential community.  It has also created physical, economic and social improvements in areas which will remain long after the tax incentives have disappeared.</P>
      <P>The scheme has also generated a substantial number of jobs in the construction industry and, more importantly, long term jobs in the companies and businesses that availed of the incentive. It is obvious that without those incentives the private sector will not expand.  The scheme is welcome because it triggered into action people whose primary motive is profit and as a result jobs will be created under the scheme.</P>
      <P>An important and pleasing aspect of the scheme is the return of private sector housing in city centre locations and other urban areas.  As far back as 1988 my party campaigned to bring the breath of life back to our cities and towns.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been the best budget for housing for many years.  It specifically provided an extra £12 million for local authority housing, an extra £2.5 million for remedial works, an extra £1.5 million for the provision of bathrooms and a special new provision of £3 million for the replacement of windows and so <Col N="1370" /> on in flat complexes.  In addition, it has provided an additional £2 million for the task force on housing for the elderly.  Is there any more worthy cause on which to use public finances than in caring for our old and those in need in the community? Those extra provisions, totalling £21 million, were made available in addition to the already greatly increased provisions for the social housing programme, including local authority and voluntary housing schemes in the 1994 Estimates.</P>
      <P>In the Programme for a Partnership Government we promised 3,500 local authority housing starts or acquisitions in 1993.  We have achieved 3,800 by taking up unused starts in local authorities which did not avail of their allocation and were carried over from previous years. Approximately 300 of those represented the purchase of existing houses.  The capital allocation for the provision of local authority housing was increased by 60 per cent in 1993 and if the Labour Party was not in Government that figure could not be reached.  That massive increase is necessary to secure completion in 1994 of the dwellings commenced in 1993 and to provide the further start-ups necessary in our local authority areas.</P>
      <P>The voluntary housing sector continues to meet the needs of social housing, but I would like to see more done in that area so that we could attack the housing lists that have bedevilled all local authorities in the past number of years.  I hope the rental subsidy scheme and other assistance provided for those in low cost housing, will address the problem identified at local authority level, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, in both parliamentary parties and in Government. We are committed to providing, as soon as possible, bathroom facilities in local authority dwellings that do not have them.  Who would believe that in 1994 some local authority houses do not have bathroom or toilet facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation for the bathrooms sub-programme will be increased <Col N="1371" /> from £2.5 million in 1992 to £4 million this year.  The commitment to allocate extra funding will enable authorities to eliminate deficiencies in their housing stock and ensure that local authority tenants will no longer have to put up indefinitely with the absence of basic facilities.</P>
      <P>As I stated already, this is one of the best budgets ever introduced for housing even though some people criticised particular aspects of it because of their constituency brief on the matter.  It is also a good budget for jobs.  When account is taken of the additional £21 million capital provided for the housing programme we will have reached a target of £295 million, an increase of 58 per cent on last year's outturn and more than double what was spent in 1992.</P>
      <P>I could talk forever about aspects of this budget.  The Minister for Education should be proud of the fact that she has allocated additional funding for secondary and primary school building programmes. Total investment in school and college building has been increased to £98 million this year.  That is the type of expenditure the Government and the Labour Party can stand over because the public want the services and the Opposition has called for them repeatedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will call for more. The Deputy should come down to my constituency to see the condition of schools there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We are delivering those services.  Does the Deputy want more spending?  It would be great if the Fine Gael Party agreed with those of us who advocated funding for areas of need because some of them have been neglected by successive Governments in the past.  We are proud of the influence we have brought to bear in that sensitive area.  I am sure most constituencies benefited from the Minister's decision to improve school buildings, to increase the number of remedial teachers, improve the pupil-teacher ratio and improve the whole infrastructure.  What is wrong with giving people what they need?  That is <Col N="1372" /> what the Government has been trying to do in this budget.</P>
      <P>As I said already, this is the best budget in recent years.  As my party Leader stated, it is pro-jobs, pro-growth and proenterprise. Everybody, from the highest paid to the lowest, will benefit in some form.  If the Minister for Finance can redistribute the wealth available to us, whether by assistance from Europe, or by widening the tax net, which means the majority of people will benefit, that should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Tax allowance certificates will be issued in April and in May and June and throughout the rest of this financial year people will realise the benefits they will derive from this budget.  Tax deductions are spread fairly and it improves the take-home pay of the low paid which will enable them to meet the demands from local authorities and so on.</P>

      <P>Some members of the media have been critical of various sections of this budget.  I represent a rural constituency and I do not apologise to anybody for the benefits provided in this budget for the farming sector.  They were provided because of the inequities in the system.  If we improve the lot of farmers &mdash; many of whom are very poor &mdash; as a result of removing the tax inequities it is merely levelling the playing pitch.  People in rural areas are entitled to a level playing pitch.  Many small farmers are in the PAYE sector and must depend on offfarm income.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy O'Shea, is committed to ensuring that small and medium sized farmers, who are an important part of the economic life of this country, are treated similarly to everybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a much <Col N="1373" /> better hope of an extension in that regard now than ever before.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the budget ensure that people living in disadvantaged areas who need assistance to survive, will be catered for.  Without such assistance rural areas would be disadvantaged.  The Government with Labour Party input through farming organisations, is ensuring that inequities in previous disadvantaged or severely handicapped areas, which might have been overlooked in the past will be redressed.  We will ensure that the people in those areas living on the periphery of Europe will not lose out on their basic rights.  They depend on such payments to remain in the community, to be part of its life blood and not disadvantaged by bigger farmers who have accumulated wealth.  I am concerned about the smaller farmer with an average income of approximately £5,000-£6,000 per year.  I want to ensure that those farmers receive the payments to which they are entitled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the areas in which they live are designated as disadvantaged. Deputy Sheehan need have no doubt that with Labour Party input we will ensure that the people Deputy Sheehan and I represent will be catered for.  I am confident that the measures we will introduce during our term in Government will make sure that the people of rural areas will be treated the same as urban dwellers.  I make no apology for this budgetary measure which seeks to equalise the tax code in respect of farmers taking account of any PAYE and PRSI allowances which they may receive in respect of their wives and children.  We have been fighting for this measure for some time, unlike Deputy Sheehan who whinges from the Opposition benches and never makes a constructive contribution in this regard, we have managed to do something about the matter.</P>

Deputy Ferris will recall what the leader of the Labour Party said about Fianna Fáil and its leader in the weeks leading up to the last general election. He will also recall that some weeks later his party agreed to form a Government with Fianna Fáil.  It is hard to understand how such a partnership could come about and that members of the Labour Party changed their minds in such a short time. It stated that there would be no reduction in mortgage and VHI reliefs.  The people believed the leader of the Labour Party but that is no longer the case.  Deputy Ferris gave a lecture on the amount of money available for housing but omitted to give the allocation for roads.  It may have been an oversight on his part.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ferris spoke of justice in economics but there is none. PRSI has been removed for those earning under £9,000.  However, an article in this week's edition of <i>Business and Finance</i> states that no PRSI payment applies in respect of an employee earning £9,000 but £400 will apply in respect of an employee who earns £9,001.  That is economic justice according to Deputy Ferris. If it is, God help this country.  There has been talk of job incentives.  I understand that a person in receipt of social employment or social welfare benefit of £8,000 per year is better off than a person working and earning £15,000 per year.  A man aged 40 to 45, married with three children recently called to see me and he cried like a baby because his house had been repossessed by a bank.  I explained the situation to the appropriate health board who saw no difficulty in paying him £35 per week as a contribution towards his mortgage repayment.  When the official asked me where I could meet this person I told him it would be difficult because the person was working.  When he heard that, he said the health board could not give him a contribution.  Despite the fact that that person was in a badly paid job and had to travel 30 miles to work, the health board was debarred from helping him pay his mortgage.</P>

      <P>Can the Deputy accept it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept it.  Was the person working when he took out the mortgage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1377" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, otherwise he would not get a mortgage, as the Deputy should know.  There are many other such instances that I could mention.  There are anomalies throughout the system which make it impossible for people to survive.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris spoke about the contribution to housing.  In the electoral areas of Mallow and Kanturk in north Cork 125 houses were built in 1986. However, the following year when Fianna Fáil took office only ten houses were built.  At present there are 350 families in this area on the housing list, at least half of whom are in urgent need of rehousing.  Deputy Ferris spoke about the Government's contribution to ensuring that facilities such as water and bathrooms are provided in houses throughout the country.  I accept his concern, but it will not install water and bathrooms and alleviate the problems of these unfortunate people.  It is time that something was done about this matter.</P>
      <P>I am not going to make a major issue of the property tax, but I understand from the Government statements that this tax will bring in £5 million.  Is that right?  Deputy Ferris knows most things, but he has not responded to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That £5 million will go to a concern which is virtually next door to the Minister for Finance.  Why was a small portion of it, even £1 million, not allocated to GAA clubs?  Is it because they are not situated near the home of the Minister for Finance?  I would like a response to that question.  The GAA does remarkable work and makes a great contribution to this country.  Were it not for that organisation many more young people would be on the streets breaking the law and would be a cause for concern. I do not know why the GAA is being totally ignored by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ferris also spoke about unemployment. I am sure he will admit he is not an expert in that department.  The budget referred to schemes such as social <Col N="1378" /> employment schemes, FÁS schemes and so on, but will those schemes create sustainable jobs?  Will any of the people who will be involved in those schemes in the coming year still have their jobs in 12 months, or will they be back on the unemployment list?  The reference in the budget to 40,000 to 100,000 jobs is simply an exercise in massaging the unemployment figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that these people should remain unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am asking a question, not making a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy addressed that question to the private sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Ferris tells me that these 40,000 or 60,000 jobs will be permanent I will be glad, but there is no evidence that they will be long term, sustainable jobs.  Taking into account those on retirement pension and so on, the figure for the unemployed of 297,000 could be increased to 340,000.  The figures were altered five years ago by a Government that is now in coalition with the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I wish to briefly refer to small farmers, about whom Deputy Ferris rightly expressed concern.  Small farmers with milk quotas of up to 30,000 gallons are regarded as a hindrance to the Government, co-operatives and the economic community.  In many cases lorry drivers will not collect from these people because the roads are in such bad condition.  As far as the Department is concerned these people are uneconomic and their cases take up too much paper work in the Department; in other words, they should get out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a farmer with a quota of 120,000 gallons told me he wanted to lease a further 50,000 to 70,000 gallons, which would bring his quota to 175,000 to 200,000 gallons.  How can the small farmer compete with such a person?  As the Minister of State knows, he cannot. The Minister should not misunderstand <Col N="1379" /> what I am saying; I am not blaming him. I am sure that people with quotas of 10,000 to 15,000 gallons attend his clinics seeking headage payments and beef and ewe premiums.  They want the money immediately and cannot wait three or six months for it.  I am sure the Minister tells these people that he will try to alleviate the problem.  However, these people cannot afford to wait.  They are so urgently in need of money that one day to them is like a year or two to us.  In saying that, I am addressing all Members. When small farmers, with a quota of 10,000 or 20,000 gallons, ask me whether they should give the quota to their sons I advise them not to do so because there is no future in farming.  People would be better off if they could get a job elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The new farming retirement scheme is welcome.  However, the requirement in relation to 10 per cent of the total acreage is an incentive to small farmers to get out of farming, to lease their land and quotas, trust in God and join the dole queue. This is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to headage payments. Farmers who are owed millions of pounds in headage payments cannot wait for this money.  As I understand it, in the agreement reached between the social partners, the Minister and the farming organisations last week, it is hoped that from 1996 onwards farmers will be paid their grants in the year they apply. However, from my figures I believe they will still have to wait for that facility to which they are fully entitled.  Regardless of the parties they represent, Deputies from rural areas who have contact with farmers will know that what I am saying is correct.  They may not admit this in the House but as sure as God made little apples that is the unpleasant reality.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to lotto funding. Approximately 15 months ago all lotto funding was to be handled by local authorities. My secretary got in touch with the Department today to inquire about lotto funding and, as I understand it, last year's grants are only being paid this year.  Lotto funding, as we now know it, <Col N="1380" /> is no better or worse than a slush fund.  I will not go into the details regarding a former Minister who is no longer a Member of this House.  Is it any wonder that members of the public are cynical about all politicians?  It does not give me any pleasure to say that.  Those of us who feel very strongly about the maintenance of standards in public life cringe at events which took place some time ago.  The public at large expect better than that.  I will not go into the details of what is happening across the water where an effort is being made to get back to basics, but I am very concerned about slush funds and the abuse of power.  If we do not prove that we are maintaining and upholding certain standards and that we have not been reduced to slush funds and the era of spin doctors, then the public will tell us what they think of us one way or another.  I do not want such a situation to arise.</P>
    <P>With regard to the residential property tax, reference was made to its impact on the middle income class.  If there is any class in our society today which was stewed alive in the budget it was the middle income class.  Many of them will have to pay residential property tax, their mortgage and VHI reliefs will be reduced and, above all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, they will also be caught by the proposals in regard to third level education where no relief whatsoever is given.  Those in the middle income bracket, earning £10,000, £12,000, £14,000 or £15,000 who get approximately £8,000 into their hands &mdash; say a husband and wife with two or three children &mdash; who have to pay for health care, have mortgages and have to pay for the basic necessities of life got no relief in the budget, and neither Deputy Ferris <Col N="1381" /> nor any other Deputy should try to tell me otherwise.</P>
      <P>Regardless of who is in Government, I do not like to see spin doctors trying to tell the public what they want to hear.  I do not want any Government to employ PR people who will rush to the media to tell them their story.  Why do we not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Pehaps it is because it is a few weeks old that Deputies have tended to wander somewhat from the contents of the budget and seem to have forgotten the very positive response to it by the media.  I think the positive response to the budget arises from the fact that it is a pro-jobs budget.  That is what the budget sets out to do and that is what it will achieve.  That is the most important aspect of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To attempt to criticise certain aspects of the budget is difficult for many people but when we consider its overall effect it is clear people on low wages will, at long last, get the benefits required to take them off the dole.  Very often many of our constituents on the dole who have medical cards and other benefits are offered a job but find that it is not viable financially to take it up.  People on low incomes, particularly those earning less than £173 per week, will not have to pay the 1 per cent employment and training levy or the 1.25 per cent health contribution. There is now an incentive for employers as when the employees are earning less than £173 per week the <Col N="1384" /> employers' PRSI is reduced from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand why Deputy Ferris is leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>These are important improvements in the budget which will benefit people on low salaries.  We must have a balanced debate and remember the unemployed who have difficulty finding jobs that mean something in income at the end of the week.  These improvements, in terms of the levies and the PRSI, are specifically for those people and the employers who wish to employ them.  Business people have told us time and again about the cost of creating jobs while honest people complain constantly about the difficulty of getting a worthwhile job in terms of take home pay, having regard to their benefits on the dole.  From that point of view this is a pro jobs budget.</P>
      <P>Many commentators referred to the enterprise culture created by the budget. The morning after I attended a breakfast meeting of business people and bankers who appreciated the growth that would develop as a result of this budget.  I realise the job of the Opposition is to oppose but we must be careful when we debate this budget to remember that we are trying to develop an enterprise culture and growth in the economy that will create much needed jobs.</P>
      <P>Improvements in the budget, such as the VAT registration thresholds, are important for small business people because the threshold is lowered to £40,000 per annum in respect of the sale of goods and £20,000 in relation to services. Those people have been struggling but they will now have the burden of the administration of VAT removed from them and will be able to get on with the operation of their businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The removal of red tape in regard to many measures in the budget is important, in particular the single registration forms and single tax clearance certificates. <Col N="1385" /> People often attend our clinics complaining about the amount of red tape they have to go through before they can even set up a business so the tidying up of matters in relation to finance is very important.</P>
    <P>I was particularly impressed with the improvements in regard to the probate tax.  I am the chairperson of the Fianna Fáil National Women's Committee and we lobbied the Minister throughout the year on this issue because we were very concerned about the changes in last year's budget with regard to the probate tax, particularly between spouses.  Most Deputies will be aware that ICAs all over the country, specifically in my county and indeed nationally, wrote to me &mdash; and I am sure to other Deputies &mdash; about the probate tax.  We should thank the Minister for the changes introduced in that area, particularly in regard to spouses, and the 30 per cent improvement in the market value on the agricultural land and buildings for probate tax.</P>
    <P>We should specifically welcome the fact that the change in the probate tax is backdated to last June when it was introduced initially.  Therefore, the women's committee and the ICAs who lobbied the Minister for the removal of probate tax between spouses can now be assured that the changes will mean that widows have not been caught in the interim.</P>
    <P>Education was mentioned by previous speakers and it is of particular interest to us in south County Meath because of the huge lack of post-primary school places. Many of our children have to be educated in Dublin because of the lack of buildings in County Meath, the need for school extensions and new schools.  I was delighted with the increase in funding for this area in the budget.  I have not been a Member of the Dáil for long but I remember when Deputy O'Rourke was Minister for Education she allocated £18 million to post-primary schools.  This was increased in subsequent budgets to £26.5 million, then to £32 million and an additional £5 million in this budget brings the figure to £37 million.  The funding for the provision of post-primary buildings <Col N="1386" /> has more than doubled in that short period.  The school extension in Dunshaughlin will be funded from this year's allocation and we are happy about that.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the funding, we are disappointed at the lack of additional school places in Dunboyne and we realise that funding is not the only difficulty.  We are thankful that the finance is available in this year's budget to provide additional post-primary places but the debate continues about the management structure &mdash; as distinct from funding &mdash; in the Dunboyne school.  However, it is ridiculous that the children of the area are still without school places while this debate continues when additional places are needed for September 1994.  Many Deputies would not understand this problem; they are perhaps concerned with the lack of school transport or the loss of teachers in their areas.  The increases in the budget are critical to an area such as ours in terms of the provision of school facilities but it is absurd that the Dunboyne school in particular still has not been provided with funding for these facilities.</P>
    <P>If I may be parochial for a moment, one area particularly welcome to us in Meath was the extension of the urban renewal scheme because this scheme never operated in County Meath.  At last Navan is covered by the urban renewal scheme.  Improvements in the tourism sector, which provides 86,000 jobs, are also welcome.  The improvements for the hotel industry and tour buses and the removal of the VAT are all welcome to a sector that wants to increase tourism and see 1994 as one of the best years on record.  The £5 million allocated for overseas marketing is welcome and we must improve our efforts to market Ireland as a tourism nation.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the agricultural organisations and bodies welcomed the budget, probably because of the probate tax issues to which I referred.  They were very welcome, particularly in the farming community, and the improvements in the capital acquisitions tax which will result in easier transfers of farms.  The changes in the PAYE allowances to sons and daughters of farmers and of business <Col N="1387" /> people is also welcome.  Those people have been extremely annoyed over the years that their sons and daughters are treated differently in regard to PAYE. The £50,000 allocation to Macra na Feirme, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, is welcome.</P>
    <P>Overall the impact of the budget will be positive; it will help to create more jobs in the economy, improve the environment for business and remove some of the bureaucracy in these areas.</P>

      <P>This is an innovative and imaginative budget which encourages enterprise.  In short, gives hope to the jobless, improves the lot of the unemployed and those on other social welfare payments, gives incentive to business and breathes new life into the economy.  Any finance Minister, certainly in the European Union, would have been more than proud to introduce a budget like this.  In that context it is a great pity that the waters have been muddied by a controversy which has blown up in relation to the residential property tax which, as the Minister said in his Budget Statement, would yield a mere £5 million.</P>

      <P>The public are entitled to hear what the then Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, had to say as reported at column 1913:</P>
      <P>Everyone talks about the necessity for reducing the tax burden represented by income tax and indirect taxes.  However, that is only feasible in the context of widening the tax base. That is why our party are committed to a comprehensive property tax on buildings and land to begin to get this equation more into balance.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley went on to say:</P>
      <P>Even in the United states property taxes raise 10 per cent of annual revenue.  Here the comparable figure is 3 per cent.  We must redress the virtual trebling of the burden of income tax in this country over the past eight years.</P>
      <P>The record shows that when Deputy Harney says &ldquo;never, never, never&rdquo; in relation to a property tax &mdash; in this case, a residential property tax &mdash; what she means is &ldquo;never, never, never&rdquo; in relation to just a residential property tax but &ldquo;yes, yes, yes&rdquo; in relation to a tax on all property including residences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At their 1987 party conference the Progressive <Col N="1389" /> Democrats voted in favour of a tax on all real property as a method of funding local government.  As a Front Bench spokesperson of her party at that time surely Deputy Harney must have been aware of that?  It was in Deputy O'Malley's contribution in the House on 11 February 1988 that that line of argument was strongly supported by their then leader.  At that 1987 party conference it was argued that a tax on property would catch everyone, even those in the black economy since everyone has to have a place to live.</P>

      <P>In November 1988 the policy, which I might describe as the &ldquo;never, never, never&rdquo; policy in relation to residential property tax but the &ldquo;yes, yes, yes&rdquo; policy in relation to tax on all property, including residential property, was watered down but only somewhat. The Progressive Democrats produced a document entitled <i>Employment, Enterprise and Taxation</i> which contained a proposal for a £125 million local property charge.  That document stated:</P>
      <P>More often than not the greater value of such a house the more likely is one's probable ability to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How hollow are those words of Deputy Harney and other critics of this tax a few short years ago.  The truth is that if one puts oneself on a pedestal, one must always remember that it is a long way to the ground.  If one cannot adhere to the standards one sets oneself in the public mind, then the public are entitled to feel that they were in some way tricked or conned.  As a consequence cynicism sets in and where cynicism sets in in relation <Col N="1390" /> to a political party the lesson of history has been that the rot sets in as well.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I said in relation to the attitude of the Progressive Democrats to property tax, including residential property tax, in the past, Deputy Harney should explain precisely why she states that the Progressive Democrats was not in favour of a property tax.  Indeed, she should explain, in the light of these policy decisions by her party in the past, why she states that she is now totally opposed to a property tax.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the merits or demerits of the arguments advanced in relation to residential property tax, the only conclusion one can reach is that the attack on the tax &mdash; which comprises a miniscule part of this budget &mdash; was motivated solely by a political desire to injure the Government parties; not by a desire to have the tax removed or to have the various mechanisms softened, but by a naked, political, obvious desire to do as much damage as possible, irrespective of the fact that the integrity of her party was being severely dented in the process.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I said, being in no way personal &mdash; I never would be &mdash; the public can now make up their minds. They have the facts and they must judge this proposal in the light of its history.</P>
    <P>I made those comments because in the controversy in relation to this matter we have been unable to see the wood for the trees.  Virtually every proposal in this budget is job-orientated, is aimed at improving people's lives and livelihoods, at continuing the correction of the public finances while, at the same time, balancing the necessity of providing essential services for our people.  In that respect some of the more welcome features of it should be addressed by me. For example, I greatly welcome the Minister's decision to reduce PRSI contributions in respect of low paid workers and the elimination of the levies on them. This means that certain industries, where there are low paid workers involved, may now be in a position to expand while at the same time improving the income of their employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to support this motion, in the name of my collegue, Deputy Doyle, on the state of county roads throughout the country.  I should say at the outset how disappointing it was to hear the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, making an attack on the Fine Gael Party and the Fine Gael spokesperson without, obviously, having paid any heed to her speech.  It was obvious that the ministerial speech was written well in advance of the delivery of Deputy Doyle's speech.  The Government have indicated a paucity of thought and activity so far as dealing with this serious problem is concerned.  The Government is simply unaware of the problem of our county roads.  It appears that the springs of the Mercedez-Benz are not as sensitive to the potholes as are the ordinary everyday vehicles being driven by the hundreds of thousands of citizens throughout the State.  That is the reason the Minister for the Environment is totally oblivious to the demands to deal with the crisis situation of county roads.</P>
      <P>In the presence of my colleague, Deputy Boylan, who has championed the cause of county roads in Cavan during the past number of years and who has brought the position of county roads in Cavan on to the national agenda, I would say to him with the greatest respect that the problem is nationwide and is not confined to County Cavan.  People are of the opinion that if the problem in County Cavan was addressed we would not have the present nationwide crisis within our county roads structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Member of this House I receive constant complaints from citizens and taxpayers in rural areas about county roads.  These can be ignored no longer. The response of the Minister for the Environment gives little hope for rural communities under severe pressure. During the past 20 years, the decision-making <Col N="1393" /> process has ignored county roads in favour of motorways, highways and by-passes.  We pride ourselves on the miles of motorways and the number or flyovers as symbols of prosperity and modernity.  National wealth and national status is gauged on the number of flyovers, criss-crossing highways between our major cities.  By concentrating the central focus of our policy on by-passes, bridges, motorways and dual carriageways we have forgotten about the county road network.</P>
    <P>In the midlands, a Cheann Comhairle, as I am sure you are aware as one who travels to and from Dublin on a weekly basis, roads are in a deplorable condition. In fairness to the Government and in fairness to the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, the weather has played a major role in the deterioration of the road network during the past few months.  The Government fails to appreciate the extent of the problem. The Minister for the Environment proved last night that he does not understand, that he is totally out of touch with what is happending with the county roads network and what is left of it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to request immediately a report on the county roads structure from every senior engineer in every local authority and that it be placed on his desk by 1 March next.  I guarantee that the Minister is in for an eye opener when he reads the the tale of woe from local authorities throughout the country and learns of the amount of money required by local authorities to deal with successive years of neglect, by way of rate support grants and block grants for county roads.</P>
    <P>In recent years, much emphasis has been placed on rural development and the need to breathe life into rural communities. The least we can ask for is an acceptable road network providing the basic facility to travel from A to B.  This must be an essential prerequisite to any rural renewal.  Once flourishing townlands are now uninhabited in parts of the Slieve Bloom mountains in my constituency of Laoighis-Offaly.  Many roads in the area are impassible.  A recent study <Col N="1394" /> commissioned by Laois Tourism Association warned against promoting many of the tourist attractions in County Laois because the roads leading to them were inaccessible.  It was not possible to travel to places such as the Giant's Grave or the beautiful Glendine Valley in the Slieve Bloom mountains.  Yet we are seeking to increase our tourist numbers and the Government is pinning its hope of recovery in the jobs market on the tourist industry.  Many lanes and roads in rural areas are of Third World status.  The reality is that more money was spent on county roads ten years ago than is being spent today.</P>
    <P>Where are the European Union funds that would enable these lanes to be brought up to a standard that would enable the council to take them in charge. Local democracy has taken a hammering from the public because of the condition of the county roads.  Public cynicism is widespread.  It is a pity the Minister did not address himself to the problem.  I hope the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, will give more hope to rural communities by way of letting us know what he hopes to do in this regard.</P>

      <P>Added to the county roads crisis is the reluctance and the blatant denial by the Minister for the Environment to face up to reality and to indicate that he will do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and myself are both from Tipperary.  I can assure you I know the roads in north Tipperary as well as the roads in south Tipperary.  The Minister has not alone denied what is happening <Col N="1395" /> in his own constituency but what is happening in every constituency.  The roads in north Tipperary are flooded and are as bad as those in other constituencies.  It is appalling that the Minister should come into this House and deny that we have a crisis with our county roads.  As public representatives we have been inundated with phone calls from people who are prisoners in their homes.  Last Sunday evening I visited a home the entrances to which were flooded.  In fairness, many people put enormous effort into the appearance of their homes but now they find the local authority does not have the funds to alleviate their problems.</P>
    <P>The answer to the problem we are discussing is adequate funding.  The local authorities cannot solve the problem.  It is only with finance from the Department of the Environment that local authorities can alleviate the problem of flooding and the appalling condition of our country roads.  What is worse is that many of the problems, including flooding, could be alleviated if the manpower was employed by local authorities.  My local authority employs four fewer men than it did 12 months ago and that is typical.  If the Government is serious about creating jobs and about having economic sense in its arguments it will divert money from social welfare and employment people to ease the flooding on our county roads.</P>

In 1991 the £65 million spent on the maintenance of county roads was more than the total spent in the four years 1983-86 by the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition and was more than four times the £15 million allocated in 1986.

He said that the political pressure had always been on the pothole outside the door rather than on the by-pass around the town, when speaking to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce at their October luncheon.  He said that the £3 billion which would come our way from EC Structural Funds should be spent permanently removing the disabilities which affect our transport network.  He was critical of the fact that £80 million had been diverted from major projects during that year to be spent instead on work on county and other minor roads.  This is a matter of record and should not be forgotten by his colleagues.</P>

      <P>The total grants paid to county councils for all works on non-national roads came to almost £40 million in 1988 and in the five years 1989-93 grants paid to county councils for non-national road maintenance and improvement works totalled £366 million.  Taking account of the contribution from local resources, total expenditure by county councils on non-national roads in the past five years was more than £120 million a year.  That is a huge amount of money and it has not been well spent because our county roads are in a very bad way.</P>
      <P>I am worried as a taxpayer and as a representative of taxpayers that despite colossal amounts of money being ploughed into county roads we have an extremely bad situation which will be helped somewhat by the additional £15 million from the budget.  This sum should be looked at as an emergency measure to deal with a drastic position which is causing great concern.  One can appreciate the anger at the condition of our county roads.  Much money has been spent but the roads are as bad as they have ever been.  The inclement weather is to blame to some extent, as Deputy Flanagan said, but another factor is that the roads are being maintained only to a minimum standard.  The manpower is not being provided by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister must take control in relation to another area in which local authorities cannot do anything.  Where dairying is a big industry 500,000 gallon tanks are being driven round the farms collecting milk.  The county roads were not built to carry such traffic.  Apart from the potholes, county roads have subsided on both sides and have completely cracked.  Patching will not do.  These roads were never meant to carry trucks of 30 or 40 tonnes.  This is a major problem and large amounts of money have been spent on these roads, £336 million from 1989 to 1993.  In most counties county and regional roads are in a very bad condition, but in some counties roads have been well maintained, perhaps through good management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a major problem which will not <Col N="1398" /> go away.  We must devise a plan which will not discriminate against people living in rural areas.  These areas should not become no-go areas.  The people there deserve fair play and justice and must be given it by our Minister.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they came up with the plan <i>Building on Reality</i> which mentioned everything except county roads.  I asked a Minister at that time about the provision of money for county roads which were then in a deplorable condition and I was told that funding was and would continue to be the responsibility of the local authorities.  When Fianna Fáil was returned to power in 1987 I talked to Deputy Flynn on the day he was appointed Minister for the Environment and requested money for county roads.  In his first year in office he transferred £7 million from primary and national secondary roads to county roads to get them into some shape.  County roads were listed as a priority for post-Maastricht funding.  We have substantial funding but it will not be adequate. However, it represents a change of heart when we can get money from Europe for county roads.  As this money will not come onstream quickly enough the Minister has provided £15 million from the tax amnesty and that represents a very good day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My county holds 1.5 per cent of the population and we provide about 5 per cent of manufacturing output.  All our industries require imports and heavy loading.  We are a leader in poultry and mushrooms with about 60 per cent of mushroom production.  One firm has a turnover of £60 million.  Only last week there were applications for 20 new plastic tunnels which shows how the industry has expanded.  Most mushroom production units are located on minor roads.  We also <Col N="1399" /> control a major portion of the poultry industry and large quantities of feed must be transported on narrow roads.  Those two industries alone would account for 750,000 tonnes of road carrying capacity.</P>
    <P>Due to Border troubles funding is a problem for us.  The courthouse was burned and the local authority out of its revenue had to provide £500,000 to cover substantial malicious injury claims. Then, the 1983 Dukes budget devastated the area affecting filling stations and garages and we also lost revenue in rates.  In the county there are 132 crossings into Northern Ireland, 41 of which are closed, some for over 20 years and I spoke about this when I first entered the House. Because of road closures and the blowing up of bridges traffic had to be diverted from national to minor routes and this has meant a greater volume of traffic on our roads.</P>
    <P>We must also take account of the drumlin soil, indeed the poet Patrick Kavanagh referred to the stony grey soil of Monaghan which is not the best foundation for roads.  The narrow winding roads in our hilly county are difficult to maintain and I hope that funding will be relative to the demands of industry and the volume of traffic.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to speak on this motion and delighted the Fine Gael, late in the day, has come to the conclusion that our country roads need support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the four years from 1983-86, £129 million was spent on county roads, contrast that with the £101 million to be spent on county roads this year.  Our problems are due to the legacy of insufficient funding from the middle 1980s.  I have fought consistently to highlight the need for a proper county road structure for two reasons, first because agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, fisheries and tourism <Col N="1400" /> either starts or finishes on county roads and second, because people's standard of living and right of access to their property is determined by the state of the country roads.  When I was elected to the Seanad I claimed that one of the greatest mistakes in the last decade was the decision to put all the EC Structural Funds into the national primary road network.  I complained consistently that we had to ensure this time round that funding from the Structural Funds would be made available for strategic national secondary and county roads.  I compliment the Government on getting Europe to agree, it is a great step forward.</P>
    <P>A sum of £101 million is not sufficient to solve the problem overnight but people will accept that progress is being made and steps taken in the right direction. Let me sound a warning on possible minefields, we need to ensure that we get value for money and that it is spread over the maximum mileage while ensuring that the work done is adequate.</P>
    <P>I support the Government amendment to the motion.  I maintained from the day of my election that the Government would be tested on the issue of county roads but the Government has taken to heart the message from public representatives and mar a deir siad i nGaeilge, tá siad as deánamh beart de réir a mbriathair.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil has always placed a great emphasis on the economic value and social importance of county roads.  By and large they are the arteries that bind our rural communities together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing the construction of roads we should recall the old adage that when you dig a hole you should have a good look to see exactly what you are digging and know when to stop.  Never has this been more apt for Fine Gael than now.  It has dug many holes for itself. I suppose the tax amnesty is the most spectacular example, but Deputy Doyle seems determined to perpetrate the noble Fine Gael tradition and dig a massive crater, big enough for the whole of the Fine Gael Front Bench to fall into. <Col N="1401" /> Where others would be content to use a shovel, one can trust Deputy Doyle to use a digger in traditional Fine Gael style.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins said that the roads are in a bad condition but we should put it into context.  During December rainfall was 150 per cent above average and obviously this has had a catastrophic effect on the roads.  This year we will be spending 35 per cent more than last year on our county roads and we need to ensure we get value for money.  I suggest the Minister should examine the way local authorities organise the repair and resurfacing of the county roads in their area.  Is there any point in patching up the road if the drains are blocked?  It is important to ensure that drains are free so that they can cope with heavy rainfall. Many people are well aware that this is not happening and that during periods of heavy rainfall the roads are flooded.  The patching carried out is uprooted and the situation is worse than before.  We need to ensure that the local authorities approach the problem in an integrated and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>About two years ago there were reports on the great pothole machine, it was supposed to be much more efficient in dealing with potholes than the traditional method.  In recent times I heard very little about it and I ask the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding, I think the Department provides £1.40 for every £1 provided by a local authority.  However, it is apparent that many local authorities decide when they receive their grant from the Minister to contribute little from their own resources.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  In this regard, I am pleased the Minister said that in the future he will look at what local authorities are providing from their own resources for the maintenance and repair of county roads to see how committed they are to this task.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £33.6 million for special road improvements projects in an effort to take effective action using EU funds to develop local economies and create employment.  The objective is to see if we can develop local <Col N="1402" /> economies by improving the road infrastructure and thereby create the necessary number of jobs.</P>
    <P>To return to the Fine Gael motion, on the one hand the party's Finance spokesperson said that we must cut public expenditure while on the other Deputy Doyle said we must spend more and more.  I suppose one could call them Ivy and Ave &mdash; Ivy is certainly not talking to Ave who does not know what Ivy is doing.  In this case, Ivy stands for Ivan while Ave stands for Avril, Ave Maria. Needless to say no one tells John anything with the result that the party finds itself in a mess because no one knows from one day to the next what policies the party is pursuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>While the motion is appropriate, it would not be fair to blame the Minister for the Environment for the state of county roads.  He is not responsible for the weather nor for the fact that no maintenance works were carried out on county roads up to and including 1987 when the Fine Gael led Coalition left office.  It is also fair to say, as the Minister has explained, that grants totalling £336 million were paid to county councils for non-national roads between 1989-93 and that this year grants totalling £109 million will be paid to all local authorities for non-national roads or £26.6 million more than the amount provided in 1993.  We should therefore see an improvement.</P>
      <P>This is not to say that many of our county roads are not in a deplorable state because the truth is that this is a real problem in rural Ireland.  It is very sad that day after day people living in rural Ireland explain to us that they are unable to bring vehicles to their own homes. This problem must be addressed.  The Minister has gone a long way towards this by increasing the allocation using £15 million from the proceeds of the tax amnesty.  In that context it is welcome that for the first time Structural and Cohesion Funds will be expended on non-national roads.  Because this was not allowed under the last round of Structural Funds a major problem was created for the Minister of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final analysis it is obvious that the maintenance of county roads leads <Col N="1404" /> to the creation of employment in local economies.  It is true to say that long ago men were employed on roads in rural areas and their sole task very often was to free the water tables so that there were not huge potholes after heavy rainfall.  If there was a message that I could give in this debate it would be that while we should maintain mechanisation in the maintenance of county roads we should recognise also that human labour and effort is far more effective in preventing the county road network from deteriorating.</P>
    <P>In this respect, it is only fair to point out that the roads are far worse in some local authority areas.  In County Kerry, for example, there are in excess of 2,000 miles of county roads many of them are in a desperate state.  Without doubt a contributory factor is the distribution of the rate support grant which is based on the rateable valuation of 1977.  Therefore, when rates were abolished the rate support grant was linked to the rateable valuation in a county at that time.  In the case of those counties where county roads are still in a poor state the position was that the rateable valuation was low which in turn meant the rate support grant was also low.  That is not the fault of the present Minister but has been a feature of the term of office of successive Governments since 1977.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that a local authority which raises more from its commercial ratepayers than a local authority in a county with a similar population also receives a higher proportion of the rate support grant.  This, in turn, puts considerable pressure on a local authority's finances because in the final analysis that authority must utilise most of the money it collects from its commercial ratepayers on county roads.  Its ability to do so is severely hampered by the fact that there is a grave inequity in the distribution of the rate support grant.  If proof was required it surely must be that while local authorities in rural areas were obliged for several years to impose service charges the same was not true up to recently in many parts of Dublin.  This meant that people who were unable to bring vehicular <Col N="1405" /> traffic to their homes were obliged to pay refuse and water charges while their counterparts in the cities where there are excellent roads and services did not have to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is going in the right direction.  He has a difficult task because, in the final analysis, he is dealing with roads which were not built to carry the traffic they carry today.  I sincerely hope that in the context of the Cohesion and Structural Funds and the agreement by the European Commission that the funds can be spent on non-national roads we will see the day when people will have an adequate road to their homes which, after all, is a fundamental right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to share my time with Deputies Sargent, Durkan and another Fine Gael Deputy.</P>
      <P>The amendment being proposed by the Government tonight outlines the commitments made in relation to maintaining local roads.  It outlines funding that has already been announced in the National Development Plan and in the budget and the Estimates.  On the surface, it would appear to be a welcome increase in the allocation for roads. However, when the small print is examined a rather different picture emerges.</P>
      <P>The overall provision of State grants for non-national roads for 1994 is £101.9 million &mdash; what the Government calls a record level and what I would call trying to make up lost ground.  To put this provision into context, as part of the submissions made within the framework of the EU Structural Funds 1994-97, Wicklow County Council estimated that the cost for the total road network is £154.80 million.  In the coming five years we need over 40 per cent more in the county I represent than the entire national allocation for local roads for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate for providing for the needs of main roads, regional roads, county roads, rural roads and bridges alone in County Wicklow is £72.2 million. If allocated in one year this would gobble up almost three-quarters of the entire <Col N="1406" /> allocation for the country, and Wicklow is only one county out of 26 counties &mdash; or 28 entities with the inclusion of the new Dublin councils.  This puts into perspective the need that has built up over the years and the minimalist Government response that is now is being lauded as a major initiative.</P>
    <P>In view of the increased allocation, the overall sum to local authorities is divided by two; discretionary block grants which are financed entirely by the Exchequer and a scheme of specific grants which will be co-financed.  The co-financed projects are the ones on which many hopes have been pinned.  I do not believe that the restrictions as regards the criteria to be satisfied have yet been fully understood at local level.  These criteria will militate against urban areas outside of Dublin that at the moment have been getting less than their share.</P>
    <P>I welcome the presence of the Minister of State who will have an interest in this, representing a constituency in Kildare.</P>
    <P>In particular I would specify the towns around the perimeter of Dublin &mdash; in Wicklow, Meath and Kildare &mdash; which have had to cope with a very rapid expansion of population and demands for urban-style road systems while at the same time having rural style allocations.</P>
    <P>The situation in Bray is critical.  We live in a town which is at times completely jammed with traffic.  Many roads are used to over capacity and are unable to meet the demand.  Yet in 1993 we got an allocation of £33,000.  In other words we got approximately £1 per head of population to pay for roads, footpaths, public lighting and bridges.  That was a derisory allocation.  Consequently, in 1993, we applied for, but did not get, a discretionary grant of £1.8 million which was more in line with the real needs.  It is worth noting that the block grant covers everything relating to roads.  In Bray the public lighting bill alone is enormous and is exacerbated by use of lamp standards that comply with Department of Environment regulations but fail abjectly when tested by vandals.  Even that application does not cover the extra demands which a relief road to the town is creating.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> The Southern Cross Route is a project which is being co-funded by Wicklow County Council and Bray UDC to the tune of £300,000.  The Department has agreed in principle to make up the balance. However, since the regulations now governing the criteria for grants for improvement work on non-national roads are so tight, we will end up in an untenable position.</P>
    <P>The Southern Cross Route itself will cost £1.55 million.  At the rate specified in the Department of the Environment's circular any specific grant for Wicklow will be spent entirely on that project and even at that will not be sufficient to complete the work in 1994.  However, since this funding is subject to the conditions spelt out in the Department's circular we in Wicklow, and particularly in North Wicklow, are going to be at a severe disadvantage.  A cap has been put on the scheme of specific grants, the cap being 100 per cent of the combined discretionary block grants paid to the authorities concerned in the year 1993.  In Wicklow the entire specific grant will be taken up in one project at the expense of other road improvements.  This is unfair to the county.  It is unfair to the expanding town of Bray and it will be unfair to other areas like Kildare and Meath which find themselves in the same situation.  That is the reality that is hidden behind the grandiose projections in the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>In rural areas the maintenance of existing roads has suffered as a result of years of neglect and underfunding.  It is recommended that roads be resurfaced every five to seven years.  In County Wicklow we aim at a rate of resurfacing once in every 30 years.  Meanwhile the potholes appear, the roads deteriorate, and the costs of renovation mount.  The case for Cavan and Monaghan is already well documented.</P>
    <P>The point I am making &mdash; and I would ask the Minister to take it on board because of seriousness &mdash; is that there is concentration on rural roads.  I do not argue with that.  There is a concentration, too, on the massive transport complications <Col N="1408" /> in the cities, but nobody is arguing the case for the towns, particularly the towns along the perimeter of the cities.  This has not been articulated to any great degree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The specific grants &mdash; not the national primary route grants &mdash; are going to be capped at last year's level. That is one problem.  The other problem is that the criteria for the specific grants militate against towns because they relate to industrial development, which is fair enough, but they also relate to forestry, tourism, agriculture and rural development. Under none of those criterion can a town like Bray qualify.  These towns have very strong commercial centres which are very busy and clogged up with traffic.  Under the present criteria we cannot argue a case for a specific grant unless there is great flexibility shown by the Minister, and by the way he is nodding I can see he is going to listen to our case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the local improvement schemes an opportunity is being lost because the isolated communities in my constituency are unable to carry out roadworks from their own resources.  The local improvement schemes have been very effective when the money has been available because they tie in with local initiative and the goodwill that can be generated among people to come together and provide a certain percentage of the funding. However, people cannot do it on their own.  It is disappointing that last year we got only £43,000 under the local improvement scheme.  It enabled three projects to go ahead, but the demand is much greater and I would argue that since it is local people being given the opportunity to invest along with a local authority in road improvements, that should be beefed up to prevent the goodwill being dissipated as is happening at the moment.</P>
      <P>In Bray we have benefited greatly from the amount of money that has been allocated to the national primary route.  I give credit where credit is due.  However, there is still an outstanding problem in relation to Euro Route I; at every connector into that primary route there are problems because they are still being treated as if they were county roads which they are not.  At the moment they are a no man's land because we are not a rural area nor are we a city area and yet we have this enormous traffic problem.</P>
      <P>There is lighting of a top European standard along the Euro route out of Dublin, but none in County Wicklow. This problem must be addressed, we cannot have a falling away of standards in areas outside the city.  People living on the outskirts of cities are now part of the greater metropolitan area, which must be taken into account in the overall development of our road network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus and members of the Fine Gael Party for sharing their time with me.  I have read the Fine Gael motion and the inevitable Government amendment.  Am I imagining things or do I detect a feeling of smug aloofness in the Government's <Col N="1410" /> wording of its amendment?  Is it saying there is no problem in regard to the state of non-national roads?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment states that local roads are in a satisfactory condition. The Government claims commitment to non-national roads, the word &ldquo;commitment&rdquo; must be one of the most abused words in this House; it is a remedy for everything.  Unfortunately, the facts do not highlight anything short of lip-service. While I recognise that some of the primary roads built in recent years are important in alleviating chronic congestion in some of our towns, others appear rather excessive unless we are trying desperately to emulate the British motorway system, with little more than one-twentieth of their population. However, while those with the begging bowl for Europe tell us the new roads are being provided with the generosity of our EU godparents, seldom are people reminded that EU money grant-aids only 75 per cent of the mega road projects. The remaining 25 per cent required to surface and prop up the EU sections of the monster motorways must come from Exchequer funds, funds which used to keep our extensive existing roads in reasonable condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, I am not surprised the Minister is wondering what all the fuss is about.  After all, expensive ministrial cars are designed to allow important people write letters and snooze on a long journey.  I am not sure about this Government but in other countries some cars are equipped with full cocktail cabinets.  The suspension on a ministerial car must be soft and soothing whatever road surface is being travelled. Therefore, I am not surprised that potholes <Col N="1411" /> and fissures go unnoticed.  Whatever hope the Minister has of noticing potholes in a car&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's colleagues were voting against moneys for roads two days ago until I advised them otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>However, most people rarely have an opportunity to travel in the style to which the Minister is accustomed. Most people are well aware that we are storing up major road works by neglecting remedial repair works since we began to divert &ldquo;pothole money&rdquo; to service large motorways.  If people do not believe that is a crisis due to the neglect of our country roads they should ask our much valued tourists.  Although Bord Fáile actively promotes Ireland as a place to cycle and walk, making out routes and circuits along our most scenic country roads, the director of that organisation, in a letter to me praising the Fingal area and the multitude of quaint and ancient roadways in north county Dublin, said he had given up walking those traditional routes because of the many potholes and because passing vehicles would drench him in mud.  Instead, when he wants to walk he must take his car to Newbridge House or Ardgillen Castle splashing everybody on the way in order to get a splash-free and pothole free zone free from churned up puddles and mud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, not everyone can get into a car, ministerial or otherwise, and drive to such places.  Children are more likely to cycle, if allowed.  A recent study shows that independent travel has been restricted because of parent's fears for their children's safety on our country roads. This grounding of youngsters leads to excessive television viewing resulting in <Col N="1412" /> children's health being at an all time low. We now have the fire brigade action of money not spent on our roads going towards repairing our children's health and the worse our roads become, the worse our health deteriorates.</P>
    <P>It is worth lifting our eyes from our potholes for a moment and focusing across the horizon to a country where the population take ample exercise, lead a healthy lifestyle and have cheaper travel with less road maintenance.  The secret in the Netherlands is their 30,000 kilometres of cycle ways; bicycles do not cause potholes, in fact cyclists will avoid them if they see them on time.  In contrast, at the last count we had ten kilometres of cycle ways.  Is it any wonder that 1 per cent of our total personal mileage is cycled while the Dutch calculate that 33 per cent of their personal mileage is travelled by bicycle?  Lest anyone is of the opinion that bicycles are mainly for children, 25 per cent of the total mileage travelled by female pensioners in the Netherlands is by bicycle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be doing that here before long as a result of the tax measures introduced in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that many Dutch tourists come here and some have bought areas of our bogland to preserve them.  That is an indication of the extent of their love for this country.  If we are serious about our environment, our children, our health, tourism and general economic activity in rural areas, such as north county Dublin, repairing and maintaining our county roads is more than pothole treatment, it is an investment in the future which will encourage a sustainable healthy way of life where local communities and economies can thrive in a manner that will save money in the long term.</P>

However, there is one joke we can no longer laugh at, namely, the one about the Irish pothole.

      <P>The jokes have worn thin as has the patience of the Irish motorist.  While we can take pride in the upgrading of our national primary routes and the development work being done on the infrastructures between our major towns and cities, there is another forgotten Ireland where the roads are merely a trial and a tribulation to be endured on a journey from home to work, to farm or to school. The pothole is no longer a joke to be laughed at over a drink.  It is a harsh reality of daily life for thousands of Irish people.  Indeed, it is now a rare and unexpected pleasure to find a good section of roadway in between the multitude of ruts and ridges.</P>
      <P>Somewhere along the way we seem to have forgotten that the small rural community in north Tipperary, or its counterpart in any other constituency, is as much a part of the European Community as their urban brethren.  In north Tipperary many of my constituents would have only a casual acquaintance with the national primary routes.  Their daily lives are spent away from mainline traffic but for them, no less than the Dublin-Cork commuter, that road system is a vital link in their daily lives and the quality of the route determines much of their activities. It is regrettable that that quality has deteriorated to an alarming extent.  We have reached the stage where my constituents believe they have become marginalised in many ways, the poor quality of the road system being merely one of the many symptoms of the discriminatory treatment having to be endured by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we blame them for feeling that way when, for example, the life of a motor vehicle is seriously diminished because of being constantly driven on roads with poor quality surfaces?  Potential damage to one's car is a hazard people must face on a daily basis.  The problem is compounded by the fear of many parents to allow their children walk to school because they would be in danger of injury <Col N="1414" /> as a result of the condition of our roads. In north Tipperary roads were closed last winter and people were unable to get direct access to their homes and farms except by walking or using a tractor.</P>
    <P>The Minister, like me, comes from a rural background.  One would imagine he would have greater sympathy with the needs of the towns and villages of north Tipperary.  It is ironic that while we are talking about major problems on our secondary and trunk roads the Minister is overseeing the construction of super-highways. We do not want four or six lane motorways, we want to sit at the Minister's table and take our fair ration of the cake, instead of scratching around on the floor for the crumbs.  It is evident that the powers of local councils are being diminished.  It is also evident that regional funds are not being applied fairly across the board.  I ask the Minister to give councils power and authority but, more importantly, to give them money to enable them set long term objectives, instead of struggling from one month to the next.  The construction of highways, dual carriageways, by-passes and flyovers are welcome, but I ask the Minister to provide funding for the county and country roads of his native north Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Our rural roads are like obstacle courses to be negotiated at one's peril.  They are in a disgraceful, deplorable condition. The Minister and the Government are oblivious to the fact that we have passed the crisis point.  Unfortunately, my constituency colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, and his Department, through inept administration and lack of funding are facilitating these appalling conditions.  All public representatives are inundated with pleas for help from members of the disillusioned public who are aggrieved and angry about the conditions of our roads. A calm, patient approach to politicians is being overtaken by militant action.  In case any Member might be under a false illusion, the Minister has done no favours for north Tipperary.  I regularly defend the Minister when our constituents <Col N="1415" /> deplore his lack of commitment to the welfare of rural commuters.  I have never accepted the charge that has been levelled against him that he has lost touch with reality since he started commuting by Government jet or helicopter.</P>
    <P>North Tipperary County Council is in a state of financial turmoil.  It has neither the personnel nor the resources to provide an acceptable level of service for a hard-pressed community.  It is understaffed and many essential services have been curtailed to an unacceptable extent. Our roadworks scheme is farcical.  Our roads are in a shambles.  The county engineer has said that the overall level of funding available for regional and county roads in 1993 has resulted in an accelerated decline and by the end of 1993 60 per cent of the system was in an advanced state of disintegration.  The roads have a surface dressing cycle of 45 years.  The estimated outlay on the north Tipperary network alone would be £38 million.  That is the professional assessment &mdash; that it would cost £38 million to restore the regional and county road network there.</P>
    <P>This position is in stark contrast to the Minister congratulating himself on doing handstands for providing an extra £15 million to be divided among all the county councils.  The time for sermons and history lessons is long past.  We need real, effective action.  It is imperative that the Minister returns to the Cabinet table to seek a substantially improved allocation to deal with this crisis which is having a serious and detrimental effect on the quality of rural life.  The Minister's actions and progress in this regard will be monitored carefully and adjudicated on by the electorate in the forthcoming European elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The little roads of Ireland that go wandering up and down o'er hill, dale, valley and many a midland town at regular intervals have very large, deep potholes.  A visitor to this planet who travelled to any rural or urban constituency would be pardoned for concluding that there had been an abdication of responsibility, that the Minister had <Col N="1416" /> retired or gone home in disgust.  That visitor would be right because that is virtually what has happened.  On many occasions the Minister has told us what he did last year, but he does not appear to accept or recognise that we have got only 10 per cent of the funds required for a single year.  Ten per cent of the annual allocation has been provided to maintain the main and county roads in each electoral area.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State who is sitting opposite knows that what I say is true in our constituency of Kildare.  The paltry sum of £15 million which the Minister cast away from the tax amnesty table could easily be spent in one, and not necessarily the largest, electoral area. During Question Time today I was under the impression that the Minister thought he had done a great job for this area.  He might delude other people that he has done a good job but if he is deluding himself in that regard it is a serious matter.  The Minister should take some action to deal with this problem.  Over 30 years I have never had the experience of driving on such bad roads as those on which I drove during the past few months.  I have damaged two new tyres because of potholes.  In doing one's best to avoid as many potholes as possible, it follows that on the law of averages one is bound to damage a tyre at some stage because of the state of our roads.  I notice no member of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party is present in the Chamber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke today about what should be done at parliamentary party meetings.  I presume Fianna Fáil is holding a parliamentary party meeting at present and, if not, it should be holding one, to decide what it will do about potholes.  If necessary road works are not carried out during the current year it will cost two to three times as much to carry out such road works next year.  My colleague, Deputy Lowry, mentioned the 45 year road resurfacing cycle. Some young and not so young people <Col N="1417" /> have never seen road resurfacing take place here in recent years and some children will never see road resurfacing if the present position does not change.  That is a sad reflection on the type of road conditions with which people have to live here at present.</P>
      <P>The allocation was made at the time when there was a big squabble here about how many billions we would get from Europe, how many billions were missing from the European grant and on what we would spend the extra billions we were seeking.  It is ironic that at a time when there was so much talk about billions of pounds, the largest allocation that could be given to address the main issue, which has raised more hackles among our people during the past 12 months was £15 million.</P>
      <P>I am sick of listening to Ministers at Question Time say that the condition of our roads is a matter for the local authorities.  The Minister knows that all local authorities have been hamstrung for years because they have no way of raising money.  They are manacled.  They depend entirely on the Department's allocation. When a backbencher in the Minister's party raised a question about the rate support grant, the Minister pretended he did not understand the question.  It was as if he was in another world.  Having listened to his response it appeared that he was seriously deluding himself about the position and that is a cause for concern.</P>
      <P>We appeal for funding for our roads on behalf of all our constituents.  I appeal to the Minister for the Environment, on behalf of the constituents of County Kildare whom I represent, to note that we need substantial funding to deal with the task he has given to the local authorities. If he does not recognise that need it will be brought home to him during the run up to the European elections.  If I were in the Minister's shoes I would seriously consider the options.  Some of the billions he was seeking from Brussels during the past few months might be better spent on the old bog roads which he, along with his colleagues, will have to travel during the next three months.</P>

      <P>Deputy Leonard cannot deny it.  Last year Monaghan needed £1.25 million to hard-top 300 miles of roads, but we were not given that funding and today those roads are in tatters.  In the last six years Monaghan lost £25 million by way of rate support grants.  When referring to these matters Ministers should give total amounts rather than highlighting certain figures. The county council in my area cannot carry out repairs to county roads with the amount of money it received from the Government, which is just a drop in the ocean.  A sum of £15 million has been allocated from the proceeds of the amnesty, but what can be done with that amount of money?  Each local authority will receive a maximum amount of £100,000.</P>

      <P>As rightly pointed out, 70 per cent of poultry and 60 per cent of mushrooms are produced in County Monaghan.  We have a home produced industry but we receive very little by way of grants.  As there are no railroads and no airport in County Monaghan, we should receive increased aid towards our roads.  A sum of £100 million is provided in this year's budget for railroads.  If we received our fair share, which we were promised by successive Governments &mdash; I am not saying that one Government was more at fault than another &mdash; we would not experience the present crisis in Counties Monaghan and Cavan.</P>
      <P>When there is a death in a family, the family contacts its public representatives, to see if we can find a way to get the hearse to the church.  This happens weekly.  It now takes 20 minutes to travel on roads which took two minutes a few years ago.</P>

    <P>As the old adage goes, a stitch in time saves nine.  If the Government had heeded my warnings in 1987 we would not have this problem.</P>
    <P>I compliment the backbench Members of the Government parties and the Members of the Opposition parties for their excellent contributions to this debate.  However, I was disappointed with the contributions of the Minister last night and of the Minister of State tonight.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Minister's statement that the problem belongs to the local authorities, I must point out that the commercial rates raise £49,820 in my county, which is a fair yardstick of the position in many Border counties and the 12 western counties; 1p in the £ will raise £498.  What rate does the Minister expect the council to strike to solve the problems now facing it when service charges in the county amount to £195 per household and £29.60 for commercial property?  Does the Minister think that the unfortunate commercial ratepayer who finds it so hard to survive should be further burdened?  I say no, that is not the way forward.</P>
      <P>I will spell out how the funding can be raised.  I will not get involved in political jibes and arguments without offering a solution.

      <P>This development was not matched by State contributions, as can be seen from the ever decreasing amount of rate support grants to local authorities <Col N="1427" /> who have been starved of the necessary funding to provide the infrastructure for the major development which took place in the agricultural and industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>How can we solve the problem?  A mystique exists, propagated by successive Ministers for the Environment, that roads must be constructed to an EU standard.  There is no such thing as an EU road standard, to quote Miss Belinda Payne who works in Commissioner Bruce Millan's cabinet in the European Commission. On two occasions she stated clearly that the Commission does not set a standard for roads, the standard is a national standard.  The £6 million per mile for Euro roads referred to by Deputy Molloy is the toy of the Minister and his advisers.  This angers and frustrates the people who use the roads which are the subject of this motion.  A former EU Commissioner and Minister for the Environment, Ray MacSharry, in his address to the General Council of County Councils in Ballyshannon clearly stated that there was no difficulty in securing 10 per cent of EU funds to transfer from national routes to non-national routes and, with a will on the part of the Government, this could be further increased.</P>

We live in the shadows of Northern Ireland; we are living in the war zone.  Reference is made to peace but without good works peace will not bring the success we hope for, that is, the interaction of the two communities North and South.  I propose a Marshall aid-type plan which will inject major capital spending in rebuilding the road surfaces in the Border region, Donegal, Sligo-Leitrim, Cavan-Monaghan and Louth.</P>

    <P>I must make a serious point about the quality of the materials used in the construction of roads.  There is no doubt that we have the raw materials necessary for this work.  One would think we had to go to the Middle East or South Africa for gravel to make our roads.  We have this raw material, if we could only extract it. <Col N="1430" /> There must be a quality standard for the materials used in the construction of roads, similar to the slump standard for mass concreate development.  If we have a quality product we can get the job done. I am putting that proposal to the Minister to deal with the problem.  It is up to him to tackle the problem and solve it.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Motor Vehicle Duty.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me an opportunity to raise a matter on the Adjournment in relation to two of my constituents who emigrated some years ago to the United Kingdom.  The husband worked for a United Kingdom firm and was sent throughout the United Kingdom and to parts of the Republic of Ireland in various contracts.  During their period in the United Kingdom they purchased three motor cars, the last in January 1993.  The husband was posted to Ireland, on contract for the same firm, and later his wife joined him.  He continued working for the firm until the end of July 1993 when he decided to set up his own company. He returned to the United Kingdom, wound up his affairs, brought his motor car home and duly reported it with a view to ascertaining to what extent, if any, he was liable for various duties.  He was informed that he did not fall within the category that would exclude him from liability.  That was questioned and subsequently I, as his public representative, appealed the decision taken by the Customs officers.</P>
      <P>In the last 12 or 14 years I have dealt with a very large number of such cases and always experienced the utmost courtesy and excellence in terms of performance from officials of the Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise. However, on this occasion, for some unknown reason &mdash; and while a letter to the Revenue Commissioners awaited a reply &mdash; the officials concerned arrived to seize the vehicle.  When it was explained to them that a response was awaited from their Department there did not appear to be a record of any such correspondence.  Subsequently, on the day of the seizure the senior Customs officer who arrived on the scene had the original correspondence which contained a letter from me and a detailed reply to the original response by my constituents. That correspondence remains unanswered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to make a major issue out of this but it is very unusual, to say the least, that while a response to correspondence of that nature is outstanding to a public representative, particularly a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, precipitate action should have been taken by the officers concerned by way of seizure. To restore confidence in and respect for the Houses of the Oireachtas, it would be advisable to have the vehicle restored to the people concerned, and at least pay <Col N="1433" /> us the courtesy of a detailed reply to the submission made in the first instance. Failure to do that will reflect not only on the Houses of the Oireachtas but on the public representatives and the Minister's Department.  I am sure the Minister would not want that to happen.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to raise that type of issue on the Adjournment, it has not been necessary previously but I will not flinch from doing so if the need again arises.  I repeat that in my dealings with the Customs officials over the years I have experienced nothing but courtesy, consideration and efficiency and I hope that will continue.</P>

      <P>I hope all officials respect Members who are trying to serve constituents.  The matter has been the subject of two parliamentary questions by the Deputy and concerns an application by a person to the Revenue Commissioners last September to register her car without payment of vehicle registration tax.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1992, all vehicles in the State must be registered with the Revenue Commissioners and the appropriate vehicle registration tax paid on them.  However, section 134 of the Act permits a vehicle to be registered without payment of vehicle registration tax if it is the personal property of a private individual when he or she is transferring his or her normal residence from a place outside the State to a place in the State.  Regulations define a person's normal residence as the place where he or she lives for at least 185 days in each year because of personal and occupational ties.  This relief is, however, subject to the individual having had possession and use of the vehicle for at least six months outside the State prior to transfer of residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person concerned applied at the Vehicle Registration Office, Naas, County Kildare, on 1 September 1993 for relief from payment of vehicle registration tax on her car under the transfer of residence provisions.  In her application she declared that she had transferred her residence from the UK to the State on 6 August 1993 and that the car had been in her possession and used by her outside the State for at least six months prior to the date she transferred her residence.</P>
    <P>She produced certain documents in support of her claim that she had possession and use of the car in the UK. These consisted of the UK vehicle registration document for the car which showed that the car came into her possession on 27 January 1993 and was registered in her name in the UK on 15 February 1993.  An insurance certificate was produced which indicated that the car was insured in the UK from 27 January 1993.</P>
    <P>She was requested to produce evidence of day-to-day living in the UK from the date she took possession of the car up to the time she transferred her residence to the State.  She was also asked to produce evidence to establish the date she transferred her residence.</P>
    <P>To support her contention that she took up residence in the State on 6 August 1993 she submitted a letter from her husband's employers in Dublin stating that he took up employment with them on 9 August 1993 having been previously employed by them for three years in the UK.  However, when his UK P45, which would confirm the date he ceased employment in the UK, was requested she said she could not produce it as he had been self-employed in the UK.</P>
    <P>She produced a statement from an agent of a building society stating she had taken out a mortgage on a house in the State on 2 July 1993.  Since she had stated that the transfer of residence took place on 6 August 1993 an explanation was asked for as to how the mortgage had been acquired one month earlier.  She <Col N="1435" /> replied that she arranged the mortgage while on holiday in the State.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners were not satisfied on the basis of the evidence produced that the person concerned had transferred her residence on the date alleged and considered that further investigations were necessary.</P>
    <P>As a result of local inquiries it was established that she had made a claim for unemployment assistance to the Department of Social Welfare on 10 March 1993. The records of the Department of Social Welfare show that she went to work on 22 March 1993 but made a repeat claim on 4 April 1993 when she qualified for unemployment benefit.  She continued to receive unemployment benefit without interruption up to 29 September 1993 when she transferred to disability benefit. This clearly contradicts her assertion that she had been living outside the State up to 6 August 1993 and that she only paid short visits to this country during the period February to August 1993.</P>
    <P>An examination of her husband's income tax records revealed a written statement by him dated 28 May 1993 to the effect that he returned to live in the State on 4 February 1993.</P>
    <P>All this clearly indicates that the person concerned had been living in the State and had been claiming social welfare continuously from 10 March 1993 and that her husband had been living, also continuously, in the State from 4 February 1993.  Consequently, since they had acquired the car in late January, neither she nor her husband could have had possession and use of it for the required six months outside the state prior to transferring their residence to the State. Accordingly, she clearly could not qualify for relief.</P>
    <P>A decision to refuse the application were conveyed to the person concerned in writing on 4 November 1993.  She was again written to on 23 December 1993 in which it was explained to her in detail the grounds for the refusal of her application. In that letter it was clearly stated to the applicant that if she failed to have the car registered immediately and the appropriate <Col N="1436" /> vehicle registration tax paid or the car permanently removed from the State, it would be liable to seizure without further warning.</P>
    <P>By failing to register the car the person concerned was committing an offence which rendered the car liable to prosecution and to a fine if convicted.  The car was also liable to seizure and forfeiture. On 1 February 1994 the car was seized by officers of Customs and Excise. The persons concerned have agreed to release terms of a payment of £400 on the car and the Revenue Commissioners will, therefore, not proceed with a prosecution. The person concerned now has two options; she can export the car permanently from the State or register it with the Revenue Commissioners and pay the vehicle registration tax.  The Revenue Commissioners have also advised me that if they do neither the car is liable to seizure again.</P>
    <P>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners they are satisfied that the person concerned sought to deliberately mislead them with regard to her residential status prior to August 1993 in an attempt to evade the payment of vehicle registration tax.  This is an offence under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1992 and is punishable on conviction by a fine and imprisonment, or both.  The person concerned has now given a true statement of the facts and the Revenue Commissioners will not, therefore, proceed with legal action in respect of the attempted evasion of tax.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the person concerned was afforded every opportunity to establish that she qualified for the relief claimed.  When she was unable to do this the Revenue Commissioners had no choice, because of the statutory obligations imposed on them, but to refuse the application.  The Commissioners had given the person concerned ample warning that her car was liable to seizure if she failed to meet her obligations immediately regarding the car.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter.  I wish to draw attention to a problem costing many individual farmers up to £2,000 as a result of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry not making the rules governing the January-February 1993 special beef premium scheme clear and easily understood.</P>
      <P>Because of time restrictions, I can only briefly outline what happened to two small County Galway farmers who are deemed ineligible for the special beef premium scheme because they did not have the identity cards stamped at the local district veterinary office.  A farmer in the Colemanstown area of Ballinasloe applied for payment under the special beef premium scheme in January-February 1993 in respect of 11 twenty-two months old bullocks.  This farmer genuinely believed he did not have to get the cards stamped at the district veterinary office.  He said he was given information early in 1993 to the effect that if the Department required the cards to be stamped, they would ask the farmer to forward his cards to the office.  I have reason to believe that some of the district veterinary offices throughout the country also believed that a circular would be sent to the farmers but this did not happen. This farmer applied for and received the ten month bullock premium without the cards being stamped.  Is it any wonder he was confused?  He understood that if he presented a mart or factory sales sheet, which included the tag numbers, he would be eligible under the scheme but he has been refused payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another farmer outside Ballinasloe applied for the premia for 22 bullocks in the same January-February 1993 period. He, like his fellow countryman, believed <Col N="1438" /> that if the Department required the cards for stamping it would write for them.  This farmer stands to lose 22 premia at £52 each, which is £1,144, together with the extensification grant of £28 per head, which adds up to another £616.  All in all he stands to lose £1,760.  What crime would a person have to commit before a judge in a court of law would fine him £1,760?  I could give an endless litany of such cases in east Galway alone.  There must be thousands of such cases throughout the country.  Taking into account the obvious confusion and the fact that this period coincided with the beginning of the new CAP regime, surely farmers cannot be victimised to this extent and the Minister could devise some system to solve this once-off problem.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a jinx on the January-February 1993 application date. With regard to the age factor for the scheme, many farmers believed what they saw.  According to the advice leaflet supplied by the Department if an animal was 21 months old on the date of the application it would be eligible for grant purposes.  This did not work out in practice and several hundred farmers got caught out unfairly.</P>
    <P>I understand that yesterday some changes were made in this area.  I thank the Minister and I would appreciate it if he would spell out exactly what it means. I understand one month is disregarded, which would be beneficial.  I am sure the Minister is fully aware of the frustration and anger felt by farmers who genuinely believe that the rules of the game were not made sufficiently clear.  In the circumstances, surely this matter can be satisfactorily resolved between the Department and the European Commission. I am sure the Minister has hundreds of representations on this issue and something must be done.  I will be extremely thankful for any help the Minister can give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this important issue, but it is <Col N="1439" /> not true, as the Deputy alleges, that applicants under the January- February 1993 special beef premium scheme were given misleading information about the stamping of cattle identity cards.  At Term and Condition 5 which accompanied every application, applicants were advised that if they were not the subject of an on-farm inspection they were obliged to forward the cattle identity cards of the male cattle being submitted for the premium to the local office of my Department for scrutiny, punching and stamping before the sale of any such cattle.  Had all January-February 1993 applicants followed this instruction there would have been very few problems relating to the punching of cattle identity cards during this application period.  Unfortunately, however, many did not and many problems arose as a result.</P>
      <P>My Department is showing considerable flexibility in addressing these problems.  Where male cattle were sold for slaughter and taken out of the system, for example, payment has been made following receipt of documentary evidence of sale for slaughter after any retention period required.  Where cattle are sold for export to countries outside the European Union, to take another example, I have just recently announced that the premium may be paid on such cattle retained by the applicant for the required period provided satisfactory documentary proof of such export can be provided.  In both of these cases staff of my Department, either at the meat factories or at ports of export, would have seen the cattle identity cards of such animals and this has been deemed adequate for payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where cattle are sold at marts to other farmers, however, and we do not know whether they have been taken out of the system through slaughter or whether they can be presented for premium again by the purchasers in the June 1993 application period, my Department has had no choice but to refuse payment on such cattle.  The January-February 1993 applicant, after all, failed to get the cattle identity cards stamped as required by <Col N="1440" /> that scheme and the June 1993 applicant would feel aggrieved if he or she, having bought an animal with clean ears and clean cards and having sent those cards in with the June 1993 application, was denied the premium on an animal apparently fully eligible at the time of the application in respect of which he or she scrupulously observed all the requirements of the June 1993 scheme.  I cannot see how we could do otherwise but choose to pay in the later application period to the applicant who complied with all EU requirements rather than in the earlier period to a non-complying applicant.</P>
    <P>My Department and I accept that there was some confusion early in 1993 during the introduction of the new CAP reform regime in relation go acceptable ages of animals.  Given this, I consulted the EU Commission on the matter and announced recently that I was allowing a month's tolerance in respect of the January-February and June 1993 application periods so that no applicant would be unfairly penalised as a result of this confusion. As farmers had grown more familiar with the age requirements by the time the November 1993 and January-February 1994 application periods came around, there was no need for this tolerance and no justification for continuing it and, indeed, we are not doing so. Instead, I have asked farmers to adhere to the age bands advised to them by my Department during these and all future application periods under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope that the flexibility I have encouraged within my Department on these two issues will result in a speeding up of any outstanding January-February 1993 special beef premium payments which can be made under the EU Regulations.</P>
    <P>My Department can, of course, only do so much.  We cannot process problem cases where farmers fail to respond to inquiries from my Department.  By way of example, as many as 40,000 June 1993 special beef premium applicants have had to be written to at least once in relation to particular problems.  Responses are very slow and this is a major factor in <Col N="1441" /> determining the speed at which payments can be made.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle, as seans a thabhairt dom an ceist phrainneach seo a phlé.</P>
      <P>I returned recently from London where I was an observer at the judicial review in the British High Court, brought about by Lancashire County Council and Greenpeace, challenging the British Government's decision to license THORP.  About 500 people from Britain, Ireland, Germany and Switzerland stood outside during the proceedings to support the case for a public inquiry on THORP.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, told me that six EU member states, including Ireland, also demanded such a public inquiry.  I thank the Minister and the Department for the work they put into the Irish Government's submission on THORP during the consultation period. The reason for this Adjournment Debate is the conviction, as contained in the Minister's submission, that any attempt to operate THORP without a legal public inquiry would be in breach of EU laws on several counts.</P>
      <P>In this motion I am outlining once again the serious points of law on which a case needs to be taken.  Lest anyone in Government is afraid of taking a case for fear that the British authorities will be upset by our actions, such a case would have widespread support in Britain, given the Greenpeace UK is entirely funded by voluntary subscriptions from the British public, and Lancashire County Council can be described as part of the British establishment.  Let us not wait for an accident such as the &ldquo;Braer&rdquo; or the most recent tragic sinking off our south-west coast.  If the strength of feeling in Britain is such that a voluntary group and a local authority could take a case, surely the Irish Government cannot continue to ignore the overwhelming public outcry here for legal action on THORP and, more generally, on Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1442" /> I have in my possession a Greenpeace Ireland briefing prepared today on the various grounds for taking legal action to stop THORP &mdash; I am sure the Minister's Department has a copy also.  All the various directives mentioned in my motion are covered in this document as well as the reference to the Paris Convention. Some further elaboration of Article 79 of the Euratom Treaty, however, might be useful.  Article 79 requires nuclear installations to keep and provide records to the European Commission in the case of the transport of source materials and special fissile materials which includes plutonium, the raw material for THORP. I urge the Minister to check with the European Commission whether it has been provided with such records from Sellafield.  My information is that none of the deadly shipments has been notified to the Commission.  I understand also that BNFL is reluctant for commercial reasons to give information on the flasks being used.</P>
    <P>I argue that the Minister is in a similar position to those wondering whether to help the Bosnians: people have died, are dying and I fear that unless the nettle is grasped, many more will die.  Will the Minister allow &mdash; in spite of his personal conviction &mdash; a 1,000 percentage increase in aerial discharges and a 900 per cent increase of marine radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea, the most radioactive sea in the world, as the British Government has admitted?  The Minister, through the Irish Government, must immediately challenge the UK Government within the framework of the Paris Convention arbitration process if he is serious in his efforts to stop THORP.  He will have my support, the support of the Irish public and the co-operation of many other countries.  I urge him to grasp the nettle on THORP before it is too late.</P>

      <P>Is cúis áthais dom an deis seo a bheith agam le freagra a thabhairt don Teachta Sargent.  Ba mhaith liom a rá thar cheann mo chomrádaithe polatíochta go bhfuil áthas orainn uilig <Col N="1443" /> go bhfuil sé ar ais tar éis a chuairte go Londain.  Tréaslaím leis as ucht an méid atá á dhéanamh aige ar son na cúise seo.</P>
      <P>Government policy on Sellafield has been and continues to be one of constant opposition to reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel by British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield.  The Government, and its predecessors, have consistently opposed the planned THORP extension to Sellafield since it was first proposed in 1978.</P>
      <P>In the last year, two comprehensive submissions were forwarded by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, in the public consultation process undertaken by the UK authorities &mdash; one in January and the other in October 1993.  These submissions detailed Ireland's absolute opposition to the plant and called for a public inquiry.  Our Government has also used every opportunity in all appropriate international fora, to highlight our concerns and to object to the commissioning of THORP.</P>
      <P>The Government continues to believe, and is supported in its view by numerous international authorities, that there are no demonstrable economic or security benefits arising from the new plant, or that it would balance out possible and even likely risks to public health and environmental damage.  The Government firmly believes that an inquiry should have been undertaken to deal with the basic justification for operating the THORP plant in the changed circumstances prevailing today from those at the time the plant was approved in 1978, as well as other important issues, such as the economics of reprocessing and the need for an environmental impact assessment of the plant to be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Government has always been and continues to be committed to legal action against Sellafield, if a sustainable case for it can be shown to exist, it cannot initiate such action without a firm legal case based on sufficient evidence. The Attorney General has advised that any such legal action would <Col N="1444" /> have to be based on scientific evidence as to the injurious effects of operations at the Sellafield plant on Ireland.  A member state, which is considered by the Commission, or another member state, to have failed to meet an obligation of the EU Treaty may be brought before the Court of Justice.  There is, however, no evidence to date to suggest that the activities at the Sellafield plant are in breach of EU law.  In addition, it should be noted that the Commission has examined the implications of THORP and issued an official opinion on 30 April 1992 that the implementation of the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste from THORP is not liable either in normal operation or in the case of an accident to result in radioactive contamination, significant from the point of view of health, of the water, soil or airspace of another member state.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 1974 Paris Convention for the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources, it should be noted that this convention, and any recommendations arising from it, is not binding on contracting parties.  Therefore, while it is useful in applying political pressure, it has no obligatory status and no means of ensuring compliance. However, a senior official in our Department will attend a forthcoming meeting in connection with this convention, and will raise the serious matter of the UK's lack of commitment to a recommendation with regard to THORP co-sponsored by Ireland and Denmark and approved by a majority of contracting parties at a meeting in June 1993.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that at a High Court hearing in London on 13 January 1994, Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council, to which Deputy Sargent has referred, were given leave for a judicial review into the UK Government's decision to allow THORP to proceed. This judicial review began on 7 February 1994 and is expected to last five days.  Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council contend that THORP should not be allowed to proceed until a full and independent public inquiry has been held.  A senior official in our <Col N="1445" /> Department is in attendance at the judicial review and is closely monitoring the proceedings on our behalf.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen indicated at a recent meeting with a delegation from the Green Party, including Deputy Sargent, that on this matter our Government is open to information and evidence from any source to support a sustainable case regarding the closure of Sellafield.  The Government remains committed absolutely to maintaining vigorous and sustained diplomatic and international pressure on the British authorities with regard to operations at the whole Sellafield complex and the question as to what legal action the Government could take regarding the THORP plant is being kept under constant consideration and review, in consultation with the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the serious condition of the girls' primary school in Adare and I thank the Minister for attending.</P>
      <P>Adare is one of the most beautiful villages of Ireland and has won the national award in the Tidy Towns Competition. The school was established about 1850 and has unique architectural features with a cut stone frontage, a tridentine roof and is situated at the rear of the beautiful local Catholic church.  An extension is being constructed after considerable delay but it is separate from the main school structure.  That extension will provide one extra classroom, a staff room and a library &mdash; remedial room and a toilet for the teachers and the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This extension is welcomed but there is still a serious problem with the main structure as the roof needs to be replaced. The roof is seriously defective and is leaking and there is the additional danger of falling slates.  The windows which were blowing in had to be sealed to prevent this happening and this has created ventilation problems.  There are five classrooms, four of which are used as <Col N="1446" /> classrooms and the fifth classroom is used for general purposes.  There is only one exit door for the six classes.</P>
    <P>The classrooms are subdivided with partitions and glass and there is no privacy for the pupils and teachers in each classroom.  There is serious overcrowding and congestion, and noise is a constant factor.  The environment is totally unsuitable for good education and I have no doubt would be condemned as a fire and safety hazard.</P>
    <P>An additional problem is the antiquated timber flooring and the associated problem of rats.  There are six outdoor toilets and a washroom in primitive condition. There are 124 pupils and four teachers plus a shared remedial teacher using this facility.</P>
    <P>When the Minister passes through Adare, admires this beautiful village and sees the new heritage centre provided at a cost of over £1 million will she think of the school which is not visible on the main tourist route?  Urgent action is needed.  I call on the Minister to redress the unjust and unfair situation that prevails and promise that funds will be provided for the much needed renovation works.  I look forward to her reply.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to this House and through the Deputy, to the people of Adare, my Department's intentions in relation to the provision of suitable permanent accommodation for Adare girls' national school, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>This school is staffed by a principal, three assistant teachers and one remedial teacher.  It has a current enrolment of 122 students.  The facilities at the school consist of five classrooms &mdash; two of which were formed by dividing one former large classroom.</P>
      <P>The school forms part of a former Trinitarian Abbey which was adapted to school usage in 1850.  The building has distinct historical and aesthetic features, the structure is sound but needs updating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I readily acknowledge that conditions in the school are unsatisfactory and <Col N="1447" /> should be improved and I have, therefore, approved an extension to provide an additional classroom, teachers' room and toilets at the school.  This extension is currently under construction and progressing satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>With regard to the repairs to the roof and reconstruction work to the existing school, I am sure the Deputy appreciates that the building is one of great historical significance and that planning of the alterations has to be considered with great care and attention.  This type of project is much more difficult from an architectural and technical viewpoint <Col N="1448" /> than the adaptation of a more modern building or erection of a totally new school.</P>
    <P>The Department has received a cost estimate for the essential work to the roof and the existing school.  The question of grant-aiding the work is being considered in the context of the overall allocation of funds and the Department's other commitments and priorities.  I hope it will be possible to have a decision on this matter conveyed to the Deputy and my colleagues very shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 February 1994.</P>

Some of the recommendations are already in operation, such as 100 per cent grants for the provision of different types of accommodation, statutory schemes of letting priorities which include provision for the travelling community, special grants for travellers buying their first home, guidelines on basic design standards and consultations on the provision of caravan parks.</P>

        <i>Wexford):</i> Ireland was the first member state to submit to the European Commission, in 1987, a national programme for implementation of Directive 85/339/EEC on containers of liquids for human consumption. The success of this programme may be measured by the increased rate of glass bottle recovery (from 6 per cent to its current level of some 29 per cent) and of metal can recovery (from zero to 16 per cent since 1987).  Directive 85/339/EEC is being replaced by a wider measure which, when adopted, will apply to all forms of packaging and packaging waste.</P>
      <P>The national recycling strategy which is currently at an advanced stage of preparation, will aim to optimise all practicable methods of waste recycling in Ireland.

      <P>The Liffey Valley Special Amenity Area Order, which came into operation in March 1990, provides for the preservation and enhancement of the character and special features of the area and for the regulation of development there.  While the reorganisation of local government in Dublin has divided the area covered by the order between South Dublin and Fingal County Council, this should not affect the operation of the order.  Each of these councils is now responsible for implementation of the order in respect of that portion of the area located within its functional area.  In addition, the co-ordination provisions of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 place a duty on the councils to consult with each other and to have regard to the overall interests of their combined areas, and this will facilitate the proper management of the Liffey Valley special amenity area as a whole.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I do not consider the establishment of a Liffey Valley Authority to be necessary and I have no proposals for legislation on the matter.</P>

      <P>Farmers opting for the early retirement scheme who have been on income averaging would be regarded as ceasing the trade of farming on the transfer of the farm.

The size of any tax liability would depend on the circumstances in each individual case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general reform of the corporation tax system which has taken place over the past few years has had among its objectives, reducing the bias in favour of capital intensive investment and bringing down the standard rate of corporation tax to the lowest level possible.  Such a policy necessarily requires the removal of sectoral reliefs and exemptions, and broadening of the tax base through this has facilitated a reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 50 per cent to 40 per cent in the period since 1988.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the corporation tax exemption for the co-operative sector in 1992 such that the profits of co-operatives are liable to taxation in the same manner as the profits of any other enterprise, must be seen as an integral part of this effort to broaden the tax base.  This change has resulted in the profits from the manufacturing activities of co-ops being taxed at the special 10 per cent rate and profits from other activities being taxed at the standard 40 per cent corporation tax rate.  The special needs of those co-ops liable for tax at 40 per cent under the new regime was recognised in the 1992 Finance Act and in order to assist such co-ops in preparing for the transition to full liability to tax, provision was made for the phasing in of the change from exemption to taxation at the standard rate over a three-year period from 1992-94. In addition, co-ops were permitted to offset losses incurred before 1 April 1992 against profits arising after that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the standard 40 per cent corporation tax rate now applies to the non-manufacturing profits of co-ops, the fact remains that co-ops which have a low <Col N="1276" /> level of profit will have a correspondingly small liability for corporation tax.  Such low levels of profit could arise, for example, because of high transport costs associated with locations such as offshore islands.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the important role of the co-operative movement in helping to preserve the social fabric of rural communities. However, I am of the view that, in the light of the special provisions which have already been made to assist co-ops in the transition to full corporation tax liability, further tax concessions would not be appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the judgment of the European Court of Justice on 2 August, 1993 in Case No. C-355/90 brought by the European Commission against the Kingdom of Spain. The Court ruled that Spain had failed to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty of Rome by not classifying the &ldquo;Marismas de Santona (Santona wetlands)&rdquo; as a Special Protection Area and by failing to take appropriate steps to avoid pollution or deterioration of the habitats of that area, in violation of the provisions set out in Article 4 of Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April, 1979 on the conservation of wildbirds.</P>
      <P>Ireland is similarly obliged to designate important bird areas for certain species and all migratory species as Special Protection Areas.  The Office of Public Works commissioned a study of important bird areas which was received last year and has been circulated to interested organisations for comments.</P>
      <P>As a first step five sites will be designated immediately, comments from the public and interested parties are being considered in the case of seven other proposed sites and two more sites are about to be advertised seeking public comments.  I also intend to designate a large number of other sites before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to these sites, the State must undertake to take appropriate measures to prevent pollution and deterioration of <Col N="1278" /> the sites or excessive disturbance to the birds where these are significant.  It will not mean restricting existing activities and will not prevent a reasonable level of development, but any new projects or major activities situated in or likely to affect designated SPA sites should not be undertaken without prior consultation with the Office of Public Works in order to avoid any significant damage to the site.  The relevant Planning Authorities will be asked to take account of the likely effects of any proposed developments in these areas on the bird population when examining development proposals.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that following the recent decision by the European Court, it is now a condition of EU grants in all areas considered internationally important as wild bird habitats, that a member state must first take the appropriate steps to ensure that the wild birds and their habitats are protected. Recently grant-aid was refused by the European Commission for a number of marine shellfish projects in Cork Harbour, Dungarvan Harbour and Bannow Bay despite the fact that the Office of Public Works had confirmed that it was satisfied that there would be no significant adverse impact on the bird population. Grant aid was subsequently approved by the Commission only on condition that Ireland would now take proper measures to protect the birds in these areas and specifically designate them as Special Protection Areas.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that where a person has claimed <Col N="1279" /> the maximum entitlement of 390 days unemployment benefit a further 13 paid insurance contributions are necessary to requalify.</P>
      <P>A person who has used up his/her entitlement to benefit may apply for unemployment assistance, at the long term rate, while in the process of accumulating the necessary 13 paid contributions. In addition, a proportion of the person's earnings from employment is disregarded when determining his/her payment.</P>
      <P>The earnings disregard is equivalent to the maximum daily rate of assistance plus £15.00 for each day worked.  For example, a single person, with no other means, working three days per week can, at present, earn up to £4.60 and receive £29.60 Unemployment Assistance in respect of the other three days.  By contrast, Unemployment Benefit for three days would only be £27.80 for a single person.  The Deputy will be aware that the rates of Unemployment Assistance and Unemployment Benefit are being equalised from July.</P>

      <P>At present, the free schemes are only payable to qualified people over 66, and to people on invalidity pension or other similar payments.  As I announced in my budget speech, the free schemes are being extended to widows aged 60 to 65 whose late husbands were receiving these benefits, and who met the other qualifying conditions for the schemes, apart from the age condition.</P>
      <P>There are about 16,200 widows aged 60 to 65 currently in receipt of a social welfare payment.  It is estimated that to extend free schemes to all these widows would cost an additional £4 million a year over and above the cost of the improvements recently announced in the budget.</P>

      <P>I am introducing a new contributory pension scheme for widowers and their families.  The budget provided £16 million for the cost of this scheme in a full year.  It is estimated that 4,500 men will benefit immediately the new scheme is introduced.</P>
      <P>In line with the National Pensions Board's recommendations, the budget proposed that the new pension would be available to women and men on an equal basis.  Details of the proposed scheme will be contained in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that fewer than 300 new widows would have earnings in excess of £16,000 which is the &ldquo;earnings requirment&rdquo; for men and women for continuation of payment after 1 year, outlined in the budget proposal.  In this context, 5,200 widows would continue to qualify each year.</P>
      <P>In my budget speech, I particularly drew attention to my concern to ensure that the position of widows with young families would be safeguarded in the new scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department does not operate business start-up as suggested by the <Col N="1281" /> Deputy.  Our concern is to facilitate our customers who are seeking opportunities to enter the workforce.  We do this through a variety of schemes and options including second chance education, self-employment, part-time and voluntary and community work initiatives, and PRSL exemption schemes.</P>
      <P>In this context I have introduced job facilitators to enhance our service to our unemployed customers and ensure the closest possible liaison with State services in the interests of the unemployed.</P>
      <P>Eight regional co-ordinators and ten job facilitators have so far been appointed at local level.  These officers were recruited from within my Department on the basis of their considerable experience in assisting unemployed people.  The regionalisation of social welfare services which I introduced has afforded my Department the opportunity to build up very strong links with local communities, and local employers and business interests as evidenced by the Students Summer Jobs Scheme, where almost 5,000 students were placed with over 2,000 local voluntary and community groups.</P>
      <P>Under the Back-to-Work Allowance Scheme which I introduced participants retain a proportion of their payment entitlements and certain secondary benefits for two years while trying out opportunities in indigenous industry, self employment and work with voluntary and community groups.</P>
      <P>Over 800 new jobs have been approved to date under the scheme and 550 people who formerly received either unemployment assistance or Lone Parent's Allowance are participating in it.  Almost 80 per cent of participants are pursuing a wide variety of self-employment projects.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda manpower, that the current manpower in the DMA is 3,984.  The total strength of the Force is 10,892.  The Garda inform me that a number of factors are taken into con-sideration when deploying members of the Force.  These factors would include the area to be covered and the particular type of crime that is prevalent in an area.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> The latest national report by the former Environmental Research Unit on surface water quality indicates that eutrophication is the main pollution threat to continued good water quality in Ireland. Diffuse sources such as agricultural wastes, and point sources such as sewage and industrial waste water, both contribute to this phenomenon.</P>
      <P>While the ERU report did not specifically highlight the threat posed to lake quality by domestic washing-up liquids and detergents, recent reports relating to Lough Derg and Lough Conn implicate detergents as a contributor to water quality problems in these lakes.</P>
      <P>A major Government programme of new and improved sewage treatment facilities is already under way and will be continued in line with the provisions of the National Development Plan.  Local authority controls on industrial and trade effluents under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990, will be maintained and licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency will apply in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detergents industry has already been reducing or eliminating the phosphate <Col N="1291" /> content of detergents.  Phosphatefree brands are now widely available in Ireland and have achieved a considerable market share.  My Department has initiated discussions with the Irish Detergent and Allied Products Association with a view to maintaining and increasing this trend in favour of environmentally-friendly products.</P>
    <P>Developments in the context of the EU Eco-labelling scheme will help the overall trend.  For example, criteria recently agreed under this scheme for domestic washing machines and dish-wasters are designed to reduced required amounts of detergents.  Discussions on separate EU Eco-labelling for fabric detergents are in progress.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> The making of charges generally by local authorities, including domestic refuse collection charges, is provided for in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983.  Under this Act, a decision as to whether a charge should be made in relation to any particular service provided to householders, and the amount of any such charge, is a matter for decision by the elected members of the local authority.  There is no proposal to alter these provisions.</P>

      <P>A range of measures is nonetheless being applied to minimise acid deposition in Ireland, including controls on sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from road traffic, licensing of industrial plant emissions, limits on the sulphur content of gas oil and certain solid fuels, and promotion of natural gas use. National sulphur emissions, in particular, have reduced considerably as a result of these measures and now stand at over 25 per cent less than 1980 levels.</P>

      <P>Sustainable growth, denoting a policy and strategy for continued economic and social development with full respect for environment, is a central objective of the Programme for a Partnership Government. The principle of sustainable growth is already reflected in national legislation, through the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, which requires the Agency, in carrying out its functions, to have regard to the need to promote sustainable and environmentally sound development.  It has also been elaborated specifically as an objective of the National Development Plan, in accordance with standing Government policy as well as the requirements of the Structural Funds Regulations.</P>

Given that elements of this scheme do not come within the ambit of the Water Services Programme. I propose to provide finance by way of a capital grant equal to 50 per cent of the cost of the proposed works with the balance being provided from South Dublin County Council's own resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>The Kilcock-Maynooth-Leixlip by-pass, which is being provided by Kildare County Council, is being carried out in two main contracts.  The award of the first contracts, which is for the provision of approximately 10km of two lane dual motorway, 1.5km of single lane carriageway, an interchange at Straffan Road, five other bridges and associated works on the line of the by-pass between the Maynooth-Celbridge Road to a point about 3km west of Kilcock, was approved by the then Minister for the Environment on 12 August 1991.  The award of the second contract, which is for the construction of approximately 6.2km of dual two-lane motorway, 1km of single carriageway at the Leixlip-Celbridge Road, 2km of single carriageway at the Lucan-Celbridge Road, 2km of other accommodation roads and ramps generally, the construction of a major crossing of the River Liffey near Leixlip, the Leixlip Interchange Bridge and three other bridges and associated works on the line of the by-pass from the Lucan by-pass to the Maynooth-Celbridge Road, was approved by me on 2 October 1992.  The award of both contracts was made only after full consideration of the tenders by Kildare County Council and then by my Department.  Both main contractors are considered to be progressing the scheme satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition of the county council <Col N="1298" /> team supervising these contracts was approved by my Department and the costs involved are chargeable against road grant.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 January 1994 the National Roads Authority took over from my Department the strategic management of the national roads programme and the overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads including the Kilcock-Maynooth-Leixlip by-pass project.  While I continue to exercise overall policy supervision, provide a block grant to the authority and carry out certain quasi-judicial functions in relation to national roads, neither I nor my Department have responsibility for day-to-day supervision of the work programme.</P>

      <Quest>the rationale behind the Council objective that, during the first five years from the entry into force of the Directive harmonising national measures for the management of packaging and packaging waste, member states should take the necessary measure to ensure an upper limit on the amount recovered, 76 per cent, and recycled, 45 per cent; the way in which this restriction can be justified environmentally; and whether any member state would be in a position to recover and recycle a higher percentage.</Quest>

      <P>The proposal for a Council Directive on packaging and packing waste, a common position on which was agreed at the Environment Council of 13 December 1993, provides that, in the case of member states generally (a) no later than five years from the date by which the directive must be implemented in national law, between 50 per cent as a minimum and 65 per cent as a maximum by weight of packaging waste will be recovered, and (b) within this general target, and within the same time period, between 25 per cent as a minimum and 45 per cent as a maximum by weight of packaging waste will be recycled, with a minimum of 15 per cent for each packaging material.</P>
      <P>In the case of certain smaller peripheral member states, including Ireland, at least 25 per cent of packaging waste must be recovered within the first five years, with the targets at (a) and (b) above to be reached by the end of 2005.</P>
      <P>The common position agreed by qualified majority of the Environment Council represents the balance of political views within the Union at this time on the regulation of the packaging waste stream.  The draft directive as currently agreed has been designed to deal with different situations in member states and the need to avoid creating barriers to trade or distortion of competition.</P>

However, the Green Paper does not purport to reach definite conclusions on the transboundary aspect.</P>

      <P>Negotiations with the European Commission on the national plan are under way with a view to agreeing the Community support framework.  Detailed discussions on a new operational programme for agriculture with its sub programme for forestry are proceeding in parallel with these negotiations.  It is proposed that this programme will again include a grant scheme for mechanised forestry harvesting equipment.</P>
      <P>The grant application to which the Deputy refers was made in December 1993.  It was not possible to consider it in advance of expiry of the Forestry operational programme at end December last.  The applicant will however be considered for grant assistance under the relevant element of the new forestry operational, sub-programme, once approved, and in this regard my Department will shortly be in touch with the applicant.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the present pricing structure operated by Bord Gáis Éireann, whereby the more a consumer uses, the less he pays per unit, hinders energy conservation, is damaging to the environment and contrary to our CO 2 abatement strategy, shortens the life of the Kinsale gas field and is unfair to customers who use less and consequently pay more per unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann is a statutory body charged with the obligation to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis.</P>
      <P>The board applies a number of tariffs which decreases the cost of natural gas to the consumer as more gas is consumed. The board endeavours to match customers to the appropriate tariff for their usage pattern.  Given the wide choice of fuels available to the consumer, Bord Gáis Éireann is satisfied that its tariffs structure is competitive and sufficiently responsive to market needs.</P>
      <P>The Bord Gáis gas purchase agreement with Marathon Petroleum is based on a specified minimum offtake each year consistent with optimum recovery of gas from the Kinsale Head gas field.  It makes commercial sense, therefore, for Bord Gáis Éireann that a consumer buying natural gas in large quantities should be able to take advantage of discounted tariffs. Discounts for users buying in bulk are already quite common in other sectors of the energy market in which natural gas competes.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the Bord Gáis tariff structure hinders energy conservation or is damaging to the environment. Natural gas is a clean efficient fuel and contributes both to energy conservation reducing harmful emissions as compared with alternative fuels.</P>

      <P>The 1974 Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from land based sources, and any Recommendations arising from it, is not legally enforceable on Contracting Parties.  In particular, the UK Government dissented from Recommendation 93/5 which was supported by a majority of Contracting Parties at a joint meeting of the Oslo and Paris Commissions which took place in Berlin in June 1993.  The UK Government have stated that they consider that the role which this particular Recommendation sought to provide for the Paris Commission was unacceptable to them, that is, in the approval or rejection of a specific project.</P>
      <P>I consider the UK's attitude to be totally unsatisfactory in the context of protecting our environment from radioactive discharges from nuclear reprocessing operations.  In this connection, I have arranged for a senior representative from my Department to attend a forthcoming Oslo/Paris Commission meeting to raise the serious matter of the UK's lack of commitment to Recommendation 93/5.</P>

Additional funding of £12.5m is being provided for the development of mental handicap services in 1994.  As in previous years, this funding will be allocated following consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees and will be used to <Col N="1315" /> provide, <i>inter alia</i>, additional residential and day places.</P>
      <P>In regard to people with a physical or sensory disability detailed information of the kind requested by the Deputy is not collected by my Department as a matter of routine.  However, it is planned to establish a national database on persons with a physical or sensory disability and this matter is being examined by the Review Group on Physical and Sensory Disability.</P>
      <P>I am committed to improving the provision of health services for people with a disability and will examine how this can best be achieved in the light of the recommendations of the Review Group whose final report will be published later this year.</P>

    <P>However, children in urban areas, whose parents wish them to attend their nearest school under Protestant management, all-Irish or multi-denominational school may be issued with bus tickets, provided that they otherwise <Col N="1321" /> satisfy the conditions of the school transport scheme.</P>
    <P>In the case in question, there is an all-Irish school much closer to the pupil's home and she is not, therefore, eligible for transport to the school named by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In addition, as the Deputy is aware, a judicial review has been initiated by the students' union on the question of student representation on the Governing Body.  This also constrains my consideration of the appointment of a governing Body.</P>

      <P>Because of the financial constraints which have existed for a number of years it has not yet been possible to make funding available for the provision <Col N="1322" /> of physical education facilities at Pobal Scoil na Rosann, Dungloe, Co. Donegal.</P>
      <P>Due to demands on the capital resources available, priority has been given for some time to the provision of essential teaching spaces.  However, physical education facilities are provided in all major new school developments.</P>
      <P>The provision of indoor sports accommodation in schools, in the form of a general purpose area at primary level and a hall at second level will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for urgent classroom accommodation has eased.  In the meantime, additional emphasis is being placed on the adjacent siting and common use of school and community recreational facilities and schools should make maximum use of other sports facilities in their area.</P>
