      <P>It is proposed to take No. 6 and, subject to the agreement of No. 6, Supplementary Estimates Votes 1, 16, 19, 20 and 42 followed by Nos. 10, 11, 12, 7 and 8 and that the following arrangements shall apply.  (1) Subject to the agreement of No. 6, Supplementary Estimates Votes 1, 16, 19, 20 and 42 shall be moved together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair and any division demanded on Estimates today shall be taken forthwith.

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, allow me to go through the matters proposed. If you wish to intervene at any stage please do so, but allow me to commence the proceedings in the normal manner. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 6 in respect of the Supplementary Estimates, Votes 1, 16, 19, 20 and 42, satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil has been summoned to deal with business under Article 13.1 of the Constitution which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> The President shall, on the nomination of Dáil Éireann, appoint the Taoiseach, that is, the head of the Government or Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>I understand that this item on the Order of Business takes precedence over all other Standing Orders.  Members have raised questions as to why we cannot have Question Time or Private Members' time or conduct ordinary business when there is a caretaker Government in office.  Clarification should be given on that.  If we can deal with Estimates without debate, surely we should be able to deal with other business in the ordinary course of activity.  In respect of Estimates, we expect a guarantee from the Ministers involved that there will be a full-scale debate in due course within the appropriate committees dealing with the Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A question was raised as to the validity of business transacted by a Dáil which is summoned to deal with business under Article 13.1 of the Constitution.  If the Dáil is bound by that Article of the Constitution it appears that the only business it can deal with constitutionally is the appointment of a Taoiseach and that therefore it is not constitutional for the Dáil to deal with Estimates.  If it is constitutional for it to deal with Estimates, it should also be constitutional for it to deal with Question Time.  Before we agree to this business, will the Taoiseach clarify the constitutional status of the business the acting Government is asking us to transact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending the outcome of the election of Taoiseach and the incoming Government such procedures are not unusual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, this is the first time since 1919, when the Dáil was founded, that we have had a Government of this kind, without an election, seeking to transact business.  It is clear that under the 1937 Constitution the only business we can constitutionally transact is the appointment of a Taoiseach.  I am asking the Government, which presumably has an Attorney General advising it, to indicate the constitutional status of this business.  It seems this is constitutionally dubious business.  If it is constitutionally proper business, all other normal business such as Question Time should also be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 15.10 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>Each House shall make its own rules and standing orders, with power to attach penalties for their infringement, and shall have power to ensure freedom of debate, to protect its official documents and the private papers of its members, and to protect itself and its members against any person or persons interfering with, molesting or attempting to corrupt its members in the exercise of their duties.</P>
      <P>The House makes its own rules.  Deputy Bruton and everybody else is aware that this is not a new situation.  I will be governed by the Chair and the rules of this House just as every other Member.  This is not new; it has been the precedent for quite a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That Article refers to normal business of the Dáil.  Article 13.1, which takes precedence over that, relates to the business that is being transacted today.  The Dáil was summoned today under Article 13.1, not under Article 15, and I ask the Taoiseach to bear that in mind.  If he looks at the Order Paper he will see a reference to business under Article 13.1 of the Constitution.  That Article refers to <Col N="609" /> one item of business only, the appointment of a Taoiseach.  I therefore submit that the business the Government is attempting to put through today is unconstitutional.  We in this Assembly are bound by the Constitution; we cannot reinterpret it on the hoof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is well aware that certain business has to be carried on.  He is well aware, as a former Minister, of the requirements of certain Departments.  If he and other Members are suggesting that the business should not continue in the manner in which it is laid before the House, let them say so.  What we are trying to do is carry on business while the House sorts out its problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies in Fianna Fáil, particularly on the Front Bench, would do well to keep quiet, considering what they have succeeded in doing unaided.  I submit to you, Sir, as Ceann Comhairle and guardian of our rights that the business we have been asked to transact is, as stated on top of the Order Paper, business under Article 13.1.  The item of business we are now being asked to deal with is not business under Article 13.1.  I suggest that the House adjourn for a period to allow the Government obtain advice from the Attorney General to satisfy us that the business the Government is asking us to transact is constitutional.  If it is not constitutional, it will not be valid and any money spent under these Estimates will not be properly spent and will have to be recouped in some fashion.  I remind the Government we are all bound by the Constitution.</P>

    <Col N="610" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not our advice in this case.  There are many precedents in this House for the carrying on of business as outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Government be so kind as to make the advice available?  Will the Government further indicate why, if it is constitutional to transact Estimates, as the Taoiseach is now saying without having visibly consulted with anybody, it is not constitutional to have Question Time?  Ministers on the Fianna Fáil benches are spending money and approving Estimates while they are not subject to normal parliamentary questions on those decisions.  If the Government has power under the Constitution to spend money, the Dáil also has power under the Constitution to ask questions about it.  You cannot have it one way and not the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny made a proposition to the House earlier that the Estimates that we are asking to be passed today will be the subject of further debate whenever the Opposition so wishes.  If Deputy Kenny is saying that and Deputy Bruton is saying something different, what does Fine Gael really want?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It can go on and it will, if necessary.  I remind you, as a constitutional officer, that we are bound by the Constitution and if the business is not valid constitutionally the Executive cannot act on decisions taken.  Will the Taoiseach, before we agree to business other than business under Article 13, furnish us with written constitutional advice from the Attorney General on the validity of that business?  If that is not available, will he make sure that all <Col N="611" /> normal business including Question Time is continued?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is correct in so far as the official business before the House today is the approval of nomination by the Taoiseach of other members of the Government, but since the House may not be in a position to proceed to that matter the House is entitled to proceed to make its own arrangements for today. There are many precedents for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, the House should decide that we take Question Time today.  I cannot see how the Government can make provision for its business and not allow Members to transact their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, having regard to the point you made in response to the valid point made by Deputy Bruton I seek your guidance on the matter of Article 28.4 of the Constitution which sets out the responsibility of the Government to this House as an assembly.  If one puts that Article alongside the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, that this House <Col N="612" /> should conduct a plethora of business without being given the opportunity to have a debate we are on very dangerous ground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked for clarification on this matter because Members were inquiring why we could not have Question Time, Private Members' time or ordinary business and you asked the Taoiseach who, in turn, said it was a matter for the Chair.  There is no clarification as to whether we can, legally and constitutionally, transact the business as read out by the Government Chief Whip.  We were summoned under the Order of the Dáil to deal with business under Article 13.1.  That is our primary responsibility.  Will you now adjudicate on what the Taoiseach said, that this is a matter for you to decide?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated the position.  We have met to deal with a certain matter and if we are not ready to deal with it we are entitled to make our own arrangements as to the business for today.  That is not unusual in these circumstances; there are many precedents for it.</P>

As apparently, we are in a new era of trust, accountability and transparency he might explain how depriving Members of this House of Question Time is consistent with this.</P>

She was concerned that this and related matters would be discussed in the House.  I gave a commitment that if the Estimate was put through with agreement it could be discussed by committees of the Houses later and that there would be a debate.  One of the major reasons for taking the Justice Estimate is to pay compensation to victims of crime.  We want to have the power to do that before the end of the year.</P>

I suggested to the Whips that the Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill which is before the House be withdrawn by way of motion at a later stage when we would have a full debate to meet the concerns expressed by Deputy McGrath, the Fine Gael spokesperson. The Whips met last week and this week and there was no hint that there were any constitutional difficulties. The House can vote on this matter and if it votes against the business we can proceed with the Adjournment debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been pressing for some time for the payment of compensation to the victims of crime.  It has been the subject of censure by the Committee of Public Accounts.  While I am anxious to see that Estimate being put through there is also the question of loss of life &mdash; a number of murders have not been solved &mdash; the huge drugs problem and the growing problems of vigilantes and paedophilia which need to be discussed in this House and to which we need answers.  We are being asked to <Col N="616" /> pass not only the Justice Vote but also the amended Garda Vote.  The central problem is that there is no accountability. We were asked, under Article 13.1, to deal with certain business but on arrival to deal with that business we were asked instead to nod through Estimates although these matters are the source of great concern for the public. As my party spokesperson on Justice, I am anxious that money will be made available but I also want some system put in place to ensure accountability.  It should be possible to make arrangements for Question Time or provide for some other facility to allow us to ask questions before these matters are put through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of great importance.  The House agreed not to have normal Question Time on the assumption that the crisis would be resolved quickly.  We cannot allow the situation to continue where an acting Government seeks to continue with ordinary business without being accountable to the House and without making provision for Question Time or Private Members' time.  As this is such a serious matter you might consider calling a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges today with a view to clarifying the matter in relation to questions until a Government is formed and setting the rules for the future.</P>

An attempt was made on Committee Stage to take this without debate and we objected at the time.

      <P>Amendment No. 1 is in the name of Deputies Gilmore and McGrath.  I note that amendment No. 2 and amendment No. <Col N="630" /> 1 to amendment No. 2 are related and amendment No. 3 is an alternative to amendment No. 2.  It is proposed that amendments Nos. 1, 2, amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 2, and amendment No. 3 be taken together.  Is that satisfactory? Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10)  This section shall, in relation to Letterkenny Regional Technical College, have immediate effect and the Minister shall make the necessary order not later than two weeks after the enactment of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputies Gilmore, Keogh and I are anxious that this amendment be adopted because we are conscious of the urgent need to put right the horrendous problems which have emerged in Letterkenny Regional Technical College. Up to last week I would have said those problems were unsurpassed in the Irish education sector but in view of what is happening in Westmeath vocational education committee, the problems in Letterkenny will fade into oblivion.  The problems in Westmeath vocational education committee surpass those of Letterkenny in terms of mismanagement and misappropriation of public funds.  It is a sad that an incident worse than that at Letterkenny has emerged.</P>
      <P>We are anxious to facilitate the Minister to move rapidly so that he can put in place procedures to deal with the problems that have come to light in Letterkenny. I note he has suggested a possible alternative which will probably achieve the same objective.  It is important that action be taken quickly in Letterkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable the Minister to proceed immediately to appoint a commissioner to deal with the problems reported on in the inspector's report to <Col N="631" /> Letterkenny regional technical college and to provide for a better system of safeguards for the other regional technical colleges.  The original amendment tabled by the Minister, as an afterthought, proposed that a commission be appointed for any regional technical college where an inspector had made a report and where the Minister was not satisfied that the college was properly run.  It seemed to us that that was casting an aspersion on regional technical colleges generally which was not justified, that it was unfair to tar all the regional technical colleges with the Letterkenny brush.  We argued that while there was an urgency to deal with the Letterkenny problem two sets of circumstances should be defined in the Bill; one to deal with the Letterkenny problem immediately and, the other to provide a system whereby proposals to deal with other colleges would be the subject of debate in the House.</P>
      <P>The problems that gave rise to this measure in Letterkenny were discussed in considerable detail in the select committee. What we have seen in the report by Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien is the most appalling litany of political jobbery and mismanagement in a public body for a very long time.  It is right and proper that it should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate and unfair to the staff and students of Letterkenny Regional Technical College and to the local community that the reputation of that college should have been so tarnished by the sordid activities that took place and the sordid way in which the chairman of the governing body conducted the affairs of that college since his appointment by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Seamus Brennan, almost two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem emanates from the fact that the chairman was a political appointee of the then Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan.  If there is a lesson to be learned from this, it is the inappropriateness of appointing political hacks to senior educational posts. The vocational education committee <Col N="632" /> system has been a good one.  It has adapted itself well to changing circumstances, providing a range of courses and various educational options.  Those who work in the vocational education committees are committed to the system. The parents, students and local communities are committed to it but it is being undermined by abuse at a political level where what could be described as square pegs are appointed to fill round holes, where people are appointed not for their educational competence or their managerial abilities but on the basis of their political affiliation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath raised the problem in Westmeath.  The problem extends not only to the appointment of boards and governing bodies but regrettably it extends also to the appointment of teachers, principals and vice-principals. I have been told repeatedly that applicants in order to qualify for appointment as principals, vice-principals or even posts of responsibility in some vocational education committee schools have to carry the party card.  I have been told repeatedly that when a vacancy for school principal is expected to arise within one or two years people who have never been known to have an interest in politics suddenly join the cumann, work their way through the political system and are appointed to the post.  It is time to call a halt to that type of political jobbery, which has been operating for far too long in the vocational education committee system. I hope lessons can be learned from the Letterkenny case and that such matters are addressed in this new era of transparency, trust and accountability.  Legislation should be introduced making it obligatory to state the qualifications necessary and reasons for appointments to such positions.  The present system of appointment is unfair to the majority of those working in and committed to the vocational education committee system. In fairness, not all vocational education committees behave in this manner, but some do and it must be stopped.  I hope what happened in Letterkenny, the <Col N="633" /> measures taken to deal with it and the fact that it has been given a public airing will bring to light not alone the problem there but the wider problem of political abuse in the vocational education committee system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage we debated the report on the Letterkenny case and the sorry and damning indictment it contained.  It is an indictment of political jobbery at its worst, something we must guard against and bring to light at every possible opportunity.  The Minister knows that my colleagues and I want this legislation to be passed but we object strongly to its going through on the nod.  That would not be appropriate and valuable amendments have been tabled.  We want to particularise the Bill to the Letterkenny case because if passed as originally drafted we would damn every regional technical college. That would be unfortunate having regard to the excellent work carried out by the majority of such colleges and their boards.  It is a terrible indictment of a system that allows political favouritism to hold sway over appropriate qualification when making appointments to boards.  That should never be allowed to happen.  When the Minister appoints a commission we should have an opportunity to debate the appointments to it. I hope that will lead to public accountability, which has been sadly lacking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Westmeath vocational education committee and the reported deficit of some £450,000 was referred to.  That is an enormous sum of money to be unaccounted for and I hope the Minister acts swiftly in that regard.  I have tabled an amendment stating that every order made under subsection (1) should come before the House.  That should not be an opportunity for the order to fall through the cracks, as it were, and for a Minister to make an order without it being debated fully in this House.  We have seen what happens when there is not accountability.  We have had a sorry tale in the past few weeks because of the lack of accountability and openness. These amendments should be accepted <Col N="634" /> as a microcosm of what should happen in political life.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore and I are past students of the same university but he sometimes makes me groved by stating that ex-cumann members are appointed to certain positions.  It should be known that Deputy Gilmore came through a similar system.  Naturally he must back the USI, of which he was president, because he used the students union to get to his present position.  He commended the courage of two officers of the students union who have blown the whistle in spite of attempts by Mr. McGlinchey to browbeat them.  One of the people involved in this case is a student and the other is a sabbatical student, a law lecturer.  I circulated the committee with the exact account of what happened in Letterkenny.  Does Deputy Gilmore call those who signed forged cheques courageous students, people who find it more lucrative to do that than to pursue a career in law?  The proceeds from 17 discos were not lodged in the accounts of the students union and a cheque for a prom held in Ballybofey bounced and was not honoured until the taxpayer paid into the students union six months later.  I ask Deputy Gilmore where that money went.</P>

      <P>I am critical of the Hederman report because it did not answer the correct questions.  Questions remain to be answered.  If I ask the Minister to <Col N="635" /> extend the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the accounts of the students union for the years 1992-93 and 1993-94 perhaps Deputy Gilmore might consider withdrawing his remark about the courageous students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of participating in this debate and have so far refrained from saying anything about the college in Letterkenny.  However, since coming into the House I have heard Deputy Gilmore talk about the appointments system which he should know was instituted under the colleges Act we are proposing to amend.  It has always been my contention that we should not have had such an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely unnecessary. What we should have done was amend the vocational education committee Act, 1930.  Under the vocational education committees the colleges were established and thriving.  Had they not been thriving the Department, under the control of any Minister would not have wished to take them over or centralise them, to do away with the whole <Col N="636" /> concept of the people living in those regions serving the regions.  Regional authorities know better than does central authority the needs of the regions and what should be the curricula in our regional technical colleges.</P>
      <P>The system of appointment is new.  I say to Deputy Gilmore and to anybody else who alleges that all the appointments in these colleges are politically motivated, I served on the management board of Letterkenny Regional Technical College for 11 years and I defy anyone in this House or elsewhere to substantiate their allegations.  If they are afraid to do so outside the House let them do it here and protect themselves.  Let anyone pinpoint one politically motivated appointment to that college during the years the vocational education committee ran it.</P>
      <P>My only wish is that the problems associated with that college due to recent happenings, will be resolved as quickly as possible.  Delay has already damaged the college.  It has been damaged not by what has been proven but rather by what is yet to be proven. Student numbers have not increased, its morale is being destroyed and parents' confidence is badly shattered, not merely because of the happenings there but by the manner in which they have been dealt with and the snail's pace with which they continue to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Let us get the college back in business. Let us look to the students and their welfare because that is the concept of the college.  I regret there ever was a Colleges Act, without which we could have handled such problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for the urgency with which we can deal with the amendments to this Bill.  It demonstrates the anxiety of all Members to ensure that legislative arrangements are in place whereby we can quickly begin to tackle the problems encountered at Letterkenny Regional Technical College. My overriding concern is to ensure that operations in that college are <Col N="637" /> restored as quickly as possible so that once again we shall have the wide support not only of the students but of its teachers, those associated with the college and the electorate generally.</P>
      <P>Deputies McGrath and Keogh raised problems associated with Westmeath Vocational Educational Committee.  I have taken appropriate action to ensure that all of the matters relating to those problems are speedily brought to light and dealt with.</P>
      <P>This Bill which was amended in Select Committee provides for the appointment of a Commission to manage and operate a regional technical college or a Dublin Institute of Technology in cases or circumstances in which serious problems arise.  It imposes very clear-cut provisions in respect of gender balance among members of governing bodies.  It provides for default by a vocational education committee in the appointment of governing bodies and clarity on the electorate for academic and nonacademic staff.  Furthermore, it gives the Minister for Education power to appoint an acting Director or President to those institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of deliberations at the Select Committee Members expressed concern that the provisions relating to the appointment of a Commission were too wide-ranging and lacked sufficient supervision by the Oireachtas.  Resulting from those concerns I propose to amend the Bill to provide that any orders, other than the order relating to Letterkenny regional technical college, will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and will require confirmation by both Houses before becoming effective. However, I am concerned that there might be undue delay in the confirmation process.  This could arise, in particular, during the Dáil summer recess. To provide for such a contingency I propose that an order will become effective if not confirmed within 28 days of having been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Of course, this would not apply, where either House has passed a resolution annulling the order.  As a further safeguard for the Oireachtas I <Col N="638" /> propose that, whenever an order becomes effective without a resolution of either House of the Oireachtas, the Houses of the Oireachtas will have an opportunity to annual the order within 21 sitting days of making that order.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I have met fairly and squarely the anxieties and suggestions made in the course of our Committee Stage deliberations and it should satisfy the wishes of my colleagues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's contribution was quite selective.  I referred to this on Committee Stage.  On my behalf and on behalf of many of my colleagues who serve on local authorities and vocational education committees.  I reject the very strong innuendo in what Deputy Gilmore said here today, on Committee Stage, and at other times, that the majority of people, many of whom serve voluntarily&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;within our educational and local authority systems are quite careless, reckless and do not give due consideration to the necessity to serve the public with integrity and to the best of their ability.  Deputy Gilmore undermines the credibility of people in public life in resorting to that selective, unproven type propaganda delivered too often in this House in that manner without proof.  Deputy Gilmore knows as well as I that there may well be a case to be made against a particular individual to the effect that perhaps matters could have been dealt with in a different manner.  Equally, Deputy Gilmore knows that constitutes a tiny part of the problem only in Letterkenny regional technical college but he has decided to ignore that and make a solid accusation again in this House without evidence to back it up.</P>

      <P>A number of major problems associated with the management of that college do not reside in one person.  There is a need to take decisive action and go forward as quickly as possible towards a restoration of credibility in the operation of that college so that we can once again be proud of it.  It would serve this House better to encourage investigation of the facts rather than slanting our views in a way which does not do justice to the average public representative in this House, on local authorities or on vocational education committees.  I support Deputy Blaney's contention that the media has given sustenance to the idea that public representatives do not take into account the merits of candidates coming before them, the reasons the vocational education system has been eminently successful, and the wisdom of people on all political sides who made decisions over the years.  It must be remembered that for the greater part of 20 years Fianna Fáil has not had a majority on most local authorities.  Any accusations should, therefore, be levelled across the board.  I make no accusations against other parties.  I believe they try to do their job as well as they can and I am prepared to support them.  Whenever mistakes are made my Department will take responsibility for putting solutions in place as quickly as possible.  That is what we are doing here.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 is made adequate by the Minister's amendment, No. 10a.  Deputy Keogh had a further amendment which would delete all the words after the word &ldquo;order&rdquo; in the fifth line of the new subsection (11).  Our concern is that a one party Government which did not want a debate on a particular issue could make an order without having it debated in the House, the Government having to adopt a pro-active stance to have it debated.  Deputy Keogh's amendment <Col N="640" /> would put the initiative on the Government to have a debate in the Dáil.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 37, to delete &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two shall be women and at least two shall be men and of whom at least four (of the said six persons)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will try not to delay the House since we had a volume of debate on this amendment on Committee Stage.  The Minister on the one hand is asking the academic council and the students' union to democratically elect one man and one woman to the governing bodies of these colleges while at the same time he is asking the vocational education committees to nominate six people regardless of their gender.  It is unreasonable for the Minister to expect democratic and gender balance principles to prevail in the work place and not in terms of nominations from the vocational education committee.  He is not prepared to ask public representatives to ensure gender equity but he is prepared to force it on other people, and that is unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister promised on Committee Stage to go down the road towards meeting our requirements in this regard. On that basis we agreed not to press the amendment on that occasion.  If the <Col N="645" /> Minister checks the record he will realise that he gave a firm committment in that regard.  I am very disappointed he did not meet that commitment.  Perhaps at this eleventh hour he will agree that what we propose is reasonable. Gender equity should be imposed not only at one end of the scale but right across the board.  It should not be imposed in a slipshod manner whereby it is applicable to the academic staff but not to vocational education committee appointees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the notion that gender equity should be generally applied, particularly in terms of vocational education committees who should not be let off the hook in this instance.  During the Committee Stage debate the Minister accepted the principle of what we proposed and consequently. I will be surprised if he does not accept this amendment.  I ask him to realise the logic of the case that has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this very reasonable amendment.  I do not think the Minister can cherry pick on gender balance.  This is the only education legislation the last Government brought to this House in its two years in office.  It was introduced on the basis that the then Minister was very committed to the establishment of gender balance in the appointment to governing bodies of regional technical colleges.  I agree with this principle but I cannot understand why a certain rule is set down for staff and students in electing members to the governing body &mdash; they must ensure gender balance &mdash; while no such rule applies to the vocational education committees, the biggest single nominator of members of the governing body.  It cannot be argued that the reason for that is because there may not be a sufficient number of women on the vocational education committee.  As I understand it, the nominations are to be made by the vocational education committee and, with the exception of the three members of the local authority, is not <Col N="646" /> confined to vocational education committee members.  It is surely within the bounds of possibility that the vocational education committees would find a sufficient number of women to be nominated.</P>
      <P>Gender balance in the education system will not be achieved simply by changing the method of appointment of governing bodies and boards of management. I will be much more impressed by the Government's commitment to achieving gender balance in the education system when more women are appointed as principals and to other positions of responsibility in schools, when the first woman is appointed as director of a regional technical college or when a greater number of women are appointed to heads of departments in those colleges, which is little in evidence at present.  If the appointment of governing bodies on a more gender balanced basis brings about such changes, it will be welcome, but to exempt vocational education committees from the legislation would make a total nonsense of what is being attempted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is a perfect system enshrined in the amendment proposed by the Minister.  It is important for us to look back at the origins of this amendment.  It arose from the fact that vocational education committees, as constituted under the 1930 legislation, are not required to provide for gender equity, nor is it provided for under the 1992 legislation which is the principal Act dealing with the constitution of governing bodies.  While that Act specifies that the Minister must conform to the requirement that there be gender equity, it does not contain any provision to ensure that is done.  This amendment is proposed to ensure that not fewer than seven of those recommended by the vocational education committees are women and not fewer than seven are men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vocational education committees, for the first time, will be compelled by legislation to adhere to the principle of gender equity.  In an ideal world we <Col N="647" /> would not compel them to do so, we would facilitate them.  It is far better to ensure that the vocational education committees will be morally bound to get the matter right instead of legislating for a precise number.  We recognise that certain vocational education committees are not in a position to provide for gender equity but we can ensure that the governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology and each regional technical college will adhere to the principle of gender equity.</P>
    <P>That is the best we can do; it is not perfect, it would be better if we did not have to state, in relation to student and staff representation, that there should be one man and one woman.  I would like to see exact numbers but we should be loath to insist on this.  We should allow the Minister's amendment to be put into effect for a period and if it is not operating satisfactorily we can return to this legislation.  The important point is that the Minister is ensuring that the principle of gender equity will be applied which was not possible under the previous legislation.  If necessary, the matter can be dealt with in the future or under the 1930 legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised a relevant point.  It is important to have gender equity in the school at both principal and staff level, at primary, second or third level.  There is an anomaly in regard to principalships.  In second level schools there were more female than male principals.  Now that the religious are vacating schools because of the problem relating to numbers, in girls' schools they are being replaced by males.  The Minister should address this problem and what I might call the nuts and bolts of the administration of the education system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I indicated I would consider very carefully the question of the extent to which I could meet the wishes of Opposition Deputies.  I said I considered their amendment unnecessarily restrictive and reinforced subsection (2) (a) to <Col N="648" /> ensure that the gender balance provisions could be implemented as intended.  It states categorically that vocational education committees will be required to ensure that at least seven of the people they recommend are women and seven are men.</P>
      <P>The aim of subsection (2) (b) is to allow the Minister for Education to exercise some control over the process of making recommendations for appointment to governing bodies.  As the legislation stands, the Minister appoints the governing bodies recommended by vocational education committees. The difficulties caused by the gender balance issue demonstrated how the Minister can be prevented from imposing any criteria on the selection process even where there is an obligation by statute or Government policy, to impose such criteria.  The amendment I tabled to this paragraph will enable the Minister for Education to ensure, if necessary, that the vocational education committees comply with the overall spirit of the legislation on gender balance.</P>
      <P>I would like to go further but that is not practical and it is not capable of being implemented in that form.  In the amendment I propose I have included a directive relating to the appropriate gender balance among the persons nominated by vocational education committees under subsection (1) (a). This should satisfy my colleagues that the Minister for Education and the Department are determined to ensure there will be a gender balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be better if we did not have to adopt legislation of this kind.  As Deputy Costello said, in an ideal world there would be a gender balance without the need for intervention by legislation. It should be a natural phenomenon. Regrettably, this has not been the case and it is not possible because of the composition of the vocational education committees in certain counties and in certain circumstances because of the lack of opportunities to secure appointment as principal of a school.  I think we can all accept that in an ideal world <Col N="649" /> there would be no need for the amendments tabled by Deputies or a response from me.  Given the lack of involvement and participation there is a need for intervention to ensure gender balance and to give the Minister for Education the power to require the vocational education committees to adhere to that principle.  Up to now, despite the Government's position, the vocational education committees were in a position to knock this off the rails.  It will not be possible for them to do this in future.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;Section 20 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>`(2)  On receipt of a report as authorised under subsection (1), the Minister may instruct the governing body to carry out such changes and in such a manner as appropriate to rectify any deficiencies and irregularities identified.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is very important in terms of ministerial control of regional technical colleges.  It deals with the manner in which reports by inspectors from the Department will be dealt with in the Department.  It is particularly important on this day that we look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we should spend some time discussing the implications of what has been happening in County Westmeath vocational education committee.  There is a case of very serious negligence in <Col N="651" /> this vocational education committee.  A former Minister for Education, now a Minister of State, not only participated in appointments which brought about this situation but failed as Minister to take heed of representations regarding problems that had arisen in Westmeath Vocational Education Committee.  In order to understand what happened we need to know the background.  There are acting chief executive officers in several vocational education committees. The procedure for appointment to an acting chief executive officer position is very loose and there are no controls.  An acting chief executive officer of a vocational education committee is appointed by the committee.  I contend that the problems in County Westmeath vocational education committee stem from the appointment of an acting chief executive officer and the manner in which he was appointed.  The Minister will be aware that the acting chief executive officer of County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee is a former Fianna Fáil councillor.  When the vacancy arose the then Fianna Fáil group met and two Fianna Fáil councillors were nominated for the position. On the casting vote of the then chairperson, who subsequently became Minister for Education, one of them was nominated to become the chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>The irregularities in County Westmeath vocational education committee stem from this appointment where party loyalty to Fianna Fáil was a superior consideration over ability to carry out the job.  I have raised some of the irregularities in this vocational education committee in parliamentary questions and the Official Report indicates that this body now has a deficit of more than £450,000 which was not sanctioned by the Minister.  In spite of this huge deficit the vocational education committee embarked on the purchase of a property in France, again without ministerial approval.  This is contrary to the 1930 Act and I wonder if we now can avail of a fail safe procedure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> In fairness I must point out that following my parliamentary questions the then Minister for Education.  Deputy Bhreathnach, recognised the seriousness of the problems and immediately appointed an inspector to investigate the activities of County Westmeath vocational education committee.  I look forward to the publication of that report and I hope to ensure a debate in this House will follow.  I am sure the report will point out the malpractice and mismanagement in County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee. Rumour is rife about what may have taken place.  For example, appointments to non-teaching positions in some instances have been carried out without any public advertisement of the positions. I understand that some vacancies were filled without interview and I can point to a post which was filled in such a manner.  The previous occupation of the person appointed was manager of a slot machine arcade in Athlone.  The crucial aspect of his <i>curriculum vitae</i> was that he was chairman of the Fianna Fáil cumann in the area.</P>
    <P>Some officials and staff of this august body went on several trips abroad and enjoyed the globetrotting.  So frequent did the trips become that the committee, somewhat alarmed, decided that all such trips should be approved by them prior to departure.  When it emerged that two officials were travelling abroad without prior approval the whistle was blown on them by the local press.  This newspaper was subsequently boycotted by the vocational education committee and was excluded from receiving notice of forthcoming public meetings and from advertising by County Westmeath vocational education committee.  This was public knowledge in County Westmeath and one might ask why no one called halt.  I attempted to do so.  I approached the then Minister for Education. Deputy O'Rourke, in 1990 to discuss the irregularities in the vocational education committee.  I would be precluded from relaying her response but suffice to say she was not <Col N="653" /> interested in hearing about my reservations and tried to browbeat me into forgetting the whole affair.  I continued to ask questions in this House.  I now look forward to the publication of the Paircéir report and I will compare it with the answers I received to questions on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I am aware also &mdash; and this will disturb the Minister &mdash; of written correspondence which was sent to the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, outlining the irregularities that existed and offering further help in bringing these items to her attention. That letter was acknowledged but the Minister decided not to take any action. I wonder if this was because of the close contact which she had with the vocational education committee and the many favours which were delivered to her Fianna Fáil supporters during the period in question by the vocational education committee.  It should also be noted that in responding to further correspondence the subsequent Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, stated in writing that no such letter existed on the files of the Department of Education.  This begs the question of what happened to the original letter which had been sent by registered post and acknowledged by the then Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. Why is it not now on the file since it was acknowledged?  Was there a clean out to destroy any possible evidence which might be left behind?  What about accountability and transparency?  Is this yet another Fianna Fáil incident to be swept under the carpet?  Will the Labour Party, on hearing my allegations here today &mdash; allegations which I am confident will be substantiated by the Parcéir report &mdash; be prepared to enter into Government with a party which was prepared to act in this manner?  In particular, is it prepared to accept that person as a Minister for Finance, as suggested this morning in a radio programme, and as a person who should take on that portfolio, knowing what has gone before?  Deputy O'Rourke was not prepared to be accountable in her <Col N="654" /> Department for what happened within the education system despite the fact that it was brought to her attention by at least two people, both of whom I can vouch for.</P>
    <P>Least I appear to blacken every member of Westmeath vocational education committee I wish to put on the record that there are many honourable members of this vocational education committee, including some on the Fianna Fáil side, who consistently have had reservations about activities within Westmeath vocational education committee but, unfortunately, through lack of support from others and lack of accountability, their voices were not heard.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of a close political ally of the Minister Deputy O'Rourke who was appointed &mdash; and again I question whether interviews were held and if the positions was advertised &mdash; to a position funded by the European Petra programme, and the Minister will be interested in this.  Many questions have been raised about the effectiveness of this work and indeed we can only point to one major achievement in this programme, that is, we sent 63 people to France on a junket this year to open a vocational education committee centre. There is a gross waste of money and it cannot be countenanced under any circumstances. When the subject came up for discussion at Westmeath vocational education committee, one Fianna Fáil member is quoted as saying: &ldquo;Why all the fuss about it?  Sure, didn't this money come from Europe.  Why should it be questioned?&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>EU funding of the Petra project ceased in 1993, so how is it still running and how is it being funded? Perhaps this partly accounts for this vocational education committee's huge deficit.  Indeed, I read in a newspaper this morning that this vocational education committee's petty cash account <Col N="655" /> was £900,000, almost £1 million, overdrawn. Having served on many committees the Ceann Comhairle will be aware that the petty cash account is normally insignificant and if it is overdrawn by £1,000 questions will be asked.  Is it not frightening that a former Minister for Education, who was alerted to problems within the vocational education committee, failed to take action and allowed this system to continue?</P>

      <P>I have already indicated to the House the seriousness with which I view reported developments in Westmeath Vocational Education Committee. I have already contacted both the Chief Executive Officer and the members of the committee who, I understand, will meet later this week to answer the questions raised.  It is my desire to ensure that all of these matters are openly dealt with that an early resolution will be found and spending, when properly analysed and dealt with, will be put on a more secure footing for the future.  The House would not wish me, at this early stage in that investigation, to do any more than underline my determination to ensure everything is done that is appropriate in the circumstances and to ensure that we resolve the problem as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> As far as this amendment is concerned, it does not add significantly to how these matters will be dealt with and Deputy McGrath would know that.  It is not necessary to enshrine in this legislation powers which would enable a Minister for Education to take the appropriate action.  They are already in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy McGrath said here this afternoon is extremely serious.  The Minister has acknowledged that, but there are two aspects of what he said, on which if allowed some latitude by you, a Cheann Comhairle, perhaps he should comment.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath alleges that these matters were first brought to the attention of the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, as far back as 1990.  He alleges also that nothing was done about it then and that the correspondence dealing with it has somehow disappeared from the files of the Department.  I recall distinctly Deputy McGrath raising these matters several months ago here during Question Time and I am at a loss to understand why they have not been investigated since.  It would be helpful if we were given some information or report from the Minister as to what has happened since then because, if anything, it puts the Letterkenny problem in the shade.  It is extremely serious and I would like to hear more from the Minister on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree what we are talking about in Westmeath vocational education committee puts the Letterkenny problem in the shade.  I knew Deputy McGrath was pursuing this matter but I did not realise it dated as far back as 1990.  It is extraordinary that a Minister should not have responded, or acted immediately when informed of this situation. The Minister must take this on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also amazed that when Deputy McGrath continued to pursue this matter, the former Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, allowed a time <Col N="657" /> gap to develop.  I acknowledge the Parcéir inquiry was set up, but will its report be published and will we have the openness to which we are entitled so that we can see what exactly transpired and also find out the whereabouts of the missing letter?  It is extraordinary that the House would not be informed about such matters.  It may not be directly pertinent to the amendment the Deputy has put down but the questions he has raised are important and the Minister must be open in his response to them.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have been able to voice some of my reservations in this regard.  The details I have already given represent merely a small picking of what is actually involved.  There are other matters, including falsification of records and so on, which will emerge later.</P>
      <P>If accountability and openness in Government is to mean anything the Parcéir report must be published as soon as possible and be open for inspection. We should have a debate, if not in the House, in the Select Committee on Social Affairs where we could ask the necessary questions and decide what safeguards must be put in place to ensure such a situation does not arise again.  Will the Minister publish the report when it is available?</P>

      <P>I regret we did not have an opportunity to debate whether we should upgrade regional technical colleges to university status.  We could make a very good case for my proposal that they be called Irish technological universities constituent colleges.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party gave a written commitment in Waterford that, on going into Government in 1992, they would upgrade Waterford regional technical college to university status.  That was the commitment referred to in the following quotation: &ldquo;as Labour Party spokesman on education I am glad to recommend the acceptance of the Tramore resolution at the Annual Conference.&rdquo;  The document was signed by Brian O'Shea. The former Minister for Education who brought this legislation forward did not bother to live up to that commitment. The Minister should review the position if he holds that portfolio for any length of time.</P>

      <P>Under this legislation the Minister is required to appoint a commission or a commissioner to the Letterkenny regional technical college. Given the way the formation of the Government is being negotiated that responsibility will fall to the caretaker Minister present.  I would like him to assure us that the person or persons appointed will be independent.  I do not want any question of political affiliation or other consideration to be taken into account when making the appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>

      <P>I thank Deputies for <Col N="659" /> their help and consideration in having both Bills passed in a short time.  The concept of regional technological universities is a new one and is not appropriate to this legislation.</P>
      <P>Regarding Waterford Regional Technical College there is an accreditation process which any college must go through but, again, it is not relevant to this legislation.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that my interest is to restore Letterkenny Regional Technical College to the position where it has the total support of the community in Donegal and surrounding counties. When established, the commission must have positive support in the college to carry out its difficult task.  Those appointed will have the confidence, integrity and independence to achieve the goal of all of us here &mdash; to have a college of which everyone can be proud.</P>

      <P>In my statement to the Dáil on Tuesday, 15 November 1994 I undertook to furnish a full and detailed report on the handling of the Brendan Smyth case in the office of the Attorney General.  I also stated that I did not find the explanations provided to me at that time satisfactory or adequate.</P>
      <P>When the new Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, SC, was appointed the Minister for Justice, on my behalf, instructed him to conduct a full and detailed investigation of the file in the Smyth case and to report back.  That investigation has been thorough and ongoing.  His full report was brought to a specially convened Government meeting this morning, and there was a preliminary discussion on it.  The report will be placed in the Library of the House tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> At its meeting this morning the Government also considered an update it had received on the progress of the work of the review group on the Attorney General's office.  Deputies will recall that I informed the House on 15 November last that in view of the seriousness of the issues which arose in connection with this case I had decided there should be a thorough and immediate review of the operations of the Office of the Attorney General.  This review is being carried out by a high level group chaired by the Secretary, Public Service Management and Development in the Department of Finance and comprising the Secretary to the Government and the Secretary of the Department of Justice.  The terms of reference of the group are to review and make recommendations on the relevant organisational structure, systems, procedure and staffing arrangements in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>At the Government's request, the review group provided the Government with an update on the progress of its review since its establishment on 15 November.  The Government has considered this update and has taken certain decisions on it.</P>
    <P>It is clear to the review group that there are serious shortcomings in a number of areas in the administration of the office &mdash; in the organisational structure and in operating and support systems. The Government is gravely disturbed by these interim findings and has concluded that as a first step an immediate input of appropriate senior level management expertise to the office is essential.  The group has advised that its final report, due within two weeks, will include a recommendation for the appointment of a person who would fill that management role.  In the light of this report and pending the appointment of such a person the Government has decided that immediate management expertise must be brought into the Attorney General's office to assist the Attorney General in running the office.</P>
    <P>To this end it has been decided that a senior official will be seconded to the <Col N="662" /> office to oversee the introduction of modern management systems and procedures and to commence the initial phase of implementation of the other recommendations which will be available to the Government within two weeks.  The official seconded will be Mr. Caomhin Ó hUiginn, BL, a senior Assistant Secretary, Department of Justice, who will report directly to the Attorney General.  He will be supported by appropriate administrative staff to be provided on loan to the Attorney General's office.  The powers and reporting relationships of Mr. Ó hUiginn will be as follows: (1) He will oversee the introduction of modern management systems, including a programme for the development of efficient and effective systems and procedures.  (2) In particular, and subject to 3 below, he will seek to identify and take action on those matters within the office now requiring immediate attention and (3) in carrying out these tasks he will work under the general direction of the Attorney General to whom he will report directly.  The management post, which will be recommended in the final report of the review group, will be filled by open competition through the Top Level Appointments Committee system.  As I said, the final report of the review group will be available within two weeks.  I envisage that the Attorney General's report and the review group's report would be the subject of a full debate in the House.  I expect that the incoming Government will provide adequate time for this debate as soon as the review group's report becomes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the first time in the history of the Dáil that we find ourselves in this situation &mdash; seeking another adjournment of the Dáil, not having a Government and not having a general election either.  On the occasion of recent general elections, we had a three week run-in during the campaign and then we settled down to sort out what combination of parties would agree to make up a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> Recent experience indicates that it can take up to six weeks for that process to take place.</P>
    <P>There are good reasons to believe that on this occasion we will be able to conclude our discussions and form a Partnership Government within a three week span.  If we can continue our wide-ranging discussions in the same business-like way we have already done, and in which all parties have participated, then I would be reasonably sanguine that we could conclude our deliberations over the week-end.  The House will be aware that the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, and I have exchanged position papers which set out our respective views on the basis for a new Partnership Government.  I received the Labour Party document yesterday and I have included my responses in the Fianna Fáil paper.  I expect that Deputy Spring and I will shortly meet again, when he has had time to read and reflect on its content. I know the public would wish to see an agreed Government back in action without wasting a single day and, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, I assure the House that we will do our utmost to expedite that process.</P>
    <P>Upon my election as Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, I requested my colleagues to take soundings among their constituents and within the ranks of the ordinary members of the party.  They reported their findings to me in the middle of last week at the meeting of the parliamentary party and at the National Executive.  Even before we became aware that we might possibly be part of a new Partnership Government we had begun to work on a draft discussion document which outlined our concerns about recent dramatic events in this House.</P>
    <P>We are of one mind in Fianna Fáil that the examination of the operations of the Attorney General's office, initiated by the Taoiseach, and which has been undertaken by the Secretary to the Government, Mr. Frank Murray, the Secretary for the Public Service in the <Col N="664" /> Department of Finance, Mr. John Hurley, and Mr. Tim Dalton, Secretary, Department of Justice, will be concluded as soon as possible and that any recommendations they make with regard to the office will be implemented without undue delay on our part if we are in Government.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at length inside and outside this House on the issue of accountability, openness and accessibility to information by the public.  I have proposed that we review the operations and implications of the Government and Secretaries Act, 1924, as well as the ramifications of Cabinet procedures and ministerial responsibility. The entire area where the needs of the public and the policies of bureaucrats interface is one of great concern to the public and while we can be proud of the vitality and robustness of all our democratic institutions we must in these times, and for this generation, question the relevance of the operational structures of those institutions and the difficulties the public has in their direct dealings with them.</P>
    <P>Major changes must be made in those systems and I am determined that the public will get the service it deserves and wants.  That is just one area we are considering in detail in our proposals.</P>
    <P>As I already explained, there have been initial discussions between ourselves and the Labour Party in which we are endeavouring to tease out the matters and concerns that we have in common.</P>
    <P>There are major decisions to be made in the very near future with regard to the framework document and the consolidation of the peace in Northern Ireland.  Final preparations must be made for the European Council meeting in Essen which will concentrate on growth, competitiveness and employment, which are so vital to this country. Major budgetary strategies have to be put in train and key Government decisions must be taken on a whole range of issues.  The management of the country's affairs must be given the precedence they demand as soon as formal <Col N="665" /> agreements are reached, and I know the House will agree that there is no time to spare.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words about the peace process and the work of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, work so ably begun and developed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and the former Tánaiste, Deputy Spring. One encouraging feature of our recent political uphevals has been the commitment shown by all parties in this House to the continuation of the Northern Ireland peace process.  Whatever differences there may be between us, I am certain that we all appreciate the enormous value of what has been achieved in recent months in bringing an end to paramilitary violence.  I sense a growing appreciation of the potential that a peaceful Ireland holds for all who live on this island.  The work of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation has a vital part to play in ensuring that this potential is realised.  It is particularly encouraging that the work of the forum has gone ahead without interruption in the last three weeks, with very high levels of participation by the delegations of all the parties.</P>
    <P>The forum's strength is that it brings together an unprecedented range of Irish political opinion from North and South.  All ten parties who participate in the forum are committed to working together to resolve problems, by exclusively democratic and political means. This is a welcome advance on the reign of violence that prevailed for so long in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The aim of the forum is to examine ways in which lasting peace and reconciliation can be established by agreement among all the people of Ireland. Having attended all four meetings of the forum, I believe that it has made an encouraging beginning, which augurs well for the progress of its work in the months ahead.  Although it is early days yet, the forum has agreed a wide-ranging work programme up to the end of February, which will enable it to get to grips with all the key issues.  The parties are currently presenting their ideas on <Col N="666" /> the nature of the problem underlying the conflict, and the principles for its resolution.  Fianna Fáil has already presented its paper and participated in a useful exchange of views with other parties.</P>
    <P>In mid-December, the forum will hold major hearings on the economic consequences of peace.  As Minister for Finance, I have been acutely aware of how much potential there is for developing the economy of this island, especially as economic recovery gathers pace within the European Union, and I am glad to see the forum focusing on this as one of its early priorities.</P>
    <P>As leader of Fianna Fáil, I hope that the spirit of realism and co-operation displayed during the early stages of the forum's work, will lead to substantial progress in removing barriers to lasting peace and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Recent opinion polls show quite clearly that furthering the peace process and the maintenance of a sound and growing economy are major preoccupations with the general public.  There is a natural logic in these priorities.  If we have managed to achieve notable growth here, against a background of violence in the North, surely we can expect to greatly enhance prosperity, North and South, in a time of peace.</P>
    <P>Economic prospects have seldom looked brighter.  The international economy is picking up apace.  The world is becoming freer and more accessible for Irish business &mdash; not least through the integration and enlargement of the European Union.  Policies based on social partnership are securing our competitiveness. Budgetary policies are building confidence in Ireland.  Domestic investment, assisted by Community resources, is helping to enhance our infrastructure, to upgrade the skills and productivity of our workers and to break the cycle of decline in areas most affected by long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the recent performance of our economy puts us close to the top of the league in terms of high growth and low inflation. <Col N="667" /> While most other industrialised countries experienced losses in output and employment in the recent recession, this economy continued to grow &mdash; albeit at a slower pace &mdash; and private sector employment outside agriculture continued to expand.</P>
    <P>Recent indicators show that domestic demand is growing strongly.  Already this year, retail sales volumes over the first nine months have grown by over 6 per cent year-on-year.  New car sales have been particularly buoyant: registrations look to be up by about 26 per cent to end-October.  For the year as whole, the volume of total consumer spending should rise by 4.5 per cent.  An improvement in business confidence, combined with relatively low interest rates and increased public capital spending, is leading to a marked recovery in investment.  Manufacturing output over the period to end-July is 10 per cent above last year's levels, pointing to continued, substantial expansion of exports.</P>
    <P>Overall, GNP growth should be well above 5 per cent this year.  At the same time inflation remains moderate, with consumer prices likely to be just 2.5 per cent higher this year than in 1993.</P>
    <P>The more balanced composition of growth is leading to accelerated employment gains.  The latest labour force survery figures show a net increase of 30,000 jobs in the year to April last.  Thankfully, a clear pattern of decline in registered unemployment has accompanied this strong performance on jobs.  For the year as a whole unemployment is likely to be 10,000 or more below last year's level.  Despite this progress, unemployment remains our most serious economic and social problem.  It, therefore, remains at the very top of this Government's agenda and we should take heart from recent progress and tentative figures. Our recent success demonstrates that, as world conditions improve, current policies will increasingly cut into, and further reduce, unemployment.</P>
    <P>The overall fiscal position is satisfactory. The EBR has been well under 3 per cent of GNP each year since 1988. <Col N="668" /> The substantial improvement in this respect which we secured in the second half of the 80s is being maintained.  The General Government Deficit &mdash; established in the Maastricht Treaty as a primary measurement of budgetary performance &mdash; has not exceeded 2.3 per cent of GDP in the same period.  Our debt burden is also falling significantly. The General Government Debt/GDP ratio was brought down from 116 per cent in 1987 to 96 per cent last year, despite the effect of the IR£ devaluation. Overall, our performance has secured the positive recognition of our fellow EU member states.  Deputies will be aware of the EU judgement that only ourselves and Luxembourg currently meet the criteria for participation in the final stage of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to low annual deficits.  I expect the Exchequer outturn to be below the budget target again this year, reflecting the importance I place on keeping the public finances under tight control.  This is a crucial aspect of our ongoing solid economic performance. It is a key determinant of overseas confidence in Ireland.  It is also a significant factor of Irish interest rates &mdash; which, as we all know to our benefit, are now more closely aligned with international rates than in the past.</P>
    <P>Substantial economic growth has enabled the reduction of annual borrowing and our debt burden and major improvement in public services, without resort to a higher tax burden.  More important, excluding the tax amnesty proceeds, taxes on personal incomes as a share of GNP will be a good deal lower this year than when we had an EBR of almost 10 per cent.  However, because our national debt is still very high, debt service costs pre-empt a big proportion of national resources.  I want to free up those resources, to enable further easing of taxes.  To do that, we have to keep the annual deficit low.  As recent progress demonstrates, this helps economic growth and is, therefore, a key avenue to rising employment, <Col N="669" /> improving services and living standards and reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>We have quite rightly become accustomed to looking at our economic and social progress in a broader European context.  Indeed many of our problems are shared to a greater or lesser extent by our partners in the European Union. It is appropriate that these problems are now being addressed collectively by our partners at European Union level and by my colleagues in the ECOFIN Council. Unemployment is one such problem.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance, I made it a priority to keep employment at the top of the ECOFIN and the European Social Affairs agenda.  As part of the follow-up to the White Paper on growth competitiveness and employment, ECOFIN Ministers at recent meetings have held a wide ranging debate on the employment situation.  Following the Council's exchange of views on this issue, the Presidency has prepared, for the next meeting on 5 December, draft conclusions of the ECOFIN Council for the European Council in Essen on 9-10 December.  Finance Ministers will attend the Essen Summit to participate in the European Council's deliberations on this crucial topic.</P>
    <P>Growth prospects in Europe will be 3 per cent next year.  This upturn on its own will not solve the unemployment problem, and the Council must emphasis the need for action to tackle structural problems in the labour market of member states.  This message should form a central part of the conclusions to be presented by ECOFIN to the Essen Council on 9-10 December.</P>
    <P>On Monday next the ECOFIN Council will return to the subject of employment in preparation for the European Council which takes place the following weekend.  The ECOFIN will have before it a number of other important issues: adjustment of the budgetary framework in the context of enlargement of the European Union, and for provision of additional funds in connection with the Northern Ireland peace process &mdash; which will also be considered by the Essen Summit: progress reports <Col N="670" /> on a number of taxation issues which have been reflected on during the past 12 months; proposals for financial aid to a number of third countries and a report on financing of Trans-European Networks (TENS).</P>
    <P>In January 1995, Austria, Finland and Sweden will join the European Union. It is clear that the Union will be strengthened by the addition of the three new members.  Now we must begin to look at the next stage which will focus on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic States.</P>
    <P>At the ECOFIN in November and at the General Affairs Council of Foreign Ministers there was an exchange of views on certain financial aspects of relations with Associated Central and Eastern European countries in preparation for the Essen European Council. Following the Council, Finance Ministers from these countries and the Baltic States met their EU counterparts for discussions on how co-operation can grow.  It is clear that the issues concerning further enlargement of the Union will feature prominently on the EU agenda in coming years.</P>
    <P>I have set out today, for the benefit of the House, the matters of concern to me, and my party, and I am sure to every party in the House, and the public generally.  I hope that formal discussions can now proceed and that with goodwill all round we will soon have a Government to deal with those issues at the various Council meetings next week and with the agenda that lies ahead.</P>

      <P>It was simply an updated edition of a single transferable speech he delivered in this House in every debate in which he participated in the past two years.  It had no relevance whatever to the events that concern us now.  That he believed he could get away with such a soporific address on an occasion of national importance is an indication of the way he takes this House and its proceedings for granted.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party is determined to take part in Government.  We recognise the needs of potential partners in Government as well as advancing our policies and priorities as a party.  It was in that spirit I engaged in discussions with the Leader of the Labour Party in the past week.  Following the list of our meetings I published Fine Gael's proposals for a new Government in a wide ranging document setting out Fine Gael policies across a broad spectrum of issues.  This statement of Fine Gael policy &mdash; unlike the Tánaiste's address &mdash; makes detailed proposals to deal with the two issues that caused the present crisis &mdash; the lack of accountability and the breakdown of partnership in Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The first of those central issues is accountability.  Fine Gael has proposed that Dáil committees be given extended power to compel witnesses to attend and the Attorney General should account regularly to a Dáil committee. The huge cost of the beef tribunal could have been avoided if proper answers had been given to parliamentary questions in this House.  Fine Gael has proposed that the Ceann Comhairle be given a new power to require Ministers to disclose further information when their replies to this House are independently determined by him on appeal to be inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second central issue in this political crisis is the collapse of partnership in government.  Our system of Cabinet Government is designed for one party government and not for coalition.  Fine Gael has proposed a formal redefinition <Col N="672" /> of Cabinet procedures to take into account that coalitions are now the norm and not the exception.  In this context the respective roles of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the leader of any other party in a coalition should be defined in a way that will recognise the reality of coalition, the reality of partnership and the increasing rarity of single party Government.</P>
    <P>Those two issues &mdash; accountability and partnership &mdash; formed a major part of my discussions with the Leader of the Labour Party.  They remain at the heart of the current political crisis and questions about the conduct of Ministers &mdash; still in office &mdash; have yet to be answered. They were not answered in this debate by the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste and unless and until those questions are answered, suspicion will hang over a Government that includes any of those Fianna Fáil Ministers.  I will identify eight key questions that those Fianna Fáil Ministers must answer.</P>
    <P>First, which Ministers prepared and approved the speaking note for the Taoiseach for supplementary questions in the Dáil on Tuesday, 15 November, which was totally misleading because it ignored the Duggan case?  If there is to be accountability, the persons involved must be named.  Second, what Minister or person included the handwritten note urging the Taoiseach to repeat the same misleading information no matter how many supplementary questions he was asked?  The person who wrote that note must be identified because he or she deliberately advised the concealment of relevant information from this House and is not fit to be a Minister.  Third, how could the Ministers not have known that this speaking note was fundamentally misleading in view of the categoric statement in the letter of 15 November from the Attorney General, Eoghan Fitzsimons, which was in their possession?</P>
    <P>Fourth, in view of the fact that the Fianna Fáil Ministers knew about the Duggan case since Monday, 14 November, how can they explain that they allowed the Taoiseach to say on Tuesday that &ldquo;the emergence of the Smyth case did not affect the integrity of the Attorney General or his suitability for <Col N="673" /> high Judicial office&rdquo; and on Wednesday that, in light of information they had since Monday, the Attorney General would have had &ldquo;no option but to resign&rdquo; if he was still in office?  That question has not been answered.</P>
    <P>Fifth, if the Fianna Fáil Ministers were so satisfied on the previous Friday that Mr. Whelehan's explanations were sufficient to appoint him as President of the High Court, why did they on the following Sunday night &mdash; before they received the information on the Duggan case &mdash; order a thorough and immediate review of the operation of the office he had been running?  Sixth, why was the Dáil not told on the Tuesday that the new Attorney General had supplied, within 36 hours of taking office, his opinion on the legal issues involved in the Smyth case while the same issue was determined by the previous Attorney General, who they appointed as President of the High Court, to be so complex as to justify a seven month delay in producing his opinion.  Why did that delay occur?  That question has not been answered.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it would be proper for any Government to be put together involving the Ministers who appointed Mr. Harry Whelehan as President of the High Court until that question has been answered.  The acting Taoiseach's contribution today was an attempt to answer a different question, which is not the one at the heart of this issue.  Maladministration in the Attorney General's office is not the issue.  It is the conduct of Ministers and the integrity of Ministers' appointees that is at the heart of this political crisis.  This is a political crisis, not an administrative one.  Every time there is a political crisis in this House this Government seeks to blame administrators and turn it into an administrative crisis.  This is a political crisis touching on the integrity and veracity of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The question the Labour Party must decide is whether those Ministers are fit for office.  The standards that are applied must be applied universally. One cannot apply one standard to Deputy Albert Reynolds and contend <Col N="674" /> that standard does not apply to Deputy Bertie Ahern because they were equally involved and, if standards or principles are universal, they should be applied universally.  I remember hearing the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, say that the stand of the Labour Party was one of principle.  My understanding of the word &ldquo;principle&rdquo; is something of general application, not something that applies to one person, namely, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  The principle that concealment of information from the House and their Labour Party colleagues in Government is wrong is a principle that applies to all of those who were involved in the concealment and not to one person only.</P>
    <P>Seventh, if, as the Taoiseach claimed on Wednesday.  Mr. Harry Whelehan would have to resign as Attorney General because he had inadvertently misled Ministers on the Fr. Brendan Smyth case &mdash; it should be remembered that the reason it was claimed that Mr. Whelehan would have to resign was because he had misled Ministers inadvertently &mdash; why do Fianna Fáil Ministers not apply the same principle to themselves and resign because they were involved in concealing information from this House?  Why do not they also resign?  Is it a case that they apply higher standards to their servants than they do to themselves?  Is it a case that Attorneys General and Presidents of the High Court can be forced to resign but that Ministers do not have to resign for the same errors?  What concept of accountability is involved in that?  What concept of accountability will apply if the people who apply such high standards to their underlings and such low standards to themselves are rewarded by promotion to even higher office by the votes of people who resigned on principle in the first instance?</P>
    <P>Eighth, what information was hidden by Fianna Fáil Ministers on that Wednesday morning from the Labour Party when the Labour Party agreed to go back into Government notwithstanding the delay in the Fr. Brendan Smyth case, notwithstanding the lack of accountability <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Tribunal of <Col N="675" /> Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, notwithstanding the lack of answers in regard to passports for sale, notwithstanding the tax amnesty; what was the information concealed before that decision was taken?</P>
    <P>These are critical questions the acting Taoiseach and his Fianna Fáil Ministers have to answer in a satisfactory manner and, until they do so, Fianna Fáil rhetoric about openness and accountability will be nothing but hollow and meaningless cant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we last met in this House I have had the opportunity of having had a number of meetings with the Leaders of the parties in the House. These meetings have been well documented in the media.  It is also appropriate to say that all of these meetings were conducted in a good atmosphere.  I thank the Leaders of each of the parties for the courtesy shown to me in the course of those meetings.</P>
      <P>Following my meetings, and as much consultation as it was possible to undertake in the time available, I decided that the exigencies of the present position demanded that, in the first instance, I should put concrete views on the formation of Government to the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The document I submitted consisted of 36 points, about half of which deal with issues of accountability and transparency and constitute the details of a strategy for renewal.  The remainder deal with outstanding issues in the Programme for Government, especially in respect of areas in which opportunities exist to accelerate progress and others in which some anomalies have arisen.  I received a formal response to that document earlier this afternoon.  As yet I have not had an opportunity to consider it in detail.  As a consequence I have advised the Tánaiste, Deputy Bertie Ahern, that I will take as much time as is necessary to consider his response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I understand that the acting Government has taken a range of decisions in relation to next year's Estimates. I will be seeking clarification from the Tánaiste as to the meaning and <Col N="676" /> extent of those decisions before I can open formal negotiations.  Naturally, I have conveyed the view that my party will not be bound in any way by decisions in which we have not been involved.  Furthermore, such decisions obviously alter the basis on which one would be expecting to negotiate a wide variety of issues.  We are as committed as any other party in this House to the prudent management of our economy but this must be done in ways which respect the rights and needs of all our people.</P>
    <P>At this stage I do not intend to comment in regard to matters in the Attorney General's office but I am sure I will do so when the completed report is made available, I understand tomorrow. Having regard to this background I believe it is sensible to adjourn this House until Tuesday of next week. While, for my part, I will make every effort to avoid further delay, it is my view that any agreement will involve a lot of hard work on the part of many people and that the search for agreement will not be facilitated by preemptive or unilateral decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss. Harney Miss. Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss. Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I find today's debate very disturbing and rather disillusioning. After the events of the past two weeks, at least while we are endeavouring to put a Government together, I would have thought that some people would have learned lessons.  It is unfortunate that today the majority of Members of this House voted down the opportunity of having an appropriate debate on the adjournment this evening.  That is regrettable because the issue that brought about the fall of the outgoing Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition Government was that of accountability, the failure of certain people to tell the truth to this House.  It was because of deception, because of untruths, because of a deliberate effort on the part of the then Taoiseach and his Fianna Fáil Ministers to cover up one of the greatest scandals in Irish parliamentary history that the Labour Party withdrew from Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought, within the period in which we are endeavouring to show that we have learned from those <Col N="677" /> mistakes, that we were indeed going to turn over a new leaf, that the Government Chief Whip would not merely have proposed today that party leaders would have five minutes to debate the issues and that nobody else would be given an opportunity to speak.  In so far as the time for leaders of the parties was extended to 15 minutes I welcome it but it is inadequate.  It is a pity that other Members will not be afforded an opportunity to put forward their points of view.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the remarks of the acting Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, I am further confirmed in the view I formed earlier, which was that we will never learn.  The Taoiseach said the Attorney General has prepared a report, that the Government met this morning and considered it.  He did not tell us what is contained in that report and we are told that it will be placed in the Oireachtas Library tomorrow.  Why could we not hear about its contents today?  Could the Taoiseach give us no idea today what that report contains?</P>
    <P>An even more depressing feature of the acting Taoiseach's contribution today was the fact that he continued to blame the system, blame the public servants, to blame a failure in the system, saying that a civil servant from the Department of Justice will be put in to oversee a new management structure. Have we learned nothing?  The one thing we must learn from the Fr. Brendan Smyth case is that it was not a failure of the system.  As the Taoiseach knows perfectly well, the system worked very well in the Duggan case.</P>
    <P>The new Leader of Fianna Fáil promises openness, accessibility and accountability, yet there is no evidence of such in what occurred in this House today or in his contribution.  He too was aware of the Attorney General's report today. He did not avail of the opportunity to tell us anything about it, to show any sign of openness, any sign that there will be accountability.  Without being smart, I have to say that to go on to talk about car sales, the level of manufacturing output, what will happen at the ECOFIN Council, important and all as are these <Col N="678" /> matters, they are in the ha'penny place when it comes to trust in Government and confidence in the people put in charge of running this country.  That is the issue that caused the political turbulence and unless we resolve it we will simply have reconfirmed people's view that they are right to be cynical about politicians because they merely play games.  This afternoon, and on the day the debate on the beef tribunal report began, when the Opposition sought to put questions to the Taoiseach, a majority in this House did not believe it was important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember saying it was depressing after all the hype and expense of that report.  Quite honestly, we have learnt no lessons.  There is no point in having accountability on paper if it is not acted upon.  I said in the last two weeks that the day this House elects the Government is the day it loses its clout.  I have to change those words &mdash; even before we elect a new Government, we seem to have lost our collective clout to have accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be an effort by some people to seek to erase from people's minds something they saw with their own eyes.  The public looked at the proceedings here two weeks ago and made up their minds.  If they had seen the proceedings in regard to other events they also would have made up their minds. That was the single biggest factor that caused such concern among the public, they made up their minds and did not rely on anybody else to form opinions for them.  There is an attempt by Fianna Fáil Ministers to obliterate the truth. We heard them say &ldquo;we have given enough&rdquo;.  As far as I am concerned, we have not got the truth.  We do not know why the file on the Fr. Smyth extradition case was hanging around the Attorney General's office for seven months, it could have been seven years: it was only seven months because he went back voluntarily to the North and we must remember that.  We do not <Col N="679" /> know the role of the Fianna Fáil Ministers. I asked questions last week about that and I want to ask them again, because they are very serious questions. If we are to have openness and accountability, if we are to change the way we do things, if we are to change the Official Secrets Act, everything else must change.  Why do the Fianna Fáil Ministers not tell us the truth?  Why, for example, on the day he was elected, did the leader of Fianna Fáil say, when asked about the Duggan case &mdash; we all heard it on the radio &mdash;&ldquo;we all played our part in making sure it was not in the Taoiseach's speech&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>With the exception of Deputy Andrews, all the Fianna Fáil Ministers were briefed by the new Attorney General on Monday, 14 November. He told them about the Duggan case.  I will now draw certain obvious conclusions from his letter and the memo prepared for answer in the Dáil. When the two are put together a series of disturbing facts come to light.  Without breaking the confidentiality of my meeting with the Labour leader, which was helpful and positive and conducted in a friendly atmosphere, I raised this issue because it is so important and serious.  In a letter to the Taoiseach dated 15 November the Attorney General said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked by the Minister for Justice to prepare a reply to the following question: &ldquo;Was this the first time that the section was applied?&rdquo;  I <Col N="680" /> have done this and it is enclosed herewith. The reply is the best I can do.  It does not, in fact, answer the question.</P>
    <P>Why did the Attorney General feel it necessary to say this was the best he could do and it did not answer the question? What was he asked to do?  Was he asked to draft a confusing answer?  He went on to say: &ldquo;In my view no serious issue of delay could possibly have been raised under the section in respect of these offences&rdquo;.  Yet the parliamentary reply says: &ldquo;The possibility existed of a case being made in respect of these offences on the basis of the section&rdquo;. The Attorney General says there could not be a case but the reply says the possibility was that there was a case. The Attorney General enclosed the reply with his letter.  A deliberate lie is told in that reply that was to be read in this House.  Why?  Last week I asked in whose handwriting was the note which read &ldquo;If pursued on this question, keep repeating exactly the above&rdquo; which was &ldquo;This is the first case giving rise to delays of this magnitude.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a time of openness, transparency and accountability, I would have expected in the eight days since I first raised this question &mdash; others have raised it too &mdash; we would have been told which Fianna Fáil Minister's handwriting this is.  Somebody who was very well aware of the facts wrote at the side &ldquo;It is section 50(bbb)&rdquo;.  The people who wrote these things knew exactly what was involved.  They were afraid the Taoiseach would deviate from this reply, let the cat out of the bag, and tell us about the Duggan case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Attorney General feel it necessary to say in his letter: &ldquo;In my view it would be absolutely incorrect to inform the Dáil that this was the first time the section was considered&rdquo;?  Were some people suggesting they should misinform the Dáil? If the Fianna Fáil Ministers, including <Col N="681" /> the Taoiseach, were told about the Duggan case on the Monday, why was there no reference to it in the Taoiseach's speech on Tuesday?  The Minister for Justice told us there was no sensible basis for deliberately seeking to conceal this information.  I suggest there was. When that information became available it would be clear that the appointment of Harry Whelehan was no longer tenable.  That is why the information was concealed from the Dáil.  The information was also concealed from Labour Party colleagues who were still members of the Government until the early hours of Wednesday morning when I understand they were told, as if it had happened that morning, that new information had come to light. However, we know that before the Taoiseach spoke on Tuesday he was already aware of the Duggan case but we were not told about it.  Why did the Taoiseach not tell us on Tuesday &mdash; Deputy Bruton raised this issue already &mdash; that, within 36 hours of going to that office, the new Attorney General was able to consider all the legal issues involved in this case and give a written report?  The Taoiseach continued to put up the defence that they were complex issues which was one of the reasons for the delay, although he did not try to justify it.  If the new Attorney General could give his opinion in 36 hours, was it not obvious that a delay of seven months was unreasonable?</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach was correct when he told the Dáil on 16 November that the former Attorney General would have to resign as Attorney General because he misled the Government, why should those Ministers who collectively were a party to misleading the Dáil not also resign? Why did the Minister for Justice offer her resignation?  Let me deviate for a moment.  At 4 o'clock that afternoon I asked the Taoiseach if anyone had offered their resignation and I was told no.  That was a lie because, apparently <Col N="682" /> the Minister for Justice had offered her resignation.</P>

      <P>The letter from the Attorney General accompanied the draft parliamentary reply.  There is reference to inquiries and so on.  Under the doctrine of legal privilege, because legal advice is privileged, we will not have an opportunity to question the Attorney General so I do not think we should fall for the offer of a Dáil committee to handle this.  Nor, because of Cabinet confidentiality, will we be able to get the truth from Ministers.  The issue that confronts the Dáil is whether we want to <Col N="683" /> put people into office who can be trusted.  I heard some spokespeople from the Labour Party say that unless their leader is leader of the Government, unless he is Taoiseach, there will be no question of them joining in a Fine Gael majority Coalition Government.  It seems ironic that the Leader of the Labour Party is prepared to be deputy leader of a Government of people who deceived the Dáil and his party and he wants to lead a Government of people who did not deceive his party.  I find that strange.  There are difficult choices. There is obviously an easy choice in terms of stability and numbers for the Labour Party, that is, to go back with a majority-led Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

If we settle for things on paper or promises of committees or reports, I believe we will deceive the people we purport to represent.  There is no point playing a blinder one week if we turn a blind eye a few weeks later. The public will not buy that and it will not be acceptable.  It is time to put trust back into politics and to put people in office who will tell the whole truth, not seek to conceal or mislead.</P>

We will complete considering it after this debate and that is why it will be placed in the Library tomorrow morning.

      <P>Regarding the reference by the Taoiseach in his opening remarks that the investigation has been thorough and ongoing and that the full report was brought to the Government meeting this morning, can it be taken that the report the Taoiseach received is the final one of the Attorney General in this matter, that the investigation is not ongoing and that the full report presented to the Taoiseach will be published?</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's answer and I hope when I finish that he will offer answers to questions I will put to him during my contribution.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Labour Party to open discussions with Fianna Fáil, without first having had substantial negotiations with other parties on a possible alternative Government, is a serious error of judgment and a decision which I believe, both the Irish people and the Labour Party will eventually regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time in the history of the State there is a real possibility of putting together a Government in which the Left would constitute almost 50 per cent and in which it would have an unprecedented influence.  Everything is on the table.  Labour has a strong claim on the <Col N="686" /> most senior positions in Cabinet, including the Finance portfolio and the case Labour has been making for the election of Deputy Spring as Taoiseach would have to be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>Instead of seizing this unique opportunity, Deputy Spring has apparently decided to defy the lessons of our history and return to the embrace of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Spring is a seasoned politician, whose achievements are justifiably admired, but I doubt if even he can breathe life back into the corpse of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.  Even if he did, any Government which included those Fianna Fáil Ministers who were at the heart of events in this House two weeks ago would be an Administration without an ounce of political credibility.</P>
    <P>Whatever Government is eventually elected will face major economic and social problems.  We have been told time and time again that the outgoing Government was a good one, that the Programme for Government was sound and would need little or no amendment. I do not believe that the outgoing Government was a good one nor is there any evidence that the people thought it a good one.</P>
    <P>There have been four by-elections in the lifetime of this Government and the Government parties have lost each one. Democratic Left won two of the by-elections, an unprecedented achievement. In three of the four constituencies Labour topped the poll in the 1989 general election and in each of those constituencies Labour saw its vote virtually wiped out in the by-elections.  Clearly the electorate were attaching principal blame to the Labour Party for the failures of the last Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy said this morning on radio that the main job was to restore trust between the two parties, but the problems and the failures of this Government pre-date the Whelehan-Smyth affair.  The Whelehan-Smyth affair was not a factor in the collapse of support for the Government parties in the Cork, Dublin or Mayo by-elections. It was the failure of the Government adequately to meet the day-to-day needs of the people which incurred the <Col N="687" /> wrath of the electorate in all four by-elections.</P>
    <P>How can anyone seriously suggest that the Programme for Government does not need significant renegotiation when the Government on which it was based made so little progress on unemployment, our biggest social and economic problem?  Have we really reached such a situation where an unemployment rate of 15 per cent among the highest in Europe, is to be regarded as satisfactory?</P>
    <P>A national crusade to tackle unemployment, mobilising all the institutions of the State and the economy, an all out assault on poverty and the causes of economic alienation, are, and will remain, a fundamental precondition for participation by Democratic Left in any Government.  The decision of the Fianna Fáil Ministers to approve Estimates yesterday which will provide for an effective 2 per cent cut in public spending does not indicate any appreciation of or willingness to tackle the problems of poverty and unemployment. The inevitable outcome of these Estimates will be further cutbacks in essential services.</P>
    <P>Any Government which fails to act on the concerns of the public which were evident during the four by-elections will have no future.  Irrespective of who is in office issues like the inadequacy of social welfare payments, the taxation of disability and unemployment benefits, the payment of social welfare arrears to married women, and the abolition of service charges will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I return to the immediate matters which led to the resignation of Deputy Reynolds as Taoiseach two weeks ago, namely the circumstances of the withholding of certain information from the Dáil when the Taoiseach replied to questions on 15 November.</P>
    <P>Last week I drew the attention of the House to the reproduction in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 20 November of the text of a reply to a possible supplementary question which Ministers had in their possession as Deputy Reynolds answered questions on Tuesday, 15 <Col N="688" /> November.  The text was prepared for the Taoiseach to use had he been asked the question, &ldquo;Was this the first time that the section had been applied?&rdquo;, that is, section 50 of the 1987 Extradition Act relating to the lapse of time.</P>
    <P>I have now had an opportunity to consider that draft reply in more detail, especially in the context of the letter from the new Attorney General which the Taoiseach read into the record of the Dáil on Wednesday, 16 November. Having done so, I am more convinced than ever that the withholding of information regarding the Duggan case was not due to forgetfulness or a failure to appreciate its importance, but was part of a deliberate plan involving a number of people to seriously mislead the Dáil on a matter of crucial importance.</P>
    <P>It is now acknowledged that the Fianna Fáil Ministers were told by the new Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, of the Duggan case at a meeting on Monday, 14 November. Different explanations have been put forward as to why this information was not given to the Dáil when the Taoiseach spoke on the following day. Deputy Reynolds pleaded that he had not been provided with speaking material on the matter.  Other Ministers claimed that they had not appreciated the significance of it, or that they had simply forgotten about it.  None of these so-called &ldquo;explanations&rdquo; is consistent with the available evidence.</P>
    <P>When he spoke here on Wednesday, 16 November the Taoiseach said as reported at column 320 of the Official Report in regard to the receipt of the letter from Mr. Fitzsimons:</P>
    <P>When I returned to my office after the debate last night there was a letter for me from the Attorney General emphasising the importance and significance of this case ...  I have the letter I received yesterday evening which arrived during the debate in the House ...</P>
    <P>However, the opening passage of the letter from the Attorney General reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> Dear Taoiseach,</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice requested me to prepare a reply to a question as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Was this the first time that the Section was applied?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have done this and it is enclosed herewith.  The reply is the best that I can do.  It does not in fact answer the question.  The contents of the second paragraph is the case that is effectively made by [blank] who dealt with the case.</P>
    <P>All the evidence suggests that the document the Attorney General enclosed was the draft reply which the Taoiseach and his ministerial colleagues had in their possession as he answered questions on that Tuesday and which was subsequently reproduced in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  If the Taoiseach had in his possession on Tuesday the enclosure, then he must also have, at that time, received the accompanying letter.  Yet he told the Dáil on the following day that he had not received the letter until he returned to his office after the debate.</P>

      <P>There can be little doubt that the document referred to in the Attorney General's letter is the one subsequently reproduced in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  The Attorney General's letter says that he had been asked to prepare a reply to a question as follows: &ldquo;Was this the first time that the Section was applied?&rdquo;  The heading on the Taoiseach's document was: &ldquo;Q. Was this the first time that the Section was applied?&rdquo;  The Attorney General's letter goes on to say:</P>
      <P>I have done this and it is enclosed herewith.  The reply is the best that I can do.  It does not in fact answer the question.  The contents of the second paragraph is the case that is effectively made by [blank] who dealt with the case.</P>
      <P>This corresponds exactly to the text of the draft reply which was in the Government's possession on Tuesday, especially in regard to the second paragraph.</P>
      <P>In his address to the Dáil on 16 November the Taoiseach said merely that &ldquo;the Attorney General, in the course of an exposition on various aspects of the case, referred in my presence on Monday to the existence of a case prior to the Smyth case &mdash; the Duggan case &mdash; ... &rdquo;.  However the whole thrust of the Attorney General's letter suggests that the Taoiseach, the person to whom the letter was addressed, was quite familiar with the Duggan case.  He does not say &ldquo;you will recall that I made a passing reference to a case known as Duggan&rdquo;, but simply refers to &ldquo;the Duggan case&rdquo;. The Attorney General was clearly writing to somebody he believed to be familiar with the Duggan case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of this are enormous. The matters I have referred to provide strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence that not only was information about the Duggan case knowingly withheld from the Dáil, but that the &ldquo;explanation&rdquo;<Col N="691" /> offered by the Taoiseach on the following day was built on an entirely false edifice.</P>

      <P>These questions cannot be allowed to remain unanswered. The House and the public are entitled to answers.  I have no interest in specifically pursuing the Taoiseach.  He has paid the ultimate price and done the honourable thing in resigning from office, but those Fianna Fáil members who are about to seek election as Taoiseach or to seek reappointment to the Cabinet must fully answer for their involvement in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an obligation on Deputy Ahern to clarify his role in this whole business.  It seems that his name will be put forward as a candidate for the position of Taoiseach and it is unthinkable that the House should be asked to vote on this in the absence of replies.  He is the only man who can answer the questions. He was chosen to sit beside the Taoiseach on that fateful Tuesday.  He, we are told, had in his possession the draft replies to supplementaries which were expected to be put to the Taoiseach. He was given the responsibility of passing the draft replies to the Taoiseach. If his statements about acknowledging the need for greater transparency and accountability are to be <Col N="692" /> accepted, he must now answer the following questions.  At what time on Tuesday, 15 November, was the letter transmitted from the Attorney General's office?  How was it transmitted?  At what time was it received in the office of the Taoiseach and by whom?  At what point did he or other Ministers become aware of the letter from the Attorney General? Will he confirm that the draft reply referred to in the Attorney General's letter is the one reproduced in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>?  Is it based on the Attorney General's reply?  If the reply to these two latter questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; how was that document in the possession of Ministers on Tuesday afternoon when the Taoiseach answered questions, when Deputy Reynolds told the Dáil that he had not received it until after the debate?  Who decided to add to the draft reply the advice: &ldquo;If pursued on this question, keep repeating exactly the above&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Ahern, can answer most of these questions.  There is an obligation on him to do so before he seeks election to the highest position in Government, but there is also a clear need for a wider investigation into this whole matter.  This can best be done by a committee of the House, but the committee must be given legal powers regarding privilege and the compellability of witnesses.  This affair will not go away until these questions are answered. Any Government involving Fianna Fáil, cobbled together while these questions remain unanswered, will be living on borrowed time from its very first day.</P>
