      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  Before we conclude the Second Stage of the Finance Bill the House should know what are the terms of reference of the Star Chamber that has been set up to plan the Fianna Fáil-Labour house tax and to know whether the report will be published before 9 June next so that the people can pass judgment on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I am afraid this horse is running in the Reynolds-Spring colours and will not run very far or very fast, that is if we have anything to do with it.  We would like this matter to be flushed out before the European elections.  We would like to see this horse in the parade ring before the European elections.  We do not want it reintroduced after the elections.</P>

      <P>What I put on the record yesterday &mdash; and if we had a little bit of ciúnas it would be helpful &mdash; was <Col N="1200" /> that despite what the Opposition, with all their scaremongering, would like the people to believe, this Government is committed to reducing the overall burden on taxpayers, including householders &mdash; which Deputy Yates might be interested to know &mdash; during our term of office.

It is our job to pursue the Government as we are doing.  How dare you continue to reflect on the Opposition in this way.  It is totally unacceptable, Sir.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I will not sit here and allow you reflect on the Opposition morning after morning.  We are here to ask questions of the Government which are of importance to the people.  It is absurd that Deputy Bruton can say outside the House what he cannot say in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be confusion when members of the Government go to Killarney so perhaps they should stay away from there.  In relation to a motion the Government intend to put before the House I wish to complain that the Government did not follow the procedure of consulting the Opposition.  The Tánaiste and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, while in Opposition complained here on 14 December 1989 <Col N="1204" /> that the then Government did not consult with Leaders of the Opposition parties in relation to the appointment of the Ombudsman.  I regret the Government did not choose to consult with the Opposition.  This is a matter for the House and not a matter for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking about a matter that is due to come before the House.  The Government was in breach of the spirit of the Act in not consulting with the leaders of the Opposition.  This is not a matter for a majority Government putting through their own nominee.  It should have been done by consultation. I regret that what the Tánaiste said on 19 December 1989 was not done.</P>

A statement made here by the Taoiseach is in direct conflict with a report which appears on the front page of a major national newspaper today in which it is indicated that the Government has set up a committee to investigate the property tax.  Will the Government agree to refer the terms of reference of this committee to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs so that we can discover who is telling the truth about Government intentions in regard to a property tax?</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1994: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past few years I have queried whether the traditional Finance Bill is the most effective way to address the problems of the economy. I have asked how appropriate is this inherited ritual in tackling the problems of a modern society.  I repeat these questions in the context of the 1994 Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Although the paternity of recent Finance Bills may have been the same, they have lacked any definite or comprehensive approach to fiscal policy and have often been internally inconsistent. For example, in 1992 the Minister for Finance claimed to have shut down or altered 39 concessionary taxes.  The Minister was exaggerating, but I applauded him then and I do so now for tackling some of the more disgraceful tax shelters and loopholes and limiting some of the more unproductive and wasteful schemes.  Unfortunately, the Minister has now revived many of these tax breaks in this Bill, albeit in many cases in a different fashion.</P>
      <P>There are several other contradictions. Last year the Minister introduced a modest probate tax which he vigorously defended on Committee Stage.  This year he has undermined the tax in response to a well-headed campaign.  This chopping and changing and <i>ad hoc</i> planning is serving little purpose in economic terms.  I suspect there is a diminishing political dividend in terms of political expedience. For example, the Minister set out to make certain changes in the residential property tax in the budget.  I predicted on budget day that this would incite middle income earners to fury.  That is what happened. As a result this Bill reflects the changes which were forced on the Government and introduced by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> The ink was scarcely dry on the Finance Bill when the Taoiseach announced that it was the intention of the Government to replace the residential property tax.  One cannot be certain from one year to the next what changes will be effected in any aspect of tax, or that a direction settled on for one year will not be reversed the following year.  The impression is that if the lobby is powerful and persistent enough, it can hope to win any change and almost any concession. There must be great uncertainty as to the significance of the Taoiseach's recent statements, notwithstanding extraordinary briefings yesterday by some of his spokespersons to the effect that we ought not to take too seriously what the Taoiseach said in Killarney.</P>
    <P>On the same weekend in Killarney, at the IMI Conference, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;We want a return to the type of low tax economy that was in operation in the 1960s&rdquo;.  He went on &ldquo;The burden of personal taxation will continue to be reduced as the Government works it way back to 1960 levels&rdquo;.  I know, a Cheann Comhairle, that in fine weather Killarney has strange effects on people.  Only a week earlier it led Minister Burton to promise the women at the meeting she attended that the Government was about to backtrack not only on the residential property tax but on the taxation of unemployment benefit.  There was no basis for Minister Burton's statement.  She absented herself from the House for more than a week afterwards and has never stated publicly why she made that statement in Killarney or why, if she was reported incorrectly, she did not seek a correction.  The Government has not withdrawn its decision to extend taxation to unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in Killarney also, whatever it is about the Kerry air, went on musing nostalgically about a return to 1960s levels of taxation.  I do not know what our over-stressed captains of industry at this £1,500 per person weekend business meeting really thought of the Taoiseach's ramble down memory lane. I am amazed that none of our economic commentators has done an assessment <Col N="1213" /> of the implications for tax revenue of a reversion to 1960s levels.  I find it hard to believe that people have already forgotten the Taoiseach's recent bravura performance in the United States where he recalled in sparkling fashion his own casual acquantance with the tax man in the 1960s when he was in business in the midlands.  I cannot imagine that the Minister for Finance would be too pleased about his reverting to 1960s levels of taxation if we were to follow the Taoiseach down that road.  It is remarkable that he should have made the speech the same week Deputy Trevor Sargent called for the abolition of income tax.  It would appear that Deputy Sargent and the Taoiseach are closer on this issue than Deputy Sargent realises.  Only fools and PAYE earners paid tax in the 1960s, and we have the Taoiseach's own word for it. However, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, has advanced in this House on a number of occasions a distinctly post-1960s concept of tax policy and tax reform.  I will quote what he said because, as it happens, I agree with it:</P>
    <P>It was never expected and never intended by the advocates of tax reform that widening the tax base and reducing tax rates would produce a lower tax bill for everyone.  On the contrary, it was always inherent in this strategy that there would be trade-offs between, on the one hand, improvements in the mainstream income tax regime and, on the other hand, curtailment of reliefs which benefit limited groups or sectors.  This was common ground among the proponents of tax reform and was explicitly stated by, for example, the Commission on Taxation. As the Commission said in its first report, tax reform is a collection of measures each of which affects some individuals adversely and others favourably.  Those who will not benefit are those who are over-favourably treated under the existing system.</P>
    <P>I happen to agree that that is a fair enough statement of the intentions and aspirations of those of us who have been campaigning for genuine tax reform for <Col N="1214" /> a long time, but for the life of me I cannot reconcile the two positions held by the two most senior members of Government on this critical question.  I cannot see how we can have a reversion to 1960s levels of taxation, as the Taoiseach wants, and at the same time some minor improvements for income tax payers and a curtailment of reliefs and shelters to business, as the Minister for Finance says he wants.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Taoiseach wants us all, in this reversion to 1960s levels of taxation, to head off for San Francisco with flowers in our hair and tell the taxman, as he did, that we are only joking.  There is an apparent conflict between the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach on tax policy, and it is not the only apparent contradiction in Government policy in this area.  At the same IMI Conference the Taoiseach advocated the reintroduction of rates.  He said: &ldquo;I think people will feel happier paying for services that they are getting.&rdquo;  The point is that people are already paying for services, which, in some cases, they are not getting.  It would appear that for the Taoiseach, language means whatever the Taoiseach wants it to mean at the time. The Taoiseach seems to have decided to replace the controversial residential property tax by an as yet unspecified nationwide tax.  You are witness, a Cheann Comhairle, to the extent that you have been troubled in the last few days by attempts by Members on the Opposition side to establish what exactly the Taoiseach meant by what he said in Killarney.  As of now, we have failed in that objective of finding out what is this nationwide tax that he proposes as a replacement for the residential property tax.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Taoiseach is calculatedly sending out two distinct and different messages.  He is telling people in Dublin in particular, and perhaps in other urban areas, not to worry about the residential property tax, which is the Labour Party's idea, that he has now persuaded them to abolish the residential property tax and that the rest of the country will be got to pay a substitute tax.  He <Col N="1215" /> has not told us yet what that substitute tax is going to be.  Then he sends out a different message to the rest of Ireland along the lines that there is some turbulence in Dublin, that Niall Andrews, John Stafford and Olive Braden &mdash; I should not forget her name just because Fianna Fáil do &mdash; are having some difficulty on the doorsteps because of this residential property tax; that because it is election time the Government wants to be able to tell them that the tax has been abolished but that the rest of the country should not take too seriously the suggestion that it is intended to reintroduce rates.</P>
    <P>Then, right on cue, the rural &ldquo;Buddha&rdquo;, Deputy Michael Smith, reassures the rest of Ireland that, like Horatio, he will man the bridge and ensure that whatever else happens rates will not be reintroduced for the rest of the country.  As a result we do not know where we are, and Minister Smith has got tremendous headlines.  The headline yesterday morning was &ldquo;I'll fight the reintroduction of rates, says Smith&rdquo;.  Classically, Fianna Fáil now have it both ways: residential property tax will be scrapped, there will not be a reintroduction of rates and, so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, the Labour Party can put on their sandals and take their own Aqua Libra bottles to the bottle bank; they can provide their own service.  We are getting rid of residential property tax and we will not reintroduce rates.</P>

      <P>On reflection, the Deputy has a point and I withdraw that statement.  I did not intend offending the supporters of Buddha, the silence and <Col N="1216" /> gravitas of the Minister for the Environment brought to mind that image.  If the Taoiseach's position is dominant, it is fair to ask if we are reverting to a 1960s level of tax, a low tax economy, high emigration and high unemployment.  It appears there are free tickets for the World Cup on offer to anyone who can find a poverty group not participating in some forum established by the Government with a view to making policy recommendations. Of course the real Government ignores the recommendations and implements decisions such as the extention of tax code to unemployment benefit.  The Chair has pulled me up before about referring to the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, as the Minister for poverty but, in fairness, she is a self-styled Minister for poverty.  I did not create that term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected and will refer to her as the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare.  She can be relied on to go around the country telling women's groups that whatever they find unpalatable the Government will change, without compunction for the fact that it may never see the light of day or be considered in legislation.  Until this morning we had not seen her since her last gig in Killarney.  The Finance Bill has been published but does not contain a provision about the Minister withdrawing the decision to extend taxation to unemployment benefit.  As someone who has more contact than other members with the unemployed I am aware there is a very hostile reaction to the fact that at a time when there are still serious inequities and injustices in the taxation code the Government, comprised of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party, should seek to extend taxation to unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister of State, <Col N="1217" /> Deputy Burton, should seek to defend her lamentable record by commenting on a number of occasions, most recently in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> last weekend, that anybody who seeks to expose that lamentable record is attacking her as a woman.  It is preposterous in an age of equality and given her disposition in the matter that she should argue that those of us in Opposition cannot point to the contradictions in her position before the election and since she became a Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill, 1994, is complex legislation.  Many of the 147 sections are of a technical nature and will require careful consideration and debate on Committee Stage.  We had hoped for earlier publication of the Bill and a longer period of time between Second and Committee Stages.  It is quite an imposition on the Opposition to expect it to come up with relevant amendments to the more complex areas of the Bill in the time allowed.</P>
    <P>Two of the most significant developments in taxation in recent months are not included in the Bill.  The decision to impose a tax on unemployment benefit was passed by order of the Dáil last February. Therefore, we will not have an opportunity to deal with that matter although I presume an amendment in that regard on Committee Stage, notwithstanding the fact that the order has been passed by the Dáil, would be in order.  The Taoiseach's announcement at the weekend concerning a poll tax was significant in terms of taxation.  It is regrettable that the Opposition has been forced into debating the Finance Bill on Second Stage without establishing the Government's position on that critical issue.  Apparently it is the intention that as soon as the strategy committee agrees this tax &mdash; whether in the form of poll tax or the reintroduction of rates &mdash; it will be a home tax and presumably will not be considered here until the next Finance Bill.  As the Minister did not refer to it in his introductory address he must do so when replying to this debate.</P>
    <P>The Bill continues the pattern in recent years of providing additional reliefs and <Col N="1218" /> concessions for business with merely cosmetic changes for the PAYE sector. Despite the impression at the time of the budget, it is clear that the supposed benefits for the PAYE sector were largely a mirage and that many low and middle income families will be worse off as a result of this Bill.  The Minister was successful in promoting his budget as pro-PAYE, a line which initially was uncritically accepted by many commentators, some of whom described it as a bonanza budget.  When the 1994-95 tax certificates started to come through letter boxes, the majority of PAYE workers discovered that improvement was marginal and that many were worse off.</P>
    <P>There were two reasons for this.  The few concessions provided for the PAYE sector were little more than token, especially when considering the level of tax most PAYE workers pay.  In addition, the combination of the reduced interest rates over the last year and the budget decision to start reducing the level of interest relief available meant that virtually all mortgage holders &mdash; apart from recent buyers &mdash; had their allowances cut and lost heavily.  While much public attention focused on the changes in the residential property tax, which in their modified form the Minister tells us will take in an additional £3 million, the real sting in the tail is the provision in section 6 which reduces mortgage interest relief. It is remarkable that public controversy has focused on the residential property tax and does not appear to be aware of the changes the Minister is introducing, almost by stealth, in section 6.  People may be shocked at what it costs them this year, but mortgage holders must look at the picture for the coming three years. The cost to taxpayers this year of the reduced mortgage relief and similar cuts in the allowance for VHI contributions and medical expenses will be £8 million. Three years down the road the annual cost of the changes in the mortgage interest relief and VHI allowance to home owners will be £81 million.  It is extraordinary that the imposition of £81 million on mortgage holders can be slipped through when there is such a public <Col N="1219" /> outcry about the proposal to raise an additional £3 million in residential property tax.  Mortgage holders and householders generally will discover that as the Minister's graduated reduction to standard level takes effect over the next three years, the £81 million will have a remarkably greater impact than the £3 million he proposes to raise in residential property tax.  The Taoiseach has delivered another body blow to householders with the announcement at the weekend of a new merged property tax and service or water charges on domestic dwellings.  I know the Taoiseach was a great admirer of Mrs. Thatcher's economic policies and, given the problems it created for the Iron Lady, I am somewhat surprised that he intends to ape her by introducing an Irish version of the poll tax.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for asking householders to pay additional taxes, and such a tax would be an additional one.  If the Minister was to say there was a visible commensurate reduction in personal income tax of householders, perhaps he would have a case to argue on the floor of the House.  However, there is no argument for the proposition to impose an additional tax on householders, especially when the drift of government policy for many decades has been to encourage people to invest in the private housing sector.  The Minister may reply that he proposes to give back £330 million in income tax this year.  However, that is not a big deal having regard to the buoyancy already evident and that figure includes the revenue from the 1 per cent levy, which should not have been imposed and the repeal of which the Minister cannot claim credit for.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach believes he can get away with effectively reintroducing rates under any other name, he has seriously misjudged the mood of the public.  By comparison, the extension of the property tax involves a relatively small number of people.  The proposed poll tax will hit every household.  The anger it is likely to create will make the row over the residential property tax look like a Legion of Mary prayer meeting.  If I interpret <Col N="1220" /> correctly what the Taoiseach said under pressure yesterday morning and today, I believe he acknowledges he has misjudged the mood of the public and is rapidly back-tracking.  He denies he ever said anything about a poll tax, a property tax or the reintroduction of rates; but it is a rose by any other name so far as the public is concerned.  There is no doubting the intention of the Taoiseach in this regard and presumably we will not see its precise shape until after the forthcoming local and European elections.</P>
    <P>I am mesmerised as to why the only property Fianna Fáil considers taxing is that of the family home.  Why will it not tax wealth, land, works of art, race horses, luxury yachts and other forms of property&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but will insist the family home is levied yet again.  In the 1970s Fianna Fáil abolished a modest wealth tax.  In the late 1970s Fianna Fáil not only abolished a resource tax but refunded the money to those who had paid it.  For a few years in the 1980s there was land tax; but Fianna Fáil, as usual, abolished it.  Fianna Fáil's view is that all property, except the family home, is untouchable.  Perhaps that is not a surprising view for Fianna Fáil, but it is certainly surprising that the Labour Party appears to have joined it in this view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle objection to Albert's poll tax is that it will be paid largely by the already overtaxed compliant taxpayers. The plan for the new tax cannot be considered in isolation from the huge burden the PAYE sector continues to bear and the failure of successive Governments to deliver on promises of fundamental tax reform.  In real terms the tax burden is now worse than that which brought hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets in the great tax marches more than a decade ago.  At that time only one taxpayer in a hundred paid tax at the top rate, now more than a third do.  The PAYE sector still pays roughly the same amount: approximately 90 per cent of all income tax, and income tax contributes <Col N="1221" /> nearly two-fifths of all Exchequer revenue.</P>
    <P>The comparison between the way in which the financial thumbscrew has been turned on the PAYE sector and the manner in which farmers have been allowed get away with paying token amounts of tax is particularly outrageous. Figures given by the Minister in reply to Dáil questions show that between 1989 and 1992 tax paid by PAYE workers increased from an average of £3,122 to £3,662.  That represents an increase of 17 per cent, more than twice the rate at which salaries and wages increased in the same period.  However, in that period the average tax paid by farmers decreased by 9.3 per cent.  Farmers now pay less than one-fifth of the average tax paid by a PAYE worker.  However, many farmers are on low incomes, but nobody could seriously suggest that those tax returns are a fair reflection of income levels of the two communities.</P>
    <P>While some progress has been made in regard to the self-employed, that sector is still paying on average more than £200 less than PAYE workers.  Given that the self-employed category includes many potential and actual high earning professions, that figure is difficult to explain. There is now evidence of a substantial evasion by the self-employed.  The president of the tax officials branch of IMPACT, Mr. Mark Flanagan, told its recent conference in Waterford that audits of self-employed found average underpayments of £22,000.  Their average tax payments of £3,431 are incredible. As minimum random sample audits of their returns discovered on average underpayments of £22,000, there is a compelling argument to increase the minimal audit carried out at present. That is an area on which the Minister should concentrate and deploy staff. Every audit of the self-employed brought in about six times the average tax paid. According to Mr. Flanagan, tax fraud is still taking place on a considerable scale within the self-employed sector and those figures would seem to confirm that. However, he claimed the Government was refusing to allocate additional <Col N="1222" /> resources to increase the number of audits carried out by the chief inspector of taxes.</P>
    <P>One need not resort to illegal evasion if one can afford tax experts and consultants, one can set up legal avoidance schemes.  Last November the Assistant Secretary to the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Seán Moriarty, gave a graphic description at the annual conference of the Foundation of Fiscal Studies of how a high income earner, earning in the region of £150,000 per annum, could use a range of tax reliefs and incentives to avoid paying any tax.  I emphasise that these are not my views but those of the Assistant Secretary of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Seán Moriarty.  He gave a graphic description to the conference through charts and explanations of how, if you are earning £150,000 per annum as distinct from £150,000 per annum, you can arrange your affairs in such a manner that you pay no tax at all.  He said many of the so-called tax avoidance schemes depended for their effectiveness on being hidden from detailed Revenue scrutiny.  He said: &ldquo;In practice the Revenue is involved in a continuous battle of wits, seeking to ensure that higher income groups are subjected to the appropriate rate&rdquo;.  The official tax returns for the self-employed and the figures quoted by Mr. Flanagan seem to indicate that the Revenue is losing the battle of wits.</P>
    <P>Figures such as these incense people on PAYE who week in, week out, see one-third or more of their salaries disappearing in tax and PRSI.  In my experience most people on PAYE do not object to paying tax, but they do object very strongly to having to pay so much tax when wealthy self-employed people, who can afford the necessary expertise, can minimise their tax liability through various devices, including loan interest on borrowings to invest in companies and partnerships, covenants, business expansion schemes, designated area reliefs, capital allowances and plain fraud.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes, who is in the House, may think this is going too far and no doubt he will have his own views on this <Col N="1223" /> matter.  I will give an example of what I call the Minister's 50-50 cash back.  I am not aware that the Minister has answered questions in the House on this matter. He presented this proposal last year as a main plank of his taxation policy to stimulate enterprise and employment, but a year later it has created only 18 jobs.  If that is not true I would like the Minister to deal with this question in his reply.</P>
    <P>There is a myriad of new reliefs in the Finance Bill for the business and commercial sectors.  The Bill has received a very broad welcome from the business sector, but whether that is an indication that it will be more successful in creating jobs and stimulating enterprise remains to be seen.  Most of the new reliefs introduced by the Minister are justified on the grounds that they are designed to encourage enterprise and investment and thus promote job creation.  In his statement on the publication of the Bill, he identified 17 such initiatives, but there does not seem to be any coherent or through-out strategy behind them.  It reflects what I described in my budget speech as a buckshot approach &mdash; scatter the reliefs and resources all over the place in the hope that something will strike the target.</P>
    <P>Virtually every Finance Bill in recent years contained a similar range of schemes, incentives and reliefs, all supposedly to promote job creation, yet our live register figure hovers close to 300,000.  It is time that a qualitative cost analysis of these schemes was carried out. One of the most widely promoted reliefs has been the business expansion scheme. We know that no less an authority than the Comptroller and Auditor General has raised some very interesting questions about the efficacy of the business expansion scheme and whether there should be a more conventional cost-benefit approach in terms of the scheme's contribution.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the apparently optimistic forecasts of the ESRI which, although some of its conclusions are very tentative, suggest that there is a relative <Col N="1224" /> improvement in our economic prospects &mdash; that is better than the position up to now which is that there has been an improvement for relatives of the Government. Unless the 300,000 unemployed can see some prospects of being reemployed, talks of boom and bloom are very hollow for them.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about jobs being at the top of its agenda it is inexplicable that the Minister has not acted on one of the greatest disincentives to research and development &mdash; I am referring to the VAT rates that apply to laboratory and research equipment.  This punitive tax on progress causes foreign research foundations to scout around for other less taxing locations.  Instead of encouraging the indigenous development of new products, technologies and processes, the Government appears hell bent on thwarting such developments at every turn.  This Bill does nothing to change that.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
    <P>I would also ask him to consider the abuse of C45 certificates.  I am surprised, since I know that trade unions have directly canvassed the Minister on this matter, that there is nothing that suggests this abuse is being brought under control. I have a letter from a member of the Labour Party which he sent to the chairman of that party, Deputy Kemmy.  As he understands it, the Labour Party has not been successful in persuading the Minister to tackle this area of abuse.  He said:</P>
    <P>As a member of the Labour Party and worker in the construction industry, I feel compelled to write to you concerning a disturbing trend, which is emerging in the industry.  I am referring to builders preferring to have their workers become &ldquo;Self-Employed SubContractors&rdquo; and work on C45 certificates.</P>
    <P>I enclose a copy of an article from a recent issue of &ldquo;Construction Today&rdquo; which highlights the benefits to builders who opt for this system and the erosion of welfare entitlements of the new &ldquo;Self-Employed&rdquo;.  As a result of <Col N="1225" /> the increasing acceptability of C45s it is only a matter of time before:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The &ldquo;Black Economy&rdquo; becomes the norm.</P>
    <P>2.  Safety standards deteriorate even further.</P>
    <P>3.  The role of and indeed need for Trade Unions will come under scrutiny.</P>
    <P>4.  The role of the Labour Party, now in Government and seen as in a position to influence national policy, in being part of a Government turning a blind eye to the erosion of workers conditions of employment is questioned.</P>

      <P>I do not have time to deal with the article from <i>Construction Today,</i> but it sets out the serious implications for workers and calculates that savings to the employer on holiday pay was 13 per cent; pension and sick pay, 4 per cent; guaranteed week, 15 per cent; meal, travel and tool allowances, 8 per cent; PRSI 12.25 per cent &mdash; which is a loss to the Minister &mdash; and the training levy, 1 per cent, giving a total of 53.25 per cent.

      <P>For Deputy Rabbitte's information, the black economy committee is working with the unions, Revenue and the Department of Social <Col N="1226" /> Welfare in trying to seek ways to address this matter.  I accept there is a problem and it is being examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that examination which is overdue.  There is a very real problem in this area.</P>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to what Deputy Yates and Deputy Cox said in respect of the excise duty on cars, not as it relates to the SIMI position of cars at the top of the range, but specifically to the question of the cubic capacity of middle range cars that have had to be adapted in order to comply with best environmental requirements. The insertion of the catalytic converter in particular has, as I understand it, produced a situation where there is a threat to market share, certainly in the case of one particular make of car.  If it is accepted that the reasons for the change are genuinely for environmental considerations, it is unreasonable that the excise duty should penalise them for seeking to do that.  I ask the Minister to address that area also.</P>
      <P>I also want to give the Minister notice of my intention to raise on Committee Stage the question of the unfair application of the tax code to cohabiting couples. The Minister told me last year that he was favourably disposed towards this but that he wanted to await the implementation of legislation to allow the right to remarry.  I would not like to be on the verge of getting married and waiting for this divorce referendum &mdash; and the way things are going, I would not count my chickens on it being held this year either.  The Government seems to be getting cold feet on the issue and in particular the employment of consultants to make its arguments is an indication that some Fianna Fáil Ministers, not to mention backbenchers &mdash; and I do not include the Minister for Finance in this &mdash; will be hiding and taking both sides of the road with them.  It is time we tackled this inequity for cohabiting couples in the tax code.  If it is good enough for the social welfare code it is good enough for the tax code and we should make that change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I remind the House that the <Col N="1227" /> former Finance spokesperson for the Labour Party, now Minister Ruairí Quinn, described the then attempt to extend taxation to unemployment benefit as &ldquo;harsh and uncharacteristically cruel&rdquo;. If it was harsh and uncharacteristically cruel when Deputy Quinn was on these benches, I can assure him &mdash; although he may come into contact with fewer unemployed people these days &mdash; that it is still harsh and uncharacteristically cruel and I will be fighting that particular measure tooth and nail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be remarked that it is not entirely usual in a debate on a Bill as important as this that the alternation of speakers in the House passes once without anybody contributing from the Government benches.  It would seem that the Government Deputies are so ashamed or so worried about provisions in this Finance Bill that none of them wants to come into the House to say anything about it on Second Stage.  I wonder what that will mean on Committee Stage.  Is it perhaps due to the fact that the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and the Labour Parliamentary Party are currently meeting, as indeed is my own party, but according to what I hear the debate in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting this morning will be about this extraordinary succession of statements and retractions from Ministers on the other side: the Taoiseach's gaffe about a combination of residential property tax and service charges, the Minister for the Environment's denial that the Taoiseach had any grounds for saying what he said and the various other rumblings we have heard from that side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me &mdash; although not too loudly, he is a polite fellow &mdash; that it would be far more interesting to be a fly on the wall at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting this morning than it would be to be here debating the Finance Bill.  I wonder what the atmosphere will be like at the Labour Parliamentary Party meeting this morning <Col N="1228" /> when they discuss the combination of residential property tax, which was one of its favourite pieces of candy back in 1983, with service charges which &mdash; although its own leader at the time when he was Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment introduced them in this House &mdash; they tried to subvert around the country and are still trying to do it. Now they find themselves locked into a Government that apparently has a Taoiseach, one of whose aims in life now is to find a way of combining this draft residential property tax with a perfectly sensible system of local charges which both of the Government parties have opposed tooth and nail around the country.  I wonder what the Labour Party will make of that.  It will require a fair amount of ingenuity and not a little political accommodation in those two parties to arrive at any sensible view on whether some action is to be taken on foot of the Taoiseach's statements in Killarney or indeed whether the Minister for the Environment will win the argument.</P>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves that there has been an interesting history in recent years of statements by Ministers for the Environment concerning property taxes and local charges.  I am sure the Minister for Finance remembers well that there was a time when a Fianna Fáil Minister for the Environment, now gone to other pastures in Brussels, seemed to be talking about introducing a new form of local property tax.  He tried valiantly several times to give the impression that the Government intended to do this until he was slapped down and was eventually so browned off with this that he allowed himself to be exported to Brussels.  I know his daughter is trying to carry on the family tradition in his constituency, although she has not much hope of doing that.</P>
    <P>Over the period of the last Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, various tentative steps were taken in the direction of a more comprehensive local property tax to resolve some of the problems that the Government envisages with its tax programme.  I wonder what that tax programme is, because the Minister <Col N="1229" /> for Finance and the Taoiseach have been trying to persuade us that they are involved in a deliberate programme of tax reform and that they want to increase revenue in some areas in order to reduce the burden of taxation on individuals.  I see no evidence of any systematic move to reduce allowances in order to be able to reduce personal taxes.</P>
    <P>If one considers what is taking place now, much of what is taking place in both directions is contradictory.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, in this Finance Bill we have some improvements of reliefs in various areas of taxation.  There is an extension of the urban renewal scheme to new areas.  That is an extension of a relief which will be welcomed by many people especially in the new areas, including the town of Newbridge which is in my constituency.  That is an additional relief that because the schemes that have already come in under the terms of the reliefs were introduced in previous years remain and the benefits of those tax reliefs continue.</P>
    <P>There are a number of extra reliefs included in this Finance Bill in relation to capital allowances for various kinds of economic activity, including agriculture, where a strong case can be made for what is contained in this Bill.  These are areas where we have some reliefs and the Goverment might say that it is extending reliefs where they will help to promote economic activity and in some of these areas, not all of them, that is probably true.</P>
    <P>We then come, however, to areas where the Government is introducing new impositions in the context of this Bill and immediately we find an economic area where it is not a relief that is being brought in but a new imposition &mdash; the change in the rules relating to corporation profits tax, for example, and the modification of the definition of products that come within the scope of the 10 per cent profits tax.  One of the buoyant areas of production in rural Ireland is the production of mushrooms.  Under the provisions of this Bill it will be subject to a higher rate of corporation profits tax.  The Minister cannot say he has a consistent <Col N="1230" /> approach to relief for productive enterprises that can expand employment.  The Government says it wants to reduce personal taxation yet there are a number of new impositions in the Finance Bill, for example, mortgage interest relief will effectively disappear by 1997; VHI allowances against tax liability are restricted and the expenditure threshold for unusual medical costs before tax relief can be claimed has been raised.  There is no discernible strategy that one can find in the Finance Bill regarding the productive sector or personal taxation and it is futile for the Minister to pretend otherwise.</P>
    <P>Mortgage interest relief has been a target of tax reformers for many years, going back to the first report of the Commission on Taxation.  The Government has not come clean in this area.  Neither this Government nor its predecessor had the courage to give a programme of taxation over the next few years.  The experts and pundits say it is impossible to have tax reform piecemeal because the opposition to any reduction in relief is more vocal than the support for a reduction in overall levels of taxation.  That is a fact and is part of human nature.  It is something Governments must deal with.  This Government will fail, as its predecessors did, to get the message across that there is a coherent tax reform policy in place because it does not give the two sides of the equation.  The Government has not given sufficient priority to the idea of tax reform in order to resist the pressures that arise in the latter part of the year when there are arguments about the Estimates, putting a budget together and the fact that the Government need an extra few million pounds in taxation to tie the two ends of the budget together.  The Minister may deny that but he knows it is true.  That is why the Minister for Finance has given us some daft taxation legislation &mdash; the last minute panic measure that is required in order to keep the Minister's figures somewhere near the overall fiscal targets he has set.  It resulted in the 1 per cent income levy last year which the Minister tried brazenly to present as part of a comprehensive, long-term tax <Col N="1231" /> reform strategy.  What happened to it? It was abolished this year because the Government found out it did not need it after all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no way to present comprehensive tax reform.  The Minister will try to defend his position but he knows that is the truth.</P>
      <P>VHI relief will be halved shortly.  Many VHI members are worried about whether they will face extra charges if they need hospitalisation or treatment and draw on their VHI benefit.  There is the particularly mean change in the tax relief for unusual medical expenditure.  Up to now, if one spent over £50 on medical expenses which was not recoverable, one could claim tax relief.  The limit has been trebled and is now £150 a year.  For many people whose income is above the medical card threshold level but who are not well off, this was a useful provision and one which I advised constituents to use. It is not a well known provision.</P>
      <P>There is the argument about residential property tax and whether the Government plans to combine it with service charges.  It is nonsensical.  Much of what Deputy Rabbitte said about wealth tax and so on is totally unjustified, unsystematic and out of keeping with any real analysis of what taxation is about. The residential property tax &mdash; I say this in the full knowledge of the history of that tax &mdash; is one of the worst taxes ever introduced.  There was only one tax which was worse, namely the 1982 Fianna Fáil strategy of VAT at the point of entry. That was a matter of pure desperation but the property tax is just stupid.  It was brought in because of the kind of nonsense Deputy Rabbitte goes on with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a feeling some people were not paying enough income tax, therefore a wealth tax must be introduced.  Since we do not know what paintings, yachts or jewellery people have stashed away in bank vaults or at home &mdash; not that they <Col N="1232" /> keep much at home these days &mdash; we should introduce a wealth tax in the form of a property tax.  I had that argument with the Tánaiste and the late Deputy Cluskey.  What they are saying is they are not happy the income tax system works properly at the high level.  Deputy Rabbitte said there was no tax on these other forms of wealth but there is.  If you have the good fortune to be a high income earner and pay full income taxation you then pay all the normal expenditure taxes when you purchase goods.  If you buy a big car you pay tax; if you buy a yacht, paintings or jewellery you pay VAT.  The proposition now is that you should pay a third level of taxation on your after tax income.  That is nonsense.  If the feeling is that such people have not paid sufficient tax then we should work on improving the income taxation system.</P>
    <P>I remember the howls of outrage from Fianna Fáil when in 1983 I took real steps to improve the income tax collection system.  They erupted and went berserk any time we proposed to make it incumbent on the self-employed to make and produce evidence of their returns.  We gave the Revenue Commissioners new powers to do that.  However, Fianna Fáil has finally seen the light and their is no more enthusiastic exponent of efficiency in tax collection than the present Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>All his colleagues who had apoplexy in 1983 and 1984 are now cheering on our Bertie because he is doing a grand job.  Nobody likes a Minister for Finance who makes the taxation system work but they all joyfully spend the money he gets.  I am delighted that it is now acceptable in the political culture of this country that one makes the income tax system work efficiency.  However, that means the Minister should take the opportunity to get rid of nonsenses such as the residential property tax.  It was such an idiotic construct from the beginning <Col N="1233" /> that it should never have had any place in our system.</P>
      <P>I want to refer very briefly to one or two other matters &mdash; I will deal with them in greater detail on Committee Stage. Section 16 amends a scheme introduced under, I think, the 1992 Finance Act which provided relief for expenditure on significant buildings.  Under the scheme relief was given for expenditure on the unkeep of a building or garden which was open to the public for one month during the year, for example, maintenance and restoration work, etc.  This scheme was introduced because it had been determined that a number of buildings and gardens were significant works in themselves and we needed to ensure that they could be maintained.  Section 16 imposes a number of other obligations on the owners of such buildings or gardens: it extends the opening period to 90 days, including not less than 60 days during the period commencing 1 May and ending on 30 September.</P>
      <P>The Minister should reflect on this provision which will make section 16 tourism policy, which was not intended in the original scheme.  The original section in the 1992 Finance Act was intended to cover heritage policy under which relief could be given for the undoubtedly high costs of maintaining parts of our cultural heritage; it was not intended to keep gardens and buildings open for tourism. In many cases &mdash; the Minister can check this for himself &mdash; the 90 days opening requirement, including not less than 60 days during the period commencing 1 May and ending 30 September, is an excessively onerous imposition which will cause enormous problems.  It may well result in some of these properties falling out of the net, not being maintained as they should and some properties deteriorating to the point that they will no longer be available to anybody.  The Minister is incorrectly changing the original purpose of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join Deputy Rabbitte in encouraging the Minister to take concrete steps to improve the position of cohabiting couples under our tax law without waiting for the divorce referendum.  Cohabiting <Col N="1234" /> couples have the worst of both worlds &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners treat them as if they were married, with the resultant penalties and the Department of Social Welfare treats them as if they were single, with all the disadvantages involved.  One of Deputy Rabbitte's constituents first brought this matter to my attention a good many years go.  Some steps have been taken to rectify the anomalies in this area in the meantime, but a conceptual leap is required to make our tax and social welfare laws equitable.  This problem is causing suffering to a good many people and the Minister should avail of the opportunity to introduce improvements on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the many major worthwhile concessions granted to all sectors of the community in this Bill.  It is one of the most broadly based Finance Bills introduced in recent years and is acceptable to the vast majority of people.  It is right to point out that its foundations were laid in 1987 under the Haughey-MacSharry administration which, because of the very poor state of the national finances, had to operate like a wartime cabinet.  When Fianna Fáil came into Government in 1987 the country was on the verge of bankruptcy and people were afraid that the World Bank would have to be called in to put our house in order.  Successive Fianna Fáil led Governments managed to rectify the state of the national finances in the intervening years.  The recently published ESRI report highlighted many of the strong aspects of our economy and the factors which will lead to a climate for investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Fianna Fáil led minority Government was strongly criticised at the time by many people, including, regrettably, our present partners in Government who are now reaping the rewards of the years of austerity which led to Ireland having one of the fastest growing economies in the Western world.  The climate for investment was never more favourable than today.  One has only to look at the Custom House Docks development, which has gone from success <Col N="1235" /> to success, to see proof of this.  The location in that centre of approximately 140 financial services companies from all corners of the globe must be seen as a vote of confidence in our economy.  It must be remembered that the Financial Services Centre is not funded by the Exchequer.  Under legislation no grants have been payable to the Authority since December 1991; indeed the Authority is required to make a contribution to the Exchequer.  To date the Authority has contributed £3 million to the Department of the Environment and this level of contribution from a development which is still in its infancy, so to speak, must be very welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 33 deals with the urban renewal relief scheme and I am very glad that the Minister decided to include Mallow, one of the oldest towns in North Cork and the largest in my constituency. This news has been widely welcomed in Mallow which has a high rate of unemployment. It is one of the fastest growing towns in County Cork and I look forward to the many developments and substantial investments which will be made as a result of its inclusion in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the seed capital scheme which is very important for start-ups. This scheme, which has a great deal to offer to interested people, should be more widely advertised.  The business expansion scheme has been very successful. I welcome the increase in the company value under this scheme from £150,000 to £250,000.  These two schemes will be of great benefit to people who have the incentive to invest in business and they should be more widely advertised.</P>
    <P>The measures being introduced to assist agriculture, in conjunction with the early retirement scheme, will greatly change the face of the agricultural sector and will lead to a substantial number of farms being transferred from older to younger farmers.  Young people are the lifeblood of any industry and the early retirement scheme will help to stimulate higher levels of investment in agriculture <Col N="1236" /> and lead to more efficient production systems.</P>
    <P>The reliefs granted in stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax for young farmers have been long awaited by farming organisations, including Macra na Feirme.  These reliefs will help to lessen the burden on many families in the transfer of agricultural land which has a high value.  I have lobbied for many years for a change in the capital allowances for farm buildings.  Farmers can now claim relief at a rate of 15 per cent for the first six years.  However, I would like to have seen the rate increased to 25 or 30 per cent to take into account the changing face of farmyard developments &mdash; a farm building which was regarded as modern five years ago is now regarded as out of date.  I refer to buildings such as milking parlours, livestock houses, potato sheds and housing for sheep and pigs.  EU directives and animal welfare regulations have led to rapid changes in this area.  It will be necessary to provide for a shorter period for write down of relief for farm buildings if farmers are to invest in their farms, thus ensuring a modern agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>A new aspect being highlighted is that of dairy hygiene.  If we do not have proper standards in this area we will be unable to tap the resources of the world food market.  There is also the matter of animal welfare on which we have not even touched as yet.  However, I understand that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is making a provision by means of some EU grant aid.  That will go part of the way only.  If there is to be development and investment to allow us put our house in order and keep pace with EU directives and regulations, we will have to examine additional changes in the provisions of the Finance Bill of next year <i>vis-à-vis</i> capital allowances. Such investment creates development and stimulates a rural economy, particularly bearing in mind the moneys spent on equipment, steel, iron, cement, gravel and labour.  Many rural areas are very dependent on this type of small building industry.  It has always been the backbone of rural villages and their economy.  This <Col N="1237" /> area must be re-examined in the preparation of next year's Finance Bill.  I have no doubt that people will be reminding the Minister of that necessity.  I am aware of his helpful approach in this area.  He understands the position well and is prepared to consider any necessary changes to keep us abreast of modern developments.</P>
    <P>The change in probate tax on agricultural land is a welcome announcement which has been applauded by all who lobbied for such change.  Those measures go a long way to alleviating a very serious problem for our agricultural industry and rural areas generally.  If our economy is to grow there must be substantial investment in this area.  There is no way that we can substantially increase public expenditure or reduce our national debt without such investment.</P>
    <P>Two areas of concern to me are health and education.  It is only a few years since we were closing hospitals and curtailing health expenditure, yet we appear now to be expanding.  While I do not want to appear to be anti-health or education, they comprise two spending areas that can be funded only through taxation.  We must keep a watchful eye on them because it was those areas that brought our economy into difficulty previously.  A new hospital is being built at Tallaght, but the county hospital in Mallow has now a 64-bed complement where there used to be some 100 beds.  Some money should be channelled into investment in that hospital to retore its full bed complement, which would not go to waste in that rural area.  While a new hospital may be required in Tallaght we must examine its economics and the necessity within our economy overall.</P>
    <P>A problem always facing our economy is our vulnerability to any change that takes place in the financial business sector in London or Germany.  A few weeks ago we observed an increase in American interest rates occasioned by a shift of funds from Europe to the American market in order to benefit from those high levels of interest.  Markets across Europe shuddered.  When the Irish punt is fairly high against the £ sterling, at 97 <Col N="1238" /> pence, many difficulties are created for our exporters particularly those engaged in the production of food and other indigenous produce.  We must maintain a watchful eye on this area at all times.  We should align ourselves with some European currency to protect ourselves from the serious crisis we experienced in late 1992/early 1993 when our interest rates soared to heights of 30 per cent plus, doing irreparable damage to confidence in this economy.  Many people were frightened, which led to a lack of investment. However, that overall scene changed rather rapidly.  Within the European Union context we must examine a single currency.  It would be in the interests of our economy to continue to promote the establishment of a single currency, particularly within an enlarged European Union with four additional member states.  It is in the interests of this island that we vigorously pursue this objective and I am aware of the Taoiseach's commitment to it.</P>
    <P>I have always been convinced that we must keep a close eye on the United Kingdom market which accounts for 30 to 40 per cent of our trade.  They are our nearest neighbours and comprise a market of approximately 60 million people, who speak the same language, and have the same tastes in food.  This renders it easy for us to trade with them. I want to refer also to the excellent budgetary fillip given our motor industry. Canvassing recently for the European elections, I called to a few garage owners to ascertain their views on the present position within their industry.  They all spoke of the buoyancy within the motor industry, all expressing gratitude at the budgetary provisions to aid their industry. By and large the provisions of this year's budget and Finance Bill are progressive and should lead to a greater level of investment.  The numbers of new cars, large and small, to be observed on our streets is further proof that the budgetary measures are effective as are the capital allowances.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Hyland, is present.  A <Col N="1239" /> small percentage of the mushroom industry is located in my constituency but it is big business in Minister generally and in the North East.  Our mushroom industry exports approximately £51 million of produce to the United Kingdom and other markets annually.  The total value of the crop is in the region of £65 million, providing a total of 5,000 jobs within the industry.  The total level of production is 40,000 tonnes, of which 30,000 tonnes are exported.  Our mushrooms are of the best quality and flavour.  We are now known to be the best mushroom producers worldwide.  Our greatest success is that we have allowed this be a labour-intensive industry and have not opted for mechanisation.  If we seek to change our methods of production because of the changed taxation structure we will have to opt for a mechanical system of growing mushrooms or not engage in the process at all.  If we have to mechanise mushroom growing we should remember we will be in danger of damaging the spawn.  The mushrooms will lose their flavour and juices, rendering them of little value in the marketplace.  They will become of comparable quality and standard to those produced by our competitors who are jealous of some of the concessions our producers enjoy.  I appeal to the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture, Food and Forestry to aid and protect this very valuable indigenous industry which has thrived in recent years.</P>
    <P>Another matter that concerns me is that money has not been paid to fruit and vegetable growers who suffered from the hazards of the weather of 1993 when many horticultural crops were lost.  Commitments were given that these growers would be aided.  I understand a substantial number of applicants for such aid await payment.  Many of them may not be deemed deserving of payment.  With the expertise now available to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Teagasc, surely an assessment of their problems should have been undertaken by now.  We are into another season, another growing year.  Many growers who did not have the requisite <Col N="1240" /> funds to invest in their businesses this year have had to borrow at expensive rates from financial institutions.  I ask that urgent action be taken in that area since budgetary provision was announced some months ago.</P>
    <P>There has been much concern expressed about the behaviour and attitude of the Revenue Commissioners in their examination of books and documentation maintained at marts and marketplaces, instilling fear in the owners of those establishments and the people who trade with them.  The Revenue Commissioners must adopt a more flexible, discretionary approach to the self-employed if we are to get our economy up and running.  It is in that area that we must see investment and an appropriate climate generated.  There is no point in the Revenue Commissioners hunting, badgering or chasing these people.  Even small entrepreneurs are in fear.  If we want to get away from the dole mentality, we must change our overall thinking and move in a different direction.  If we are to become an enterprising society we must have more control over the Revenue Commissioners, lessening the type of taxation culture that has tended to be developed.</P>
    <P>It has been a great week for the Opposition because of the Taoiseach's statement at the Irish Management Institute Conference in Killarney that he was examining new areas of taxation, rates or other impositions that would help to broaden the taxation burden, thereby creating a new climate.</P>
    <P>An issue which was mentioned in discussions has been picked up by the Opposition and leads me to wonder whether the end of the world is approaching. There have been calls for taxation changes and different methods of taxation but when any new method is introduced to broaden the tax base there are screams to the effect that it will not work and Opposition campaigns are organised.  We are then left with a few reliables such as capital tax, the PAYE structure and personal taxation.</P>
    <P>Service charges were introduced under the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1983, <Col N="1241" /> and a property tax has now been introduced. There was great merit in the Taoiseach's suggestion in Killarney to set up a committee to examine the co-ordination of the property tax and service charges.  There is a willingness on the part of the public to pay some form of tax especially if it goes to local authorities. This would mean that they would have a broader financial base rather than being dependent on central government.</P>
    <P>In New York, for example there are three taxes; the federal tax, the state tax and the county tax.  There is room for change here and we should not make this a political issue because of the European or local elections.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have had the opportunity to praise the Government and the Minister.  When I see all the concessions that have been introduced it is difficult to understand why there will be a division on the Bill this evening.  The personal allowance has been increased by £175 for a single person and by £350 for a married couple thus bringing them to £2,350 and £4,700 respectively.  That is a major step forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I contributed to debates on previous Finance Bills and participated in Committee Stage debates.  A Finance Bill is complex and is only teased out effectively on Committee Stage.  On that Stage it is a pity the Minister does not respond to suggestions. For example last year we raised several issues which were causing concern, one of which was the 1 per cent income levy and as a result the Minister abolished that levy this year.  I opposed the probate tax and described it as a death duty.  Its introduction was regrettable considering the small amount of revenue collected. Fine Gael opposed its extension to spouses.  I am glad that subsequently the Minister saw the wisdom of our views and made amendments to that tax.  He should have gone all the way and abolished the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage of last year's Bill our amendments were not accepted.  On occasions when one puts forward constructive <Col N="1242" /> suggestions they are not appreciated.  For example the Finance Bill, 1993, was flagged as being concerned for business, particularly small business.  We were told about a provision in it &mdash; the seed capital scheme &mdash; which was intended to give a boost to entrepreneurs to set up businesses in the form of a financial incentive.  During the debate we pointed out that the regulations of the scheme would retard progress. Subsequent events proved us right because I understand the take-up under the scheme was minimal.  The scheme proved a disappointment.  I am pleased there are amendments in this year's Bill to relax some of the regulations of the scheme.  The barriers and restrictions which prevent people setting up in business should be removed.</P>
    <P>Out of our concern to stimulate employment in the clothing and footwear industries we made a major issue of the 21 per cent VAT imposition last year. Subsequently events proved us right in that those industries have been hammered and many jobs lost.  This year's Bill I had hoped would contain provisions to reduce the amount of VAT.</P>
    <P>The issue of mortgage interest relief has been of concern to many people.  It is important to recall the history of that relief and its objective which was to encourage people to buy or build their own houses.  That was achieved because there has been a phenomenal increase in home ownership.  We must give positive inducements to encourage people to buy their own homes because during recent years very few local authority houses have been built.  That means that the waiting list has considerably increased.  If those people were to build a house they would need to be given some encouragement. The mortgage interest relief was a positive encouragement towards home ownership.  I recall when the mortgage interest relief maximium stood at £4,800.  Subsequently it was reduced to £4,000, and recently it has been reduced to £3,200.  The relief is being systematically reduced.</P>
    <P>Certain changes in the Bill, will impact on people who wish to own their houses. <Col N="1243" /> I am concerned that many provisions will hammer the middle income category.  For example, the PAYE person who may not be eligible for higher education grants for his children will be affected by the reduction in mortgage interest relief and VHI premium relief.</P>
    <P>On VHI relief, the House will recall a provision in the Finance Bill two years ago concerning people who sought treatment in public hospitals.  It appeared laudable at the time and many people were penalised by a subsequent increase in their PRSI contributions in order to pay for this change.  Money was taken out of the pockets of people who would not necessarily avail of public hospitals and who would use their VHI to avail of private treatment.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, of which I am a member, recently reviewed the operations of the VHI who will have to face more competition in the future.  I was concerned about the mid-west region which has a population of 320,000 people.  While the Limerick Regional Hospital is very good many specialist facilities are not available there.  For example, there is not a cardiologist &mdash; I understand such a specialist will be appointed shortly &mdash; a dermatologist or a neurosurgeon.  However, the VHI did not encourage local business people who were prepared to establish a private hospital; it would not subvent VHI patients.  That is unfair to the people in the mid-west as it means the VHI member does not have a choice.  Where a private facility is not acceptable to the VHI, patients are referred to Galway, Cork, Kilkenny and other centres.  It is regrettable that the VHI could not support that service.  The issue of balance billing generated a great deal of publicity and I am concerned about its effects on the VHI and the Hospital Consultants Association.  At the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies I supported the move to ensure the GPs would inform patients whether consultants operate under the VHI or balance billing system. It is regrettable that news of the squabble <Col N="1244" /> between the chief executive and the chairman of the VHI has percolated through the national newspapers and the attendant publicity is certainly not doing the cause of the VHI or its 1.3 million members any good.  Perhaps it is symptomatic of the fact that the VHI has only five board members whereas most semi-State bodies have nine.  They should have at least nine board members and I supported this at the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  I hope the unseemly squabble will be resolved because it is not in the interests of VHI.</P>
    <P>On Valentine's day 1991 the then Minister for the Environment Mr. Flynn, announced his social housing plan.  It was a laudable package but it has not lived up to what was envisaged.  It has been disastrous for the local authorities who were asked to implement it because they were not given the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members have received literature from the confectionery industry about the 12.5 per cent VAT rate which puts the industry at a competitive disadvantage compared with operations in the UK and Northern Ireland.  The newspaper industry also is subject to severe competition from British newspapers which operate under more favourable economic conditions.  Last year we discussed the rate of VAT on newspapers but no changes were made in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that this Finance Bill was pro-enterprise but there are very few examples in the Bill to show that.  I see a contradiction in the approach to enterprise.  County enterprise boards &mdash; I am a member of such a board &mdash; operate with a certain degree of success.  They act as a launching pad for service and manufacturing industries which in the past would not have been entertained by the State agencies responsible for industrial development.  On the other hand the enterprise allowance scheme which gave many unemployed people the lift off to start a business and supported them in its first year of operation has been suspended and I have been informed it is unlikely to be reintroduced.  It is regrettable that a scheme that encouraged <Col N="1245" /> people to go into business has been discontinued.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has written to all the local authorities asking them to ensure they get value for money. I support this initiative.  We are all aware that the implementation of EC legislation is being foisted on local authorities but no finance has been provided for this. The classic example is the Abattoirs Act. During recent years the county council in my area has had to spend £1 million in implementing the provisions of legislation, such as the Abattoirs Act, the health and safety Act, the maintenance of courthouses and so on.  It did not have to do this in the past but finance was not provided for this additional role.  It is regrettable that it is reducing the asset base of local authorities.</P>
    <P>In my county council area we are probably losing £300,000 per annum on the operation of the refuse service but the greatest barrier to implementing an alternative system is Fianna Fáil councillors.  I suggest the Minister should tell all Fianna Fáil councillors that he wants local authorities to get value for money.  The onus rests on all county councillors to act responsibly instead of sneaking a mean political advantage, as happened in this situation.  If the Minister wants local authorities to behave responsibly he should instruct members of his own party accordingly instead of expecting certain councillors to accept such responsibilities.</P>
    <P>During my contribution to the budget debate I said I was bitterly disappointed at the allocation of £15 million for county roads.  Whereas residential property tax generated a great deal of opposition in urban areas, where it was rightly condemned, the state of county roads is the contentious issue in rural areas.  There is hardly a councillor who has not been approached at functions by people who are angry at the damage caused to their cars by the potholes.  The general public has run out of tolerance and is extremely concerned about the country roads.  In my area we were allocated £570,000 from the £15 million but there was a sleight-of-hand because we finished up with £40,000 <Col N="1246" /> less in our block grant for regional and county roads.  Is that not a three card trick job?  The impression is being given that the council will get an extra £570,000 over what it got in the previous year but it ends up with £40,000 less.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, well in the European elections. It is reported that with the support of the European Union there is £31 million at national level to be allocated subject to certain restrictions for county roads and we await with interest the announcement of the allocations.  It is anticipated that my county council will get an additional £1 million which I am sure we will put to effective use.  The sooner the announcement is made the better.  Our party leader proposes that in relation to county roads we need to adopt a five year strategy and I fully support that.  It is estimated that it will cost £24 million to bring the county roads in my area up to reasonable standard and the allocation of £4.5 million this year will be a step in the right direction, although it is not enough.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic; we will not be given £24 million but given that funding has been allocated in a piecemeal way there should be a five year strategy which would allow us to plan ahead.  We should eliminate the &ldquo;drip feed&rdquo; system whereby the local authorities have to speculate when discussing the estimates and how much they will be allocated.  If it is possible to map out a five year strategy for the National Development Plan it should be possible to do the same in regard to county roads.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to extend the urban renewal scheme which was introduced originally by John Boland.  This scheme has been a breath of fresh air and injected new life into many towns, including Portlaoise and Limerick.  I would like to see more towns included in the scheme.  I am thinking of towns in my own county such as Newcastle West, Rathkeale and Kilmallock, which are steeped in history.  If some encouragement was given towns such as these would be given a major lift. It is only when we canvass at election time that we become aware of the number of derelict sites and buildings in small <Col N="1247" /> towns.  I encourage the Minister to expand the number of towns included in the urban renewal scheme as the cost involved in stimulating activity would not be excessive.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate and I hope to have another opportunity on Committee Stage to express reservations about certain aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for Finance for bringing forward a Bill which will greatly enhance business confidence, particularly in the small business sector.  There have been significant changes in taxation which will benefit taxpayers.</P>
      <P>This Bill must be seen in the context of the 1992 and 1993 Finance Acts.  The Minister is consistent in the financial management of the economy.  The Bill must also be seen in the context of the Government's overall economic strategy as enshrined in the National Development Plan and the need to restrain public spending, to maintain strict budgetary discipline and to enter into responsible wage agreements under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>Accountants and accountancy bodies will acknowledge that the system is now more simple with the result that there is a greater degree of tax compliance.  In 1992 and 1993 the Minister was attacked from all sides for introducing measures which were considered too severe but the system is working reasonably well and is being improved all the time.</P>
      <P>In relation to the report of the task force on small businesses it is clear that the Government has put small businesses and their vital role in job creation to the forefront of its economic strategy. I welcome the measures in the Bill to improve the performance of small businesses. It is clear from the latest ESRI report and reports emanating from small firms and businesses that confidence is picking up and an economic recovery is under way.  Small businesses have reported an increase in orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to maintain this momentum <Col N="1248" /> and for the Government to remove as many obstacles as possible in the way of small businesses.  Measures have been taken but we must go further.  It is critical that long term finance at cheap rates is provided to allow small businesses to expand and develop and create extra jobs.  When one considers the number of jobs dependent on small businesses it is easy to see how important it is to provide as many resources as possible for this sector.</P>
    <P>The taxation changes in this Bill will improve significantly the position of the individual taxpayer.  Personal allowances have been increased by £350 for a married couple and £175 for a single person while the standard rate tax band has been widened substantially from £15,350 to £16,400 for a married couple and from £7,675 to £8,200 for a single person.  The Minister has been saying for some time that if we want to reduce taxation for the PAYE taxpayer in particular we must broaden the standard rate tax band.  The Minister wants to continue this process and increase personal allowances to eliminate poverty traps and the disincentives to take up work.  Many arguments have been put forward as to why people on social welfare are reluctant to return to work.  The only way to tackle this problem is to reduce taxation and to allow as many people as possible to pay tax at the standard rate.  The Minister made a significant advance in pursuing that strategy in this Bill.  I also welcome the reduction in marginal relief from 48 per cent to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>There has been much hypocrisy from the Opposition benches on the question of tax reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Progressive Democrats, the so-called mould breakers who made tax reform the cornerstone of their economic strategy, were hysterical when property taxes or rates were mentioned. The Opposition parties should be honest and spell out what they mean by tax reform and a proper system of local government funding.  Fine Gael, the Progressive <Col N="1249" /> Democrats and Democratic Left all said in their manifestos that they are in favour of a proper system of local taxation and broadening the tax base.</P>
      <P>For far too long politicians have been pulling the wool over people's eyes and pretending that tax reform equates with tax reductions.  If we want to reduce taxation we must change the existing system. This would have implications for certain sectors or individuals who benefit from significant reliefs.  If we wish to move in a certain direction we will have to curtail some reliefs but that is the choice we must make.  We will have to listen to the people to see if they are anxious to make this choice but we cannot pretend that we can continue to reduce taxation without eradicating reliefs.  I am talking in particular about VHI and mortgage interest relief.</P>
      <P>Politically, the reintroduction of rates is not on.  It must be accepted, therefore, that only a certain degree of progress can be made in reducing income tax.  The Progressive Democrats' attack last week on the Taoiseach, who was making an intelligent and straightforward point about our taxation system, calls into question its sincerity about broadening the tax base and reducing taxation.  Only a few options are open to us &mdash; to take in tax through income taxation, through VAT or indirect taxation, by way of property-based tax or as some form of rates. We have a huge debt that acts as a major constraint on what we can do from year to year.  We still have a significant borrowing requirement each year which must be serviced and taking into account annual budgetary constraints, there is little room for manoeuvre.  The other side of the coin is that there are increased demands from both Opposition and Government benches and the spending departments for increased expenditure on health, education and social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the merited, badly needed exemption for people on unemployment benefit who are participating in systematic short-time working arrangements. In that respect, the taxation of unemployment benefit and disability <Col N="1250" /> benefit could have a too severe impact on many people affected.</P>
    <P>Although we are removing tax reliefs, perhaps we should assess their value as an instrument for developing certain sectors of the economy.  The Commission on Taxation and other committees which met to consider the reform of taxation came down heavily against reliefs and called for their elimination.  We should take a more flexible approach and look at sectors of the economy which could benefit from the application of tax reliefs, specifically the child care area.  The second report of the Commission on the Status of Women dealt with child care and the employment opportunities it represents for thousands of women.  It made a clear case for providing tax incentives, particularly where people are providing child care facilities that involve a significant capital cost.  The Minister should look carefully at that recommendation.</P>
    <P>That report also included a minority report dealing with tax relief for people who engage child minders.  Many people are employed in that capacity on an irregular and informal basis.  If there were generous tax reliefs child minding could be brought into the formal economy.  This would generate a considerable number of jobs.  Young couples have drawn my attention to the need to do something to alleviate the cost of child minding. Generous tax reliefs in this area would, in addition, to helping the parents involved give child care the recognition and respect it deserves.  There is a strong economic argument, too, in favour of such relief because, although there might be some loss to the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone, it would give a badly needed stimulus to the child care area and generate considerable returns to the State.</P>
    <P>I regret the decision to increase the thresholds on medical expenses relief.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister put an extra tax on cigarettes and direct the resulting yield towards cancer research?  Cancer remains a major killer in Irish society?  There has been significant progress in the world generally and in our own country in the area of research into the causes of cancer etc.  This has resulted in increased chances of survival.  Research is vital because it allows the medical profession to detect cancers early, to treat them, and where possible, to cure them.  I am not sure that we are giving to research the level of assistance that is needed. People complain about taxation on the &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo;.  The correlation between cigarette smoking and cancer is recognised. If the extra taxation on cigarettes was allocated specifically to aid cancer research, there would be a broad degree of acceptance for it.  Prior to the budget, Ogra Fianna Fáil, a body with which I am associated, produced a policy document making that suggestion.  That was from young people who feel strongly about this whole area.  It is the kind of innovative thinking we need and that the Minister should consider seriously.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increased incentives for the film industry, an important area which can enhance the profile and prestige of our country, create a significant number of jobs and generate considerable revenue.  There will be many spin-offs if we can develop our film industry.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is doing a significant job in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the proposals in this Finance Bill which enhance measures taken in earlier Finance Acts.  The arts is an area which requires imaginative and generous treatment by the Exchequer.  Studies carried out in the UK show that, pound for pound, the arts give a better return for public expenditure, assist urban renewal and give a high profile and prestige to areas and cities.  Generous taxation measures would not be wasted on the film industry or on the broader arts area. In Cork there is a thriving arts infrastructure <Col N="1252" /> which gives a considerable degree of employment, retaining many graduates in the area where they find fruitful activity in the arts, in film, theatre, etc.  That is something the Minister should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal measures are also welcome.  The designated areas status has improved many areas throughout the country and in the main cities.  The city of Cork has benefited substantially with considerable urban renewal taking place in the heart of the city.  The development in Cork is taking place mainly because people are striving to meet the deadlines of the old scheme.  I look forward to the implementation of the new scheme which will come into effect on 1 August and ask the Minister, together with the Minister for the Environment, to follow through with its implementation and ensure that in all areas designated for urban renewal relief the local authority selects a team of officials to act in an integrated manner to sell the area and ensure it is developed. It is pointless for one arm of the State to put forward an incentive package if it is not followed through down the line.  It is essential to have a more integrated approach by local authorities whose departments should work as a team to sell the scheme to developers and businesses and ensure it is successful.  Such co-ordination was lacking in some previous schemes.  I hope the new measures are taken on board in Cork and will have a significant impact on the city in future.</P>
    <P>I referred to the overall impact of the Finance Bill.  The decision on vehicle registration tax has had a dramatic impact on car sales which is a useful barometer in terms of increased consumer spending and economic progress.  It is clear that we are on the right road, the ERSI report paints the picture.</P>

It follows in the path of similar Bills which I referred to as being bandaged.  It proposes improvements in areas which do not require improvement whereas areas crying out for improvement are being ignored.  We have a mish-mash of the thinking of the Government parties.  There is bound to be confusion.  Deputy Martin is proud of the performance of this Administration but I warn him not to be overly possessive and proud in that respect having regard to the questions raised and the trauma suffered by backbenchers in the two Government parties since the budget.  I will not go into the details because I do not wish to hurt members of the Government.</P>

      <P>Neither party is willing to claim full responsibility for its introduction, but the reverse is the case in respect of other provisions.</P>
      <P>Let us consider how some of the proposals in the budget are now being put into statutory form.  I pity the poor PAYE worker.  After the Minister for Finance made his budget speech in January we heard Members on the Government benches proclaim how benign the budget was in relation to PAYE workers.  PAYE workers and their spouses looked forward to the Finance Bill as a progressive instrument to lift their taxation burden and cast out the demons which had bedevilled them for some time.  What did they get?  On 5 April they received their tax free allowance certificates from the Revenue Commissioners, acting in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the budget and the Finance Bill, which revealed that instead of relief there would be more damnation, hassle and an increased burden of taxation.  That was an amazing performance in the light of the impression the Government had succeeded in giving at the time the budget was announced &mdash; that it was a benign Government, willing, anxious and eager to help those unfortunate people carrying a huge burden of taxation.  The hopes raised then were quickly dashed.  I was surprised that not a backbencher from either party cried out in alarm at what was being done to the unfortunate PAYE sector, for example, in regard to the provisions for mortgage interest relief and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 deals with a revision of medical insurance relief.  I consider it desirable that people take out insurance to protect them in the event of illness, but obviously some Member opposite does not think so and proposed that the relief provided up <Col N="1255" /> to now be narrowed and phased out.  That is regrettable because it hits people when they are most vulnerable &mdash; the elderly and families with members who are ill. This is a peculiar measure from a progressive Government.  The proposal in respect of unimbursed medical expenses is dealt with by this progressive, caring and considerate Government in section 8 where it proposes to shift the thresholds in such a way as to make life more difficult &mdash; from £150 to £300 in respect of families and from £50 to £150 in respect of individuals. I do not know the intention of the person responsible for that proposal but obviously he or she did not intend to make life easier for unfortunate people in need of medical attention.  It will hit hardest at old age pensioners.  The over 65 age group is not a huge lobby and it no longer seems to matter.  Indeed it is viewed with suspicion by the Government. Whether those older people become ill, or take out medical insurance the Government taxes them.  Likewise death taxes are increased.  I do not understand that extraordinary attitude from the Government.  Numerous people have asked me why the Government targets that group of people.  How did they offend the Government?  Why did the Government decide to reduce the allowance in respect of medical insurance and at the same time raise the medical expenses threshold?  That it was not a benign move intended to help the people concerned, it was to take back with one hand what the Minister attempted to give with the other.  That is a cold and callous attitude, not one of a caring Government. I was surprised and upset there was no public outcry about it.  There was a time when a public outcry was common, but that has passed.  There is certainly no outcry from Opposition backbenchers because they agree with taking money from old age pensioners and making life more difficult for them.</P>

I do not know if the scripts get mixed up.  I would have thought that the opposite would have been the case, that the Minister would have made a statement and that the Taoiseach would have said it was not discussed in Cabinet, but the lines got crossed.  A Government with such a large majority should not flounder, if it wishes to make an announcement it should do so.  It should not skulk in committees and try to introduce a system which it does not have the guts to introduce in the House, especially in the run up to an election.  The Government should have the courage of its convictions and be forthcoming about its proposals.  When the Opposition and the public have heard them they will be better informed as to who to vote for.  The public wish to know a party's proposals in advance of an election. Many measures introduced by the Government during the last 12 months were not outlind before the people voted in the last general election and the public are upset about that.  It will be more upset <Col N="1258" /> on the next occasion it votes.  The public believed the promise made by both parties in Government in the run up to the last general election and voted accordingly, but it cannot be blamed for that. The fact it was misled is incidential, neither of the Government parties is concerned about that but the public are upset.  At this stage the Government should be forthcoming about its proposals. It would be desirable if it had information at its disposal in respect of the Government's proposals for the new taxation system or poll tax in advance of the local and European elections to be held in June and the by-elections which will be held whenever the Government makes a decision.  The public should also know which party in Government is sponsoring that proposal.</P>

This matter was contentious at the last general election when the dirty dozen was introduced. There are now a dirty dozen and a half, six were removed and 12 introduced in their place.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has the co-ordinating responsibility for the local development programme for which a provision of £1,263 million was included in the National Development Plan.  My Department has direct responsibility for the disadvantaged areas element of the programme and for the Community Employment Programme, formerly CEDP-SES, in so far as it relates to the areas designated as disadvantaged under the local development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions are expected to be completed with the European Commission on the Community Support Framework by the end of this month.  The framework will set out the broad national and sectoral strategies to be funded from the Structural Funds.  The <i>pro-rata</i> adjustments proposed by the Government have been agreed by the Commission.  It is clear that the Government and the Commission have agreed virtually all of the projects to be funded.  The expected strong growth in the economy will enable virtually all of the projects to be completed within the period of the National Plan without imposing any additional burden on taxpayers.  Discussions about <Col N="1261" /> the operational programmes, which set out the measures and objectives in more detail, are continuing in tandem and the intention is that they will be approved following the adoption of the Community Support Framework.</P>
    <P>Pending the completion of these discussions, I am not in a position to give specific details of the final allocations of funds under the local development programme. For example, the discussions with the Commission Services suggest that the Community Employment Programme while very relevant to local development initiatives, may be more appropriately included with other education and training measures in the Operational Programme on Human Resources.  Since the publication of the National Plan, the Government has decided to expand the numbers who may participate in the Community Employment Programme to almost double the number which were provided for in the National Development Plan.  As a consequence the financial estimate for the programme will change significantly over the plan estimate.  The programme will be co-financed by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Detailed discussions will be undertaken with the Commission Services in regard to the specific measures which will be funded under the local development programme.  Relevant to these discussions will be the Commission's proposals for Leader II and the measures which may be funded from this initiative.</P>
    <P>State funding for the local development programme of £90.63 million will co-finance initiatives in designated areas and the Community Employment Programme in these areas.</P>
    <P>My Department has the lead co-ordinating role in relation to the local development programme.  Elements of the programme such as county enterprise boards and urban renewal will be directed operationally, respectively by the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and the Environment.  The Community Employment Programme will be operated jointly by my Department and the Department of Enterprise and Employment through FAS.  The programme <Col N="1262" /> will be supported and monitored from a policy perspective, by the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development which reports to me.  All relevant Departments and agencies are represented on this committee.  The policy committee's role also includes assessment and review of other policy issues in so far as they impact on local development.  Financially, the programme will be monitored through the Community Support Framework monitoring system.</P>
    <P>The local development programme is already operational.  The objectives of the programme are to harness the potential which exists at local level to bring about social and economic development and to maximise this potential by putting in place a set of structures to facilitate this development.  This process is already being implemented.  A county enterprise board has been established for each county.  The areas to be targeted under the disadvantaged areas sub-programme have been designated and the complementary measures &mdash; the urban renewal scheme and the Community Employment Programme &mdash; have been announced.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that his reply highlights the incredibly complex process of local development and that there is need for some rationalisation of the way these programmes are agreed, put in place and run?  The Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of the Environment, various monitoring committees as well as committees at local level, county enterprise boards and project committees must fill in a variety of forms and make cases to each other in order to make progress.  Would the Taoiseach agree there is need for an urgent review of the way local development is put in place?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree and I do not accept that the process is particularly difficult.  It is very clear when you understand the structures.  The Central Review <Col N="1263" /> Committee which services the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has been in place for a long time and has worked very successfully.  Directly under that committee are what were known as the 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> companies, established a couple of years ago and targeted to areas of high long term unemployment, and these companies are operating very successfully. That concept has been expanded to other areas, bringing the number of companies to about 32.  There is a very clear line as to how the Central Review Committee fits into this process &mdash; it reports on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  The other areas are under the clear direction of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and FÁS is the operational agency dealing with these areas.  There are very clear lines as to how the programmes work.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach rereads the original reply he will clearly see the impossible complexity for any lay person outside this House and outside his Department of trying to understand precisely where responsibility lies for any given decision.

      <P>I listened closely to the Taoiseach's reply on the <i>pro rata</i> cut of £800 million.  He said that a cut of £800 million was being made but that all the projects would be completed within the time available.  From where will this £800 million come?  Did I hear the Taoiseach suggest that it would come from tax buoyancy, that invention of his predecessor, the former Deputy Charles J. Haughey? In other words, PAYE taxpayers will be denied cuts in taxation that they would otherwise have enjoyed in order to make up the difference between what the Government promised they would get from Europe and the £800 million less they will receive.  The price of the Government's pride is £800 million more in taxation than would have otherwise been the case.</P>

Why was the support framework not published on 8 April in accordance with the regulations? Will the Taoiseach agree that Deputy De Rossa's question refers to the <Col N="1267" /><i>National Development Plan 1994-99</i> and the figure we are talking about for those years is £5.9 billion and not £7.2 billion?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what point Deputy Harney is trying to make about these regulations and 8 April.  We have been involved in negotiations with the Commission for quite some time and it is quite likely that ours will be the second national plan on which agreement will be reached.  We are not lagging behind, as people would suggest, and we have agreement on all the major issues.</P>
      <P>On the period of the national plan, it has been clear from the beginning that the last budget prospective ended on 31 December 1992.  The money about which we have been talking since applies from 1 January 1993 and that is the figure on which the original allocations were based.  The period in question has not changed and neither has the money agreed on last October, so I do not understand what further information Deputy Harney is requesting.  I will try to facilitate her if I can determine what information she wants.</P>

If there is an £800 million shortfall, at least, the same plan cannot be implemented without some other adjustments.

When I asked for and was granted my own personal representation I told the Beef Tribunal I would pay that bill.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir Patrick Mayhew's speech at a meeting of the Foreign Policy Association in New York on 12 April was a useful and constructive contribution to our collective efforts towards the development of the peace process and an agreed political settlement in the spirit of the principles contained in the Joint Declaration.</P>
      <P>Both Governments share the determination that the use or threat of violence will not prevail.  The position of the two Governments on violence is clear and unambiguous.  The Joint Declaration has opened up a new avenue, by providing an honourable means for all sides to take the first step towards a lasting peace and an agreed just settlement in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I agree with Sir Patrick's statement that ending of the armed conflict which has so afflicted the lives of so many in Northern Ireland over the past 25 years is not going to require any surrender.  In my Irish Association speech on 10 January I made the same point in the following terms:</P>
      <P>For over 20 years there has been a prolonged military stalemate that has stifled most of the possibilities for political and economic progress.  There are no military victories on either side, nor on the basis of past experience does any side have any reason to expect one.  It is generally agreed that there will be no surrender on any side, Loyalist, Republican or by the British or Irish Governments, and surrender terms are not acceptable to any side. It is totally unrealistic for anyone to expect peace on that basis.  There can only be a mutual process of demilitarisation through confidence-building on all sides.</P>
      <P>An abandonment of violence in favour of full democratic engagement does not imply victory or defeat for any side.</P>
      <P>Cherished principles and aspirations would not require adjustment or relinquishment. Only the method of pursuing these demands would change in the context of a clear commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and to the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The security forces on both sides of the <Col N="1282" /> Border will continue to search for illegal arms and weapons, both now and after a cessation of violence.  A comprehensive process of demilitarisation on all sides will be essential if the confidence-building necessary for peace is to take place. That process will also include the withdrawal of the British army from the streets of Northern Ireland.  The only condition for full participation in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is a complete and permanent cessation of violence.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to express my grave concern and condemnation of a series of recent brutal and indiscriminate sectarian murders by Loyalist paramilitary organisations, which have been the agency responsible for most deaths in Northern Ireland since 1992.  Since the beginning of this year, they have been responsible for eight out of the 11 murders committed.  The Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, pointed out last Saturday that, of the total 137 charged with terrorist offences so far this year, the great majority, 87 were Loyalist, reflecting the increased activity of the Loyalist paramilitaries.  I would call on the authorities responsible for security in the North to step up their protection of vulnerable Nationalist areas, but it would be reasonable for those providing such protection to expect that in that situation they would be free from attack.</P>
    <P>By and large, I believe that those closest to the communities from which paramilitary organisations spring are best placed to express the revulsion of all decent people at such acts.  In that regard, I welcome the forthright comments of councillor Michael McGimpsey and of the Archbishop of Armagh, Dr. Robin Eames, who has called on the Loyalist paramilitaries to become part of the movement towards peace.  The Loyalist paramilitaries have no vestige of justification either, under the Joint Peace Declaration, for any continuation of violence. The declaration states, not only that the British Government will uphold the democratic wish of a greater number of people of Northern Ireland on the <Col N="1283" /> issue of whether they prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland, but I also solemnly state in the declaration that it would be wrong to attempt to impose a united Ireland, in the absence of the freely given consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  The Loyalist organisations know as well that, towards the end of the same paragraph 5 of the declaration, I have pledged the Irish Government to respect the civil rights and religious liberties of both communities, in terms very similar to those which they set out themselves.</P>
    <P>As follows from what I stated on Saturday, when I spoke in favour of the indefinite continuation of the right to dual citizenship in the North, their British citizenship is under no threat from the Government and people of this State, either now or any time in the future.</P>
    <P>Nor is there any question of using a majority in the island as a whole to override the constitutional wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.  Indeed, even Sinn Féin at its Árd Fheis accepted the principle that it would be wrong to coerce Northern Protestants into a united Ireland.  As I stressed in the House yesterday, any future accommodation must be based on agreement and consent in which the rights and participation of both communities must be guaranteed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's view that the Loyalists would give up their violence if the Provisional IRA were to permanently cease their violence?  The Taoiseach said that where the security forces go into areas to protect nationalists they should not be vulnerable to attack and would he clearly indicate that they should not be vulnerable to attack in any circumstances, in any part of Northern Ireland, from either side?  Would he clarify his reference to British citizenship not being under threat now or in the future? Does that guarantee apply also in the circumstances he was envisaging in his speech on Sunday last when he spoke about a Government of an all-Ireland State in which a majority and minority in Northern Ireland would have 30 per cent <Col N="1284" /> of the seats?  Does he envisage that, in that circumstance, they would retain their right to British citizenship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Deputy read my speech he would have seen, quite clearly that that is intended to be carried through in the event of an all-Ireland Parliament, a sovereign united Ireland, or an agreed Ireland and that that citizenship should be protected.  On the question of security forces protecting Nationalist areas, they are entitled to expect that they would not be attacked by anybody; that is the rule of law as it applies there and here.  What was the Deputy's third question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the first one the Taoiseach answered.  Does the Taoiseach expect that the Loyalists will give up violence permanently if the Provos do so?  In regard to the security forces going into Nationalist areas to protect Nationalists, the Taoiseach said they should be free from attack.  Will he confirm that they should be free from attack anyway, that they should not be safe from attack merely when protecting particular individuals? My final question was in regard to British citizenship and his reference to the present majority community in Northern Ireland being able, in any circumstances, to protect and preserve their British citizenship.  I understand the correct term is that they are subjects &mdash; that is the way they understand it &mdash; rather than citizens of the United Kingdom; the United Kingdom does not have citizenship in the same sense as have we.  Is the Taoiseach talking there about simply a right to use that type of passport or is he talking about other rights of a territorial kind associated with their being subjects of Her Majesty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Bruton is asking if they can hold onto their British passports, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what other aspects Deputy Bruton may have <Col N="1285" /> in mind.  Any civil or religious rights, of course, would have to be guaranteed either way.  We have made that clear, whether talking about Nationalists in a minority in Northern Ireland or Unionists in a minority within an all-Ireland context when the same guarantees of rights and religious liberties would have to apply.  In regard to my view as to whether Loyalists would give up violence if the Provisional IRA ceased their violence, my view is that they would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume this 30 per cent seat scenario the Taoiseach put forward is a Government proposal with which the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is in agreement and I hope it will be established that the Tánaiste did agree to it.  Assuming that it has been agreed and happens, is that actually predicted in view of the fact that the Taoiseach has said that people there could preserve their British citizenship in a form of joint sovereignty in Northern Ireland?  Is that what the Taoiseach is talking about as his long term goal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about joint sovereignty or any other specific proposal.  These are matters for negotiation. There would be no need for a talks process were we to negotiate in public and across the floor of the House. These are all options to be discussed which hopefully will lead to an overall settlement.  There are no conditions attached to what debate will take place within the talks process.  Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that is the basis for the talks process.  Clearly everything can be on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that he is giving the impression to some people that he is developing a habit of throwing out a half-baked idea that appears to be very detailed but, when asked a question about it he cannot answer and says that is all subject to negotiation?  What does the Taoiseach envisage in terms of a constitutional arrangement when he spoke about this 30 per cent of the seats scenario?  Is it <Col N="1286" /> joint sovereignty?  Is it a sovereign united Ireland or is it some other form of hybrid we have not yet had explained to us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not indulge in Deputy Bruton's habit of throwing out ten different ideas a day.  Had the Deputy read and studied my speech he would have seen it was clear from where the idea had come.  On the question of which option I might pursue in relation to it, clearly these are matters for discussion when we get all the parties around the table to discuss how we can work out a future accommodation for the two traditions on this island.  If Deputy Bruton thinks I am going to put forward one option as my priority, I can tell him emphatically I will not do so.  That will be a matter for discussion within the talks process.  I hope all parties will get around the table to try to work out how the two communities can live together, how we can take violence out of society for good and how, within a peaceful environment, we can plan for a better Ireland for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be forgiven for commenting that this reminds me of the days when bishops used to throw in the ball at all-Ireland matches and walk off the field.  Will the Taoiseach deal with reality as opposed to fantasy politics.  He said the only condition for participation in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is a complete and permanent renunciation of violence and will it be possible for a person to permanently and completely renounce violence and not be disarmed either voluntarily or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made my position clear in my reply, and on numerous occasions in this House.  If Deputy McDowell chooses to go into fantasy land, that is his choice but what I have been dealing with over the past 18 months in this area are practicalities, addressing the matter in a pragmatic way, not in the way some people address that very complex problem.  I have said clearly that the condition for Sinn Féin participating in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation <Col N="1287" /> is a real and permanent cessation of violence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear the Taoiseach's reply on whether it is expected the IRA will have to disarm. Perhaps the Minister will give us the benefit of his views on that issue.  Will he indicate the basis on which he believes the Loyalist paramilitaries will stop their killing if the IRA stop as the statistics read out by the Taoiseach indicate that the Loyalists are now more active in the killing business than the IRA?  It is clear to most observers that the paramilitaries are reacting as much to what they see as the perceived threat of a united Ireland as they are to the violence of the IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what Deputy De Rossa said.  If he has good advice to give I would be glad to accept it. There cannot be a permanent cessation of violence if they do not lay down their arms.  That is elementary and does not need to be answered.  My view, on the best advice available to me, is that if Provisional IRA violence ceases Loyalists violence will cease when they get guarantees concerning the rights they expect, expressed in paragraph 5 of the declaration.  The Deputy should study the declaration and if he has a different view or different advice I would be glad to hear from him tomorrow morning.</P>

I take the Taoiseach's point that on a cessation of violence <Col N="1289" /> it would have to lay down its arms.

      <P>Following from Deputy O'Keeffe's question, the Taoiseach said that a permanent cessation of violence meant giving up arms, laying down arms or handing them in.  How can anyone do that without surrendering?  The definition of &ldquo;surrendering&rdquo; in any dictionary is to hand over, to give up, to yield or to capitulate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Harte did not listen to my response.  I made it clear that an abandonment of violence in favour of full democratic engagement does not imply victory or defeat for any side.  Cherished <Col N="1290" /> principles and aspirations would not require adjustment or relinquishment. Only the method of pursuing these demands would change in the context of a clear commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and the democratic process.  That is clear and simple.  I said on numerous occasions in this House that we want a real and permanent cessation of violence for participation in the forum. I went further and said that even if there were words, phrases or a sentence or two in the Joint Declaration with which people had difficulty a real and permanent cessation of violence remained the entry passport to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that it is very difficult to accept into constitutional politics persons who have been engaged in violence for 25 years unless their armaments are disposed of in a verifiable way through an amnesty or whatever?  Second, it is unhelpful to use words such as &ldquo;demilitarisation&rdquo;<Col N="1291" /> in the context of the activities of the British Army and the paramilitaries. The British Army is the legitimate army of Britain and Northern Ireland.  We cannot compare the activities of both and use the same terminology. I am surprised that the Tánaiste agreed to guarantee 30 per cent of the seats in Government to those from Northern Ireland.  I would have assumed that came from the Mansergh word-processor to appease the party troops&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 10, 12, 16, 32, 41, 48, 71, 83 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>At the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference, which is to take place within the next week, I shall discuss with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how the two Governments can best take forward the peace process initiated by the Joint Declaration, and promote political progress.</P>
      <P>We are determined to pursue a lasting political settlement through dialogue across all three strands and building on the achievements of the Joint Declaration. We would like to see such dialogue get underway as soon as possible. It is, however, a political reality that the rivalry and pressures of the European elections seem to be an added obstacle in the way of the Unionist parties returning to the table.  I hope the situation will improve once the elections are out of the way.</P>
      <P>We also wish future dialogue to be as comprehensive as possible.  The Joint Declaration states that democratically mandated parties, which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods, will be free to participate fully in democratic politics and join in dialogue in due course on the way ahead.  The manner in which this would be done has also been set out clearly by both Governments.</P>
      <P>It is up to the Republican leadership to decide whether they will agree to a total cessation of violence, thereby opening the way for the processes envisaged in the declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no change in the consistent position of the Government that agreement in Ireland must be pursued and established by exclusively peaceful, democratic means and that, consequently, <Col N="1295" /> there should be no negotiation with Sinn Féin-IRA on the basis of the &ldquo;armed struggle&rdquo;.  Respect for the democratic mandate cannot be a matter of mere tactical choice, and we cannot accept that it may be supplanted by recourse to violence, whenever that appears more expedient.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration removes the last vestige of justification for resort to violence. I hope that the Republican movement will heed the unmistakeable wishes of the people, North and South, which are clearly for peace and the pursuit of an honourable accommodation through the political processes which are now available.</P>
    <P>A cessation of violence would transform the political landscape and greatly enhance the prospects for a successful outcome to negotiations.  We have also, however, made clear that no party can have a veto on progress, and that continued recourse to violence should not be allowed to block the quest for agreement.</P>
    <P>In the absence of progress among the political parties, the two Governments have a responsibility to do everything in their power to advance the prospects of agreement.  Officials are currently engaged in intensive discussions of ideas and proposals on various aspects of a possible future agreement, building on the Joint Declaration and the three-strand process.  New arrangements could include devolved structures with widespread support throughout the community, which is a shared policy objective of both Governments under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It must be recognised however that this could be achieved only with the support and cooperation of the political parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These discussions include matters which are properly for decision by the two Governments in strand three, and a framework which we hope might guide future negotiations with the political parties towards a successful conclusion.  It would, however, be inappropriate at this stage for me to go into details of these ongoing discussions, or of the structures <Col N="1296" /> which might be envisaged to enhance cooperation between the two Governments and to develop closer North-South relationships.  The Secretary of State and I will review progress at the forthcoming meeting of the conference and give directions for further work.  We are determined to press this forward as speedily as possible.  An agreed framework document of the kind we are working on could make a valuable contribution towards future talks, since agreement between the two Governments would offer the best possible basis for the search for agreement between the political parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Tánaiste consulted? Did he agree with the Taoiseach's detailed sketching of the arrangements for the government of a united Ireland, including a provision for 30 per cent of seats in the government to be allocated to Northern Ireland and that these would be further subdivided on confessional lines between Catholics and Protestants?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy realises that the nationalist aspiration to unity by peaceful means and by agreement is entirely legitimate and I do not share the view that any mention of it must be deemed to be politically incorrect.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was describing his vision of one possible way in which the fundamental principles of agreement and consent might be met in such an eventuality. His central message was that agreement, consent and full political participation are essential in all circumstances. Given the constant references to fear of coercion by the Unionist community, the Taoiseach was acing within his powers to describe his vision of one possibility which might arise if we could bring negotiations to a conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will note the care with which the Tánaiste read his reply and will infer from it that he was not consulted by the Taoiseach before that comment was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the approximate timescale for the presentation of the framework document <Col N="1297" /> for the resumption of talks?  When does the Tánaiste expect the Irish Government will table its proposals in Strand Two with regard to North-South institutions?  Does he see merit in initiating some form of low level discussions between the parties in Northern Ireland on matters upon which agreement is possible in the short term, for example, the outlines of a bill of rights, upon which in theory to date, all parties are agreed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the timetable, as I said in my reply the Irish Government is willing and available and would respond tomorrow morning if the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland were available to engage in dialogue.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the significant progress made by the liaison group on the framework document in recent weeks and it is my strong desire that we maintain that momentum.  Officials on both sides are well aware of this.  It is the wish also of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I hope that within a matter of weeks, we can reach agreement on the framework document.  The proposals for strand two will be incorporated within the framework document and we hope to make progress on that.  I am available at all times to discuss with the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland &mdash; the Unionist parties and the SDLP &mdash; a bill of rights, a covenant or any proposal on ongoing difficulties that would assist in making progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Tánaiste said the Taoiseach was speaking in a personal capacity last Saturday.  Is it desirable that members of the Government &mdash; whether at the top or the bottom of the pecking order &mdash; should express personal views rather than governmental views on a matter of this importance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his original reply the Tánaiste referred to new arrangements involving devolved structures for Northern Ireland being a matter of discussion between the two Governments at the moment.  Am I to take it that the devolution of authority we are talking about in that context is devolved power from the United <Col N="1298" /> Kingdom Parliament to Northern Ireland with Northern Ireland remaining part of the UK and we are not talking about joint authority or devolution from a United Ireland Parliament to Northern Ireland?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is well aware that party leaders, including the Taoiseach, myself, Deputies Bruton, Harney and De Rossa have on many occasions taken the opportunity to express views, for example, at the Irish Association which has been used to enhance the whole prospect of discussions on Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is not the first time the suggestion put out by the Taoiseach, has been made.</P>
      <P>All parties in this House have set out to allay fears &mdash; in particular the fear of coercion &mdash; the mistrust and misunderstandings of which there are many in Northern Ireland about the Government, politics in the South and our attitudes. It is reasonable for the Taoiseach or myself, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, to outline aspects of the generosity that can be expected in any negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of devolution in Northern Ireland, we cannot even get to the table.  Elections will also be held in Northern Ireland on 9 June and it is unlikely that there will be momentum in <Col N="1299" /> Northern Ireland before then.  The Unionist parties are fighting with one another for representation in the European Parliament.  Likewise, John Hume is hoping to regain his seat which he obviously will.  It is unlikely there will be any discussions on what institutional framework will be acceptable.  Since it was formed the Government has been reasonable in terms of what it is trying to establish, discussions, openness and firmly establishing the principle of consent. This time last year we were using words such as &ldquo;could&rdquo; or &ldquo;would&rdquo; and we set out to remove those obstacles.  At the conclusion of the last round of the three strand talks there were difficulties. The parties in Government here were facing an election and perhaps were not as forthcoming as they should have been. The situation is different now and we have tried to overcome the difficulties.  I would like to see those talks recommencing as quickly as possible.  The solution lies in the three strand talks process.  If we can remove violence from the equation the prospects would be better because, ultimately, it would be much easier to solve the conflict.</P>

As the Anglo-Irish Agreement provides for an examination of the feasibility of a bill of rights have the two Governments examined that question since the Anglo-Irish Agreement was accepted?

Agreement has not been reached but one would not expect this until one enters into negotiations.  For example, what new institutions will be required in breaking the impasse in Northern Ireland in terms of the aspirations of the Nationalist community on the one hand and the Unionist community on the other?  The two Governments are working on a framework document because of the difficulties we have encountered in bringing the constitutional parties to the table.  I would much prefer if the parties were at the table with us and making an input into the institutional framework which will be necessary.  That will be part of the framework document and I hope that both Governments, with the determination and momentum achieved in the context of the Downing Street Declaration, will come to an agreement on the document very soon.</P>

I got the impression from some of his public statements that the Minister agrees this is not the right focus and that we should be focusing on a practical step by step approach to agree what can be agreed rather than saying that everything must be agreed before we can agree on anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 24, 44 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The US Immigration Reform and Control Act, 1986, provides for a visa waiver pilot programme under which nationals of foreign countries with relatively low visa refusal and overstay rates are allowed to visit the US for up to 90 days without the need to obtain a visa in advance.  The operation of the pilot programme, which ends on 30 September 1994, will be reviewed by Congress before that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has not so far been admitted to the programme because we do not comply with the provision relating to visa refusals.  Under the terms of the 1986 <Col N="1303" /> Act, the refusal rate for non-immigrant visa applications in the previous two year period must be less than 2 per cent and less than 2.5 per cent in each of the two years.  While the refusal rate for Irish citizens has been reduced in recent years, it remains above the limits specified in the Act.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Congressmen Frank McCloskey and Ronald Machtley recently published a Bill which would amend the 1986 Act to ensure Ireland's inclusion in the pilot programme.  The Government is very anxious to secure Ireland's inclusion in the programme and we are lobbying actively, with our friends in Congress, in pursuit of this objective. We will do all we can to build support for the McCloskey-Machtley Bill to maximise its prospects of adoption before September. I intend to avail of every opportunity over the coming months to press our case for inclusion in the programme and it is my intention to have discussions with the US authorities at a high level on the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that two amendments have been tabled by Congressman McCloskey?  The purpose of one is to remove the need for Irish, Portuguese and Greek citizens to seek a visa while the purpose of the other is to waive this requirement for Irish citizens only as the refusal rate for Portuguese and Greek citizens is higher.  This year they expect to give out 80,000 B1 and B2 visas to Irish citizens.  Would the Tánaiste not agree, therefore, that the removal of the requirement for a visa will cut down on the great workload in the American Embassy and also save the time and trouble of 80,000 Irish citizens making applications?  In his lobbying will he raise two final points about visas?  An anomaly has arisen in regard to the Morrison visas whereby if Irish people discover they were actually born in England they are refused a visa from the Irish allocation, although residency in England may have been for only two or three weeks.  The second point relates to Irish university students who, having won their Morrison <Col N="1304" /> visas and having gone to activate them in the early part of their university career, cannot come back to Ireland because they are supposed to take up residency. Will the Minister secure some regulation to allow those students to finish their courses here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I can speak on this subject with a fair degree of experience.  The McCloskey-Machtley Bill is a limited one which will apply to Ireland only.  The three European Union countries currently excluded are Greece, Portugal and Ireland.  There have been previous attempts to amend the 1986 legislation and secure admission for all three countries. The chairman of the US House Emigration Committee, Congressman Mazzoli, tried in 1991 to have an amendment adopted.  He was, unfortunately, unsuccessful.  In fairness, it has to be said that the US Embassy has increased its staff massively to cope with the visa applications.  We will do everything possible. We have been successful in the past in relation to the Morrison visas and in this case it is hoped we can make progress as quickly as possible.  There is a problem in regard to Morrison visa applicants who were born in England or Northern Ireland.  We are trying to sort that out and are getting very healthy co-operation from the American Embassy.  In regard to students, I do not have the information in front of me, but I will get it and come back to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The killing of the Presidents <Col N="1305" /> of Rwanda and Burundi on 6 April unleashed a massive wave of violence in Rwanda in which it is reported that up to 20,000 people have been killed.  The Government is appalled at the atrocities that have been committed and is deeply concerned at the continuation of the violence. The Security Council of the United Nations has held consultations on Rwanda and is making every effort to facilitate the immediate ceasefire it has called for.  The Council has welcomed the willingness of the Organisation of African Unity to promote a ceasefire in Rwanda.</P>
      <P>The UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) was established in October last year to assist and monitor a peace agreement reached in Arusha between the Government and the Rwanda Patriotic Front.  UNAMIR has a force strength of 2,500 military personnel. The structure and mandate of the force is currently under review by the Security Council which is expected to consider shortly the recommendations of the force commander.</P>
      <P>The Government has already expressed its sorrow to the Belgian Government at the brutal killing of ten Belgian military personnel serving with UNAMIR, and I am sure the House would wish to join in this.</P>
      <P>The violence and chaos in Rwanda have prompted the forced evacuation of almost all members of the international community, including eight Irish citizens. I wish to thank our partners in the European Union, and in particular the Governments of Belgium and France, for their help.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the other members of the European Union have appealed to the opposing forces in Rwanda to bring the violence to an end and to resume negotiations on the basis of the principles in the Arusha agreement.  We will continue to support the efforts being made by the UN, by the Organisation of African Unity, and by the European Union to bring about an immediate ceasefire and a return to the negotiating table.</P>

What is the Minister saying in correspondence with the Secretary General of the United Nations about peace enforcement in that country?

      <P>Many of our officials were concerned last week and much work was done to ensure the safe evacuation of Irish nationals.  The problem in Rwanda is extremely complex and I am sure the Deputy, who has much experience of foreign affairs matters, is aware that it will not be solved in any simple manner.  The United Nations has a mission there.  The future of UNAMIR is under review by the Security Council.  Belgium has decided to withdraw some of its 450 troops serving with UNAMIR and that evacuation may begin today.  Our permanent representative at the United Nations knows and reflects the concern of the Irish people about the chaos and the carnage and the massacres going on in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, in fighting between the Government forces and the RPF.  Ireland's concern will be reflected by our permanent representative at the United Nations and we will continue, <Col N="1307" /> with our European Union partners, to assist in any way possible.  If there are methods of assistance we will not be found to have any shortcomings in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I dealt with aspects of the Finance Bill which affect the less well off.  One should not leave that subject without mentioning the taxation of benefits which can be very traumatic in some circumstances. Members of the Government must take collective responsibility and I am sure none would admit to being personally responsible for deciding to tax benefits. Was sufficient thought given to those at the receiving end of such changes?  I am disappointed the Government went down that road and carried out such an unseemly act on people who are frequently disadvantaged. The Minister of State who was in the House before Question Time did not know the rate of pay for an unemployed person who becomes ill in a year subsequent to a year of unemployment.  The new rate of pay for a person on unemployment assistance who submits sick certificates, whether in hospital or at home, introduced by this caring and compassionate Government will be £25 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much debate about the problem in respect of <i>pro rata</i> pensions. The National Pensions Board published its report, and in doing so it managed with great dexterity to circumvent some of the obstacles in its path.  However, it was not as successful as the Government who avoided dealing with that annoying and pertinent issue.  A large number of people has fallen victim to the Government's proposals in the 1988 Act to make pensions available to all on foot of contributions. <Col N="1368" /> A number of people are short of approximately five contributions to qualify for a pension and it is amazing that nothing has been done in that regard. It is argued that there is not sufficient funding but it has been forgotten that additional funds were taken into the system in 1988 to finance it.</P>
    <P>I want to cite the case of seriously disabled people who run small businesses. Because such people are not a burden on the State and are not included in the system the only concessions they receive are in respect of duty on wheelchairs. They are expected to fend for themselves in this big wide world as if they were able bodied.  I fail to understand how someone in this so-called caring and compassionate Government did not identify that such people are fending for themselves and that the Government should help them.  In many cases they barely eke out an existence.  They earn slightly over the income limit for a medical card &mdash; one does not have to earn a high income to exceed that limit &mdash; and they do not qualify for benefit because they have committed the sin of working for themselves.  Perhaps the Minister would examine that area in the future?</P>
    <P>Apropos legislation and how and when it should be changed, in the past few days we debated a Bill on local government reform.  I do not know what inspired the introduction of that legislation, but it reminded me of an ancient Roman in a period of depression who, having pawned the fiddle did not have anyone to perform and nothing to attend to.  The fire was burning, there was nothing to do and suddenly someone had the bright inspiration to introduce reform.  The theory of reform was embodied in that legislation, but there was no reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Finance Bill and I will take a global view of its thrust to implement the main provisions of the budget.  Job creation and a full frontal assault on unemployment should be the main focus of Government policy from now on.  When all the economic <Col N="1369" /> parameters and indicators are moving in the right direction, Government strategy should be targeted at a complementary fiscal and tax system which will encourage maximum job potential from the enormous investment available under the Structural Funds allocation.  Our tax structure penalises productive earnings and leaves other investments virtually unscathed.  It is important that the initial thrust of this policy which was evident in the budget focuses on low paid people as that would help those most likely to face serious unemployment traps.</P>
      <P>A number of measures were introduced in the budget in this regard including the abolition of health, employment and training levies for people earning less than £9,000 per annum.  Tax exemption limits were increased by £100 for each child and the marginal relief tax rate was reduced from 48 per cent to 40 per cent for those slightly above the income tax exemption limits.  Personal allowances were increased by £350 per couple.  Family income supplement is being increased and the children's allowance is being increased for families with three or more children.  I welcome the abolition of the 1 per cent levy for all income earners.  There is a widely held view that measures introduced on a temporary basis had an uncanny habit of assuming an unwanted permanence.  It is fundamental that this Bill marks the turning point of our economy.  From now on we will be talking in terms of how we should distribute the 5 per cent per annum annual growth rate in the economy which the ESRI review has forecast up to the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not surprising the Opposition has spent much time carping about minor nitpicking items.  The growth by 14 per cent in tax revenues in the first quarter of this year compared with 1993 indicates that the Government will have the scope to reduce the tax burden by the sound policy of creating more activity and expanding employment.  That is the only way forward. The issue with which the Government must deal in future budgets is unemployment.  I want the unemployment ratio, particularly the 50 per <Col N="1370" /> cent ratio in respect of long term unemployed, reduced.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, recently announced the community employment programme.  That is only one step in the armoury of policies we must implement to put our people back to work.</P>
    <P>I do not expect support from those who have accused us of being a tax and spend Government although they are the first people at local authority level who seek increased expenditure for every item on the agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>To those who have been eager to cut public sector employment claiming that it is a major burden on the Exchequer, I suggest that another way we can tackle unemployment is by allocating £1 million to each local authority to employ 100 workers from the dole queues at a cost of £10,000 per annum. The cost to the Exchequer of keeping a person on the dole is approximately £9,000 per annum when account is taken of lost income tax and PRSI payments. The net cost in the wage bill to the Exchequer of employing 3,500 additional local authority workers would be £1,000 per worker.  Based on 35 local authorities each employing 100 people the cost-benefit analysis would be positive.  Apart from savings in respect of unemployment benefit and the collection of revenue in the form of income tax and PRSI, those employees would represent a return to the old fashioned ways of working in local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, was a member of the local authority on which I serve.  This measure would involve a small contribution from three Departments, namely, the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment.  Each local authority would have a mandate to employ 100 outdoor staff on road works. Under the old system local authority workers operated within a six-mile radius.  If we cast our minds back 20 years <Col N="1371" /> we will recall there were very few potholes because there was an early detection system and people worked on the roads using shovels.  The problem arose because some people supported large cutbacks in local authority expenditure. I did not and will not support such measures.  I do not apologise for saying that additional people should be employed at local authority level.  That would lead to early detection of potholes, water cuts could be opened and this would provide a saving in terms of cost benefit analysis.  The employment fund of £1 million could be paid as a wage subsidy.  This would lead to sustainable employment and complement the community employment programme announced by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  It would provide jobs for some of the unemployed retrained through the CEP.</P>
    <P>The Opposition is aware that the Government will have the financial means to put the economy on a long term growth path.  The only matter about which I have heard the Opposition shout is RPT.  When has the Opposition demanded radical action to tackle unemployment? I have not heard a murmur about that in the past few months.  The Opposition cannot sing the same old tune of tax cuts financed by public expenditure cuts.  It must make up its mind if it wants services on the ground which will require increased expenditure or to reduce the tax bands to 20 per cent and 40 per cent which will improve the lot of the better off.  Those less fortunate would be left further behind, with no local authority housing building programme or initiatives to deal with waiting lists.  That may be what the Opposition wants but it is not what I want.  I was elected with a different mandate to ensure, among other matters, that medical card holders would not have to wait three and a half to four years for hip replacements.  I make no apology for supporting increased expenditure in those areas.  If I only hold office for three to four years and all I achieve as a TD is a contribution <Col N="1372" /> in that regard, my time in this House will have been well spent.</P>

If employment is increased by 25,000 per annum other measures will still be needed to help the long term unemployed.  Ministers who regularly attend meetings in Brussels will appreciate there is a European dimension to this problem.  In the European Union almost eight million people have been unemployed for a year or more.  We should ensure every possible policy measure is taken to reduce unemployment.</P>

      <P>Some people do not like to hear the truth.  Ten of those proposals were implemented in the budget.  Many reports gather dust but this one resulted in positive action within a few weeks of its presentation.  Half of the private sector employment is in our 150,000 to 160,000 firms and 80 per cent of such employment is in the service sector.  The total number of start-ups is equivalent to the European Union average.  Most people recognise that 40 per cent of new firms fail in the first five years of business.  It is important that the report focused on that area. Every measure should be taken to ensure that bureaucratic impediments are removed and that such businesses are not constrained by further bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have only to listen to the financial institutions to realise there is a place for a third banking force.  The Minister for Finance announced in the budget that a £100 million fund will be available from the ICC.  That announcement elicited a <Col N="1374" /> positive response from other financial institutions when they realised that a start up fund was available for certain businesses. Some of those institutions decided to match it.  That announcement was an important impetus and it highlights the importance of the involvement of a semi-State bank in the provision of funds for that sector.  However, one drawback is that funds are restricted to export oriented companies.  There is a large number of businesses in the service sector in my constituency.  I am not referring to solicitors' practices, although they provide services, but to companies involved in other areas.  Funds should be available for those.  If each of the 100,000 small firms in Ireland were encouraged to take on one person it would make a large dent on the dole queue.  The minimum £50,000 draw down figure is a little too high and should be considered.</P>
    <P>I welcome measures such as the £800 PAYE allowance to sons and daughters of families in the business area and the increase in VAT thresholds to £40,000.  I welcome the reintroduction of the cash receipt basis for payment of VAT.  While there is a ceiling of £250,000, nevertheless, it is an important measure for companies.  The decrease in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 27 per cent is equally important.  Other measures include the single tax clearance certificate and the single registration certificate and the measure whereby owners of companies may invest up to £250,000 in the company.  The real message from the report is that small businesses are the backbone of the economy.  The only way we will make a major impact on unemployment is by focusing our energies and attention on this sector and by providing the necessary inducements and encouragement for it to flourish.  Big businesses have had a monopoly of the AAA rate which gave them a 3 per cent or 4 per cent advantage over small businesses.  It is important that this rate be applied to small businesses to bring equity into the availability of finance.</P>
    <P>A matter which must be tackled by the Minister for Finance is the restriction on the availability of C2 certificates.  Very <Col N="1375" /> often people who provide one or two jobs, which are critical in rural areas, are inhibited because they are unable to obtain C2 certificates and, consequently, are unable to submit tenders for major sub-contracts that become available.</P>
    <P>The special allocation of £100 million to the health services will address the problem of the accumulated excess debt of health agencies.  This debt was funded by bank overdrafts and by running up extended periods of trade credit with suppliers.  This imposed a heavy burden on small family businesses who had to wait a long time for payment and on the agencies through payment of interest charges and an inability to secure the best value for goods and services.  The injection of £100 million into the service will enable the agencies to deal with banks and creditors on a normal commercial basis.  It will also assist traders and those seeking health board grants. It will enable agencies to operate more efficiently in their purchasing and finances.</P>
    <P>One of the important initiatives taken in 1993 by the Minister for Health was that in regard to waiting lists.  The Minister promised a significant reduction in the number of people on waiting lists and that has been achieved.  It was promised that 17,000 additional operations would take place in 1993 and the number of additional operations carried out was 18,768.  At the beginning of June 1993 there were 40,000 people awaiting admission to acute hospitals nationally and I am glad that figure has been reduced by 14,757.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious to build on the success of the 1993 waiting list initiative.  Its continuation of it in 1994 with the special allocation of £10 million announced in the budget will enable it to make further inroads in this problem area.  The principal objective will continue to be the elimination of waiting times in excess of 12 months for adults in the problem specialties and six months for children for ENT and ophthalmology. There should not be a curtailment in health expenditure in this area and I say <Col N="1376" /> that unashamedly.  It is the one area where I strongly argue for an increased allocation of resources.  Considering the relief to people who undergo hip operations, ENT treatment or ophthalmology, money should not be a barrier to these services.</P>
    <P>I was concerned that a two tier health service would emerge but the achievement of the waiting list initiative has certainly eliminated that view of accessibility and equity in the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  The 1994 budget, and the Finance Bill, give a clearer indication of the Government's thinking on financial matters than did their first budget which, it told us, it did not have time to prepare.  The Government said last year that as it was in Government for only a matter of weeks it did not have time to do any strategic planning.  However, it has had a further year to do so and we are entitled to judge this Bill, and the second budget of the partnership Government, on the basis of some criteria.</P>
      <P>The first criterion must be the capacity to deal with the fundamental problem confronting our economy, that of high unemployment.  Why have we such a high unemployment rate?  We have a high dependency rate &mdash; for example, for every ten people who work in the economy, they have to keep 22 others.  By comparison, for every ten people who work in the Danish economy, they have to keep nine others.  Of every ten people who work in the Irish economy, two work in the public sector.  Eight out of every 24 people must create wealth and generate income to keep the remaining number &mdash; a ratio of 1:3.  Perhaps that explains to some extent why taxation is so high in Ireland, but there are other reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way to deal with the fundamental problem facing the economy, the only way we will change the high dependency rate is by encouraging more people to become self-reliant, to have an opportunity to participate in the economic development of the country, to have <Col N="1377" /> a job.  We can generate jobs through radical pro-jobs tax reform &mdash; I will deal with that matter later.  That is one way of encouraging enterprise, rewarding those who take risks and making it worthwhile for them to put their money into productive investment rather than leave it lying in a financial institution.</P>
    <P>Even with radical pro-jobs tax reform a substantial number of people will not be able to find a job in the traditional way.  Recently I dealt with this matter when I published on behalf of my party a programme called A Community Right to Employment.  This programme has been criticised and is considered right wing, but I see it as a very sensible programme. It compels people, particularly the young unemployed, to have work in return for unemployment benefit and, in addition to the benefit they receive, they would get an extra £20 which would be an incentive to engage in part-time work. Many people have asked why the programme should be compulsory.  It would be compulsory for the individual, but, more important, it would be compulsory for the State, through the voluntary sector, the State sector or the local government sector, to provide these young people with employment.  That is the compulsion we need to talk about because too many in our society are excluded from worthwhile participation in the economy.</P>
    <P>Normal everyday conversation usually begins with a person being asked where they work, but many unemployed people are ashamed to admit they do not have a job.  No society should put people in that position.  There are 300,000 people unemployed and a further 50,000 who are not in full-time employment, including part-time workers, those signing for credits on the live register and those engaged in training programmes.  There are 350,000 people who do not have full-time work in this economy.  Unless we implement as a matter of urgency a programme such as I am suggesting &mdash; I published the detailed document &mdash; many more people will join that 350,000.  Alternatively they will go elsewhere to eke out a living.  That is bad for society at many <Col N="1378" /> levels.  It is bad for the dignity of our citizens, equality in society and for fairness and justice.  It makes many people feel they should not bother to obey a State that has treated them so badly.  I wanted to deal with that matter before going on to deal with some of the more fundamental issues in relation to tax reform.</P>
    <P>If we are to have effective tax reform, we need to codify, as Deputy Cox said yesterday, our taxation system.  It never ceases to amaze me each year the Finance Bill is so long.  I have taken the opportunity to examine the legislative proposals from other jurisdictions.  Why can they produce the Bill implementing their annual budget in a shorter and much more coherent form?  The reason is simple; they have a much more simplified taxation system.  We should examine, for example, the American financial Bill implementing their annual budget.</P>
    <P>I recently came across two publications, one called <i>Successful Tax Reform: Lessons from an Analysis of Tax Reform in Six Countries</i> by Cedric Sandford and the other titled <i>Key Issues in Tax Reform,</i> also by Cedric Sandford. Both these books make fascinating reading. In relation to the Irish tax system, a chapter was written entitled &ldquo;Self Assessment and Administrative Tax Reform in Ireland&rdquo; by Frank Cassells and Don Thornhill.  They were two of the civil servants at the centre of the transformation of the Revenue Commissioners in the past decade.  In their chapter they outline clearly the huge administrative strides in the way our tax system has been updated and I commend the Revenue Commissioners for that.</P>
    <P>In his book, Sandford said that if we had 10 per cent of the effort in relation to restructuring the tax system as we paid to changing its administration we would be much better off.  He said: &ldquo;Despite a comprehensive blueprint provided by a Commission on taxation, the Republic of Ireland saw less reform of the structure of its tax system than many other English speaking countries&rdquo;.  That is from a man who examined the tax system in five other English speaking jurisdictions including <Col N="1379" /> the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, the United States and Canada. He also said: &ldquo;the essential requirement for successful tax reform is a strong political will; and such a political will has to come from a champion&rdquo;.  He said:</P>
    <P>The only effort at tax reform in the Irish Republic was in 1989 when the Progressive Democrats joined in a coalition with Fianna Fáil and promised a complete overhaul of the tax code.  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition was responsible for the biggest reductions in personal income tax; the phasing out of tax relief on life insurance premiums and the attack on fringe benefits; the reduction in corporation tax from 43 to 40 per cent and the phasing out of accelerated depreciation; and for most of the reforms on VAT and excise duties.</P>
    <P>I could quote many more fine words about our tax system but it is unfortunate that although the Government has the largest majority ever it has no targets in its Programme for Government, nor were any targets mentioned in the Minister's speech yesterday, on tax reform. What does the Government hope the standard rate of tax will be by the end of its term in Government?  At what is it aiming?  If politicians do not have targets, nothing will be achieved.  Even if we did not achieve ambitious targets, if we were merely on the path to achieving them, we would be doing much better.  What does the Government hope the higher rate of tax will be at the end of its term in office?</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy Penrose's contribution when he referred to public spending.  Since the partnership Government came into office, public spending has increased by 17 per cent, which means taxation has also increased by 17 per cent.  That spending is over four times the combined rate of inflation.  Last year it was 1.5 per cent, this year it is anticipated to be 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>We must examine the reason that level of spending continues to rise.  One of the major contributory factors is the way we deal with pay bargaining in this jurisdiction. <Col N="1380" /> There was much to be said for the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which helped to resolve industrial relations problems.  The economy cannot sustain or afford the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> or the PCW.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to a fine paper delivered by economist Ciarán Kennedy, head of the ESRI.  The Government is fond of quoting the ESRI when it suits it.  In a paper delivered to the National Economic and Social Forum on pay Mr. Kennedy suggested pay cuts and said the economy could not sustain another central pay bargaining round such as the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  During the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> years, for example, unemployment in the economy rose by 40 per cent.  This year the public sector pay bill will be £252 million more.  It will increase by 6.1 per cent although inflation will rise by over 2.5 per cent.  I am not suggesting lower pay for public servants; I want higher pay and much higher productivity.  The numbers in our public service cause the problems. No effort is being made to change this and I very much regret that the Department of the Public Service was abolished. With the exception of the former Minister, John Boland, no real effort has ever been made to reform our public service to introduce productivity or value for money throughout the Civil Service as well as the public service generally.</P>
    <P>Instead of that £252 million, what could we have done for tax reform that would have benefited lower paid public servants in particular who are often the reason we are told we need public sector pay rises?  We could have reduced the standard rate of tax by 3 per cent, from 27 per cent to 24 per cent.  We could have perhaps reduced the top rate of tax by 6 per cent, from 48 to 42 per cent.  We could have reduced the standard VAT rate by perhaps 2 percentage points.</P>
    <P>Last year the public sector pay bill increased by £347 million.  What could we have done with that money?  We could have either reduced the standard rate of tax by 5 per cent, the top rate of tax by <Col N="1381" /> 10 per cent or the standard rate of VAT by 4 per cent.  Any of those choices would have been much better to generate enterprise, encourage those at work and make people realise that we have radical, pro-jobs tax reform in place.</P>
    <P>Many people listen to the Budget Statement each year.  I carried out an exercise recently, and I will not bore the Minister of State by recalling all the figures, which involved examining the Budget Statements for the past eight to ten years.  Every year the Minister said that &ldquo;X&rdquo; number of taxpayers will be taken out of the net.  This year, with the reliefs and so on, he said 38,000 people would benefit.  Figures of 11,000, 15,000 and 18,000 have also been mentioned and if one adds them all up, nobody should be paying tax, obviously some of them are the same people coming in and out of the net.</P>
    <P>We have the highest level of tax on work of all the OECD countries and, despite what the Minister for Finance said recently that our tax system compared well with the tax regime of other countries, that is not the case.  In terms of the GNP take in tax revenue, it is higher in this economy than in Europe generally and in Europe it is approximately 10 per cent higher than in Japan or the USA.  Is it any wonder they have unemployment levels of approximately 2.5 per cent in Japan and 6 per cent in the United States?</P>
    <P>We must control public spending.  I am pleased that the forecast for growth over the coming years is high.  The ESRI recently produced a paper on the medium-term outlook.  I want to see that money used to bring in additional revenue. I hope it will go towards radical tax reform &mdash; which does not mean bringing in a new proposal to raise £5 million and giving it to a particular organisation.  That kind of measure gives tax reform a bad name.  The property tax or rates or the service charges, and the manner in which the Government has handled this whole issue, has been appalling.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's comments at the weekend and the contradictions from the Minister for the Environment, who <Col N="1382" /> seems to be holding the Fianna Fáil line in relation to these matters, have led to a great deal of confusion.  The Taoiseach is very adept at clarifying matters; he often clarifies matters he has not been asked to clarify.  However, clarity begins at home and the Government must explain its intentions in relation to service charges, property tax, rates and so on.</P>
    <P>My party favours broadening the tax base and having an equitable tax system for different categories of taxpayers. Consider the existing property tax proposed in this year's budget to be implemented through the Finance Bill.  I will give an example of two taxpayers, one with a salary of £100,000 living in a house worth approximately £150,000 and paying no mortgage.  That taxpayer pays the exact same property tax, under the Minister's proposals, as a person in a house of the same value with a mortgage of approximately £70,000 and an income of £25,000.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Today I received a letter from a group called The Homeowners' Rights Association. They claim to be a non-political organisation formed to oppose the residential property tax.  They outlined some of the problems as they saw them.  If we are to fundamentally alter the tax system the Government should abandon the proposal which it estimates will raise £5 million and start again.</P>
    <P>My party suggested the establishment of an all party committee.  Many would say we are foolish and ask what would Labour and Fianna Fáil do if they were in Opposition.  Would they consider an all party committee?  I am committed to radical tax reform although I hate to call it &ldquo;radical&rdquo; because it is so simple.  If one is on a low income one is almost better off being unemployed.  We need to integrate, as a matter of urgency, the tax and social welfare systems.  A married person with four children and a dependent spouse living in local authority accommodation would have to earn £300 a week to be as well off working in net disposable income terms as he is on social welfare.  That does not encourage self-reliance and enterprise.</P>
    <P>At Question Time the Taoiseach spoke <Col N="1383" /> about the national plan and how we would make up the shortfall of £800 million. He said it would not be through increased taxation or borrowing but yet it would come from the Exchequer.  He did not say it would come from the private sector.  I suspect it will come from what is described as tax buoyancy.</P>
    <P>I read an article by Martin Fitzpatrick in <i>The Sunday Independent</i> of 10 April following his briefing by a Department of Finance official on the first quarter Exchequer returns.  He asked where the money for the increase in public sector pay would come from since it had not been provided for in the Estimates.  The official said that about 50 per cent of the increase in public sector pay immediately flows back to the Government.  The interviewer inquired about the balance.  &ldquo;That is coming from tax buoyancy&rdquo; repeated the official.  This tax buoyancy &mdash; the increase in growth which will obviously generate increased revenue &mdash; must go towards tax reform and reducing the tax burden.</P>
    <P>As regards tax compliance, there is a company which owes the Revenue Commissioners £11 million and owes £6 million to the revenue authorities abroad. The company has a C2 certificate and was able to engage in work and put other companies out of business by not allowing them compete.  It will get away with paying 20 per cent of what it owes.  That is a disgrace.  A constituent of mine who owes £4,000 to the Revenue owns a small minibus, is involved in school transport and earned £11,000 last year.  If the person availed of the tax amnesty the tax liability would have been cleared.  The school transport service was withdrawn because the person did not have a C2 certificate.  To treat a person with an income of £11,000 and a mortgage of £60,000 in that way and allow a company that owes £11 million and has a C2 certificate to get away with paying 20 per cent of what it owes is nothing short of a disgrace.  Where is the equity and equality the Government, particularly the Labour Party, talk about?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> Cedric Sandford said regarding compliance:</P>
    <P>... large-scale tax compliance cannot be achieved solely by threats and penalties.  The tax system itself, if badly structured, can contribute to poor compliance simply by its own inefficiencies.  This can lead to a perception of inefficiency, lack of openness and a person feeling there is no point as they will not be rewarded for being honest with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>My constituent, by being honest, agreeing the figure he owed and not availing of the amnesty is being put out of business. That is not good enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ryan.  Since 1987 Fianna Fáil has aimed to reduce the tax burden on all sectors especially the lower paid. The aim is to make the system more equitable and this is being achieved by increasing tax free allowances, widening the tax bands, a change in the orientation of the revenue authorities and through the acceptance by the self employed of the self assessment system which has resulted in greater tax compliance.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill has a role not only in levying and collecting income tax but in the promotion of sustainable employment. In this Bill the Minister recognises the need to make changes to improve competitiveness, promote the productive use of resources and stimulate and reward genuine enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of years, Fianna Fáil recognised that all sectors must work together to ensure continued growth and an improvement in employment through the <i>Programme for National Recovery, Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  It recognises the vital importance of small businesses in job creation.  Not only did Fianna Fáil talk about the necessity of doing something but it set up task forces in the small businesses, jobs and services areas. Reports were not left to gather dust on shelves, rather the deliberations were <Col N="1385" /> taken into account in formulating the budget and Finance Bills.</P>
    <P>Many Opposition Deputies spoke about tax reform as if it was a panacea and about job creation but always in general terms without backing up their statements with facts and figures.  They call for tax reform, meaning a reduction in taxation, and at the same time look for increased expenditure by Government in health, education, social welfare and so on without saying where the extra revenue is to come from.  It is time they told us where they would get the extra money from, while at the same time reducing taxation.  The Government is acting positively as any objective analysis of the considerable improvement in the overall taxation system will show.  Tax relief under this budget will amount to £330 million.  If that does not represent a reduction in the tax burden what does?</P>
    <P>The reduction in PRSI will cut the cost of employment to employers.  In the area of capital taxation the tax base has been widened and there is a reduction of 10 per cent in corporation taxation.  Indirect taxation and VAT have been reduced from 25 per cent to 21 per cent and the 12.5 per cent rate has been extended to a wide range of employment incentive sectors.  The Government has made it clear that its taxation policy is aimed at providing the most favourable climate for employment.  Many of the measures are directly related to job creation.</P>
    <P>Sections 1, 2 and 3 represent considerable improvements in the income tax code.  Personal allowances have been increased by up to 8 per cent and the standard rate tax band has been widened by 7 per cent.  Exemption limits have been increased and the top rate has been reduced from 48 per cent to 40 per cent. There has also been an improvement in children's allowance which is a continuation of the Government's policy over the past number of years and shows its commitment to lower paid workers and the family.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 4.  For many years children of the self employed and proprietary directors were discriminated <Col N="1386" /> against by not being allowed the £800 PAYE allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 10 extends the list of persons who must operate the withholding tax scheme when making payment for professional services to individuals and companies. This scheme can restrict the level of cash flow to recipients and in many cases can have a negative impact on those engaged in professional activities such as engineering, consultancy and medicine. Sometimes the amounts withheld are out of all proportion to the eventual tax liability.  Now that the self-assessment system is effectively in operation the original justification for the introduction of the withholding tax no longer exists.  The requirement that a person must have a tax clearance certificate before doing business with public sector bodies should be a sufficient safeguard against tax evasion.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on this point.</P>
    <P>The seed capital scheme introduced in the 1993 Finance Act was too restrictive &mdash; only six applications were approved during the first six months.  The changes introduced in section 14 will lead to a greater take-up of the scheme, thus providing the necessary seed capital to expand and create more employment. The introduction of a special capital gains tax rate for individuals in respect of shares in most unquoted trading companies is very welcome and will attract investment funds which heretofore were kept in bank vaults.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extension to the wider services sector of the roll-over relief under capital gains tax for equity investment in unquoted trading companies. This relief was introduced in last year's budget for investment in business in certain sectors.  There is great potential in the service sector for job creation and the extension of this relief will make it more attractive to invest in unquoted trading companies.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest hindrances to young people taking over family businesses is a lack of cash flow, which has often been caused by family settlements. The new business assets relief under capital acquisitions tax will facilitate the <Col N="1387" /> handing over of businesses to young people and give them the opportunity to develop those businesses.</P>
    <P>In recent years I have repeatedly referred to the necessity to revise the VAT thresholds and I am glad that the Minister has finally done this.  The new registration thresholds of £40,000 in the case of goods and £20,000 in the case of services will enable a number of businesses to continue in operation and provide a proper income for the families involved.  The regulation which required VAT returns to be made on the basis of invoices created serious cash problems for many small businesses.  I welcome the decision to introduce a cash basis of accounting for VAT purposes where the annual turnover is less than £250,000. This change will not only help to secure businesses but will also give business an opportunity to develop.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme has proven to be an outstanding success in recent years, revitalising as it has derelict areas in cities and towns.  I welcome the extension of the scheme to other towns, particularly to Mallow in my constituency. However, I am disappointed that the scheme has not been extended to all areas in need of improvement, for example, Youghal and Cobh, where there is considerable unemployment and dereliction. The extension of the scheme to those towns would help to revitalise them.  I hope that the Minister and the Minister for the Environment will be in a position in the years ahead to extend this scheme to cover towns where it would have a practical and beneficial effect.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is still one of our major industries and I acknowledge the need for the introduction of measures to benefit agriculture and encourage the transfer of farms to young enterprising farmers. Section 33 provides for increases in the level of capital acquisitions tax reliefs for agricultural land and buildings and relief in inheritance tax.  For the first time ever a relief has been given for assets such as livestock and machinery.  Farmers can qualify for a relief of up to 25 per cent in such cases.  The Bill also provides for a <Col N="1388" /> reduction by two-thirds in the level of stamp duty chargeable on the transfer of agricultural land and buildings to farmers under 35 years of age who have completed an approved course.  In the majority of cases this will mean a stamp duty rate of 1 per cent, down from 3 per cent, for transfers between relatives and of 2 per cent, down from 6 per cent, for transfers between non-relatives.  The Bill also provides for probate tax relief at a rate of 30 per cent in respect of agricultural land and buildings.  Transfers between spouses will be fully exempt from probate tax.  I welcome these measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided for an improvement in the capital allowances regime for farm buildings by reducing the write off period from ten to seven years. The Minister should consider granting capital allowances of up to 100 per cent in cases where farmers have to carry out pollution control works required by environmental regulations.  In many cases such capital outlay can cause severe problems.  The Minister said that these measures, when taken together with the EU early retirement scheme and the scheme of installation aid for young farmers, should help to improve the structure of this most important sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>I refer to the advantages enjoyed by the International Financial Services Centre and the Shannon zone so as to encourage development.  Why has the Cork area not been given a similar incentive? The Minister should redress this imbalance so that all areas can complete on a level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>Foreign entertainers do not have any withholding tax deducted from their fees.  As a result very large sums of money are leaving the country &mdash; approximately £20 million left the country last year. This means that less spending power is available for our entertainers.  Other countries deduct withholding tax from the fees of foreign entertainers &mdash; the rate in England is 27 per cent.  The Minister should re-examine this issue.</P>
    <P>I will refer in depth to many other aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage, <Col N="1389" /> for example, the capital allowances for the computer software sector, section 26 which deals with the patent income relief, the increase in the valuation of motor vehicles for capital allowances and the reduction in the rates for benefit-in-kind and preferential loans.  All these elements are aimed at improving our economy.  It is generally accepted that the policies being pursued by the Government are the correct ones.  Interest rates are down, there is greater buoyancy in the markets, the number of cars sold since January is up 40 per cent on the number sold during the same period last year, there is a tremendous buzz in the house market and building industry and there is a general air of confidence which had been missing for years.  Like previous Finance Bills, this Bill is moving in the right direction in terms of tax reform, having as its central concern job creation. I wish the Minister continued success in his efforts to make our tax system more equitable and efficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill which has been widely welcomed by the business community, economists and the media in general.  This Bill, which does not add to the red tape, should lead to greater investment in start-ups and existing businesses.  The Bill aims to create and sustain employment and for that reason must be widely welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Bill was published the ESRI has issued a report on the future of the economy which gives a very positive outlook for job and wealth creation in both the short and longer terms.  While the present level of unemployment is obviously unacceptable, there has been a recent welcome reduction in the number of people out of work.  Many Fine Gael Deputies blamed the Government for the unacceptable level of unemployment.  I agree that our unemployment level is unacceptable, but I would refer them to a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by a former leader of their party, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  This excellent article, which should be read by everyone, cites the huge growth in population and the large <Col N="1390" /> number of people coming onto the jobs market every year as two of the reasons for the increase in unemployment.  I recommend that members of the Fine Gael Party read that article.  Indeed they might not be in their present difficult position were they to follow the very reasonable line of their former party leader.  The recent ESRI report supports that theory in many ways, and one reason it took such a positive outlook was the falling birth rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be congratulated on broadening the tax base which all Members would agree is essential if we are to get our affairs in order.  I also welcome the changes in capital allowances for motor cars which will create a significant number of new jobs, giving the motor industry a great boost.  The two amendments to the Finance Act, 1987 regarding the film industry which is at present going through a very positive phase with a huge potential for growth and job creation are welcome.  There is a renewed interest in the film industry here.  As a former member of the Irish Film Institute I know that when I served on the board there was a great deal of pessimism among its members.  They are very much more positive about its prospects, feeling the industry has turned the corner, will expand greatly in future years and employ many more highly paid, well qualified people.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extension of the urban renewal scheme which has been of enormous benefit to many areas.  It has given a fantastic boost to this city where approximately 7,000 new apartments have been built in the inner city, with a huge new area created in Temple Bar. The Financial Services Centre and the quays have been practically transformed as has the whole approach to the city along the Liffey.  A person who had not visited Dublin for approximately 12 years told me of how amazed he was at the improvement effected.  People cannot believe how well the city looks and the great buzz that is everywhere.  This scheme has allowed us to do something we thought impossible, restore life to the <Col N="1391" /> inner city.  It is extremely important that the north inner city be given a boost in any new designation because that area has many derelict sites and old buildings. That area is in need of a boost to restore it to its former glory.</P>
    <P>The Bill generally is to be welcomed. The Government is moving in the right direction, has kept public sector borrowing under control and is well placed to take full advantage of the upturn in world economies.  It would be quite an achievement if we could maintain our growth rate at 5 per cent and that would help resolve many of our social problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the changes proposed in the capital gains tax.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter for next year because one of the greatest problems experienced by business here is a lack of adequate capital.  Despite what might be thought there is not much wealth here and any created usually is held by middle-aged or older people and much of it tied up in property or in company shares.  Were the Minister to reduce the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to, say, 27 per cent on all company shares held over a five-year period that would be of enormous help.  While excluding speculators it would help investment in companies because what they need is long term investment and five years is a long term.  Anybody who invests money in a company for five years should be allowed withdraw it and pay tax at the 27 per cent rate.  I do not believe that people should, or do, pay tax at the 40 per cent rate.  Rather they leave money in their wills from which the State receives no return in the form of capital gains tax and such money is tied up rather than being invested in more productive areas of our economy.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the way this Bill, and others, are drafted.  We are committed to open Government but we are turning our backs on open Government by maintaining a tradition in the way our Bills are drafted.  Many sections are incomprehensible, not on account of the necessarily complex wording but because of the cut-and-paste approach adopted <Col N="1392" /> to the amending of legislation without setting out in full the amended section or sections involved.  Sections of this Bill include tables and the consequences of the amendment proposed can be clearly seen and understood.  However, by the time we reach section 10, that practice is abandoned and one must resort to the Explanatory Memorandum to ascertain what it is one is expected to vote on.  In regard to section 10, the side note to the section should explain what the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1992 is about.  An even worse example is section 32 where the side note reads; Amendment of Chapter VII (Urban Renewal: Temple Bar and other Areas) of Part I of the Finance Act, 1991.  How is one to ascertain what is meant there?  Much of it appears to be a game played by civil servants determined to exclude everybody else from playing.  We should remember that not only legislators need to know what is intended but the general public also.  It is not acceptable that any member of the public should have to pay £200 to £300 per hour to a tax consultant or lawyer to explain the meaning of these provisions.  The parliamentary draftsmen may be under great pressure, they do an excellent job, but there is need for a greater effort to make legislation generally comprehensible.  All amending sections should contain tables showing the relevant Acts being amended and all side notes should refer to any other Acts or provisions affected by the changes proposed.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for acknowledging the success of the urban renewal programme which was initiated by the Fine Gael Party.  I am glad it has served its purpose and rejuvenated not alone Dublin's inner city but also parts of Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford, Tralee and several other urban centres.  While acknowledging that its provisions have been improved and that this Bill will render it more attractive, my only regret is that it was not extended to include traditional seaside resorts like Salthill, Ballybunion, Tramore and Bundoran.  They are feeling the <Col N="1393" /> pinch at present and are experiencing great difficulty competing with resorts like the Canaries with which they did not have to compete in the past.  The Minister was approached by a number of organisations, including the Ballybunion development association, to have the scheme extended to such resorts.  Unfortunately he appears to have ignored their pleas but he may accept an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.  The scheme has helped generate economic activity generally and its extension to traditional seaside resorts would create even greater economic activity in addition to substantially upgrading and improving such resorts and the facilities and accommodation available in them.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to include traditional seaside resorts. Should Deputy Enda Kenny come into the House I wish to share time with him.</P>

      <P>As Opposition spokesperson on tourism I will confine my remarks to that area.  The more favourable reliefs on gifts and inheritance tax should facilitate the transfer of family businesses to younger people.  I welcome this provision which was sought by the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation &mdash; ITIC &mdash; and other interested groups in tourism.  I thank the Minister for responding to a degree.  This provision and the more favourable reliefs on gifts and inheritance tax will ensure that businesses are passed on to family members at a younger age; 75 per cent of the hotels in Ireland are family owned.  In the past, our tax system served as a major disincentive for families to pass on hotels and other property but this Bill ensures more favourable circumstances for families in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inheritance tax provision in the Finance Bill, 1994, which makes no provision for families, with more than four children, who wish to pass on their business, should be inclusive rather than exclusive.  Any tax regime whether it <Col N="1394" /> refers to the passing on of agricultural land or hotels should encourage the passing on of and investment in hotels and in tourism.</P>
    <P>The improvements in capital allowances for the hotels sector which will enable hotels to write off capital expenditure over a seven year period rather than over ten years are welcome.  Between 1978 and 1989 hotels had annual writing down allowances of up to 100 per cent. This provided a major incentive to investment and reinvestment in the nation's accommodation stock and related plant. Under the provisions of the Finance Acts, 1989 and 1990, accelerated allowances were phased out.  I hope this move will indicate a return to the previous position which undoubtedly encouraged investment in hotels with consequential job creation.  Other provisions, such as the reduction in employers' PRSI and employees' tax, will be beneficial to the tourism industry.  However, the threshold of £9,000 for the special PRSI concession should be extended on a phased basis; a cut off point of £9,000 is stark.  On average, the social cost of employing people is about £25 greater here than in England. That puts any industry, and especially our tourism industry, at a disadvantage especially in regard to competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight the proposed taxation of unemployment benefit.  Despite what the Minister or Minister of State may say this will have an adverse effect on the tourism industry because of the seasonal nature of that industry and also because of the type of people who work in that industry, in many cases the wives of husbands who are in permanent employment in the tourism industry.  This provision will be a total disincentive for these people.  There is a large pool of experts, for whom it will not be worthwhile to work in the tourism industry. When replying to a Private Notice Question some time ago the Minister pointed out there are plenty of young people to do this work.  I accept that, but they do not have the expertise which these people have built up over a long period in terms of meeting with customers, general hospitality and how they treat people.  Tourists <Col N="1395" /> appreciate the level of expertise in hotels and in the traditional tourist areas. Year after year these people are involved on a part-time basis in the tourism industry. They do this work to supplement the family income.  The feedback I am getting from places such as Killarney, Waterville, Tralee and throughout Kerry indicates it will have a detrimental effect. Women will find that it will be more advantageous for them not to work but to claim some of the benefits to which they will be entitled.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made some minor concessions in regard to part-time work but he should examine the overall question and its effects on the tourism industry. Also, he should monitor its effects during the coming months and especially towards the end of the year to determine whether it will have the effects I predict. Perhaps my interpretation is not correct but I will certainly know at the end of the tourist season.  I asked the Minister for Tourism and Trade to keep a close look on this whole area.</P>
    <P>In this Bill I expected a provision in relation to higher education grants and tax reliefs for hard-pressed families.  I am disappointed that there is no reference in the Bill to tax concessions for hundreds of middle income families who are hard-pressed to send their children to third level institutions.  Despite numerous promises made by Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party before the last election regarding free third level education there has been no significant concession for that group during the past two years.  I had expected that provision would have been made for them in this Bill but this hard-pressed section of the community will not benefit from tax relief on third level education costs.</P>
    <P>The same segment will be affected by the changes in mortgage interest relief. Tax relief on mortgage interest will be reduced from the marginal rate of tax to the standards rate of tax over four years. The lowering of the ceiling to 80 per cent of the allowable mortgage interest relief will hit lower income families.  This provision will have a major effect on the <Col N="1396" /> aspirations of many young couples to own their homes and people will no longer have as great an incentive to own their homes.</P>
    <P>Government backbenchers have referred to the major tax concessions during the past five years.  While concessions have been made in the rate of personal income tax, the reliefs have been eroded.  Income tax relief on mortgage interest payments gave couples an incentive to enter into long term commitments with banks and lending societies to buy a house but unfortunately this relief is being eroded continuously. Those with mortgages for five years or more were given no prior notice of the changes.  While there are certain positive taxation aspects, the reduction in mortgage interest relief is not welcome.</P>
    <P>Will the provisions on stamp duty, inheritance and gift tax and other reliefs for farmers be backdated to the date they were announced in the budget rather than the date stated in the Bill, because a number of transfers were made on the presumption that the provision would be backdated?  The provisions should be backdated to budget day at least.</P>
    <P>I omitted to refer to corporation profits tax when I was speaking on the tourism industry.  There is no reason whatsoever that the 10 per cent manufacturing rate should not be extended to the tourism industry.  We expect that the tourism industry will provide 35,000 jobs during the life of the National Development Plan over the next five years but at the same time a very repressive taxation regime is being imposed on the industry. Manufacturing industry, including foreign operators who are providing much needed employment, is not creating the same number of jobs but will pay tax at the 10 per cent rate.  Tourism is an indigenous industry, with very few foreign operators and it has been built up by families who have been involved in the business for years.  They are providing very valuable employment in areas where no manufacturing industry would locate and they should be given the tax concession of 10 per cent profits tax.  The Irish Hotels Federation and a number of <Col N="1397" /> other tourism interest groups have called continuously for this provision.  I accept there is a cost factor but in view of the significance of the tourism industry it is important that their contribution be recognised and that they be granted this concession.  I realise it may not be possible to lower the rate to 10 per cent overnight but the 40 per cent of tax should be reduced on a phased basis.  This would give a major fillip to the industry.</P>
    <P>The introduction of new provisions in relief for investment in films, aimed at assisting low budget Irish films is very welcome.  I have been involved in the production of five videos on north Kerry writers.  I found that the little help that was available was not very useful.  Those who invested in the project qualified for special tax exemption under section 47 but the existing supports do not provide sufficient incentive.  We were fortunate that RTE could provide funding from its grants to encourage local initiative but we had to raise the rest of the funding in America.  I hope that this new provision will help not only in making major films and low budget Irish films but also the production of videos.  There is massive untapped potential in this country for producing videos and there is very interesting subject matter that may not be available in ten years time.  We need to encourage people to make videos in their communities.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister, and his officials, that tourism is of such importance that when he is framing his Finance Bill the special interests of tourism should be to the forefront of his mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be afforded the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Bill, one of the most, if not the most important Bills we will deal with this year.  There is an onus on all Members to portray the legislation accurately.  There is also a need to project it with confidence to the business community to ensure we meet our aspiration of creating sustainable employment.  The Minister is continuing the process initiated in recent Finance Acts.  Last <Col N="1398" /> year's Finance Act had the same laudable aims.</P>
      <P>The public accept that they have to pay taxes and that the system must be fair.  In the past some people were able to avoid paying their fair share to the detriment of others.  Most people are now complying. There was a time when well heeled individuals could buy expertise to circumvent the legislation and evade their responsibilities, but those days are gone.  This is welcome because the fall guy was the PAYE taxpayer who was carrying the can.  Happily, the position has changed dramatically.  I welcome the changes in taxation provided for in this legislation.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the remarks by the Taoiseach in the House yesterday that the Government is committed to reducing the overall burden of taxation.  The Minister is continuing the process initiated in recent Finance Acts.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the Finance Act last year I was highly critical of the decision to introduce the 1 per cent income levy.  This move was regrettable. I expressed the hope that it would be a short term ploy and that the Minister would find himself in a position to remove it.  I had an aversion to this measure because of the implications for pensioners who had not budgeted for it.  I am grateful to the Minister for removing it.</P>
      <P>The Bill is geared towards the creation of jobs and contains measures to help small businesses.  We lag far behind our European partners in terms of the number of small businesses per head of the population.  This indicates the potential of the small business sector to create jobs.  It is incumbent upon us to ensure that every encouragement is given to small business people who have the guts to enter business to provide employment for themselves and others.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill to help these business people.</P>
      <P>I have great expectations for the county enterprise boards.  I hope these boards will not be brought to the ground by the malaise which affected other agencies in the past.  The responsible Minister is committed to ensuring that this will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> The Government's efforts to promote job creation are producing results throughout the country among ordinary people and at local authority level.  Yesterday the local authority in County Wicklow held a special seminar entitled &ldquo;Wicklow: A Jobs Strategy 1994-1996&rdquo;. Long may this continue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes announced in the urban renewal scheme.  Last year I called on the Minister to include other towns.  I am pleased that at least one town in most counties is being included.  In my own constituency the town of Wicklow is being included.  I would like to see Arklow and possibly Baltinglass and Blessington included in the not too distant future.  The scheme is of immense benefit.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the good news concerning the film industry.  The incentives provided reflect the realisation by the Minister and the Government of the recent successes of Irish film makers and the potential that lies within that industry for job creation.  In my own constituency there is a tradition of film making in the town of Bray which, I hope, will not go unnoticed by all concerned.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Deenihan's aspirations for tourism and wholeheartedly agree with him.  I welcome the measures the Minister has included which will undoubtedly help tourism which, with other service areas, has been the chief provider of jobs in recent years.  Certain provisions have been made to assist hotels, but in my county of Wicklow accommodation is a problem.  There are just not enough bedrooms to meet the demands of tourism in the county.  We are thankful for the vast improvement in the industry in Wicklow but it is necessary to encourage people to provide more accommodation, particularly in family-owned hotels.  Mechanisms like the BES have been availed of to upgrade such hotels, but there is a need for further funding of such projects to provide a quality tourism package for visitors.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasises the importance of agriculture.  I particularly welcome the measures that facilitate the <Col N="1400" /> transfer of land from fathers to sons.  Until recently there was no incentive to hand on the farm to educated young farmers.  In this Bill there is stamp duty relief for trained young farmers, and other aspects in the budget will help them.  Perhaps the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will look in the near future at the scheme of installation aid which has remained at the same level for a number of years.  This scheme, combined with the early retirement scheme and the other provisions, is part of an overall package of incentives for young farmers to take over the farm. It needs to be updated.  Perhaps the Minister would review the scheme with a view to upgrading it at this time.</P>
    <P>Mention of the peace efforts by the Taoiseach, the Government and all concerned might at first glance seem out of place in a debate on the economy.  I think it is appropriate that it be mentioned because of the implications for the economy of this whole island if peace can be achieved.  The benefits to tourism would be unlimited.  We would also benefit in our dealings with other countries who, perhaps, see us as a war zone much of the time.  Let us hope that the trojan efforts of all concerned, led by the Taoiseach, will bear fruit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Enda Kenny.  There are some aspects of this Bill that I welcome. I am glad the Minister has seen fit to do something about the mistakes he made last year and earlier this year.  He introduced the 1 per cent income levy which, although it was voted through this House, was unacceptable to everybody here.  The Minister has realised his mistake and that situation has been remedied.  The probate tax also had major implications. Once again the Minister has realised his mistake and moved somewhat in the right direction.  That movement is to be welcomed but it has not gone far enough. Probate tax is a death tax.  It was done away with some years ago and it should have been left that way.  It is a sad day when we have to tax people facing the trauma of a death in the family.  Although <Col N="1401" /> a spouse can now inherit the property without having to pay the probate tax, if one of the spouses has already died the family still has to pay probate tax when the death of the remaining spouse occurs. That is fine if a person has lived his natural span of life.  However, if a person is killed by accident or dies from a serious illness, young families are left to bear a burden that they cannot afford.</P>
      <P>We also welcome the Minister's back tracking on the introduction of means testing of widow's pensions.  We welcome the introduction of pensions for widowers.  However, matching that with a means test for both widows and widowers had major implications and we are glad that is not being done.  It should never have been suggested, causing trauma to the people concerned.</P>
      <P>The right to own property seems very much a blind area to the Minister.  Few people realised at the time of the budget how serious were the implications of the cutbacks in mortgage interest relief.  One only has to talk to any young couple with a high mortgage to realise how serious the implications are.  The cutbacks in mortgage interest relief, with the cutbacks in relief on VHI contributions and the proposal to do away with that, fly in the face of the promises made to the electorate before this Government was formed that neither would be touched but were to be improved.  The measures in the Bill in this regard have serious effects on the take-home pay of couples and individuals which will become far worse in time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard glib assurances from the Taoiseach that he wants to reduce the level of income tax, not increase it.  I am concerned that the running down of the county roads structure and the hidden comments about the need for taxation from local sources is a ploy to prepare the public for the reintroduction of rates. It may be in the form of a property tax, but if the revenue derived from it is paid into the national Exchequer rather than to local authorities there is no guarantee the potholes in Monaghan, Cavan or elsewhere will be repaired.  However, I welcome the changes to the property tax <Col N="1402" /> brought about as a result of comments from this side of the House and lobby groups outside.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's commitment to reduce the level of stamp duty required to transfer property to young farmers.  This is a step in the right direction towards the position which obtained when our party was last in Government when such transfers were not subject to stamp duty.  Will the Minister consider a request on behalf of a small group of people?  The stamp duty relief came into effect on 11 April, but some people transferred property between budget day and that date in an effort to benefit from the retirement scheme.  Will the Minister give some relief to those people?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry saw fit recently to backdate to 1 January the changes in reactor grants.  Will the Minister backdate to budget day the reduction in stamp duty on property transfers? Many people believed there would not be a change in stamp duty after the budget was announced and proceeded to make property transfers.  This matter is important for the small number of people involved.  Farmers' sons and daughters are not given similar treatment to the sons and daughters of the business people. Will the Minister consider that matter? Those are minor issues in the overall national finances, but have a major impact on farming families.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the urban renewal scheme.  The town of Monaghan has been granted urban renewal status and I want to ensure the maximum possible acreage is included.  As 20 acres were included for the town of Longford, we would like a similar acreage for Monaghan town which will benefit greatly from the change in status.  Towns in the Border region have suffered a great deal in recent years and any assistance is appreciated.  While the tax increases on petrol and other items may be of minor significance in areas further south, they have major impact on Border regions and but for the decrease in oil prices such taxes could have seriously affected cross-Border trade.  The introduction of the Single European Act and taxation agreements <Col N="1403" /> between North and South have brought about tremendous improvements in trading between those two regions, but we must ensure nothing is done to affect that detrimentally.</P>
    <P>The low interest loans available for various sectors were referred to earlier. Because of the major interest in the scheme from both a tourism and small industry point of view, will the Minister increase the £100 million available?  The high interest rates last spring did enormous damage to small industries, but that can be rectified by a fixed interest rate for that sector which could provide much needed jobs.</P>
    <P>The taxation of part-time workers will have major implications for the mushroom, meat and tourism industries.  Last weekend many people made representations to me about their tax free allowance being cut in half.  In one case a person's allowance was reduced from £112 last year to £56 this year.  I understand the Minister has promised to rectify that position by way of amendments to the Bill.  It is crucial that this is done. Otherwise, many people employed in seasonal industries will be adversely affected.  For example, tourism is at a high point in the summer but does not provide year round employment.  The meat and mushroom industries have their valley periods and if part-time workers in those industries are taxed in the manner proposed in the budget the implications for families will be dire.  Many of them will be forced to apply for full social welfare benefits.  The Minister should not merely alleviate the position for a few months, but confirm that he will withdraw the proposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard played a major role in the setting up of the mushroom industry. It is regrettable that corporation tax on that industry has been increased from 10 per cent to 40 per cent.  Approximately 900 full-time and 4,100 part-time jobs have been provided in the industry and it generates enormous wealth from exports.  Will the Minister reconsider the matter and minimise all possible damage to that industry which is vital in the area <Col N="1404" /> I represent and many other parts of the country?  He must look to his European counterparts in order to do this, but if he is willing it can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Jacob's speech and share his aspiration for peace and his sentiments about the general economic and social benefits peace would bring about.  We must continue to work towards peace.</P>
      <P>I also share the sentiments of Deputy Crawford in regard to the mushroom industry.  A number of enterprises have grown up in the west in recent years and they are facing closure because of this increased taxation.  I hope the Minister will accept Fine Gael amendments on Committee Stage to allow the mushroom industry, which has prospered in recent years, to stand on its feet.</P>
      <P>The ESRI report forecast a period of boom and bloom for this country in the years ahead and in general we share that optimistic outlook.  One recalls the ESRI's 1989 report in which it predicted the budget surplus would be £1.2 billion at this stage, but there is a deficit of £0.8 billion at present.  It also predicted 100,000 fewer unemployed than at present.  ERSI and other economic forecasts are only partly true and must be judged on the circumstances that apply on the day.</P>
      <P>While sharing the generally optimistic approach of the report the competence of the Government to deal with those implications must be called into question. The Minister spoke for 45 minutes but did not refer to the controversial statement by the Taoiseach in Killarney when he proposed an amalgamation of the residential property tax and other service charges into a super-tax to be levied on all householders next year, nor did he indicate that if taxation of this nature is introduced &mdash; which will be fought hard and long by this party &mdash; and paid to local authorities that the rate support grant would be reduced proportionately for those local authorities.  That would transfer the difficult task of raising finance to local councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> The competence of the Government to deal with the implications of the general optimistic outlook is questionable when one considers the Minister for Defence failed disastrously in an 11 : 1 defeat in Europe on a marine issue, an area of great potential for this country.  He returned to this country, said he and the Government had acted in our best interests and tried to placate the outraged fishermen by compensating them with £5 million for the inclement weather conditions of the past 12 months.  Deputy Andrews did a good job as Minister for Foreign Affairs but that is not the case in respect of the Marine and Defence portfolios.  We have been scuppered in the area of the marine and the period after 1996 will tell its own tale.</P>

That export business is worth £100 million and involves thousands of jobs.  The reports of German supermarkets displaying signs they do not sell Irish beef are disgraceful. Not only are they against the spirit of the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, they also breach the law and if the German Ministry for Health and Agriculture pursues this restriction we should take court action.</P>
      <P>Regarding the national plan, the Taoiseach said we had £8 billion in the bag, a phenomenal sum of money but it has been reduced by £800 million.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is talking about the introduction of a new super-tax, the Minister for Finance is making a sterling defence of the residential property tax and the Minister for the Environment is making a play for leadership from a long way out by saying he will stand like Horatio on the bridge in his opposition to a reintroduction of rates. However, given the large majority of the Government we know it can railroad through any legislation.  If residential property tax, or family home tax as I prefer to call it, is amalgamated with service charges it will crucify hundreds of thousands of people and develop into a super-tax which will be fought tooth and nail.  The odium which the poll tax in Britain, under the redoubtable Mrs. Thatcher, caused a number of years ago will pale into insignificance when our electorate deal with this Government's outrageous intention to introduce such a tax.</P>
      <P>In 1993 public expenditure increased by 9 per cent and taxation this year is due to increase by 9 per cent.  Despite the Government saying that people will have more money in their pockets, the tax free allowance has increased from £1 to £2 which is disgraceful when one considers that for the next 12 months the black cloud of the new Reynolds-Spring super-tax will hang over people's heads.  The officials in the Department of Finance must be driven around the bend by this proposal but they will hear more about it because the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste will not get away with this.  It is disgraceful treatment of the electorate and I condemn it out of hand.</P>

      <P>The Minister made three relevant points, the first dealt with the creation of sustainable employment by promoting productive use of our resources and rewarding entrepreneurs. He said he had taken account of the views of interested parties.  He is willing to meet groups and listen to representations from TDs on behalf of constituents.  He talked to the members of the task force on small industries and on the service sectors.  If we stick to the three points made by the Minister and make the best possible use of available funding we will develop our economy and create jobs.  We will receive regional funds, we have a guarantee in respect of funds from the International Fund for Ireland and in respect of INTERREG II and Leader II which I hope will come on stream at the end of the year.  Substantial funds have also been made available for small industries through county enterprise boards.</P>
      <P>During the first term of a cross-Border fund which ended last December some stand alone developments were set up on each side of the Border but the fund was not used in a true cross-Border sense.  I hope there will be a breakthrough in talks and that at the end of the term of that fund we will be in a position to make better use of such funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past few weeks the 10 per cent corporation profits tax on the mushroom industry has been increased.  To comply with a European Union directive the Government had to increase that tax and section 32 of the Bill provides for that.  We are aware that earlier this year the European Union ruled that the application of that tax to the mushroom industry was a State aid and incompatible with the EU ruling.  It was increased partly because the English market for mushrooms was taken over by Irish growers who produced a high quality product. The position is somewhat similar to the export of beef to another EU member <Col N="1408" /> state.  The Commission has set up a formal procedure in this area which does not favour Ireland.  Under Article 9.3 of the Treaty Ireland as a member state of the EU is obliged to comply with the Commission's ruling.</P>
    <P>A number of mushroom growers will continue to be taxed under income tax.  I welcome the fact that compost production is eligible for the 10 per cent tax rate.  I discussed this matter with the Minister and I know he considers mushroom production as a good money spinner. The success of the mushroom industry is well documented.  It has gone from strength to strength since its inception in the early 1980s and it is still developing.  It has generated substantial income for the country and, more importantly, for my constituency which accounts for about 60 per cent of production &mdash; output stands at £53 million.</P>
    <P>The industry employs 5,000 people, including full-time and part-time employees.  With the decline in the number of small family farms, spending power would be greatly reduced were it not for the mushroom industry.  One has only to look at the number of planning permission applications in County Monaghan to see that on a weekly basis people are applying to set up units.  Each unit costs about £25,000, with an investment of £100,000.  I stress the importance of this industry.</P>
    <P>In late 1992 and early 1993 the mushroom industry experienced a serious crisis, but due to the efficiency of growers, a cost cutting exercise and a sympathetic response from the Government, it overcame those difficulties and is now poised to make greater inroads into the export market.  There is a very good manufacturing and canning side to this industry which would cater for any contingencies that arise.  There is room for expansion in this area.  I request the Government to do all in its power to ensure the continuation of this viable industry which benefits a large part of the community.</P>
    <P>There are often down sides to successful enterprises and in this case it is a deterioration in road conditions.  With <Col N="1409" /> the substantial increase in heavy trucks using our roads &mdash; delivering compost and transporting waste compost, the daily collection of the produce, the delivery of feed for the poultry and pig industries and the delivery of milk to our cooperatives &mdash; the condition of our roads has rapidly deteriorated.  Irrespective of cutbacks in EU funding, the scheme as outlined by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, of a six year period of funding for non-national roads should be adhered to.  I would go further and ask that additional funds be provided for roads which in a region such as mine are the lifeline of rural communities.</P>
    <P>I listened yesterday with great interest to the Leader of the main Opposition party who outlined his five year plan for roads.  However, when he was asked how he proposed to fund the scheme he suddenly realised that money would be needed to do so and he was unable to respond.</P>

Following the launching of this study, money should be provided under INTERREG or some other programme for recycling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all of us agree that the greatest national problem is unemployment and that any Government would have to apply all its efforts to ensure that problem is tackled.  In recent years the Government has proceeded with that in mind.  Since the last election there has been a greater urgency in the approach to that difficulty.</P>
      <P>The macro-economic indicators of recent months seem to be positive.  This results from firm Government action in dealing with our finances.  Debates on finance, the economy and aspects of that area are not popular with the media, as is obvious from the number of people in the Press Gallery today.  However, small topics such as missing Ministers' cars attract people to the House.  The approach to our economy in the last year has been a success story.  I say that not because I am on the Government backbenches and wish to please the Minister; it is the considered opinion of people in business.</P>
      <P>I welcome the ESRI report and the overview of the eminent economist, Mr. Kieran Kennedy, director of the ESRI. He did not say that everything is rosy in the garden and that everything will be great.  He pointed out that there are problems to be tackled by Government.  He said that the position has vastly improved over the position that existed a few months ago and that the trend could continue to improve if the Government kept a vigilant eye on all areas of economic activity, as it is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not normally look to documents from IBEC as a means of putting forward my argument.  Down the years I opposed some of its statements, but I have always respected its analysis on our economic position.  It gives its analysis on the basis of trends, departmental figures and returns in various areas and therefore they are statistically correct.  It is worth quoting IBEC's comment in its quarterly review ending March 1994.  Under the heading &ldquo;Stronger Growth in 1994&rdquo; it states: &ldquo;The prospects for a return to stronger economic growth in 1994 and a substantial increase in output of employment <Col N="1411" /> appear good&rdquo;.  That is a welcome appraisal of the situation.</P>
    <P>One of the major triumphs of the Government and of the Minister is the national wage agreement, which is now contained in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> to maintain the sound trends in our trade union movement which has co-operated fully in that area.  Over many years the movement has adopted a considered approach to our problems and has entered into agreements for the betterment of all people, for the reduction of unemployment and, at the same time, looking after the interests of their members, which is their first duty.  A continuation of policy such as that contained in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is regarded by the trade union movement as being beneficial for its members and for the whole community.</P>
    <P>In commenting on the national wage agreement, IBEC, in its quarterly report, state that this will prove particularly beneficial to indigenous industry serving the domestic market where it believes there will be substantial growth and that this in turn ought to lead to an increase in employment over the course of the year.  It further stated that the budget will have imparted some stimulus to consumer spending, particularly at the lower income levels, through the abolition of the income levy and the income tax concessions and that these developments ought to stimulate both employment and increased spending.  That is an important comment and we must continue the policy outlined in the budget and put it into effect through this Bill.</P>
    <P>Already we can see some green shoots appearing throughout the country as a result of a slight upturn in our economy and more confidence coming back into the economy.  Though this view may not find favour with Deputy Yates, I particularly welcome an increase in employment in the public sector area.  For too long there was a decline in that area; from 1987 to 1990 there was a reduction of 21,000 people employed in the public sector.  With such a reduction in employment, <Col N="1412" /> obviously there is a resulting increase in unemployment commensurate with the reduction in that area.  During that period employment in our local authorities and all Government Departments reduced substantially, although perhaps this action was necessary.</P>
    <P>We must employ more people in the public sector.  We need more people working in our local authorities.  This is demanded by all of us at local level regardless of which side of the political divide we are on.  In his contribution to this debate, Deputy Yates demanded a cut in public expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but at local council level there is a demand for increased activity within the counties in the building of local authority houses and the maintenance of roads.</P>
      <P>I am happy to see life coming back into our economy and that in my town of Wicklow 30 local authority houses are being built in addition to over 60 private houses.  This is not the only area in our constituency where house building is taking place, it is happening all around the county.  Car sales are improving because of measures in the budget and this may result in an increase in car imports.</P>
      <P>The only cautionary comment I would make to the Minister is in regard to the slight increase in the inflation rate.  I know he is aware of this and is taking action in that area, but the ship has steadied and it is going ahead.  None of us wants to see inflation rates increasing again.  We want to see steady progress so that the levels of unemployment will decrease, as has been suggested in the IBEC quarterly report, and see more people getting back to work as a result of Government policy.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and, in particular, the opening statement of the Minister for Finance that it implements an important range of measures designed to promote and assist the creation of sustainable <Col N="1413" /> employment.  I hope to see this reflected on the ground.  I must refer, in particular, to my constituency of Kerry North where unemployment is now well above the national average.  In July, one of our major industries in Tralee, Klapman Industries, will lose approximately 148 jobs.  This will be close on 300 job losses in this company within the past two years.</P>
      <P>While commitments have been given by the various State agencies over the past number of years that north Kerry would secure a major industry, nothing has happened.  The Minister emphasised that the measures in the Finance Bill should not be viewed in isolation but rather as complementing and enhancing the initiatives for enterprise and employment enshrined in the 1993 Finance Act and that they must be seen in that context by the Government's broadly based strategy for economic progress in the interests of job creation.  How can I explain this to the many people seeking employment who attend my clinics week after week?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance should consider the submission of Kerry County Council which could create up to 300 jobs within the local authority provided it can qualify for certain subsidies.  I do not propose to elaborate on the submission at this point; it is well presented and documented and could be taken as a pilot scheme with the co-operation of the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister with regard to unemployment benefit which has been made reckonable for tax purposes from 6 April 1994.  It has been decided, however, that in recognition of their special circumstances, workers who, on 5 April 1994, were participating in a systematic short-time working arrangement recognised by the Department of Social Welfare, will be exempted from the new tax arrangements.  This exemption will apply in respect of unemployment benefit payments received in relation to systematic short-time working for the duration of an individual's current unemployment benefit claim or to the end of the present tax year &mdash; 5 April 1995 &mdash; whichever is the earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> I welcome the Minister's statement that he will table a Committee Stage amendment to this effect, but I ask him to take into account the many genuine workers involved in short-time employment. In this respect I refer to County Kerry where in excess of 7,000 people are affected by this measure.  I realise a number of submissions have been made through the various industries in the area who are now on short-time, in particular Pretty Polly, and I ask him to consider this also on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures with regard to agriculture, in particular, those which will benefit and encourage the transfer of farms to younger, more enterprising farmers.  The measures include a substantial improvement in agricultural relief under capital acquisitions tax, relief in respect of probate tax and a new stamp duty relief for young trained farmers. These measures, when taken together with the EC early retirement scheme and the scheme of installation aid for young farmers, will certainly help to improve the structure of this important sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the money being made available to the many local authorities throughout the country for housing.  We have certainly benefited from this in Kerry and we hope to improve our position during the year. Last year, as a result of the additional funding, we built in excess of 164 houses, which was second only to the Donegal local authority who built 200 houses.  I hope the same commitment will be given this year because we have a serious problem in Kerry with regard to housing.</P>
    <P>I realise time is against me but I ask the Minister to consider the submission made by Kerry County Council which will create up to 300 jobs provided it qualifies for certain subsidies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate, in particular, Deputies Yates, Cox and Rabbitte.  I do not accept the proposition by Deputies Yates and Cox that the Government has no coherent tax strategy.  Everyone agreed the overriding <Col N="1415" /> economic and social objective is to resolve unemployment.  Ensuring taxation policy is pro-employment is essential and is the focus of the Government's tax strategy.  This means continuing the process of tax reform which has been underway for a number of years.  It is aimed at increasing the rewards and incentives for working and reducing the cost of employing workers.  We should not forget the significant progress made by successive Governments from the point we were at ten years ago where we had 65 per cent, 58 per cent and 35 per cent tax bands and 50 per cent corporation tax.  This year significant steps are being taken in implementing the Government's taxation strategy, in particular to lighten the tax burden on earned income.  By any standards the reliefs in income tax are substantial costing £330 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's policy to continue, within responsible budgetary parameters, to ease the tax burden on earned income and, where necessary, adopt appropriate base-broadening measures. In the Budget Statement I set out what the Government regard as the guiding principles for a pro-jobs taxation strategy. The same principles are reaffirmed in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  These concerns underpinned this year's budget and Finance Bill and will remain the barometer of progress on taxation over the coming years.</P>
      <P>I make no apology for the steps that are being taken to assist the development of firms, particularly smaller indigenous businesses.  I refute categorically the allegation that the specific targeted measures proposed are in any sense a reversal of the base-broadening measures put in place over recent years.  People who say that do not understand what has been happening over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies have argued that the Government has lost control over Government spending, that somehow this is a tax and spend Government with no concern for the proper management of the public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice very often that those who <Col N="1416" /> argue in this way do not spell out in any detail how they impose cuts on public spending.  However, this does not stop these critics from going on to call either for tax reductions or for expenditure increases.  There were calls in this debate to spend millions of pounds on all kinds of projects.</P>
    <P>We have made significant progress in bringing order to the public finances. With the recent slowdown in the international economy, Irish public spending increased during the period from 1990 to 1993, reflecting, in particular, the pressures which high unemployment has imposed on Government services, especially health and social welfare.</P>
    <P>This was a development common to all our European partners.  Nonetheless, public spending in Ireland compares well as a percentage of GDP to that of our European partners.  EU statistics on general Government expenditure indicate that Ireland is significantly below the EU average.  The 1994 budget targets &mdash; which once again meet the Maastricht guidelines &mdash; show that the Government is determined to maintain this performance in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>If the argument is that Ireland's public sector is pre-empting an excessively large share of national income, then this is not borne out by these figures.  If a relatively small public sector confers any competitive advantage, then, on this evidence, Ireland is certainly in a better position than our European partners.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that social services &mdash; health, education and social welfare &mdash; account for a very high proportion of spending in Ireland.  If the Government contemplated substantial cuts in the level of provision, the quality and scale of these social services would also have to be reduced.  It is far from clear that there would be any support for measures of this sort from any group of opinion, perhaps not even from those who have been arguing today that aggregate levels of public spending are too high.  Deputy Yates is calling for a major cutback in health and social welfare.  It is the only conclusion that one can come to.</P>

      <P>The Government is continuing the work of all Governments since 1987 in steadily and sensibly reforming the income tax system.  We tackled the immediate problem faced by us in 1987 which was to reduce the very high rates of tax.  I doubt if even Deputy Yates would argue that a standard rate of 27 per cent and higher rate of 48 per cent are excessive by international standards. In fairness, he has acknowledged that they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Our main concern now is to remove as many low income families as possible from the tax net and to ensure that only high income taxpayers are obliged to pay tax at the higher rate.  That is what the partnership Government is committed to and I was glad to be able to move substantially in that area.  This involves a raising of the threshold at which taxpayers become liable to the higher rate of tax over and above the rate of earnings growth on a phased basis. Middle income taxpayers will be the main beneficiaries of this threshold raising exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally base broadening must be an element of tax reform.  To make out, as Deputy Yates does, that not only can you leave all existing reliefs untouched but that you can add new reliefs and simultaneously effect major reform of the taxation system is unsustainable.  The tax reform measures we have put in train, notably the increase in the standard rate band, will be of particular benefit to the middle income taxpayer. The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> makes clear the Government's intention that the progressive increase in the yield from the standardisation of discretionary reliefs should be used, as a priority, to expand the standard rate band.  What we have said is that what will be achieved by taxing <Col N="1418" /> everyone in the same way will be used to widen the bands.  Some Deputies said we never gave that commitment and that is why I reiterate it.</P>
    <P>The circumstances which obtained at the time of last year's budget forced the Government to introduce a temporary income levy in the context of exceptional budgetary difficulties arising from the repercussions of the international recession.  It was a means of seeking an equitable contribution from all income earners in a position to bear such a burden at at time of crisis.  Its introduction had to be seen against the backround of the income increases and tax improvements in recent years which produced a significant improvement in real take home pay generally and of the progress made in implementing measures envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I stressed at the time I announced the levy that it would be a temporary measure but I did not anticipate the total abolition of the levy would be feasible in this year's budget.  We do not have the benefit of hindsight in these matters.  We made the right decision and there is no inconsistency in the honest and responsible approach we took in introducing the levy and, when there were sufficient resources available, removing it.  I know that creates a difficulty for Deputy Yates because his party brought in two levies in the mid-1980s which still exist although they were temporary measures.</P>

      <P>The fact that the tax free allowance certificates issued to taxpayers with mortgages have shown decreases over the 1993-94 tax year in the allowance in respect of mortgage interest has been mentioned.  I am glad most Deputies understand it.  Taxpayers will see the full benefit of the budget improvements in their other allowances.  All taxpayers, apart from a few previously exempted on account of having a medical card, will benefit.  Decreases in tax free allowances have arisen mainly from the fact that the Revenue Commissioners have reduced the interest shown on TFAs in line with <Col N="1419" /> interest rate reductions.  If they did not do that they would be looking for their money back and hitting taxpayers excessively at the end of the year.  This part of the reduction reflects an unavoidable feature of all tax reliefs in respect of expenditure, namely that relief depends on what the taxpayer spends.</P>

      <P>The only element of the reduction which can be attributed to the changes in the 1994 budget &mdash; this applies only to higher rate taxpayers &mdash; is the scaling down on account of the move to standard rating.  It is clear that tax free allowance reductions have very little to do with the 1994 budget changes which will only have a modest effect this year.</P>
      <P>The case for standard rating discretionary reliefs has been well ventilated but for the benefit to Deputies I will repeat some of the main arguments.  Standard rating is a central part of the Government's strategy to broaden the tax base so as to improve mainstream income tax allowances and bands.  It is designed to put all taxpayers on an equal footing as regards the extent of support given through the tax system.  This means that the equity of the system is improved and at the same time funds are raised to contribute to reductions in tax rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many reputable bodies have recommended that short term social welfare benefits, including disability and unemployment benefit, should be treated as income for tax purposes.  I thank Deputies for their support for the changes I propose to make on Committee Stage.  We are following the recommendations made by the Commission on Taxation, the Commission on Social Welfare and the NESC.  Deputy Yates appears to have conveniently forgotten the substantial increases provided this <Col N="1420" /> year in disability and unemployment benefit rates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cox referred to the question of capital allowances on cars.  I would refer the Deputy to my Budget Statement in which I set out my intentions on the future development of the capital value threshold for company cars.

      <P>I forget the term he used, and I think he left for Africa as soon as he finished his speech.  I have set out my intentions on the future development of the capital value threshold for company cars for the next three years. The measures in this year's Bill reflect only the first instalment of a three year phased increase in the threshold.  The threshold will be increased to £14,000 next year and by 1996 it will equate with the average cost of a 1.6 litre car and its value will be reviewed annually thereafter.  As in the case of everything else, our policy in this area is logical and consistent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cox referred to the patent income relief.  The changes I am proposing in this area are designed to tackle unintended abuses of the scheme.  These changes were supported by Members on all sides who will be aware that over the past year or so the tax relief on patent income has become the focus of critical media attention, notably on foot of the revelations that certain financial institutions had apparently established patent holding companies so as to enable the payment of tax efficient remuneration to certain directors.  The Government is aware that companies are using the relief as a means of sheltering company income from tax which would otherwise be taxable at 40 per cent.  The decision no longer to allow the relief in respect of royalties derived from non-manufacturing activity where the payments are made between connected persons will prevent unintended abuses of the scheme and preserve the basic industrial policy thrust of the exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the withdrawal of <Col N="1421" /> the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax from mushroom growers, I was glad Deputy Cox acknowledged that the Government was bound by an EU Commission ruling and had no choice in the matter.  If Deputies read the section a little more carefully they will see that I did not decide to withdraw the 10 per cent rate overnight.  If necessary, I can spell out the reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some of the mushroom growers who visited me come from the Deputy's county and they are very happy with the change.  Mindful of the difficulties which an overnight change in tax treatment would have on the mushroom sector, the Government couched this legislation in such a way as to provide a considerable degree of breathing space to allow those affected to adjust to the new regime.  The Bill applies the higher 40 per cent rate of tax to income earned in accounting periods beginning on or after 1 June.  This will allow affected companies the flexibility to commence an accounting period on 31 May 1994 so that the higher tax rate will not apply in practice until the accounting period beginning 31 May 1995.  Because corporation tax is not paid until six months after the end of an accounting period, the above arrangements mean that a major mushroom company or an incorporated grower will not have to pay the tax due at the higher rate until November 1996.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates would be very upset if I did not refer to RPT and the other points he raised.</P>

      <P>This group was set up to examine the taxation system with a view to reducing the burden on taxpayers. As in previous years, the Government is endeavouring to reduce the burden on taxpayers.  Deputies opposite should compare the position which obtained some years ago when there were three tax rates of 65 per cent, 58 per cent and 35 per cent with the position today when we have two tax rates of 48 per cent and 27 per cent.  This year I introduced the biggest increase in the tax bands since 1984, at which stage the tax rates were 65 per cent and 58 per cent.  The Government has done an extraordinary job in the area of taxation.  The tax strategy group will continue to try to reduce the burden on taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I look forward to debating these issues in greater detail on Committee Stage. Some of the sections are very technical and I thank Deputy Yates for agreeing to take the debate in a more limited time.</P>

    <P>condemns the lack of consultation by the Minister for Education in recent decisions about new school building projects, in particular in Dunboyne, County Meath, and calls on the Minister for Education to hold a plebiscite among parents in the Dunboyne area to establish their choice of new second level school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night we debated in detail the merits and demerits of the proposal by the Minister to steamroll through the proposal to establish a community college in Dunboyne against the wishes of the parents and the Dunboyne community.  It was a long and heated debate and both sides projected their respective views.  The vast majority of people reading the newspapers today will note the groundswell of opinion.  The independent commentators and the people who are examining this problem analytically will view this as a litmus test on where this Minister stands on specific issues.  I had hoped that after 24 hours the Minister would have weighed up the pros and cons and taken into consideration the wishes of the people of Dunboyne and decided that democracy must prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dunboyne is a growing community on the periphery of Dublin and one that has no second facility.  It has lobbied hard and vigorously. There have been files, letters, representations and promises. During the year the expectation was that Dunboyne would get a second level community school and that it should be a <i>cause célèbre</i> of jubilation and rejoicing. This year £2.5 million has been allocated for this purpose.  Instead of the jubilation, applause and general acclaim that <Col N="1427" /> should greet such a development in a new maturing community the whole debacle is dragged into the mire not by the parents or the community but by the intransigence of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We are not speaking simply about Dunboyne but rather about democracy and the rights of parents as the primary educators.  Irrespective of what the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, Deputy Mary Wallace, Deputy Brian Fitzgerald or Deputies of this side of the House want, our views should prevail.  The primary educators, the paramount educators, the people who have the God-given as well as the constitutional right are the parents and their wishes should prevail.  They have both the constitutional and the natural rights.  They also have rights as citizens because we are talking about £2.5 million of taxpayers' money and, therefore, the public voice should prevail at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister what mandate she has to ride roughshod over the will of the parents.  All the indications are that the parents and the community want a community school.  A number of years ago that seemed to be the unanimous wish. The most recent poll indicated that it was the unanimous wish of the people.  We are asking the Minister to do the honourable, decent and democratic thing and listen to the people.  The best way to get the views of the people is to hold a plebiscite not in a heated atmosphere but in a cold, objective, analytical atmosphere where all the arguments would be listened to, argued and rationalised.</P>
    <P>Who told the Minister that a community college was the preferred choice of the people of Dunboyne?  There is another element to this issue which goes back to one of the Minister's predecessors. The first Minister for Education to launch the concept of parent power and to take them from their deferential position at the back of the class, raising their hand in an effort to get in on the education debate, was Deputy <Col N="1428" /> O'Rourke.  I believe Deputy O'Rourke would not have gone down this road.</P>
    <P>How can parents have confidence if such a fundamental issue represents a streamrolling over their views?  How can they have confidence in the Minister as their custodian, as Minister for Education, to uphold their rights?  How can they have any fundamental belief that when it come to management boards the Minister will ensure they will have equality of numbers, let alone the Chair? How can they have any confidence when it comes to selection committees and making choices of teachers and promotions that their constitutional and natural rights to be represented thereon will be upheld?</P>
    <P>I am not pro-VEC or anti-VEC; I am pro-choice, democracy and parents.  I ask the Minister to recant, repent, retract, withdraw, to go back to the drawing board and put this matter on hold.  We had hoped we were about to enter a new era of participation where parents would undertake their rightful place as equal partners in education.  What we have is an unseemly row.  I suspect there is a hidden agenda.  This is strange especially when we thought the Labour Party had matured into a more open attitude to education.  This appears to be a throwback to the old days when at Labour Party conferences the Minister and her colleagues were throwing their arms round each other and calling each other comrades.  I suspect there is a hidden agenda that is not in the best interests of education.</P>

      <P>I regret very much that he would use the parents and pupils of Dunboyne for what I would regard as party political purposes.  By all means we should have an education debate.  One thing I can say is that this Minister is not afraid to enter into debate or to listen to and discuss issues.  Last night she outlined the various steps, culminating in the National Education Convention, she has taken during her 14 months in office.  This was an exercise in trying to bring together the various strands involved in education to try to reach an agreed position on the White Paper and the education Act.  The facts do not bear out the allegations of a lack of discussion and consultation.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I should have sought permission to share time with my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement about the provision of a second level school in Dunboyne. Some people in Dunboyne would have preferred if the Minister had announced the establishment of a community or diocesan school, but in correspondence and at meetings I have had with the second level school committee at no time was I told that it was their policy to settle only for a second level voluntary, diocesan or community school.  I purposely <Col N="1430" /> put this question to them and I was told it was the policy to have a second level school provided in Dunboyne and that the type of management was not an issue.  On that basis I pursued the matter with various Ministers for Education and this Minister agreed to provide a second level school in the area.</P>
      <P>The first meeting on the Dunboyne second level school that I attended was held shortly after I was elected in 1987 and it was made quite clear that the people in the area wanted a second level school and would not settle for anything less.  In the period 1987-91 &mdash; I will not dwell on the detailed history as it was recounted by Deputy McGrath and the Minister &mdash; I tabled questions on several occasions to various Ministers for Education, particularly when I learned that the proposed school had been put on the back burner.</P>
      <P>I had a say in convincing the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, to undertake a further survey in the early nineties.  A review took place and the demographic information thrown up by that survey confirmed that the provision of a school was more urgent than had been anticipated when the project was put on the back burner.  Deputy Noel Davern, the then Minister, announced that a school would be provided and my constituency colleagues and I continued to make representations on a commencement date for the school.  Earlier I stated that at no stage did the second level school committee indicate to me that their policy was for a particular type of school.  I accept that some members of the committee may have thought that it was accepted that it would be a voluntary secondary school but let me emphasise again that whenever I asked that question I was told it was the committee's policy to have a second level school and the management of it was not at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to the Minister's decision I met with the second level school committee in Trim and the first question I put to them was whether it was their policy to provide a particular type of second level school and they confirmed what they had told me earlier, that they had <Col N="1431" /> no policy on the type of school.  To be fair to the members of the committee, some of them said that a view had been formed that it would be a voluntary or diocesan secondary school but it was not the policy of the committee to have a particular type of school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the survey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating what I was told.  The second level school committee had no policy on the type of school and I operated on the basis that they were seeking a second level school.  I was delighted, as were the people of Dunboyne, to hear that a second level school would be built.  I have no hesitation in commending the Minister for making that decision.</P>
      <P>People vote with their feet and in this instance 120 parents turned up on enrolment day to enrol their children in the school.  As far as I am concerned that is the vote that counts.  It is the views of people who will attend the school rather than those who may or may not attend the school that are important.  I have no doubt the Minister's decision will be vindicated in the future when the school is comparable to any other school in County Meath.  I object to the undertone on the type of school approved by the Minister.  A number of Opposition speakers have addressed this subject and have acknowledged that the vocational education committee system is good and that they have no objections to it but when I question what is underlying these objections to a community college I can only come to the conclusion that some people have a problem about attending a vocational education committee school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schools are almost identical.  In a community school there are joint trustees comprising the religious and vocational education committee.  There is also a deed of trust.  Both sides have a say in determining the policy and the philosophy of the school.  While a community college is owned by the vocational education committee the policy and philosophy is decided jointly by the <Col N="1432" /> vocational education committee and religious.</P>
    <P>The board of management in a community school comprises three members of the religious, three representatives of the vocational education committee, two teachers and two parents.  There is a slight difference in the board of management of a community college which comprises three members of the religious, three representatives of the vocational education committee, two teachers and two parents but there is an option to have a nominee of the minority religion.  I hope no one in this House will object to this.</P>
    <P>While a community school reports directly to the Minister for Education the community college reports to the vocational education committee.  Under the deed of trust and the agreements in place there is an onus on the management of a community school to ensure provision for religious education.  The same onus is on the management in a community college.</P>
    <P>There was a reference by Deputy Keogh in particular to the rights of parents under the Constitution to opt for the system of education of their choice. There is little difference in the system of education provided in a community college and a community school.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment about the way in which teaching staff are appointed in a community college.  The procedures laid down in the model agreement for community colleges in the Archdiocese of Dublin are almost identical to those laid down for community schools. They provide for public advertisement, a selection board with an equal number of representatives of the religious and the vocational education committee with a Department of Education inspector.  In the case of a community school the choice of the selection board is ratified by the board and by the vocational education committee in the case of a community college.  If for any reason the board or the vocational education committee should disagree with the choice made the matter has to be referred to the Minister for Education.  The provisions for the appointment of staff are almost identical <Col N="1433" /> and are designed to ensure that the procedures are seen to be fair.</P>

      <P>They are not.  All teachers in the vocational education committee system in County Meath reject the suggestion that the appointments were political.  As a former member of the vocational education committee, I can stand over this.  It is time members of the Opposition stopped complaining and making allegations and concentrated on the real issues in education.  In making this allegation they are casting a slur on every member of the TUI and of the teaching profession in vocational education committee schools.  I reject this outright.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The curriculum laid down for post primary schools by the Minister is followed in community colleges and community schools and teachers must have similar qualifications. The length of the school year and the examination system is the same in both schools and pupils leave with the same educational qualifications.  Can anyone seriously argue that the provision of a community college undermines in some way the right of parents to opt for the system of education that their children deserve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of democracy was raised. What body is more democratic than a vocational education committee which comprises public representatives and people nominated by parents and other groups?

      <P>It has been stated that Mr. Cooney approved the provision of a secondary school in Dunboyne in 1987.  I have checked the records in the Department of Education and the only reference I can find is to a post primary school approved in 1987 by Mr. Cooney.</P>
      <P>It has been stated also that voluntary secondary schools are being neglected. This is not true.  Capital expended on voluntary schools last year amounted to £6.6 million.  It is projected that approximately £10 million will be spent this year, which shows that secondary schools have not been abandoned by the Minister or the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister for Education has given the go-ahead for the <Col N="1435" /> school in Dunboyne and that it will be a community college as I am committed to the maintenance and strengthening of the vocational education committee system. I commend the Minister for taking this difficult decision.  I have said to deputations that I do not want the provision of this school to be hindered.  I want to see it going ahead.

      <P>I listened to the debate last night and tonight, and there are a few corrections that I want to make. It was exactly 25 years ago that Father Rispin, then parish priest in Dunboyne, announced on the altar the purchase of the site for a post-primary school.  It was also 25 years ago that Deputy John Bruton was elected as a Deputy for that area.  Twenty five years ago I was a nine year old child attending the Dunboyne primary school.  I was one of the children who had to go to school in Dublin because there was no post-primary school in Dunboyne.  Twenty years after Father Rispin made that announcement, I was elected to the Dáil on a commitment to fight for a school for Dunboyne.  That is what I have done, with my fellow public representatives.  The announcement has now been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few corrections are warranted relating to what the Fine Gael spokesperson on education said last night, including his comment about Pat Cooney approving the school.  Nothing happened in Dunboyne until the school was sanctioned in February 1992 by the Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Noel Davern.  In January 1992 I was told by the post-primary school committee that we needed to get a letter from the Department of Education <Col N="1436" /> that included the phrase &ldquo;the school is now sanctioned&rdquo;.  In February 1992 we got that letter and from then on things started to happen.  People from the Department of Education came to Dunboyne to survey the site and, in July 1992, the five Deputies at the time wrote to the Minister supporting his proposals, informing the Minister that the bishop was suggesting the building of a diocesan secondary school and that they would support that too if it meant speeding up the matter.  That needs to be clarified. The question of a diocesan secondary school came into the debate because it was seen as a quicker option, and for no other reason that I know of.  Until then we had always spoken about a community school.</P>

      <P>I had no doubt about the parents' choice.  I am 100 per cent certain that the parents chose a community school in 1987; 70 per cent of the people voted for that.  I believe that and I do not question it.  I wonder why Fine Gael is questioning it by seeking a plebiscite. I suggest that it would be better to back the 1987 decision of 70 per cent of the people to look for a community school.  One of the Fine Gael speakers referred last night to the fact that in 1986 Ashbourne chose a community school which is to open in September this year. In 1987 Dunboyne chose a community school.  The school is opening in September 1994 as a community college.  If we are all sure about what took place in 1986 in Ashbourne and in 1987 in Dunboyne, why is there need for a plebiscite? We know what the outcome would be.  We know too that the Minister chose a different type of school.</P>

      <P>Two years ago the school was sanctioned by the then Minister, Deputy Noel Davern.  Everybody <Col N="1437" /> knew that the big question was money.  I worked closely with the Minister, Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach, and lobbied the Minister for Finance for extra money for the post-primary school buildings programme, not just for Dunboyne but for the extension in Dunshaughlin and the Ashbourne school.  In south-east Meath we were starved of places at post-primary level because there was not enough money in the post-primary budget.</P>
      <P>In the Estimates that came out before Christmas there was extra money and we rejoiced at that.  On budget night there was more money for the post-primary school budget.  That night, 26 January, I met with the Minister in her office, having asked Deputy Fitzgerald to come with me, to confirm whether, funding not now being an issue, we could go ahead with the announcement relating to Dunboyne and, on the basis that the Hartstown school went ahead in 1992, make the announcement in February so that the school would be in place for September 1994, albeit in temporary accommodation. We know that the new school could not be built in that short a time. Two weeks later the £2.5 million announcement was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It was made. Although we were delighted with the £2.5 million there were three things that we had to question.  Two of them have since been solved.  The first was that there was no mention of temporary accommodation for September 1994 and for us in Dunboyne that was critical.  Neither was there mention that even if there was temporary accommodation for September 1994, it would be located in Dunboyne. The third question related to the management structure of the community college.  The temporary accomodation was agreed two weeks later for September 1994.  It was also agreed that the children would not go to Hartstown but would have to be housed in Dunboyne in prefabricated buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all this we are very grateful.  We <Col N="1438" /> are grateful for the £2.5 million contract which will be started in Dunboyne this time next year and completed by September 1996.  We are grateful that temporary accommodation will be ready for September 1994 and that it will be located in Dunboyne.  The only disappointment related to the management structure. Certainly the people of Dunboyne did vote in 1987 for a community school and they were surprised at the announcement of a community college.  The proposal relating to a diocesan secondary school was mooted only to be helpful; we thought it would be a quicker option because the bishop owned the site.  The bishop said he would build a diocesan secondary school in Dunboyne if it would hurry things up, while the Minister said we should have a community college.  In the middle were the people who wanted to compromise, who voted for a community school in 1987.  The bishop's proposed school would be 100 per cent Church-controlled; the Minister's proposed school would be 100 per cent State-controlled. The one in between, the community school, would be controlled equally by Church and State.  In 1987, and again at the public meeting in February 1994, the people asked if the Minister would agree to a compromise which would make everybody happy.  It was a pity the compromise could not have been reached.  We should have been lighting bonfires in Dunboyne at the prospect of a £2.5 million contract coming into our area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We are delighted, but it is a pity about the management structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers spoke about the situation in Dublin.  I will refer to the County Cork model which has a management structure which is a 50:50 split and, instead of four members of the vocational education committee and two representatives of the bishop.  There are three representatives for each.  That is something that can be considered.  The <Col N="1439" /> board of management in Dunboyne is not due to be appointed until 16 May 1994.</P>
    <P>Sixty children enrolled on enrolment day and another four have enrolled since. To be fair to the principal teacher who has been appointed to this school, he has done an excellent job in meeting with parents.  The people who have enrolled their children in that school have given it their vote of confidence.  However, 50 per cent of the people who turned up on enrolment day questioned the management structure.  They wanted to back the school and not boycott it.  They did not want to jeopardise it but they were certainly concerned about the management structure.  Nobody wants to do anything that will delay the building of this school.  A plebiscite might delay it and we know what the result would be. We know that 70 per cent of the people wanted a community school and none of us is in any doubt about that.</P>
    <P>The motion provided an opportunity to have a debate on this important issue. I support the Minister's amendment because it highlights the greatly increased budget for capital spending on second level education.  I lobbied the Minister, Deputy Ahern, for some time in this regard and am delighted he has provided the additional money for the Department of Education.  I support the amendment which refers to the decision of the Minister to sanction a second level school in Dunboyne.  She must be congratulated for her work at the education conference in Dublin Castle and she would be a very popular person in Dunboyne if she reconsidered the management structure.</P>

      <P>The motion tabled by Fine Gael purports to be essentially about parental involvement in education and the rights of parents to be consulted. However, as I suspected, it is essentially about the type of second level school that should be located in Dunboyne.  Having listened to the contributions of two colleagues <Col N="1440" /> from the Meath constituency I suspect this is a local issue and somewhat similar to the position of the unfortunate Meath corner back in Croke Park last Sunday.</P>

      <P>As I do not represent the constituency and am not a member of a party which has a representative there, I am at a loss in regard to this debate.  I am depending on the fairly extensive press coverage of the issue and the debate here to establish what this is about.</P>
      <P>From my understanding of the matter, it is essentially a question of whether the school in Dunboyne should be a community college or a community school. There are many parts of this country, including parts of my constituency which I share with the Minister, where parents would be very glad to have the luxury of debating whether their second level school should be a community school or a community college.  In many areas parents have been seeking a second level school for years.  This has been the case in Dunboyne for the past 25 years since the parish priest first called for the establishment of a community school, notwithstanding his opinion of Deputy Bruton's candidacy during the general election and its influence on the outcome of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people cannot understand why there should be a debate about the difference between a community college and a community school.  Their titles, buildings and the subjects taught in them are similar.  At one time a vocational education committee controlled school was assumed to teach mainly practical subjects whereas secondary schools were assumed to teach academic subjects, but that is no longer the case.  All schools in the second level sector now teach a similar range of subjects.  Practical subjects are taught in some of the more exclusive schools and academic subjects, up to honours leaving certificate level, are taught in vocational education committees.  Postleaving certificate courses which were once almost exclusively confined to the <Col N="1441" /> vocational education committee sector are now being held in the voluntary sector.  Therefore, the same subjects are taught in community schools and community colleges.  Teachers in both schools must qualify in the same way, have similar professional competence and there are only minor differences in their boards of management.  It is regrettable if this is a question of whether there should be three representatives from the vocational education committee and three from the Church or whether the ratio should be 4:2.  Most people would regard such a debate as obscure.</P>
    <P>The only difference I discern relates to the question of control and ownership and it is regrettable that it is debated so vehemently when there is a willingness on the part of most people involved in education &mdash; the Minister, vocational education committees, parents or teacher unions &mdash; to co-operate in producing the best possible education system and schooling for our children.  It is also regrettable that some people, particularly members of the churches, have sought to include as a central element in the debate the question of control and ownership.  In the lead up to the education convention, I recall spokespersons for the Catholic Church in particular making controversial remarks about the question of ownership and control and their right to hire and fire teachers.  It is unwise of the Church authorities to place that issue on the agenda because other people do not consider it of such importance. It is as if the churches think there is a hidden agenda and that somebody wants to drive them out of education.  I do not know of anybody who wants to do that.  They have made an honourable and generous contribution to education and many of us are beneficiaries of the educational skills of their members.  Some of the best educationalists are in the churches and I am not aware of anybody in the educational field who wants to push them out of education.  Most people in education are trying to involve the churches in a new relationship in the education field, a field in which there is an equal relationship involving parents, <Col N="1442" /> teachers, the churches and the State representing the taxpayers who provide the money for the educational service.  A major debate is taking place as to what balance should be struck in that area.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Dunboyne school issue has been elevated to a type of test case in this debate.  I respect the opinion of parents on this issue, but it is becoming a test case for an obscure battle about control of educational resources that should not be part of a debate on education.  Although I respect Deputy McGrath's entitlement to do so, it is regrettable that this matter has been presented here cloaked in the velvet glove of the notion of parental involvement. Effectively, what we are asked to do here is to say it should be a community school.  That is what this motion is about and I do not propose to support it.</P>
    <P>As the issue has been put on the agenda, perhaps the Minister and other interests in education should take on board the question of the role and involvement of parents in the educational system.  I am a strong believer in the involvement of parents in the educational system and in the principle of parents as the primary educators.  That should not be confined to periodic consultation with representative bodies of parents, be it at the education forum or at meetings between Department representatives or other educational authorities and parents. The principle and idea of the rights of parents to determine the education of their children should be pursued more actively.  It is encouraging that this issue has been put on the agenda, albeit with a different end in view.</P>

      <P>I will deal with the question of school choice.  Many schools have been built in the past 25 to 30 years, especially in developing urban areas around the perimeter of Dublin and other cities.  There was little consultation with parents about what type of schools they should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In the area of primary education the question of parental choice may be more immediate.  It is argued that children attending second level schools are more mobile and in theory there is some degree of choice.  However, at primary level one is stuck with the school in the area in which one lives.  During the past 25 to 30 years few parents were consulted about the type of school in which their child should be educated. When an area was being developed a small committee was established comprising officers of the local authority, representatives of Archbishop's House and of the Department of Education.  They decided before people moved in to new housing estates what type of schools should be provided.  The result was a crude head count on religious grounds. The numbers of Catholics and Protestants were counted and a decision was made as to how many Catholic schools were needed and where schools for other denomination should be located.</P>
      <P>Parents who wanted a different type of education, whether multi-denominational, Gael scoileanna or whatever, had to obtain it the hard way.  In many cases they had to battle against the most outrageous obstacles put in their way when they tried to establish forms of schooling to meet their needs.  That is not the way our educational resources should be organised.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education should take up the statements by Bishop Smith and other bishops about parental involvement. She should discuss with them the establishment of a permanent arrangement for the consultation of parents on the choice of school to be established in particular areas.  She should do so in a way which establishes parental wishes.  In the primary area she should establish the number of children over a given period who will require denominational education of one type or another, multi-denominational education or a Gael scoile and seek to ensure that the resources for school buildings are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should seek to put back into the educational system school buildings <Col N="1444" /> no longer in use.  I asked questions about the number of schools closed in recent years.  I have details of figures from the Minister given in a reply on 17 November last and from her predecessor, Deputy Brennan, on 14 October 1992. Thirty-seven schools were closed in 1988, 21 in 1989, 18 in 1990, 27 in 1991, 21 in 1992 and 13 in 1993.  Many national schools are no longer in use and I ask the Minister what has happened to them.  In many cases the property is being sold for speculative housing and other types of development.</P>
    <P>Recently, the owners of St. Anne's School in Milltown, which has not been closed, spotted a chance to make money. Like the owners of the Shamrock Rovers grounds, they discovered there was great money to be made by closing the school and selling the property for housing or other speculative development.  Many schools provided by taxpayers' money but vested in private ownership are being sold for such development.  Many are located in communities in which there is a demand for an alternative type of schooling.  That practice should not be allowed.  If there is a willingness now &mdash; the Minister should put this to the test &mdash; on the part of church authorities to give parents the ultimate say and recognise their right to be primary educators, that writ should apply beyond Dunboyne across the whole educational system.  The wishes of parents should be established. It should also be established if churches are prepared to allow school buildings to be used for alternative education purposes when no longer required for use as a denominational school.</P>
    <P>The involvement of parents in education has been put on the Dáil agenda. We should put this issue to the test by making parents the primary educators. Let us have democracy in that area.  With available technology it is possible to have a formal system whereby parents will be periodically consulted about their educational needs.  Depending on the demographic shifts over time those needs will inevitably change.  A primary school building may be no longer needed for that purpose but there is no reason it <Col N="1445" /> could not be used at second level or for adult education classes instead of being sold out of the educational system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the issue of educational involvement is on the agenda.  In the context of the controversy in Dunboyne it is something of a Trojan horse.  The idea should be taken up, acted on and parents given real involvement to vindicate their constitutional rights in respect of the education of their children. I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Deenihan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The taste of democracy becomes bitter when its fullness is denied.  In the case of Dunboyne the taste of democracy is extraordinarily bitter because that fullness is denied in the most fundamental way.  In a country that purports to be a democracy, democracy is denied in the issue of parental right to choice in education and the right to a say in the schooling of their children.  The parents of Dunboyne have been denied the right and that is unprecedented in the history of Irish education.  We have come to associate this position with the totalitarian states of Eastern Europe before the collapse of communism.  The Minister's decision is evocative of Henry Ford's dictum: you can have any colour you like provided it is black.  The Minister is saying you can have any school you like provided it is a community college and in doing so she has contrived to cast a cloud over the splendid work in which these schools are engaged.</P>

      <P>The question being asked by those who care and by those who are interested in education is why the Minister is behaving in this way.  She may argue that she is being influenced by democratic considerations, but this is palpable nonsense in that the majority of those involved, in this case parents, have demonstrated again and again their preference for a deed of trust community school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> Many people involved in education are firmly convinced that the decision reflects the ideological bent and disposition of the Minister and Government.  If this is an accurate analysis of the position the Minister should have the courage of her convictions, come clean and declare publicly that the decision is primarily ideological and that this is the shape of things to come.  She has launched the education service in a direction without precedent.</P>
    <P>Some cynics are of the opinion that the decision is not based on principle, that it is a sop to the vocational education committees.  This is the worst of all worlds in that it patronises the vocational education committees who deserve better than to be treated in such a fashion.  Why should the Minister propose a sop to the vocational education committees when she is about to dismantle them under her proposal for a reorganisation of education and the introduction of regional bodies?  It is perplexing.  Maybe the Minister blundered into this decision because she did not know or comprehend the differences and distinctions between community school and community college. Whatever the reason behind the decision, whatever the principled pragmatic misadventure, the House, the education system and the country are entitled to an explanation and a rationale, but this has not been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Green Paper and the forthcoming White Paper and Education Bill, the Minister travelled the country preaching the virtues of democracy, accountability, transparency and partnership.  The principle behind the Minister's decision on the Dunboyne issue amounts to political nonsense.  It is a high price to pay for the principle of democracy when the Minister violates Labour Party policy on parental involvement in education, the principles and commitments in the Programme for Government and the guidelines of the Department of Education in this matter. For example, Circular M27/91 to management of secondary schools states:</P>
    <P>The Department recognises that schools-family relationships are particularly <Col N="1447" /> important.  As the primary educators of the child, the parents have a right to be assured that the child's needs are being met by the school.  It follows that the parents should be given as much information as possible on all aspects of the child's progress and development.  Parents as a body are also entitled to know whether the school and the education system are meeting the children's needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister is corrected by her Department's guidelines.  This is not democracy or partnership at work.  What about the principle of accountability in education? The Minister singularly failed in this criterion also.  Why has there not been an explanation or clarification on this extraordinary decision?  The Minister has continually fudged this issue.</P>
    <P>Where does the Minister stand on the issue of transparency?  Will she explain to the House, the education system and the country why she attempted in a hamfisted and bizarre fashion to use the Official Secrets Acts to curtail legitimate debate on a matter of public interest and attempted to extend the operations of that Act to responsible partners in the education process?  This may be GUBU II at one level, but at another level it is serious in that it represents a conscious, deliberate attempt to stymie debate on an issue of public concern.  It contrasts most acutely with the commitment of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to open government.  My information is that the Minister attempted such a course of action.</P>

The whole world knows that despite their loyalty to the Minister, the Government and the institutions of State, many key officials believe that the Minister's decision is ludicrous and they have attempted to distance themselves from it.  The Minister must confront this reality rather than engage in a cover up through the mechanism of the Official <Col N="1448" /> Secrets Act.

The Minister stated last night that no one partner should dominate, but the Minister is in breach of that principle in the Dunboyne case, or does she not see herself as a partner in this enterprise?</P>
      <P>In Dunboyne the principles of democracy are being undermined and subvented by a Government with a huge majority.  We find that some are more equal than others.  We are experiencing the antics of big brother and the process of thought control.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's colleague, Deputy McGrath, argued strenuously about the exclusive right of parents to decide on the type of school their children attend.  The Minister dealt with this argument comprehensively yesterday and it is the most reported part of her speech in today's media.  Parents are one of the partners but there are other partners involved and there is also the issue of the general good of society.  The Minister, in her brief career, has an outstanding record of consultation with all interests.  A previous Fianna Fáil speaker said the previous Minister for Education introduced parent power.  This Minister has increased that impetus.  In the national education convention she deliberately went out of her way to consult all <Col N="1450" /> interests in education and she did so on her position paper on local education structures.</P>
      <P>This Minister has had a tremendous record of consulting the interests involved, far more than any other Minister for Education in the history of the State.  I have had to listen to this nonsense about ideology from Deputy Deenihan and it is quite evident from him and his colleagues' contribution that whatever decision was made by the Minister would have been elevated to a statement of national policy.  If she had decided on a voluntary secondary school, this would have been seen as the pattern for the future and likewise, if she had opted for a community school.  The kind of arguments now being put forward about ideology and so on would have been applied to any decision the Minister might make.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the decision made by the Minister relates to a particular case, namely, Dunboyne.  It does not represent a statement of national policy.  It does not prejudge White Paper proposals nor does it pre-empt any debate surrounding the White Paper.  A community college was chosen for Dunboyne because it is part of the clear pattern developed and enunciated by many Minister, as far back as 1976 and prior to the current Minister taking office, as to the most suitable school for a green field situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be said that the saddest role in this whole phoney debate in the past few days has been played by the Leader of the Opposition.  He is the local Deputy, the person who should know better and who has one of the longest careers in this House.  Deputy Wallace remarked that the struggle for this school went on for 25 years but during that time the Deputy from Dunboyne was a Member of this House and held high office, including a post in the Department of Education. Yet, was there any progress in relation to this matter.  There was no progress until this Minister came forward with this wonderful news for the people and the children of Dunboyne.  Deputy Bruton should not interfere or play politics with <Col N="1451" /> the education of the children of his own area.  That is a most regrettable course of action and one that he should not have embarked upon.</P>

      <P>It has been said that the Minister is in some way trying to lever the Church out of education but if one were to examine the pattern of capital expenditure in 1993 and 1994 in relation to second level education, they would see that this Minister has displayed a most even-handed approach between the voluntary sector, community schools and community colleges.  The facts and the figures are there as she elucidated them for us last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Capital expenditure has been allocated depending on the specific needs of each situation.  I am proud to say I am a teacher and for most of my career I taught with the Christian Brothers and with teachers in other voluntary secondary schools.  It was one of the most astonishing achievements of this Minister, and this partnership Government, that two of the most famous Christian Brothers schools in my area on the north side, St. David's CBS in Artane and St. Aidan's CBS in Whitehall, got the go ahead this year for new buildings following a 25 year struggle.  This Minister does not carry ideological baggage and it is nonsense to infer that she does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the constitutional issues.  They do not affect the Dunboyne situation and, furthermore, there are more complex and diverse views, and even arguments, on the constitutional issues, that the constitutional provisions conflict with each other.  I do not propose to pretend they can be analysed and fully clarified in this debate but many of the comments made display a misunderstanding of the complex constitutional issues relating to education <Col N="1452" /> and a disregard for the role and constitutional rights of the general community.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision in no way diminishes or attacks the constitutional rights of parents as the primary educators of children, with which we all agree.  It is a gross over-simplification of a complex area of constitutional law to imply that parents have the final direct say in all and every aspect of the educational system. The decision in no way impacts negatively on the religious, moral, intellectual, physical or social education of children.  Neither does it represent coercion by the State, in violation of the conscience of lawful preference of parents, to send their children to a school. These parental rights are acknowledged and guaranteed by the Constitution.  The decision is one properly arrived at by the constitutionally appropriate arm of Government which, in the context of the separation of powers, also provided for in the Constitution, is charged with the allocation of resources in the interest of the whole community.</P>
    <P>A community college will be opened in Dunboyne in September 1994.  As the Minister stated last night, the people of Dunboyne effectively voted with their feet on that famous day of 9 April, and voted confidence in the new school and the new principal.</P>

I am confident that in 12 months time the people of Dunboyne will remember Minister Bhreathnach as the Minister who gave them a school and these political, opportunistic and hypocritical arguments, which have been advanced by Deputy Bruton, among others, will have faded into the oblivion they deserve.</P>

Some inaccurate statements were made tonight by the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, and Deputy Mary Wallace.  They indicated that I said last night that a former Minister for Education Patrick Cooney, had sanctioned a voluntary secondary school for Dunboyne. That is incorrect and I have been completely misquoted.  I will quote from my script for the record of the House:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 this committee got a commitment from the then Minister for Education, Gemma Hussey, that a second level school would be built in Dunboyne.  This sanction was progressed a step further by the new Minister for Education, Patrick Cooney, who, in 1986 gave the go ahead for <Col N="1454" /> either a voluntary secondary school or a community school.</P>
    <P>That is the quote and I would ask Deputies not to misquote me in future.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil and Labour, by supporting the imposition of <Col N="1455" /> one particular type of school in Dunboyne against the wishes of local parents, are showing that they do not believe in partnership in education.  They are willing to involve parents in minor educational decisions but when it comes to a major decision, such as choosing the type of school for a particular area, the Minister alone makes the decision.  That is not partnership.</P>
      <P>This represents a major change of policy for Fianna Fáil.  Up to now, Fianna Fáil supported the principle of allowing parents a real say in deciding the management structure of their local school. In Ashbourne, for example, Fianna Fáil supported the following of precedents set by previous Governments and agreed to allow local people there decide whether they wanted a community school or a community college.  In Dunboyne, under pressure from the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Fianna Fáil is accepting the statist principle that the Minister alone should decide the issue. The parents of Dunboyne are informed and wise enough, and have sufficient commitment to social justice, to be allowed to make a choice for themselves between a community college or a community school without having a &ldquo;superior&rdquo; person deciding the issue for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour Party speakers in this debate have tried to say that those who demand a right to choose for the parents of Dunboyne have some antipathy towards community colleges or vocational education committee run schools in general.  This is not the case.  I demand a plebiscite be held on this issue for one reason: it is the democratic entitlement of the people of Dunboyne to make that choice.  The Minister's decision to refuse to allow the people the option of choosing a community school or a diocesan school is capable of being construed as a reflection, by her, on the quality of education provided in community schools.  She is <Col N="1456" /> not willing to allow the people in Dunboyne to choose a community school.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's hidden agenda? What has she against community schools that she would not even allow the people in Dunboyne the opportunity to choose a community school but decided her will had to be imposed?  If we are looking for a hidden agenda, as the Labour Party members seem to be, and for people to blame and malicious motives behind the scenes, we might look at the malicious motives of the Minister in saying that the people should not be allowed the option of choosing a community school.</P>

What has she against the many diocesan and voluntary schools that she would not allow them the possibility of deciding in favour of either of these?  What has she against those who teach in community schools, secondary schools and those who attend community schools?  What has she against those parents who choose to send their children to community schools rather than community colleges?  What is the poor opinion she has of those people that she would not allow the people in Dunboyne to select such a school?</P>
      <P>This is a national not a local issue. Those who reject the principle that Dunboyne parents should have a say in this case are seeking to establish a new principle that all parents be excluded from decisions in regard to the choice of management structure for their local school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for permitting <Col N="1463" /> me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Ireland is one of only three European countries whose citizens are required to apply for a visa when visiting the United States of America, the others being Portugal and Greece.  Citizens of other European Union countries like Britain, France and Germany are not required to apply for non-immigrant visas.  I understand the historical reasons related to the extent of emigration from this country to the United States.  While the level of emigration is still high, compared with, say, Britain, there is no reason for the United States authorities to treat Irish citizens as second-class Europeans whose entry to and stay in the United States has to be controlled on the same basis as Third World countries.</P>
      <P>Given the alleged influence of the Irish lobby in the United States it is remarkable that this discriminatory practice has been allowed continue.  Football fans travelling to the United States for the World Cup this year will encounter those restrictive visa requirements and many fans will be refused initially.  It is to be hoped that the special arrangements being put in place will result in all of them being able to travel.</P>
      <P>The administration of the visa requirement by the United States Embassy in Dublin impacts most severely on young Irish people wishing to travel to the United States for family or private reasons.  As a Member of this House I have come across many cases in recent years of young people being refused visas for no apparent reason than that they were single, in their early twenties and did not own a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem seems to be that the United States authorities assume that an applicant for a non-immigrant visa intends to remain in the United States unless he or she can prove otherwise.  The most recent case I have come across is most absurd.  I will make details of that case available to the Tánaiste in the hope that he can prevail on the United States Embassy to issue a visa.  The case concerns an applicant of 18 years of age who <Col N="1464" /> intended to travel to the United States at the end of May to attend a family wedding. He had planned to travel with seven other members of his family, all of whom applied for visas at the same time and have now been issued with them.  One member of the travelling party is the 18-year-old girlfriend of the applicant but, as she is a United Kingdom citizen, she does not need a visa.  The young man concerned wrote to the United States Embassy to have his application reviewed.  He submitted letters from FÁS with whom he had been undertaking a training course, the girl who was to be married, the priest who was to conduct the service, his parish priest and myself, all attesting to his intention to return to Ireland after the wedding.  Again he was refused and effectively told not to reapply.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Government to make the strongest possible representation to the United States authorities over the grossly unfair treatment of young people who are applying for visas to enter the United States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for raising this matter tonight as it gives me a further opportunity to outline the Government's concerns in this area and to inform the House of our continuing efforts to achieve a resolution of the problems being experienced by some Irish applicants for visitor visas to the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions about the issuing of visas to travel to the United States are, of course, a matter for the US authorities. However, my Department maintains close contact with the US Embassy and we are generally familiar with their procedures and the incidence of difficulties and refusals.  The US Embassy informs us that up to 90 per cent of all non-immigrant visa applications are processed entirely by mail.  In the 10 per cent or so of cases where applications are the subject of queries by the embassy, the applicants are interviewed.  Most applicants are able to satisfy the Embassy's requirements at the interview stage and <Col N="1465" /> receive their visas.  A review channel is also available to those whose applications are initially refused following their interviews. Reviews take up to ten days but are normally completed well within that time and result in a further significant proportion of visa approvals.  Reapplications are accepted from those turned down following the review stage and who wish to submit additional documentation in support of their applications.</P>
    <P>Apart from the disappointment for individuals whose applications are refused, the level of refusal in recent years has also had the effect of preventing Ireland's inclusion in the visa waiver pilot programme established under the United States Immigration Reform and Control Act, 1986, as I outlined and spoke of in detail on Question Time today.  This pilot programme enables nationals of countries with relatively low visa refusal and overstay rates to visit the US for up to 90 days without the need to obtain a visa before travelling.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in the Dáil earlier today, a country may be included in this programme if the number of refusals of applications for non-immigrant visas by its citizens in the previous two years is no more than 2 per cent of total applications on average, and less than 2.5 per cent in each of the two years.  The number of refusals in the case of applications by Irish citizens remains above those limits.</P>
    <P>The Government is very anxious to see Ireland included in the visa waiver pilot programme.  We and our friends in Congress continue actively to lobby in pursuit of this aim.  We are very glad that Congressman Frank McCloskey and Ronald Machtley recently introduced in the House of Representatives a Bill which, if passed by Congress, would ensure Ireland's inclusion in the programme and, consequently, the suspension of the visa requirement for most Irish people going to the US on short visits.</P>
    <P>While it is too early at this stage to say what the outcome of the McCloskey-Machtley and other initiatives will be&mdash; and one has to recognise that there is always opposition to proposals to facilitate easier access to the US &mdash; I am <Col N="1466" /> hopeful that Congress will adopt legislation soon which will allow the US authorities to admit Irish people for short visits without the need to obtain a visa in advance.  The Government is doing all it can to maximise support for the McCloskey-Machtley Bill and other such measures and I will be raising the matter personally with the US authorities over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The suspension or ending of the visitor visa requirement would obviously solve the problems of intending short term Irish visitors to the US mentioned by Deputy Gilmore.  However, this will not happen in time for the World Cup finals which will be attended by very many Irish team supporters.  We are, therefore, continuing to press the US authorities to be as understanding and flexible as possible to ensure that all genuine supporters receive visas.  We are in continuous contact with the US Embassy on the matter. We recognise that arriving at fair decisions while respecting the statutory guidelines by which the embassy is bound can sometimes be difficult.  I am told that evidence of previous travel in support of the Irish team, or having a match ticket or a credible prospect of obtaining one, or of being a member of a supporters' club, can be crucially important in borderline cases.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Gilmore wishes to have any special case addressed I assure him that I, as a Deputy for the constituency of Kerry North, have had to make a contact, on many occasions both in Opposition and in Government in relation to such applicants and I would be only glad to offer my services to him.  We are also assured that applications are not being refused by the embassy solely because people are unemployed, are unmarried, are in low paid jobs or are in certain age categories.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the American Embassy, despite individual cases as Deputy Gilmore mentioned, in recent times the Ambassador and her staff have been particularly courteous and helpful.  I will make my office available to the Deputy if he wants me to take up any particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter could be described as the reverse of the problem raised by Deputy Gilmore the difficulties experienced by some Americans on their application for naturalisation.  They feel just as aggrieved as those young Irish people refused entry to the US on a holiday visa basis.  They find it difficult to explain why they too are refused.</P>
      <P>In excess of 40 million Americans claim Irish ancestry.  Irish people have a close affinity with the US.  More than any other country Irish people are welcome in the US.  When our several hundreds of soccer supporters visit the US for the World Cup they will discover this at first hand.  Since the introduction of the Morrison visa programme more than 28,500 visas have been issued to Irish applicants which will enable them to work in lucrative jobs in America and to advance their future prospects.  Already this year 7,800 visas have been allocated under the Morrison visa programme.  I too have heard of refusals and in certain cases the American Embassy was wrong.  Generally speaking they are fair in the sense that everyone is treated equally.  Even if a politician contacts them they will not change their mind on an application. Despite the affinity and the friendship built up between US and Ireland on a political, social and cultural basis down through the years Americans who apply for naturalisation experience considerable difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of a few cases and one in particular of a lady refused naturalisation which has been appealed on a number of occasions.  From the story she told me I see no reason for her refusal.  She corresponded with me recently and explained how she likes Ireland.  Since she studied geography in school her desire was to come to Ireland some day and she did so nine years ago.  She sold her home, made other necessary arrangements and in February 1987 she settled down here. She said she has a great love for the Irish people, the land and the climate and pointed out that the extremely hot summers in the US were becoming more <Col N="1468" /> difficult to endure.  She would be prepared to work here and does not wish to return to the US.</P>
    <P>I understand the Ambassador has taken a keen interest in her case.  She said that since coming to Ireland she has been struck by the difficulties faced by Americans attempting to work here and is trying with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, to reach a satisfactory accommodation.  Given the warm and exceptionally cordial relationships between our two countries, all that has been done and is being done to allow Irish citizens to emigrate and work in the US she hopes that some way can be found to accommodate these applicants.  I appeal to the Minister to show leniency in this case and to treat applicants as fairly as possible.</P>

      <P>I regret that I am unable to respond in a comprehensive manner due to the fact that Deputy Deenihan did not provide me in advance with the specific details of the particular case he has in mind.  The only point I have established in the course of the debate is that Deputy Deenihan is representing a woman.  I would be delighted if he would supply me with the appropriate information and I will undertake to contact him when I have examined the cause of his concern. I can assure the Deputy that there will be no delay on my part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to make a number of general points arising from the Deputy's contribution.  The law in relation to naturalisation is set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986.  The relevant provisions concerning the conditions for the issue of a certificate of naturalisation are set out in sections 4 and 5 of the 1986 Act.  An application for naturalisation must satisfy certain statutory requirements, which include having a period of five years residence in Ireland in the nine-year period prior to the date of lodgment of his or her application, with the last year being one of continuous residence.  Each application <Col N="1469" /> is examined on an individual basis on its merits in accordance with statutory conditions.  I can assure the House that there is no question of an applicant's particular nationality having a bearing on the decision one way or the other.  I reject out of hand any suggestion that there is discrimination by way of nationality in the assessment of applications for citizenship and I deplore a situation where that sort of unwelcome and erroneous signal is being sent out from this House.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise also that decisions in this area are taken by the Minister for Justice personally and the question of applications being rejected by my Department does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>Monaghan town has a population of up to 7,000 people and water rationing has occurred in the past nine years.  For up to six months during the summer period, the water supply to large sections of the town could be cut from 12 midnight to 7 a.m.  This obviously causes enormous problems for the people affected and for factory production.  Naturally it also has implications for our hotels and guesthouses when we are trying to promote our tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The recent serious and tragic fires in Kerry have highlighted the possibility of a serious outbreak of fire during the night and the fire brigade would be hindered by a lack of water at this time.  It must be remembered that many of the buildings in the town are old and would ignite easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Water is supplied to Monaghan town from three sources &mdash; the main source <Col N="1470" /> being the Corcaghan Lakes through the Togan treatment works, which is capable of supplying 60 to 70 per cent of the town's requirements.  The second supply is from deep wells located at St. Davnet's hospital grounds.  This is a hard water supply and naturally causes many difficulties within the system.  The third source of supply is from Lambes Lake, which is unfiltered and virtually untreated.  It is very difficult for the authorities to assure high quality water from a combination of all three sources.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give a commitment that he will provide the finance to test the sources of water from the Bragan Mountains, where there seem to be high quality underwater supplies available?  A local group water scheme has used this source for many years and this water is of extremely high quality.</P>
    <P>Monaghan Urban District Council has drilled test wells in the region but they need to do much more extensive trials. Then, of course, the Minister must give a commitment to provide the necessary finance to bring this much needed water to Monaghan town.</P>
    <P>It is essential that a portion of the much heralded European funds be committed to this absolutely necessary and long overdue project.  The Minister is aware that a very extensive and much needed waste water treatment plant has been provided which will service factories and the tourism industry, which in turn will create jobs in the region.  Unfortunately, however, unless the water is improved, the present plant cannot hope to reach its full potential.</P>
    <P>Water from the Togan treatment works could be transferred to other areas.  There is a very fine water supply in Kilkitt in the middle of the county and if the water cannot be supplied from one source close to Monaghan town moneys should be provided to bring water from Kilkitt.  The Monaghan town water supply is smelly, to put it mildly, and people want the problem addressed urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for sharing his time with me.  As far <Col N="1471" /> back as 1975 the North Eastern Regional Development Organisation carried out a survey on housing, roads, sewerage and water in the four towns in the county and their hinterlands.  Since that time housing has been satisfactory and urban roads are much better than roads in rural areas, a new treatment plant has been built at a cost of £6 million and the Minister for the Environment will perform its official opening next Friday.  However, the water supply remains a matter of contention. At that time there was no surplus capacity and they recommended planned expansion by bore hole augmentation.  As Deputy Crawford said, the town is supplied from three sources, the Togan treatment plant, the original source, a bore hole at Rooskey and water from Lambes Lake.</P>
      <P>As soon as money becomes available from the operational programme I ask that it be set aside for this purpose.  We have been told that the Department requires further exploratory bore holes in Knockatallon, but I question that because the urban district council as well as a group water scheme had opened exploratory bore holes and there seemed to be a plentiful supply of safe water.  My area is served by an underground water supply.</P>
      <P>I believe we have adequate information to proceed.  County Monaghan has many sources, including the Lough Egish scheme which received funding of £4 million from the EC in addition to £1.5 million from the county council, the Lake Muckno source, the subject of litigation, as well as the Knockatallon bore holes, Emy Lake and the Derrygooney Lake chain.  The Department should make an all out effort because 37.5 per cent of the industry in the county is based in Monaghan town and its hinterland.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Minister for the Environment to provide the moneys to proceed with this project.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> I am aware of the importance attached to the Monaghan water supply scheme. The project, which is estimated to cost £8.5 million, involves the development of production bores together with associated storage, treatment and transmission lines to deliver water to Monaghan town. There are no proposals to supply Monaghan town from the Kilkitt scheme but tenders for the development of production bores at Knockatallon in north Monaghan have been received in my Department.  However, in common with many other worthwhile proposals around the country, it has not been possible to provide financing for it up to now due to the pressure of other priority schemes within the water and sanitary services programme.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, considerable progress has been made in the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure in County Monaghan.  In the 1989-93 period over £9 million of Exchequer and EU finance has been invested in important projects, including sewerage works at Carrickmacross, Smithboro, Newbliss, Rockcorry and a flood relief scheme in Monaghan town. This coming Friday, the Minister, Deputy Smith, will be in Monaghan to officially open a modern, sophisticated treatment plant facility for Monaghan town which has been completed at a cost of over £7 million.  I suggest that the Deputies should have a word with the Minister on that occasion.</P>

      <P>I have long experience of dealing with public officials.  In this case I am referring to community welfare officers or as they were known, relieving officers.  While I often crossed swords with them and we had differences of opinion it was always possible to reach an accommodation.  I never found any of these officials to be anything but genuine and caring.</P>
      <P>When I come up against a system in my home town of Dungarvan which shows a lack of compassion and sympathy for the most under-privileged section of the community, the poor and deprived, I have a duty to voice my concern in this House. I have tried to redress this through the appeal system in the South Eastern Health Board but to no avail.  I do not believe that there has been an on-the-spot investigation into any of the cases I highlighted.  There should be an independent mechanism in the Department of Health under which people, or their public representatives, who feel they have been unjustly treated can have their cases examined.  I do not think an appeal system within a health board or any other body will work satisfactorily as personnel will not over-rule other members of that body.  I would like the Minister for Health to introduce a system which is truly independent under which hardship cases can be investigated.</P>

    <P>I wish to give a number of examples. Case A involves a woman who is suffering from diabetes and asthma.  As a result the <Col N="1474" /> heating system has to be left on almost continuously.  Even though her husband &mdash; who has a drink problem &mdash; is in receipt of unemployment assistance she cannot obtain any assistance towards her electricity bill.</P>
    <P>I am referring to genuine cases only; I am aware that there are people who are not genuine and try to secure payments. I am long enough around to know who is genuine and who is not.</P>
    <P>Case B involves a battered wife who has returned from England with her young family.  She was refused payments on the basis that she was in receipt of payments in England.  She spent any money she had in returning home with her family.  She was also refused money to cover the cost of school uniforms for her children.  She was shown no compassion and the wrong attitude was adopted. This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Cases C and D involve a deserted wife who is in receipt of a lone parent's allowance and a woman who is in receipt of a prisoner's wife's allowance.  Both were in receipt of payments from the community welfare service but neither was informed how to go about applying for the statutory allowance in each case.  Were it not for the efforts of my constituency secretary they would not have received any back money which in turn was refunded to the health board.  I am objecting to this lack of compassion and understanding and it must be attended to.</P>
    <P>A scheme to refurbish houses which are in a poor condition is nearing completion in Dungarvan.  In some cases people have been given a grant of £300 to provide furniture and fittings.  However, some of the most deserving cases have not received any grant.  Case E involves a family, the adult members of which are unemployed, who could not obtain a grant.</P>
    <P>Case F involves a woman whose husband is a pensioner.  She is in bad health and was discharged from hospital three or four weeks ago.  She does not have the money to pay the bill of £145 and she was informed by the community welfare service that if it paid the bill she would have to pay back a larger sum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> The final case involves a woman with three children whose husband is on a FÁS scheme.  She works in a local school for which she receives £40 per week when it is in session.  Their mortgage repayment is £192 per month but she can obtain no relief from the community welfare service.  I cannot accept this.  Poor people who are in difficulty must be helped.  I accept that these are discretionary payments but someone should ensure that the people who administer this scheme do so in a just and proper way.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy indicated, I am deputising for the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin.  I do not accept that the community welfare service in the Dungarvan area is being delivered in an unsatisfactory manner. This issue was investigated last week on foot of a question tabled by the Deputy. The South-Eastern Health Board confirmed that it is not aware of any dissatisfaction in relation to the general manner in which the community welfare <Col N="1476" /> service is being operated in the Dungarvan area.</P>

If the Deputy has any further cases he wishes to pursue the health board will investigate them as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy has asked me to pass on what he said to the Minister for Health. I will certainly undertake to do that.  The Deputy's motion is timely because tomorrow we are launching a health strategy document to take the health services into the next millennium.  An important part of that strategy will be the reorganisation of the health boards.  I note particularly what the Deputy said about the appeal system.  We are coming at just the right time to consider these matters in the context of the reorganisation of the health boards.</P>

        <i>The National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> includes provision for a national conference centre capable of accommodating up to 2,000 delegates at an estimated cost of £50 million.  In accordance with EU regulations, the maximum level of grant payable to a private developer would be 50 per cent of eligible expenditure which would leave a minimum matching requirement of £25 million.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in answering written questions on 29 March, the position is that following on two separate studies, one of the benefits to the country of a national conference centre and the second of the most desirable location for such a centre, the site at the Royal Dublin Society was chosen for the proposed development.</P>
      <P>The current position on the RDS project is that the society has not been able to generate the funds necessary to match the amount available from the European Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RDS proposal is one of a number of proposals that have been received for a national conference centre.  The essential difficulty of matching funding has arisen in every proposal.  The reason for this is that the conference centre is not commercial in itself but there are significant benefits for hotels, restaurants and other <Col N="1308" /> tourism-related facilities from the spending of those who come to the centre.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances the issues which could provide justification for matching funds are currently being examined.  The Government will then consider the various arguments arising and come to a decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to having a national conference centre and believe it can be developed without further funding from the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 25, 47, 53, 73 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>In my reply to questions on 2 March I outlined the three essential aims which we are pursuing in our policy on former Yugoslavia: to maintain and develop the search for a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Bosnia on the basis of the European Union's peace plan; to prevent the spread of the conflict, and to ensure the supply and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims.</P>
      <P>These aims continue to guide the Government's overall approach to the crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The horrific events which have unfolded at Gorazde in recent days have shocked the international community. This assault on a small town, where some 65,000 people have huddled for protection, is an affront to human dignity.  It <Col N="1310" /> is a further flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, examples of which we have witnessed all so frequently in Bosnia for over two years.</P>
    <P>Gorazde was designated a safe area by United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 824 in May 1993.  The use of air power at safe areas under the authority of the United Nations was provided for in the subsequent Resolution No. 836 adopted by the Security Council in June 1993.</P>
    <P>The close air support provided by NATO forces at Gorazde was undertaken at the request of UNPROFOR and with the full authority of the Secretary-General of the United Nations acting under the mandate from the Security Council.  In advance of the action, clear and unambiguous warnings were repeatedly given to the Bosnian Serbs to cease their onslaught.  As I indicated to Deputies in response to questions on 27 January, decisions to use force including air power to achieve the very specific objectives of Security Council resolutions raise difficult and complex questions.  I believe that the Secretary General's decision to authorise close air support in defence of UN personnel was taken after giving due weight to all the factors involved.  Those Bosnian Serb commanders who defied the appeals and warnings of the international community bear the responsibility for the action taken.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that the Bosnian Serbs continued their actions against Gorazde, inflicting high casualties on its population and threatening the lives of UN personnel who, courageously, remained in the town.  Their actions are a substantial setback for the peace process.  They are particularly disheartening, given that much progress had been made in the peace process recently.</P>
    <P>The fighting between Bosnian Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia &mdash; the major conflict area for over nine months &mdash; has been brought to an end.  Both parties have agreed to establish a Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia.  In Croatia, a ceasefire was agreed last <Col N="1311" /> months and forces are withdrawing from the confrontation lines.</P>
    <P>In Bosnia, the vital issues of the delimitation of the Croat-Muslim federation, as well as the future relationship between this federation and the Bosnian-Serb territory, remain to be determined.  These questions can be resolved only by negotiations conducted in good faith by all of the parties.</P>
    <P>The recent events at Gorazde have given rise to questions in some quarters as to whether the United Nations should continue to be engaged in Bosnia.  It is clear that the United Nations has not been able to achieve all of its objectives.  It would be the ultimate tragedy if, following events at Gorazde, despair should precipitate a withdrawal of the United Nations peacekeeping force.  However difficult and frustrating the process may be, the presence of the United Nations in Bosnia is vital to create the climate for negotiations and to provide desperately needed aid, not least in Gorazde, whose inhabitants are threatened by an appalling humanitarian crisis.</P>
    <P>The European Union which co-chairs the international conference on former Yugoslavia, is fully engaged in the search for peace.  European Union member states are contributing some 15,000 personnel to UNPROFOR.  A valuable contribution is also being made to a peaceful settlement by the 200 EC monitors in the EC monitor mission.  Some 65 per cent of the total cost of the humanitarian operation in former Yugoslavia has been provided by the EU and its member states.  The European Union has also agreed in principle to administer the town of Mostar for a two year period, a major contribution to the <i>rapprochement</i> between Bosnia's Croats and Muslims.</P>
    <P>For Ireland's part, we will continue our efforts to promote the essential objectives I have outlined, through our participation in the international conference on former Yugoslavia and our participation in UNPROFOR and in the EC monitor mission.  We are also providing help for the victims of the conflict and support the work of the international tribunal <Col N="1312" /> which has been established to prosecute the perpetrators of war crimes.  We will also continue our support for the vigorous implementation of the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.</P>
    <P>Along with our European Union partners we are fully engaged in the search for an overall settlement for Bosnia.  Our aim is a comprehensive and durable peace for that country and the region. What has been achieved in recent weeks must not be lost.  A ceasefire at Gorazde is now essential.  This should be built upon and extended throughout Bosnia. European Union Foreign Ministers, in Luxembourg on 18 April, demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, the withdrawal of Bosnian Serbs from the vicinity of Gorazde, and the lifting of all obstructions which have been placed in UNPROFOR's path.</P>
    <P>Ministers also called for an intensive and co-ordinated effort by the international community, involving the European Union, the United Nations, the United States and Russia, to relaunch the negotiations on the basis of the European Union plan of action which has been accepted by all of the parties.</P>
    <P>A settlement cannot be imposed on Bosnia.  The Bosnian Serbs, in particular must return to the negotiating table to arrive at a solution through negotiation. Failure to do so will condemn them and Serbia to isolation in Europe.</P>
    <P>I understand that a ceasefire at Gorazde was negotiated early this morning. This provided for the deployment of some 140 UNPROFOR personnel, troops to the left bank of the Drina river and United Nations military observers throughout the town.  It was hoped it would facilitate the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance.  However, my latest information indicates that the Serb shelling against Gorazde is continuing and that it has not yet been possible to deploy the UNPROFOR personnel.  An effective ceasefire and the immediate deployment of United Nations troops is absolutely essential in Gorazde.  The Government is fully supportive of the ongoing UN efforts to bring this about.</P>
    <P>I reported yesterday evening to the <Col N="1313" /> Dáil on the whereabouts and welfare of the two Irish citizens who are trapped in Gorazde and my direct approach to Bosnian Serb leader, Dr. Karadzic concerning their safety.  My latest information is that Dr. McLoughlin and Mr. O'Dwyer are safe.  It is hoped that the ceasefire, which the United Nations is working strenuously to put in place, will permit UNHCR staff to reach Gorazde and those who wish to leave to do so in safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 19, 29, 37, 57, 66, 68 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>The concerns of the Government at the human rights situation in East Timor and at the actions of the Indonesian authorities there are well known and have been expressed in this House on several occasions in the recent past.  Since I last spoke on the matter in early March we have been working actively in pursuit of our policy: I met with members of the East Timor Solidarity Group and obtained a briefing on recent developments in East Timor; we have taken the matter up with our partners in the European Union; the Irish delegation to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights were active at the recent session of the Commission in Geneva, and we have discussed the situation in East Timor with the Australian authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the European Union is concerned Ireland played an active part in ensuring that the statement made by the European Union to the UN Commission on Human Rights reflected our concerns. The statement calls on the Indonesian authorities to comply fully with the decisions of the United Nations Commission; calls for better access to East Timor for human rights bodies and the <Col N="1315" /> international media; urges that those members of the security forces responsible for the Dili massacre be prosecuted, tried and punished; and calls on the Indonesian Government to account for all those still missing.</P>
    <P>A number of these points were taken up in the conclusions drawn by the chairman of the United Nations Commission in his statement at the end of the session. The Commission has requested the Secretary-General to keep it informed on the situation of human rights in East Timor and the matter remains on the commission's agenda.</P>
    <P>In replying to questions last month I undertook to raise the situation in East Timor with the Australian authorities. This has been done.  Officials of my Department have outlined to the Australian Ambassador the concern of the Government at the human rights situation. We have asked the Australian Government to use its influence with Indonesia to achieve an improvement in that country's record in East Timor.  The Australian Ambassador replied that no country had been more consistent or persistent in defence of human rights, including human rights in East Timor, than Australia.  His Government has long emphasised to the Indonesian Government the need for a process of reconciliation with the people of East Timor. The Australian Government were working for a major reduction of Indonesia's military presence in East Timor, for improved social and economic development, and for greater recognition of East Timor's distinctive cultural identity. Their concern at human rights violations would continue to be clearly and consistently conveyed to the Indonesian Government.  They would also continue to register their close interest in the welfare of the Fretilin leader Xanana Gusmao.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not in a position unilaterally to introduce trade sanctions against Indonesia.  These are matters for the United Nations, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, or for the European Union in accordance with <Col N="1316" /> Article 228 (a) of the Maastricht Treaty. At the moment, while dialogue is underway between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General, I do not believe that there would be sufficient agreement within the United Nations or in the European Union to impose sanctions on Indonesia. The Government has fully supported, and will continue to support the United Nations Secretary-General's efforts, which we hope will lead to a just comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution on the question of East Timor's status.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out that the questions of East Timor and of the United Kingdom's relations with Indonesia do not come within the remit of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and, therefore, could not be appropriately raised in the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 39 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The human rights situation in Guatemala <Col N="1317" /> has been one of great concern to Ireland and to our partners in the European Union for a considerable number of years past and is a matter of intense discussion each year at the United Nations Commission for Human Rights. The commission has recently extended the mandate of the independent expert to examine the situation of human rights in Guatemala and provide assistance to the Government in the field of human rights.</P>
    <P>I have been very concerned at reports of an escalation of human rights abuses in Guatemala in recent months.  I was appalled at the assassination on 2 April 1994 of the President of the Constitutional Court.  Along with our partners in the European Union, Ireland has called on the Government of Guatemala to thoroughly investigate this issue and bring its perpetrators to justice.  We have also urged the Guatemalan Government to continue its efforts to promote the peace process, respect for human rights and the democratic order.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government of Guatemala and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union &mdash; URNG &mdash; are engaged in peace negotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.  At the end of March 1994 both parties signed a human rights accord under which a United Nations mission will be established inside Guatemala as soon as possible. It will be empowered to visit any part of the country and demand information at any time from the Army and the Government.</P>
    <P>Along with our partners in the European Union, Ireland will continue to encourage and support these peace negotiations with a view to ensuring a return to peace, the rule of law and full respect for human rights in Guatemala.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy's question on 2 March, the Government has consistently emphasised within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement the importance of ensuring that the rights and identities of the two traditions in Northern Ireland are fully respected.  We have availed fully of the mechanism of the agreement to promote this objective in every way open to us.  I indicated on that occasion that the question of additional measures in this area had been considered by the Conference at its meeting on 28 January, and that the issue remained on the Conference agenda.</P>
      <P>The Conference reviewed developments at its meeting on 10 March, when it considered the progress of working groups set up to examine measures to recognise and accommodate the identity of the two traditions in Northern Ireland, in legal, social and cultural matters, including the Irish language.  It is intended that the Conference will continue to monitor progress in this area.  I will be reverting to the issue at future meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland took up observer status in the Western European Union last November, with the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty.  The decision to take up observer status at the Western European Union was prompted by the new relationship between the European Union and the Western European Union provided for in the Maastricht Treaty (Article J.4.2). <Col N="1319" /> Observer status at the Western European Union enables us to keep informed of developments in the Western European Union that might have a bearing on discussions in the European Union; places us in a better position to formulate appropriate responses on such issues within the EU; helps us decide our policy on the reference of issues with defence implications by the EU to the Western European Union; and enables us to follow the subsequent discussions within the Western European Union on such issues.</P>
      <P>The Government has appointed a permanent representative to the Western European Union.  Since last November we have been attending the weekly meetings of the Western European Union's Permanent Council as well as working groups.  In the immediate future the Government considers that the Western European Union can play an important role in promoting security and stability in Europe as part of the framework of mutually reinforcing institutions.  With this in mind we have taken part in discussions within the Western European Union on such matters as international peacekeeping, the conflict in former Yugoslavia, the relations between the European Union and the Western European Union, and the development of the Western European Union's relationship with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>We are satisfied, on the basis of this experience, that observer status meets our current requirements with regard to the relationship between the EU and the Western European Union established by the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the longer term, the question of the role of the Western European Union in the future security of the European Union is likely to arise.  At present, the Maastricht Treaty specifies that the Western European Union is &ldquo;an integral part of the development of the Union&rdquo;, but it remains a separate organisation operating within its own treaty framework &mdash; the Brussels Treaty of 1948.  As Deputies are aware, the Maastricht Treaty specifically <Col N="1320" /> provides for an intergovernmental Conference in 1996 to review the implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</P>
    <P>It is likely that discussions on the scope and content of a future common defence policy and on the question of a common defence will feature in those negotiations, and that they will almost certainly include a review of the relationship between the EU and the Western European Union.  While it is difficult to predict what specific options may be under consideration when the Intergovernmental Conference meets in 1996, the Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that Ireland's policy of military neutrality will remain unchanged unless the people decide otherwise in a referendum.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in the context of the developing debate about future European security and defence arrangements, it is important that there be a full informed discussion on Ireland's security policy.  I welcome the attention which the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is already giving to this issue.  This debate will be especially relevant to the preparation of the White Paper on Ireland's foreign policy which I have announced.  I intend to announce shortly arrangements to involve the public fully in the consultation process that will culminate in the publication of the White Paper.</P>

      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the continuing conflict in Sierra Leone which has been the <Col N="1321" /> scene of many deaths and has given rise to a serious humanitarian crisis.  I was particularly saddened by the brutal murder of Fr. Felim McAllister along with a Dutch doctor and his family last week.</P>
      <P>Ireland has strong links with Sierra Leone as a result of the work there of Irish missionaries over the years.  I wish to take this opportunity to salute the Irish nuns for their unwavering commitment to their mission.</P>
      <P>I recently met with Fr. McAllister's brothers, the Provincial of the Holy Ghost Order, Fr. Brian McLaughlin and representatives of the Sisters of the Daughters of Charity, to express the Government's condolences to them on the death of Fr. McAllister.  I discussed with them ways in which assistance could be given to Sierra Leone and how we could mark Fr. McAllister's contribution to the people of that country.</P>
      <P>In addition, my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has met with representatives of some Irish NGOs to discuss the humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone.  I understand that a number of detailed proposals will be made shortly to my Department requesting further assistance for Sierra Leone.  Upon receipt these proposals will be considered sympathetically.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 26, 27, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 43, 46, 51, 52, 56, 58, 64, 67, 72 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has for many years been a vocal critic of the apartheid régime in South Africa and has worked actively for South Africa's transition to a democratic and non-racial society.  As part of the international effort to ensure that South Africa's first ever democratic elections on 26 to 28 April are free and fair we have endeavoured to ensure an adequate involvement by Irish election observers in response to the request from South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission.</P>
      <P>Over 100 observers from Ireland are taking part in the international effort; 25 observers with the European Union's observer mission; 13 observers with the UN's team of election observers; ten observers with the UN's volunteer election monitoring team, and 31 observers with the monitoring teams that are being organised by the Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa (AWEPA); 33 observers with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC).</P>
      <P>The selection and funding procedures for each of these bodies vary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the European Union <Col N="1326" /> each member state and the Commission agreed to provide 25 election observers to a joint mission which is being managed by a specially established European Union Electoral Unit.  This is part of a joint action by the European Union under the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  The Irish team is composed of 11 Members of the Oireachtas, five individuals selected from central and local government bodies and the chairman of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement.  It includes eight people with relevant experience in Africa, or with experience of election observation who were nominated by the Agency for Personal Services Overseas (APSO).  The Department of Foreign Affairs is providing £200,000 to cover the total estimated expenditure involved, which includes reimbursement of salaries, travel and insurance.  The European Commission is covering in-country costs.</P>
    <P>The 13 observers with the UN team were nominated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and are being funded by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The ten observers with the UN's volunteer election monitoring team, 21 of the AWEPA observers and the 33 Independent Electoral Commission observers are being funded, or partly funded, by the Agency for Personal Services Overseas which recruited the individuals concerned. The average cost of funding each AWEPA and IEC volunteer is £2,500 and the cost of each UN volunteer £560. The total cost of APSO funded volunteers for these delegations is estimated at £213,600 and this will be met from APSO's annual grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The 31 volunteers serving under AWEPA include ten Members of the Oireachtas whose mission is being funded by AWEPA itself.</P>
    <P>The level of violence in South Africa has remained at a disturbingly high level for many months now.  The safety of election observers is a priority for the Government.  We are in close and regular contact with the European Union Electoral Unit which is based in Johannesburg about the safety of observers.  Moreover, the security situation is a matter of <Col N="1327" /> ongoing discussions between the EU Electoral Unit and South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission.  All Irish funded election observers were aware of the security situation in South Africa before they left and are to be commended for their willingness to volunteer for this difficult task.</P>
    <P>Prior to their departure from Ireland, Irish observers were required to attend compulsory briefing on their role.  In these briefings particular emphasis was placed upon impartiality as a key requirement for the success of the election monitor's function.  I am aware of reports and claims of lack of impartiality on the part of certain observers.  APSO has reiterated to all its volunteers the need for absolute impartiality in the conduct of their functions.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficult security situation in South Africa I am confident that the international presence in South Africa will make a valuable contribution to <Col N="1328" /> ensuring that free and fair elections take place in South Africa on 26-28 April.</P>
    <P>The agreement reached yesterday between the political leaders in South Africa which enables the Inkatha Freedom Party to contest the elections is a welcome and encouraging development. I hope that the agreement will lessen tensions in the run-up to the election and will enable the ballot to take place in conditions of peace and stability.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the policy of successive Irish Governments to ensure that the legal process is applied to Irish citizens in Britain, or travelling through Britain, in an even-handed manner.  The British authorities are fully aware of the Government's views in this regard and the importance it attaches to ensuring that <Col N="1330" /> the rights of Irish citizens are fully upheld.  Where abuses are alleged to have occurred, these are raised with the relevant British authorities through the Embassy in London and such other channels as may be appropriate in the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to monitor closely developments in this area.  I have no plans at present to raise these matters at the next meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Council of Europe and I do not think that it would be appropriate to do so.</P>

      <P>At present, our Embassy in Ottawa has consular responsibility for Newfoundland.  Our network of resident diplomatic missions is small and, because of resource constraints, must remain so for the foreseeable future.

The question of appointing a Canadian consul in Waterford is a matter for the Canadian Government.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of our historical and cultural links with Newfoundland and of the province's particular connection with the south east of Ireland due to the pattern of emigration in the past from Waterford and Wexford.  In recognition of these ties, the Cultural Relations Committee of my Department has for many years supported the activities of the Irish Newfoundland Association and has assisted other cultural projects in Canada which have included Newfoundland in their itineraries.  I will be happy to consider ways in which we can strengthen these links in the future.</P>

      <P>The question of jurisdiction over Rockall and adjacent areas has been a matter of dispute with Britain for many years.  Britain has claimed ownership of the rock itself since 1955 and it has declared a 12 mile territorial sea around it.  Ireland has not accepted this claim.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> The question of jurisdiction over the much more extensive continental shelf is a separate matter.  As a result of negotiations the question of jurisdiction over the shelf was resolved and an agreement between Ireland and Britain on the delimitation of the continental shelf, including in particular large areas of the Rockall Plateau, entered into force on 11 January, 1990.  Designation Orders governing large areas of the Rockall Plateau under Irish jurisdiction were subsequently made by the Government.  No conflicting claim with the British in this area in relation to continental shelf jurisdiction now remains.</P>
    <P>Claims have been made by Denmark and by Iceland to areas of the Rockall Plateau.  These claims are not accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>Fishing rights are a separate matter again.  These rights are governed by the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union and decisions on the allocation of fish resources are taken by the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Parliament has proposed that a convention of members of <Col N="1334" /> the European Parliament and of Parliaments of the member states be held prior to 1996 to adopt a draft constitution for Europe, based on a draft submitted by the European Parliament.  It has also proposed that a group of eminent persons be appointed to consider a draft constitution for Europe.</P>
    <P>Already as part of its preparations for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) the Council has agreed to invite the European Parliament and the Commission to work with it on a report on the operation of the Treaty on European Union.  It is expected that this report will be completed by mid 1995.</P>
    <P>The report will serve as an input to the work of a group of representatives of Foreign Ministers who will be appointed by the forthcoming meeting of the European Council in Corfu.  This group of personal representatives which will work in association with the European Parliament will begin its task in mid 1995.  It will be asked <i>inter alia,</i> taking account of the views and arguments of the members states, to identify options for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference in such areas as weighted voting.</P>
    <P>In my view the setting up of this group to consider the issues facing the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference will go a long way to meet the call by the European Parliament for the appointment of a group of eminent persons; and the invitation from the Council to the Parliament and the Commission to work with it on a report on the operation of the European Union Treaty will allow the Parliament a full opportunity to present its views on the idea of a constitution for Europe over the coming months.</P>
    <P>It remains, of course, for the Parliament itself if it so wishes to pursue in specific detail the proposals which it has made including the proposal for the holding of a convention involving its members and members of national Parliaments.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question, I have sought the details requested from the British authorities and will communicate further with the Deputy.  In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question, our figures indicate that since 1969 four prosecutions, out of a total of thirty-three arising from the use of lethal force by the security forces, resulted in convictions: two convictions for murder, one for attempted murder and one for manslaughter.  These convictions, which arose out of the use of <Col N="1336" /> lethal force in the course of official duties, are additional to the convictions for serious offences, including in some cases murder, of a number of members of the former Ulster Defence Regiment, which were referred to in a reply to a question from the Deputy on 5 May 1992.</P>
      <P>The Government have consistently conveyed to the British Government the necessity of ensuring that the security forces act within the law at all times; and that members of the security forces should be accountable and be seen to be accountable for their actions.  As previously indicated.  I have brought clearly to the attention of the British Government my concerns over the adequacy of the existing criminal law as it relates to the use of lethal force by the security forces, the operation of controls over the use of such force and the accountability of those involved.</P>
      <P>The question of the use of lethal force by the security forces has been considered at recent meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference with particular reference to a review undertaken by the British side in relation to their criminal law, including proposed reforms to the law, and the guidance, practice and follow-up procedures relating to the use of force.  The matter remains an important one on the agenda of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991 be enabled to proceed with its vital work.  There has been a number of positive developments since my reply to a parliamentary question on this subject on 7 October 1993.</P>
      <P>The tribunal has held two sessions to date at its seat in the Hague from 17-30 November 1993 and from 17 January-11 February 1994.  At the first session, the eleven judges elected Judge Antonio Cassese of Italy as President.  During its recent session, the Tribunal adopted rules of procedure and of evidence.  The next session is scheduled to begin on 25 April 1994.</P>
      <P>With regard to the funding of the Tribunal, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on 14 April 1994 authorising the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for up to 11 million dollars for the period 1 January-31 December 1994.</P>
      <P>The General Assembly also authorised the Secretary-General to sign a lease for the premises of the Tribunal and to ensure that it is provided with adequate facilities and necessary staff resources. The Secretary-General has stated his belief that these measures will provide the Tribunal with the necessary foundation for its effective operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of how the amount of 11 million dollars and future funding will be apportioned among the member states has been deferred to the 49th session of <Col N="1338" /> the General Assembly next autumn.  This will not however adversely affect the financing of the Tribunal in the interim. Together with its partners in the European Union, Ireland will continue to urge that the Tribunal be financed from the regular budget of the United Nations, as we believe this is the best way to ensure adequate funding of its work.  European Union member states made clear their willingness to accept mandatory assessments for regular budget financing of the Tribunal during the General Assembly debate on 14 April 1994.</P>
    <P>I informed Dáil Éireann on 2 March 1994, in reply to a question, that the Government was contributing £15,000 to the voluntary fund for the Tribunal established by the Secretary-General, as a further demonstration of the importance we attach to its work.  This payment to the United Nations will be in addition to any mandatory assessment we will be required to pay in due course towards the financing of the Tribunal.</P>

    <P>The Prime Minister, Mr. Major, stated in December 1992 that those who were killed on Bloody Sunday should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot whilst handling firearms or explosives.  Following a meeting which I had with John Hume and a delegation of relatives of the victims of <Col N="1339" /> Bloody Sunday on 16 February of this year, I raised the issue again with the British Government, through the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  In doing so, I indicated that I would welcome any further steps which they could take to meet the legitimate concerns of the families, in particular their desire for a comprehensive and unequivocal statement that the victims were totally innocent, that they were engaged in peaceful protest and that they were not involved in violence.</P>

      <P>The Government are very conscious of the needs of Irish emigrants and we are providing support in a number of practical ways.  Special measures are in place in Britain and the United States and a number of initiatives are also being undertaken in the European Union context.</P>
      <P>In Britain, since 1984, funding is being provided to immigrant assistance groups through the London-based DÍON Committee, which reports to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  The Government's grant of £500,000 in 1993 was used to assist thirty-four such groups.</P>
      <P>The Government also helps to fund the work of Irish immigrant welfare and advice organisations in the US.  Grants amounting to £150,000 were given to nine organisations there in 1993.  As in Britain, and indeed elsewhere, our diplomatic staff in the US devote much time and resources to advising and assisting Irish immigrants.  The Immigration Working Committees which meet under the auspices of our Consulates in Boston, Chicago, New York and San Francisco are particularly useful.</P>

    <P>Emigration and its associated problems are considered on a regular basis by an interdepartmental committee on emigration chaired by a senior official of my Department.  Among the issues currently under consideration by that committee is the improvement of pre-emigration advice to ensure that intending emigrants are adequately prepared before they leave.</P>

The estimated tonnage of fish consumed on an annual basis by such population is not known to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seals are a protected species under the 1976 Wildlife Act and it is an offence to hunt or kill them, save under licence or permission under the Act.  I am aware of calls by some fisheries organisations for a seal cull in Irish waters because of concern expressed at an apparent increase in the seal population here and the effect this, among other things, is having on some Irish fish stocks.  This increase is due mainly to the migratory/breeding habits of such species, the majority of which originate in Scottish waters and such a cull, if it were to be undertaken, would have to be carried out there.  There <Col N="1342" /> is a remedy available to fishermen in that they may apply for permission, under section 42 of the 1976 Act, to kill seals which are causing damage at and to their nets.  Any such application will receive prompt attention.</P>
    <P>Because of this concern by the fisheries' interests a working group, chaired by the Department of the Marine, with representatives from that Department, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Central Fisheries Board, the Fisheries Research Centre and the Office of Public Works was set up to consider and quantify seal interactions with fisheries.  I understand that the working group expects to furnish a report later this year.</P>

    <P>If the 1994 budgeted Exchequer borrowing requirement of £798 million is realised and if the exchange rates used in the budget are maintained throughout 1994 it is estimated that the national debt at 31 December 1994 will be £29.156 billion. It is not possible at this juncture <Col N="1343" /> to provide an estimate of the domestic-foreign division of the end-1994 national debt.</P>
    <P>The estimated average interest rate underpinning the budget estimate for debt service in 1994 is 7.32 per cent.  On the basis of the outturn for debt service costs the average interest rates on the national debt for 1991, 1992 and 1993 were: 1993, 7.59 per cent; 1992, 8.24 per cent; 1991, 8.36 per cent.</P>
    <P>The estimate as published in the 1994 White Paper of receipts and expenditure for servicing the national debt, including provision for sinking funds and expenses of issuing debt, in 1994 is £2,229 million. The corresponding servicing costs for 1991, 1992 and 1993 were as follows: 1993, £2,390 million; 1992, £2,355 million; 1991, £2,353 million.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at present to accurately estimate the total amount of the national debt at the completion of the National Development Plan, 1994-99. This is because the level of debt in 1999 will depend on a number of factors, in particular the level of Exchequer borrowing for each of the five years from 1994 to 1999 as well as the effect of possible market developments, particularly exchange rate movements over the period on the value of the portion of the national debt denominated in foreign currencies.</P>

    <P>As regards employment in the centre, some 1,400 net incremental jobs have been provided by IFSC companies, about half of which are located in the Customs House Docks Area.  These figures do not take account of the significant additional employment that has arisen in support services, e.g. in the legal, accounting, and general services sector.</P>

      <P>My Department is in contact as necessary with the European Commission regarding certification matters connected with the IFSC and Shannon customs-free airport zone.  Indeed, a joint review with the Commission that was arranged some time ago has already begun in regard to the end-1994 approval date for service companies wishing to establish in the Shannon zone.  The similar approval date for the IFSC will receive attention in that context also.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a lower effective tax rate may be available for financial service companies in some other European locations.  One of the advantages of the IFSC is that it has a transparent tax incentive regime.  The IFSC also offers a wide <Col N="1346" /> range of financial services and products to international customers within a well regulated framework.  The success of the IFSC has also been a result of, <i>inter alia,</i> the availability of qualified people and excellent communications facilities in Dublin.  This is borne out by the number of substantive projects that have located in the centre and augurs well for the continued growth of the IFSC.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a rent supplement may be paid to eligible persons whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs. Entitlement to rent supplement is determined by the health board in the light of the circumstances of the case.  Arrangements involving immediate relatives are not excluded under present arrangements. Where the property being rented is owned by an immediate relative of the applicant, however, the health board would have to be satisfied that a genuine landlord/tenant relationship exists in the particular case in question.</P>

      <P>A deserted wife under 40 years of age is not entitled to receive deserted wife's benefit if she has no qualified child dependant.  The person concerned ceased to be entitled to deserted wife's benefit when her daughter reached 18 years of age.  Payment of her benefit ceased in March 1994.  She will be entitled to reapply for deserted wife's benefit in July 1994 when she reaches 40 years of age.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not allow my Department to extend payment of this benefit to the person concerned before her 40th birthday.  Any extension of the deserted wife's benefit scheme to cover this situation would have to be examined in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>From the information available to my Department, the person concerned is in employment now.  However, if she is experiencing financial difficulties she may wish to contact her community welfare officer at her local health board clinic for assistance through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, I formally announced on Monday last that agreement had been reached with the Minister for Finance on the details of the Government's emergency aid scheme for the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>The scheme for which an amount of up to £5 million has been earmarked is intended to alleviate the exceptional and unique difficulties that had been experienced by the catching sector over recent months arising from the prolonged spell of bad weather during that period.  In particular, it will focus on relieving the hardship suffered by crews of boats that were restricted from undertaking normal winter fishing activity because of the extreme weather.  In determining hardship, the scheme will also take account, as appropriate, of the loan servicing difficulties of boats that had been inactive due to the weather.  In addition, limited assistance will be made available to shellfish fishermen towards the replacement of gear lost or damaged.</P>
      <P>The scheme will be administered by BIM and payments will be determined by the particular circumstances of each case and total demands under the scheme.  Payments to crews will be based broadly on the rate of support available under social welfare unemployment schemes.  Aid towards the servicing of loans will be considered where serious difficulties exist arising from a fall in landings due to the exceptional bad weather and will be limited to a proportion of the interest overdue.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress that fishermen operating from all areas of our coastline will be entitled to assistance under the scheme subject to the criteria that I have outlined.</P>

      <P>There are 127 fishing vessels, owned by fishermen in County Mayo, entered on the current sea fishing boat register, and 85 of these are based on the north Mayo coast.  All these vessels would be entitled to engage in commercial sea fishing.  During the years 1991-93, one new sea fishing boat licence was granted to a fisherman resident in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>In addition, a special scheme has recently been introduced to regularise the position in relation to certain boats which have been in the fleet for some years, but which for various reasons were unregistered.  Nine applications under the above scheme have already been received from fishermen in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The total tonnage of fish landed at the various ports on the north Mayo coast in 1992 was 530 tonnes.  This was predominately made up of shellfish, mainly mussels, lobster and crab, and whitefish, primarily dogfish, ray and cod.  The total value of fish landed at these ports in 1992 was £0.88 million.</P>

      <P>I accept that the weather conditions until recently have created difficulties for livestock farmers and indeed farmers in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very conscious of the importance of direct payments to farmers in the light <Col N="1359" /> of the CAP reform changes and the need to ensure that such payments reach farmers as quickly as possible with the minimum of red tape.  The position is that some £345 million has already been paid out to farmers on foot of 1993 premium and headage schemes.  These payments are continuing and I expect payments of the order of £40 million to be made over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The EU regulations precluded any payments under the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes before 1 November last and even then limited the payments to 60 per cent advances.  Payment of the balances under these schemes is subject to EU requirements relating to the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density.  This obliges member states to process all applications received from a particular applicant during the course of 1993 before paying out the balances. Payment of the November 1993 special beef premium and the 40 per cent suckler cow premium balance commenced recently and I expect that payment of the 40 per cent balance for the 1993 special beef premium will commence within a few days.  Payment of extensification premium is also linked to stocking density and here too I expect payments to commence by the end of the month.</P>
