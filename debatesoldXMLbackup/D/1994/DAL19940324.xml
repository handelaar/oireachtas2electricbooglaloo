It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 1 shall be brought to a conclusion within one hour and any amendments from the Seanad not disposed of shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments thereto, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate in this House I accepted an amendment from Deputy Quill.  I said I was glad to accept the amendment but that naturally it would have to be sent to the parliamentary draftsman to see if it was acceptable both legally and from the point of view of terminology.  The parliamentary draftsman advised that a number of changes <Col N="1316" /> were necessary and these have been embodied in my amendment which was agreed by the Seanad earlier this week. In essence, this is Deputy Quill's amendment &mdash; the thrust is the same.  The revised wording of the amendment, particularly in paragraphs (ii) and (iii), reflects in legal language Deputy Quill's proposals on new and emerging areas of industrial activity and the potential for multi-skilling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly support this amendment, which meets a number of concerns expressed by Deputies during the debate in this House.  We felt that the Minister should be conscious not only of the traditional apprenticeship sectors but also of new and emerging sectors.  There is growing evidence to suggest that placement is a problem and that some people find it impossible to complete their apprenticeships, thus giving rise to a number of semi-trained apprentices who are unable to find placements.  In dealing with our future training needs, we must concentrate on the needs of the growing number of women coming into the workforce and the development of new areas of industrial training, new skills and multi-skilling.  It is clear that the future lies in multi-skilling rather than in the traditional apprenticeship areas which have been beset by demarcation rules.</P>
      <P>It has to be repeated that our apprenticeship system has proven to be extremely resistant to change.  The Minister must give serious consideration to this matter before deciding on the new areas to be poured into the old casks of the apprenticeship network which have proven very difficult to reform.  The Minister has spoken in glowing terms about the traineeship system in other countries which seems to be much more adaptable and much easier to reform.  That is my only reservation about the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems in this area arise mainly because of the Government's failure to present to the House a proper White Paper on its plans for training.  We are trying to identify well recognised problems in the training area and accommodate all the changes required in the <Col N="1317" /> apprenticeship system under the auspices of this Bill.  In many ways this is an unsatisfactory way to do our business.  We should be debating a White Paper which sets out the Government's strategy, the use of apprenticeships as a proper vehicle for training and the alternative vehicles from other countries which could be used for training so as to meet the emerging needs of women, the need for multi-skilling and developments in the technological area.</P>
    <P>I feel somewhat handicapped in dealing with this amendment.  I accept the principles in the amendment but I am not 100 per cent satisfied that the traditional apprenticeship system will meet the emerging training needs.  While the amendment is an improvement, the Minister must seriously address the defects in the apprenticeship system if she is to meet the needs in this area.  Not least among those defects is the issue on which we devoted much time on Second, Committee and Report Stages, namely, the clearly perceived element of inequity in access to apprenticeships.  I know the Minister has proposed a voluntary code of practice and has retained certain powers to go beyond that code but before she decides to use the apprenticeship model for all of these new areas of training, we would have to be assured that the voluntary system or its alternative compulsory system for equity in recruitment was in place and working well.  We do not wish to see the areas in which women or young people are looking to develop their skills become tied up with the sort of insider network that we have seen in traditional apprenticeships where one cannot get access to an apprenticeship without a sponsor.  Those sponsors are effectively the gatekeepers to the spending of £30 million of taxpayers' money between Irish and EU resources. If the proposal is to increase that £30 million to a much larger figure, we must have an assurance that equity of access is dealt with satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Those are the key considerations.  We are going back over the Second Stage debate but it is important to emphasise again the need to deal with these issues <Col N="1318" /> satisfactorily before we embark on further expansion.  When the Government presented its draft proposals on apprenticeships in December 1989 it clearly did not opt for the current apprenticeship system but for an alternative system where FÁS would short-list suitable applicants for apprenticeships and only from that short list would employers have the discretion to recruit.  That was flagged as the optimal system by the Government but we had to settle for second best.  I do not suggest that was the Minister's fault.  It is clearly the fault of the Government as a whole who in its dealing with the social partners did not obtain an agreement that squared up to what it said was the optimal system.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for putting forward this proposal and I congratulate Deputy Quill for setting out the original draft of the amendment which in a rejigged form should commend itself to the House generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister also for taking on board the spirit and substance of my amendment and for the skilful manner in which she steered it through the Seanad.  I acknowledge also the support of Members of the other parties.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment about which I feel strongly.  It is now accepted worldwide that educational development and training is vital for economic development. In the race between trading blocs, high skills and competencies are seen as giving a competitive advantage to those possessing them.  It is fundamentally important that our people should have a range of skills to enable them compete successfully with other member states of the EU and non-member states in the rapidly intensifying race for employment and the production of goods.</P>

    <P>This is widely acknowledged in the Culliton report, for example, and in the reports of Tansey and Roche and others. Arising from those reports and the concern expressed here, I sought to amend the Bill in a specific way and to highlight deficiencies in our existing training practices, for example, the small number of <Col N="1319" /> women participating in apprenticeship schemes.  I related the low level of training provided here for women to low income because it is a well established fact that low income is a direct consequence of a low level of skills.  I sought to include in this Bill a provision that would help to raise the level of training among women and increase the potential for multi-skilling.  All of the people involved in training use the term &ldquo;multi-skilling&rdquo;. It is a well known and accepted concept within education, within industry and in all areas where people are concerned with training.  It is a phrase used widely in the Culliton report in the section dealing with training.</P>
    <P>My original amendment which referred to multi-skilling has now come back having gone through Committee Stage here, and in the Seanad, and having been the subject of exhaustive discussions between myself and officials of the Department who conscientiously and competently tried to convey my intention to the parliamentary drafts man.  Apparently the parliamentary draftsman, whatever about the concept, cannot cope with the term &ldquo;multi-skilling&rdquo;.  This raises an interesting question that has everything to do with the context but nothing to do with the substance of this Bill.  A wide gulf has developed between the language of the marketplace, of those who are involved in organising our training schemes, and our legislators and the language of the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <P>In my original amendment I referred to an order that the Minister would seek to make under the terms of this Bill.  I sought to amend that by saying: &ldquo;In the making of such an order, the Minister shall at all times take full cognisance of the potential for multi-skilling&rdquo;.  That is directly in line with what everyone concerned with training would advocate.  The following amendment came back from the parliamentary draftsman:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall, ... (take cognisance of) the potential for developing the skills of apprentices in the sector or sectors of industry to be designated <Col N="1320" /> so as to make it possible for them to adapt to technological and other developments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is an extremely imprecise way of wording an amendment put forward in this House with a degree of precision that makes it immediately understandable to everyone involved in designing training schemes.  There is a vagueness about this amendment that does not reflect my original intention.  I respect the effort made by the Minister and her officials to convey my intention to the parliamentary draftsman but the wording of this amendment does not respond precisely to that.  It will lead to a type of vagueness that will not improve the present position.  My intention was to effect an improvement in the Bill.  That was my only intention when I tabled this amendment.</P>
    <P>In another section of my amendment I spoke about &ldquo;the emerging needs of young women&rdquo; which was supported by all Members and parties in this House. That came back from the parliamentary draftpersons as &ldquo;the potential for the recruitment of men and women in the sector or sectors of industry to be designated&rdquo;, an extraordinary watering down of what I had in mind.  I fully accept that we are now precluded by law from singling out one gender as opposed to the other but it seems meaningless in its present form.  Perhaps it might have been better to omit it because, when one examines what has come back to us &mdash;&ldquo;the potential for the recruitment of men and women&rdquo; it makes you wonder who else we would recruit &mdash; chickens and ducks?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The potential for the recruitment of men and women&rdquo; is so meaningless it becomes just another bit of waffle.  I am precluded in law from making special reference to women, or from trying in that way to advance the needs, as I see them for more women to receive better training, and for better provision to be made in any new legislative <Col N="1321" /> measure we enact, to enable that be brought about, I am not certain that what has come back reflects what I had in mind, what the House had in mind and what needs to be said.  My amendment tabled on Committee Stage read:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) In the making of such an order, the Minister shall at all times take full cognisance of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the emerging needs of young women,</P>

      <P>(iii)  the potential for multi-skilling.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>What has come back to us seems to me to be an exercise in filling pages with words as the amendment from the Seanad reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the Minister shall, before making an order under paragraph (a), consider the following matters, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the potential for the recruitment of men and women in the sector or sectors of industry to be designated;</P>
      <P>(ii)  whether or not, having taken into account the state of technological development or other factors that the Minister considers relevant, the sector or sectors of industry to be designated are in a new or developing area of industrial activity;</P>
      <P>(iii)  the potential for developing the skills of apprentices in the sector or sectors of industry to be designated so as to make it possible for them to adapt to technological and other developments;</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State should use her position to engage in some kind of discussions with our parliamentary draftspeople to try to impress on them, if legislation is to be relevant, it will have to resonate in some way to the language of the marketplace, to the language of this House, to <Col N="1322" /> the language that is clearly understood and acted upon by education and training, by all those bodies out there.  We have a serious difficulty with our parliamentary draftspersons.  Clearly there is a language barrier that needs to be breached, something needs to be done about it.  Since we are talking about training, if we have to devise a training scheme to bring our parliamentary draftspersons into the language of the last half of the last decade of the 20th century, then let us incorporate it in this amendment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister fully understands what I have tried to convey. I am hopeful that, in all her discussions endeavouring to put in place better, relevant and up-to-date apprenticeship schemes here, she will take on board the clearly articulated wishes of every Member who spoke in this House in relation to multi-skilling which is fundamentally important in relation to advancing the rights and needs of women with apprenticeship schemes, in the need to extend properly designed training and apprenticeship schemes to whole areas of industry not yet designated or developed. I am sure the Minister of State will take the thrust of that on board.  I thank her for her part in endeavouring to incorporate the bones of what I had tried to advance in the Bill.  I also thank her officials for the support they gave me on this.  However, it is about time we cut down on the waffle.  I had sought to strengthen in law what we all feel needs to be done, which indeed was recommended by people like Culliton and other experts.  I am disappointed that it has come back from the Seanad in this very woolly, vague form because it certainly does not reflect the views of the Members of this House who spoke on this aspect of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is essentially Deputy Quill's amendment from Committee Stage and I was happy to support it then.  I accept that the Minister of State has made some effort in including it, albeit in a changed fashion, in the Seanad amendment before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the problem is that we are <Col N="1323" /> endeavouring to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  Inevitably we have ranged wider into some of the more fundamental questions posed by industrial training efficiencies than were prescribed in the Bill which sought to do no more than levy a portion of the quite extensive cost of industrial training on employers.  In itself that constitutes minimal progress after many years of tussling with the issue.  All parties in the House, and the Minister agreed on Second Stage that, unfortunately, most employers seem to view the question of training as a cost on industry rather than an investment in productivity and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Deputy Richard Bruton had a very strong, fundamental point when he argued from the beginning for the necessity for a whole rethink of the industrial training and apprenticeship system to have been set out in a White Paper so that we could consider questions like this in context.  That is a fundamental argument, one which highlights the difficulty posed for us in dealing with a very narrow aspect of the entire industrial training question.</P>
    <P>Competitiveness seems to be the &ldquo;in&rdquo; word.  We now have a <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  I understand the employers wanted to call it a Programme for Competitiveness and the trade unions were successful in having tacked on the terms &ldquo;and Work&rdquo;.  I am not sure whether, like a lot of things we do, there is too much meaning to that.  However, if one is to look at the question of competitiveness, Deputy Quill is quite right in pointing to the significance of industrial training.</P>
    <P>I took issue with a colleague in the House yesterday who seemed to be of the view that our special tax regime of 10 per cent was the main plank of our competitiveness in this economy as far as the multinationals are concerned.  I do not believe that is the case and the multinationals admit there are other factors for their presence.  They are here generally speaking, because we have a well trained, highly educated, English-speaking workforce; because they want to gain access <Col N="1324" /> to European Union markets and other reasons in addition to the special tax regime.</P>
    <P>This area Deputy Quill has highlighted is a significant factor in international competitiveness.  If one does not have a workforce trained to the highest degree possible, that has the multi-skill adaptability and flexibility about which Deputy Quill spoke, our competitive ness is undermined.  Therefore, it is difficult to confront an issue as major as this.  For example, in my Second Stage contribution, I dealt in passing with the system that obtains in Germany.  Other Members of the House agree that although it is a radically different system, we should examine it in terms of revamping policy in this area.  We are hidebound by the fact that the Bill is so narrow that it merely deals with the question of whether employers ought to be required to make a contribution to the fairly significant costs of apprenticeship.  The Minister will say that she has broadened the Bill somewhat to deal with the question of equitable recruitment.  She has, but like Deputy Quill I do not know whether this amendment is more than aspirational.  The Minister is now required to consider these matters. Having regard to the traditional profile of apprenticeship and the practices that have obtained for hundreds of years, the Minister can reasonably say she is implementing the letter if not the spirit of this Bill without impacting greatly on the three headings in the amendment. The traditional profile is such and patterns on this question are so ingrained in both sides of industry, that the Minister merely taking those factors into consideration will not bring about a sea change in attitudes which will either facilitate greater equity in access or on the question of multi-skilling.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill has raised an intriguing question on multi-skilling, on which I would like to hear the Minister's views. In industry in 1994 the term &ldquo;multi-skilling&rdquo; is as commonplace as any other that has been in vogue since we became an industrial country.  I am intrigued as to why the draftspersons should find the <Col N="1325" /> word unsuitable.  The text of the amendment, paragraph (iii), reads:</P>
    <P>the potential for developing the skills of apprentices of the sector or sectors of industry to be designated so as to make it possible for them to adapt to technological and other developments;</P>
    <P>Perhaps it means the same thing but I am mystified as to why a term that is in vogue, which is understood by both sides of industry where traditional demarcation is breaking down, is somehow repugnant to the draftpersons.  The Minister will be aware that the question of multi-skilling is at the coalface of some disputes that have surfaced recently.  It is a bitter pill to swallow for some traditional craftpersons that we are no longer in the era of the one skill, one dimensional approach to craft and so on.  Multi-skilling is pertinent and relevant in the context in which Deputy Quill raises it.  I do not know, and I am open to being convinced by the Minister, why the term is jettisoned in favour of waffle.  I always thought it was the task of Government, with their superior resources to point to imprecision in amendments put forward by the Opposition and to tidy them up. In this case it is the opposite.  While I welcome the amendment in so far as it goes, I wonder whether it will be meaningful at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The emerging needs of women was a key factor in this legislation.  The Minister is as genuine in supporting these needs as is anybody on this side of the House. However, despite all the well intentioned aspirations in the world, the prospect of the emerging needs and requirements of women in the workplace being acceded to and developed is slim.  The enshrining of a mere aspirational intention in legislation will not change that.</P>
    <P>The Minister opted for the voluntary code of practice following discussion with the social partners.  As I said at the time, it is patently evident to anybody in public life that the views of the social partners matter a great deal more than those of us who seek election to this House.  We will see how long that continues and whether it is a good thing.  It is time somebody <Col N="1326" /> made an academic analysis of the stifling consensus which is smothering debate here, but that is another day's work.  The Minister decided to opt for the voluntary code because this was the preference of the social partners.  I wish the Minister well, but I am not sure that at the end of the two year trial period, it will have produced a great deal of tangible results. I would like to hear the Minister threaten to review it and take what legislative measures may be necessary in the event of the voluntary code not producing the desired results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the three Deputies opposite for their practical contribution to the debate.  Deputy Richard Bruton spoke on the theme which pervaded his Second Stage contribution, a theme which the other two Deputies support, that is the need for a White Paper on industrial training.  It is an idea worthy of consideration.  Because the Bill was prepared before my appointment to this Department and it was a good idea to establish a standard based system we wanted to proceed with it.  However, there is a wider dimension to industrial training which must be addressed.  I recognise that the standards based system is only the first halt on the road towards industrial training.  A White Paper now might be a good idea.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Quill recognised that we had made efforts with her amendment on Committee Stage, she took issue with the draftspersons.  I consulted with officials having accepted Deputy Quill's amendment and was informed that &ldquo;multi-skilling&rdquo; is not recognised terminology in law.  We work within the constraints placed on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quill's comments were interesting because we have often been told in our clinics that this Chamber is not relevant and that people outside do not heed what is going on here.  Surely, then, we must adapt our language; without using slang.  I understand that the jargon of the day cannot be put into law but the term &ldquo;multi-skilling&rdquo;, is now an accepted industrial work term.  Because it is so widely applicable, both in education <Col N="1327" /> and training, perhaps it lacks precision. While the Deputy was making her contribution I was again informed that the term &ldquo;multi-skilling&rdquo; was the one with which the draftsman found fault.  We are precluded by law from saying &ldquo;women&rdquo; on their own, it must be &ldquo;men and women&rdquo;.  I asked if it could be &ldquo;women and men&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I take the point that one cannot discriminate in law and say &ldquo;women&rdquo; on their own but I wanted to see if we could use the phrase &ldquo;women and men&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;men and women&rdquo; because placing the emphasis on &ldquo;women&rdquo; would have its own tale to tell in an implied way.  It is something I intend to take up.  I relate that incident because of its veracity and because it is quite odd.</P>
      <P>On the multi-skilling issue, the parliamentary draftsman said the word must be legal but the gap between what is legal and what is not and what we do in the real world needs to be addressed in more modern language.  In the Seanad, Senator Dardis said the old industrial Acts of the 1940s were written in plainer, simpler and clearer language and were more precise.  I will commend that to the draftsman and send him a <i>billet doux</i>.  I do not know if that is allowed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte spoke about the need to be competitive and the German tradition.  As regards the voluntary code I do not intend to wait until the end of the two years.  The <Col N="1328" /> Department will monitor the code and if companies do not live up to it we will have to introduce legislation.</P>
      <P>In the notes I circulated to Members I set out the trades we brought into the new system last September.  By the new system I mean the standards based system.  The remaining ten trades are also listed.  We will start the second stage of our phased introduction of the new trades this September and the third stage next September.  There was clear recognition in the talks between officials in the Department and the EU that we have shifted to the standards based system. They want to know when it will be concluded. The funding has been agreed and arranged.  There are strong positive signals coming from Brussels for the new standards based apprenticeship system and I took heart from that.</P>
      <P>To those outside bodies who said I did not have sufficient consultation, I met IBEC, CIF, SIMI, ICTU, the Department of Education and the TUI.  The construction industry poses difficulties. There are new ways of doing work in that industry.  The old large firm taking in its cadre of apprentices each year is being broken down into smaller units.  There is not the same belief that physical trades need to be brought along.  Though the industry has come quite a distance of the road with me it has not sorted out all its difficulties.  We all know the fine system of apprenticeships in the ESB, Aer Lingus, Telecom Éireann, Bord na Móna and Bus Éireann.  The local authorities used to have a strong apprenticeship system but they have moved away from that.  I will meet all these bodies separately and ask them to enhance their apprenticeship systems.  Many young people benefited from these but in latter years the numbers have been limited.  I am sure I will be told it is a question of money but perhaps we can come to some arrangement about redistribution.  There is a long history and tradition of apprenticeships in these areas which I would like to see enlarged.  This has been included in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the next six years, <i>la fouchette</i> or <Col N="1329" /> not, large sums of money will be given for sewerage schemes, building, water schemes and roads.  I put the proposal that each firm tendering for public works must show how many apprentices they will take on to the CIF and they did not faint on the spot.  This has also been included in the programme.  I know Deputy Rabbitte will tell me not to hold my breath.  I do not know if it will infringe on EU rules.</P>
    <P>This is only the beginning.  This is a Pandora's box and it took all my skills to come to grips with it.  I have not done so yet.  I pay tribute to FÁS who is committed to the new apprenticeship system and training.  The existing trades are the practical ones but in the new arena I want them to be apprenticeship/training and free from much of the bureaucracy which has needlessly hindered progress on the road to the new standards based system.  I look forward to further debates on industrial training and am considering issuing a discussion document on the way forward in this area.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their strong inputs to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said.  Most people would consider that the language is convoluted.  At the end of the day what matters in relation to the recruitment of women and opportunities for women is not what we put into the law and whether we put &ldquo;women&rdquo; before &ldquo;men&rdquo; but what the Minister intends to do about it.  It seems the Minister has shied away from the Commission for the Status of Women's suggestion of apprenticeship quotas. There is the additional difficulty that of the 30 female apprentices in traditional areas who were taken on none has completed the apprenticeship.  The issue is not the language but what it directs the Minister and her successors to do and that is what I am interested in hearing from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Minister has had wide consultations but evaluation and not consultation is the issue.  We need to take on board the views of all representative <Col N="1330" /> bodies, large and small, and if they say the system is not working to meet their needs or they raise questions on the standards reached we have to take their criticisms seriously.  Fine Gael tabled an amendment to build evaluation into the apprenticeship scheme but the Government did not respond positively.  Evaluation of the new system will be critical.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Government to talk about building in a requirement to employ apprentices, but putting requirements into contracts that the Government does not honour in its internal workings is not convincing.  The Government has been extraordinarily slow in developing new systems of employment within its own remit that would bring more women into the workplace, such as flexitime, job sharing and other measures to facilitate women in the workplace.  When faced with an equality ruling that suggested that married women might have the right to return to the public service it decided to abolish that right enjoyed by widows and deserted wives under a previous code.  One wonders how convincing the Government is when preaching to other sectors.  Training and apprenticeships in the public service are nothing to boast about.  The Government should lead by example and not just by inserting statements in contracts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as initiated, was short and specific but the Minister was good enough to broaden the discussion and the Bill is better for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Bruton's recommendation on the need to put in place a comprehensive discussion document on apprenticeships and training.  We know what is wrong but we are not clear at all times how to put it right.  We are aware that a number of training schemes are not yielding what young people and their parents expect.  I hope that when we are spending our allocation of European Union funds we will make a proper evaluation of the training schemes that are working well and seek to strengthen and enhance them and make other necessary changes to ensure that young people get <Col N="1331" /> a good return on the money invested in them.  The future of the country depends on the level of skill and training of its workforce.  They are our greatest asset and are much more important than building bridges, tunnels or interpretative centres.  The investment we make in education and training will serve us well as we enter an era of intense competition. Education and training is the key.  It is important that the schemes are well designed and that we spend resources wisely.</P>
    <P>I attempted to address in my amendments the poor level of training for women which leads to low paid work. We need to put in place training of a standard that is equivalent to that in competing countries.  That can only be addressed fully and logically in the context of a comprehensive discussion document. I appeal to the Minister to bring forward such a document as soon as possible. Many apprenticeship schemes are in chaos and young people are finding it extremely difficult to secure an apprenticeship. A Member recently said that it is now easier for a young person to get a place at university than to get an apprenticeship. That tells us how apprenticeship schemes are viewed.  It will have to be remedied.  That can be done only in the context of a comprehensive discussion drawing on the expert advice available. A number of reports by experts tell us how we should design our training schemes and we ought not to ignore them.  We face a huge task in that we have to alter the attitudes to training.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte told of the successful training and apprenticeship schemes in Germany.  It is the tradition that German employers have an obligation to the upcoming generation to ensure they get the best training possible and they discharge their obligation in the most practical way possible.  Irish employers do not always see their obligation in that light. There is an obligation on everybody to cultivate that type of attitude and impress on employers their duty to play their part in ensuring that the young workforce is trained to the highest possible standard. <Col N="1332" /> That will involve a great deal of consultation and discussion.  The Minister has a key role to play &mdash; I acknowledge that she is playing it actively &mdash; in persuading employers to change their attitudes to training.</P>
    <P>Changes are taking place in formal education and a much greater emphasis will be placed on vocational training in mainstream senior cycle education. These changes are being put in place by the Minister for Education.  In my time the person with a good head for books was a great person who would do great work in the country but nobody ever praised the child who had a good pair of hands, a good eye or a great deal of creativity.  Nothing was as important in my day as having a good head for the books.  There has been a change in thinking and this is reflected in formal education. In parallel with this we must introduce training schemes.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the use of unparliamentary language; I do not want the word &ldquo;multi-skilling&rdquo; to become the new &ldquo;F&rdquo; word.  Will the Minister of State drag the parliamentary draftsman screaming and kicking into the 20th century in regard to the language deemed to be legal?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish Deputy Creed every success on his appointment as spokesperson in this area.  I will be delighted to co-operate <Col N="1333" /> with him as I have with other spokespersons. The Bill represents an important step in the process of enhancing the administrative structures and procedures for identifying, preserving, and exhibiting physical representations of our national heritage whether they be in the form of archaeological objects found, monuments or sites of archaeological interest.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed in this Bill should be seen against the background of a Government Department which for the first time has the overall responsibility under one administrative structure for co-ordinating policy in respect of all the strands encompassed within the discipline of archaeology ranging from the moment an object is discovered in a field, the conservation and interpretation of the object found, its public exhibition and its integration into the contexts of history, education and art.  I will be bringing before the House in the coming months other related legislative proposals in a Bill to put the Heritage Council on a statutory footing, and in a Bill which is at an advanced stage of preparation to establish the National Museum as an autonomous entity with the objective of affording it as much freedom as possible to develop its role as an integral part of the national culture.  I also take this opportunity to point to my recent decision to establish an interim board to advise me on the future direction of the National Museum.  I wish its chairperson, Barbara Nugent, and her fellow members well in their endeavours.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of these wider proposals coming to fruition in the near future it is appropriate at this juncture to note the pivotal role of the National Museum in providing the vital link between the world of academic scholarship and research &mdash; exemplified by the work of archaeologists &mdash; and the wider public dimension within which such contribution must be assessed.  I have already paid tribute to the work carried out in the public interest by the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society which were authorised by the Crown, especially during the 19th century, to collect, <Col N="1334" /> record and protect the most precious of our artefacts, which led in time to the creation of the repository of these treasures in the National Museum.  The 1877 Dublin Science and Art Museum Act which created the museum was a major achievement of co-operative action between the various main bodies involved acting in the public interest and is still the cornerstone of our administrative structures.</P>
    <P>Such co-operative action has always needed legislative and financial back-up, as well as administrative structures deriving their authority from the State.  There has always been an obligation on the State to underline its role and purpose, by providing the necessary legislative tools with which to preserve, protect and foster the heritage of the people.</P>
    <P>Renewed attention to the structures within which the work of archaeology will be conducted in the future is particularly important at this juncture, not just for broad cultural reasons which would enjoy the support of everybody in this House but because at the core of this Bill are provisions dealing in a comprehensive way with the ownership and protection of archaeological objects.</P>
    <P>The Irish State has an honourable legislative record in its efforts to protect the physical manifestations of our cultural and artistic heritage.  In its day the National Monuments Act, 1930 was an early reflection of the fledgling Irish State's capacity &mdash; and will &mdash; to afford adequate protection to archaeological objects as well as preservation of national monuments, but the characteristics and needs of a society are constantly evolving and what was sufficient in one era may no longer suffice in another.  While the Act was updated in 1954 and 1987, it is no longer adequate for the tasks which face us today.</P>
    <P>The primary element of the Bill can be tracked back to the finding of the Derrynaflan hoard on the afternoon of Sunday, 17 February 1980 by Mr. Michael Webb and his son Michael.  This event was a dramatic example of the unpreparedness of the State to deal with a problem in the latter part of the 20th <Col N="1335" /> century with non-legislative administrative tools crafted in the middle of the 19th century.  As we know, the Webb v. Ireland case led, ultimately, at the end of 1987 to an invitation to the Oireachtas from the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Finlay &mdash; backed by the late Mr. Justice McCarthy and Mr. Justice Walsh &mdash; and outlined in their landmark judgment to provide a statutory basis for the State's claim to ownership of objects of archaeological interest of national importance which are discovered with no known owner.</P>
    <P>The judgment was of great importance not just for establishing the right of the State to the ownership of a specific remarkable hoard rivalling in importance the great finds of the 19th century.  The importance extended to the judgment's conclusions concerning all important objects of antiquity in the context of the State's overall role and purpose.  In the judgment it was reasoned that the State had a right to the ownership of treasure trove &mdash; described by one leading legal authority as &ldquo;gold or silver in coin, plate, or bullion found concealed in a house or in the earth or other private place, the owner thereof being unknown&rdquo;&mdash; not as a result of any ancient royal prerogative but as an inherent right of the people of Ireland.  Mr. Justice Finlay said:</P>
    <P>... the essential point is that by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution of 1922 what was being created was a brand new sovereign State and that the function, power or position of the King in that sovereign State was such only as was vested in him by that Constitution and by the State created by it.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to highlight the judgment's declaration that the State's prerogative on behalf of the people derived not just from the 1922 Constitution but also from Article 5 of the 1937 Constitution which declares that &ldquo;Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic State&rdquo; and from Article 10 which attributed to the State &ldquo;all royalites and franchises within that jurisdiction&rdquo;.  I am struck by the <Col N="1336" /> insight, clarity and vision of Mr. Justice Finlay's words: &ldquo;... it would appear to me consistent with the framework of the society sought to be created and sought to be protected by the Constitution that such objects should become the exclusive property of those who by chance may find them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of necessity much time has had to be devoted to the task of absorbing the lessons of the judgment by all those concerned with the interaction of the Constitution on the legislative matrix of the State.  We have been enormously assisted by the penetrating clarity of the words of Mr. Justice Finlay.  Not least of those concerned with this interaction of the Constitution on the legal matrix of the State was the late and distinguished Mr. John Kelly, who so often spoke in this House with such power, conviction and humour.  Speaking in Trinity College on the occasion of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Constitution he said in his preliminary remarks:</P>
    <P>the three judgments..., if not a buried treasure, are a sort of open-cast mine of material on the Constitution of the Irish Free State, the Constitution of Ireland, the incidents of sovereignty, the fate of the royal prerogative, the extent of rights of land ownership, the mode of conveyance of chattels, the interpretation of statutory words, the admission of non-statutory materials in explanation of a statute's reach, the bearing of the possible commission of an offence on the offender's possible rights at civil law arising in the same transaction.</P>
    <P>As John Kelly and all those either interested in or affected by the Supreme Court's analysis of the nature of the royal prerogative in the context of a sovereign independent Republic recognised &mdash; and remember beyond the argument of 1922 and 1937 the State had now been declared a Republic &mdash; this judgment would show a capacity to mould the future evolution of the State.  Whatever one's political response, the judgment still stands as an integral part of the law of the land, clarifying <Col N="1337" /> as it does the scope of the State's power in the area of royalties.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is, therefore, to give statutory expression to the central call of the Supreme Court to legislate for the ownership of treasure trove to take greater cognisance of the State's continuing obligation to protect and preserve the heritage of the people, as represented by all antiquities of importance and not just treasure trove, and to take on board the court's suggestions, in the interest of common justice, to expressly provide for the payment of a reward to persons reporting the finding of such objects.</P>
    <P>Accordingly the main challenge posed to us as legislators has been to strike the right balance between the constitutional rights of all, with the obligation on the State to ensure the preservation and, where it arises, the acquisition of objects and artefacts which are important representations of our heritage.</P>
    <P>The central provisions of the Bill are designed to underpin the fundamental finding of the Supreme Court that the people of the State have a right of ownership to archaeological objects which otherwise have no known owner.  All items found after the enactment of the Bill where there is no known owner must be reported to and are deemed to be the property of the State.  The Bill redefines the term &ldquo;archaeological object&rdquo; to include the concept of treasure trove &mdash; one of the suggestions made by Chief Justice Finlay.  The possession, sale and acquisition of archaeological objects found after the enactment of the Bill is prohibited unless the State has waived its rights to ownership, a right that is based in the constitutional expression of the rights of all the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>So that the State will at least be aware of the existence and location of every archaeological object found in the State since 1930 and in private hands, the Bill will require that all such objects must be reported to the Director of the National Muesum and that any transaction of such an object must be likewise reported.  At present, by virtue of the National Monuments Act, 1930, there is only an obligation <Col N="1338" /> on the finder of an object in the State to report the discovery of an archaeological object.  There is no parallel obligation on the possessor of such an object to make a report.  The effect of these provisions will be to allow protection to be extended to all such objects in private hands while not affecting the right of an established owner to sell them.  The Bill provides, of necessity, for offences and penalties for breaches of these provisions, consistent with the seriousness of the offences.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill amends certain provisions of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1987 by extending the protection given to monuments and historic sites under these Acts by closing loopholes in the legal controls and by aiding co-operation between the main conservation agencies.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to empower the Commissioners of Public Works to establish a record of national monuments and of sites where they believe national monuments may be located so that every known national monument will be given the cloak of a basic protection and in such a way as also fully respects the rights of landowners.</P>
    <P>For many people, it is the artefact or monument itself that symbolises the identity of a people.  The images such as those printed on the front cover of every school child's homework copy as a daily reminder of the physical manifestation of our heritage are part of what we are &mdash; the Ardagh Chalice, the Tara Brooch, the Monasterboice High Cross and the Borrisnoe Collar.  There is more.  To have visited an historic site such as Clonmacnoise or Newgrange leaves one with the knowledge &mdash; and responsibility &mdash; of knowing that we are but the latest inheritors of a long, proud and inspiring past.  While the artefacts and monuments, in themselves, are very important, in more recent years it is the sites in which such artefacts have been discovered, particularly when in an undisturbed site, that have been seen to yield up or constitute a reservoir of amazing information about our ancestors and, through them, about ourselves.  When archaeologists <Col N="1339" /> have been given the opportunity properly to excavate such sites, they have, using the strict disciplines of their profession and helped by modern forensic technology, been able to begin piecing together the complex jigsaw of the past.</P>
    <P>With this broader perspective in mind I would like to draw the attention of Deputies especially to section 15 of the Bill which extends legislative protection to such sites of archaeological importance. The proposal arises from the commitment made in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> to &ldquo;prohibit the giving of consent to the demolition of monuments without approval by the Oireachtas in exceptional circumstances and after a full archaeological excavation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At present the Commissioners for Public Works, or the local authorities acting jointly with the commissioners are empowered, under the National Monuments Act, 1930, to give consent to the demolition or alteration of a national monument in the care of the commissioners or of a local authority or a national monument in private ownership which is the subject of a preservation order.  The consent may be given by the commissioners in the interests of archaeology or for any other reason.</P>
    <P>In the majority of cases where such a consent would be sought the purpose would be to allow an archaeological excavation. However, it may also happen that other physical changes to a monument might be required for reasons of public safety or health, for instance, if a monument is in a dangerous condition.  It can happen too that consent would be given when the purpose is to allow a building programme to proceed.  The most notable example of a consent of this nature would commonly be regarded as the joint consent given by the commissioners and the local authorities in respect of the Wood Quay site in Dublin in 1979.</P>
    <P>The clash of interest between the imperatives of heritage and the exigencies of development over the fate of the archaeological site at Wood Quay <Col N="1340" /> involved the people of Ireland as never before.  When called upon, the State's legislative and administrative structure, as with the Derrynaflan case, was insufficient for the task of channelling the argument in a manner acceptable as fair to all involved.  What happened at Wood Quay was perhaps the single most important incident affecting the administration of archaeology in this State and the trauma has reverberated to the present day.  While in the intervening decade administrators have done much to accommodate the often competing needs of development and archaeology, in the absence of broader and more democratic legislative structures there is nonetheless still a potentiality for damaging conflict.  In the present co-operative environment it can be anticipated that cases like Wood Quay should not arise. However, where such a conflict of interest does arise there will at least be a process in place that will allow an informed debate and the ultimate decision to be taken in a manner which permits prior maximum consultation and open expression of views.</P>
    <P>I will now give a more detailed explanation of the various substantive provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 expressly establishes the State's right to ownership of all archaeological objects which have no known owner and which are found in the State after the Bill is enacted.  This is the single most important provision in the Bill.  It removes any doubt which might exist regarding the State's right to the ownership of archaeological objects found after the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides the State with a waiver of its rights to the ownership of an archaeological object.  It is not necessary to retain possession of every single artefact found.  In many cases it will be sufficient simply to know the details and the circumstances of the find.  The situation may also arise that there are already a number of similar samples of the object under full State control, and it would be unnecessary to retain all such similar objects.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 provide for restrictions as to the possession, sale, exchange or <Col N="1341" /> disposal of an archaeological object found in the State after the enactment of the Bill or objects not properly reported under the National Monuments Act, 1930.  Section 4 in particular is designed to place a complete prohibition on transactions in objects found after the enactment of the Bill, unless the State has waived its rights to ownership.  Section 5 is to ensure that the director of the National Museum is made aware of transactions in archaeological objects found at any time between the passing of the National Monuments Act, 1930 &mdash; when controls on finds of archaeological objects were first introduced &mdash; and the enactment of this Bill.  These sections also provide, of necessity, for heavy penalties arising from breach of these restrictions. Such penalties are based on the fact that what is being damaged is our heritage, the common good and our future citizens.</P>
    <P>Section 6 permits the director of the National Museum to designate a person to carry out his or her functions in relation to receiving archaeological objects, and to designate places where such objects may be placed for safe-keeping, such as Garda stations or other secure locations.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this provision is to allow for delegation of the director's functions regarding finds made after the passing of the Act in a situation where the director is not immediately available to take charge of the protection or preservation of an archaeological object or the site of a find of this nature.  At present there is no statutory provision for the delegation of the director's functions, nor is there any statutory provision for the approval of locations outside the National Museum suitable for the safe storing or exhibition of archaeological objects, but this matter is being addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the seizure by the gardaí and forfeiture by the courts of unauthorised detection devices and diving equipment found at the site of a national monument or a site protected by an underwater heritage order.  There is only one underwater heritage order in place at present protecting two crannogs <Col N="1342" /> in County Leitrim.  In making provision for this stringent enforcement power it is important to bear in mind that it will only be applicable where the threat is to a site of national importance.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the control measures in the National Monuments Act, 1987, curtailing the use of metal detectors was necessary to bring to an end the widespread and systematic destruction of our physical heritage which unguided and unsupervised use of detection devices had wrought in the early 1980s.  As a result of the legislative measures taken and the enforcement action of gardaí and the archaeological authorities the destructive use of metal detectors was largely halted.  However, unauthorised use by a hard core of offenders is still persisting despite the precautionary measures already in place. The purpose of the provision is to provide an effective deterrent against the use of such equipment by the small minority that are persisting in unauthorised search for archaeological objects within the State.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for inspections and excavations to be carried out by the director of the National Museum where the director perceives an immediate threat of decay or destruction to the site of the find.  This is because the context of a find is often more valuable in terms of the information which can be gleaned than the object itself and it is essential that the director be in a position to derive the vital information swiftly and without any potential delaying factor.  It is intended that the work of the director will encompass no more than the immediate task of evaluating and recording the characteristics of a site.  While some excavation of a minor nature may be necessary this would encompass only the immediate surroundings of the find. Should the investigations and accompanying excavation, if any, point to the desirability of a more important and wide-ranging excavation at some future time then this would have to be dealt with under the broad provisions relating to monuments.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 9 is to give <Col N="1343" /> general effect to the Supreme Court judgment in the case relating to the Derrynaflan hoard which clarified that archaeological objects which are discovered and which have no known owner are the property of the State.  Accordingly, this section sets out the mechanism whereby the State can take possession of archaeological objects with no known owner found after the coming into operation of this Bill.  The provision empowers and requires the director of the National Museum, on behalf of the State and the people, to take possession of the archaeological object on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that this provision shall not apply to an object which is not, in the opinion of the director, of sufficient historical or archaeological interest to justify its retention by the State.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the payment of a reward to a person finding an archaeological object.  Where such object is retained by the State the Director of the National Museum is empowered to make payment to any or all of those associated with the finding of an archaeological object, namely the finder of the object, the owner of the land on which the object is found, or the occupier.  I emphasise it is a reward for responsibility rather than a transaction.</P>
    <P>While rewards have been paid in the past it is important to emphasise that these were by way of administrative sanction only, by grace and favour of the State.  Now there will be a provision which gives clear statutory basis for such payments.  Section 10 also establishes, as it must, that while rewards may be paid in the public interest, there is no suggestion that the finder of an archaeological object could have any claim to ownership of the object as the object in question will be owned by the State.  The provision sets out, in so far as it is reasonably feasible to do so, the criteria which the Director of the National Museum must take into account when evaluating whether a reward should be paid and how much &mdash; the criteria includes the intrinsic value <Col N="1344" /> and importance of the object, the circumstances of its findings and amounts paid in other comparable cases.  The provision makes clear that the reward is not an entitlement or a right.  The intention is to reward the conscientious finder of an object who reports the find responsibly to the director of the museum and not the professional treasure hunter who only reports the finding of an object simply as a last resort.  In accordance with established practice in matters involving a possibly very substantial payment from public funds, a reward would be made only with my consent as Minister and the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 11 updates and extends the scope of the provision of the 1987 Act which deals with the acquisition of national monuments by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The amending provision gives the commissioners new power to purchase rights of way and other easements at national monument sites and introduces a specific mechanism for compulsory purchase and calculation of compensation should such an eventuality become unavoidable.  The underlining principle behind these provisions is governed by the obligation of the commissioners under the national monuments Acts to facilitate people in gaining access to view monuments of national importance.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the policy of the commissioners is to always try to come to a voluntary amicable arrangement with the landowner for purchase of the site.  This policy has been successful in the main but occasionally problems have arisen particularly in respect of rights-of-way to certain important sites. Therefore, while it is anticipated that the compulsory aspect of the purchase would be rarely used whether to buy land outright, or to purchase a right-of-way, the option that the power represents, is considered nonetheless an essential tool in the maintenance of the inherent right of people to be allowed visit without unnecessary hindrance, the most significant physical manifestations of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the establishment <Col N="1345" /> by the Commissioners of Public Works on a statutory basis of a list of all monuments and places where they believe monuments are located.  Over the past two decades, and during the last ten years in particular, a preliminary but comprehensive national record detailing where it is believed monuments and monument places known as sites are located, has been compiled on survey maps by the Office of Public Works, details of which are held on individual files located in that office.  The maps are structured on a county by county basis. The nation-wide survey was completed in 1992 and the detailed maps have been distributed to all planning authorities throughout the country and are already open for inspection for those wishing to know where monuments may be located. These maps are known as Sites and Monuments Records or SMRs.  There are about 150,000 such monuments recorded on SMRs.</P>
    <P>This provision is a key addition to the protection which can be afforded to our immoveable heritage.  Monuments and sites recorded under this section will be immediately put under the protection of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Two months notice must be given before work of any nature can begin on sites recorded under this provision except in the case of emergencies and then only with the consent of the commissioners.  Action in this period would involve consultation with the owner or occupier as to how best to accommodate his or her legitimate interests and concerns while ensuring that the most appropriate means of protecting the monument is taken.  By providing for a formal exhibition of SMRs in each county landowners will also have the opportunity of establishing for themselves if any monuments exist on their property.</P>
    <P>Another positive effect of the provision will be to remove the inherent unfairness that exists in the law that makes it an offence for an archaeologist to excavate at the site of a monument without a licence but places no restraint on others who may dig out or completely destroy a monument for any other purpose <Col N="1346" /> because that monument has not been accorded specific protection from such treatment.  The section also extends the prohibition contained in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987 on the possession and use of detection devices at a monument or place so recorded.</P>
    <P>Section 13 sets out the penalties for non-compliance with the various offences.  The penalties have been pitched at a level commensurate with the seriousness of the offences.</P>
    <P>Section 14 makes a key amendment to the existing definition of archaeological object by including the concept of treasure trove.</P>
    <P>Section 15 sets out the circumstances in which the commissioners shall give their consent to the alteration or destruction of a national monument in their care or to a removal of a preservation order from a national monument.  The commissioners, or the commissioners and local authorities jointly, will continue to be empowered to give a consent for reasons of archaeology without reference to the Minister.  If consent is sought for reasons of threat to public health and safety it will now have to be submitted to the Minister for decision.  In these circumstances the Minister would have the authority to refuse such consent.  Should the Minister wish to give such consent for any reason other than for threat to public health or safety he or she would be required to make an appropriate statutory order but the order would not become operative until the Houses of the Oireachtas had been given the opportunity to debate and annul the order if either House so desired.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 16 is to change a reporting procedure so that all archaeological objects and associated materials found in water or on land covered by water are now to be reported to the Director of the National Museum, rather than to the commissioners or the Garda as at present, as it is the National Museum which is the State's repository of all archaeological objects.</P>
    <P>At present the 1987 Act provides for the mandatory reporting by the finder of <Col N="1347" /> all wrecks over 100 years old and for the reporting of wrecks under 100 years old but only when found on a restricted area site where there is an underwater heritage order in place.  The new provision provides that an archaeological object, which could encompass the wreck itself regardless of its age, found in water, under 100 years old, and whether or not found in a restricted area, must be reported by the person who found the object.</P>
    <P>Section 17 revises and extends the procedures for reporting the finding of archaeological objects as first set out in the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>At present objects must be reported within four days of discovery to the Garda or the Director of the National Museum, basic details about the find must be provided, the object must be allowed to be examined and photographed, and the director to take possession of the object for a period not exceeding six weeks.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide an updated and streamlined procedure whereby archaeological objects found after the passing of the Act are to be protected and preserved prior to a decision being taken by the Director of the National Museum as to whether such items should be retained by the State.  The administrative changes from the provision contained in the 1987 Act include the reporting of all finds to the Director of the National Museum only, the removal of the maximum period for which an object may be held by the director, more precision in the details to be provided by the finder.  As well as the changes inserted are new provisions setting out how an object found under the Act is to be handled prior to coming into the possession of the director.  The level of penalties has been increased substantially to reflect the seriousness of the offence committed now that such objects are the property of the State.</P>
    <P>Section 18 extends the provisions of section 25 of the National Monuments Act, 1930 by prohibiting the cleaning, restoring or sampling by any process of <Col N="1348" /> archaeological objects except under and in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister.  The purpose of this amendment is to afford comprehensive protection to archaeological objects by prohibiting other potential sources of damage which might not in themselves constitute injury, defacement or destruction.</P>
    <P>Section 19 formalises a process of consultation between the Director of the National Museum and the Commissioners of Public Works before an excavation licence is granted by the commissioners, for instance, on the most appropriate measures to be taken, and perhaps stipulated on the licence, to ensure adequacy of provision for the permanent and temporary storage and conservation of excavated finds.</P>
    <P>Section 20 clarifies that where a search warrant has been issued to a member of the Garda Síochána, in relation to a possible offence under the National Monuments (Amendment) Acts such member may be accompanied by the Director of the National Museum or other person so designed.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have appreciated by now that the Bill is designed to deal with the fundamental requirements of identifying, acquiring and preserving our national heritage.</P>
    <P>Cuireann an Bille atá os comhair an Tí struchtúr cosanta ar fáil chun séadchomharthí agus earraí gaolmhara a chaomhnú &mdash; struchtúr a bheidh láidir go leor, tá súil agam, do riachtanais an lae inniu chomh maith le do riachtanais na nglún atá le teacht.  Creidim féin go gcaithfear glacadh leis na forálacha seo chun cothabháil ár n-oidhreachta corportha &mdash; bíodh sí sonraithe i rudaí fisiciúla nó in imlínte na tíre &mdash; a chinntiú.  It will be for the archaeologists to continue their work of interpretation to illuminate the past, to find out what really happened, how, when and if possible why and what lessons were learned from it.</P>
    <P>We have, in this Bill, taken a lead which, I have no doubt, will be an example for legislators throughout the world.  We have put into legislative form a clear unequivocal statutory right to our heritage and clear provisions for action <Col N="1349" /> against those who would seek to diminish it.  Most important of all we will have gone a considerable distance towards fulfilling our duty as custodians of something which is far larger than the concerns of any one generation and provides a continuing option for peering into the lives of our ancestors.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille don Teach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Higgins, for his kind remarks. In my tenure as spokesperson on Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht I assure him of my co-operation.  The record of the Oireachtas, particularly the contributions of the Minister in his capacity as Opposition spokesperson in this area, is extremely informative.  I will be using that information extensively to advocate directions the Minister should take in his position of authority to influence policy on arts, culture and the Gaeltacht.  I thank the Minister's officials for their co-operation to date and for information which has been forthcoming from them. I look forward to their continued co-operation.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the genesis of this report in 1980.  On 17 February of that year Mr. Michael Webb senior and Mr. Michael Webb junior, with metal detectors and without the permission of the landowner in question, excavated the Derrynaflan board, subsequently valued at £5.5 million.  In 1987 in a Supreme Court decision the Oireachtas was invited to lay statutory claim to ownership of items found which have no known owner. We are now winding up this process in the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill.  Why has it taken almost 14 years to safeguard the State's right of ownership to archaeological artefacts which have no known owner?  While the Bill is an admirable and, in many ways, adequate response to the questions raised as a result of the Derrynaflan find, a period of 14 years is an undue delay and we must consider the facts that led to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all well aware of the demands on parliamentary draftspeople to present legislation.  If the delay is due to lack of resources that matter should be seriously considered and additional resources <Col N="1350" /> made available.  I would not like to think that it reflects the priorities of Government in this area.  If that is so, the delay is well counterbalanced with the appointment of Deputy Higgins as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht as he has a publicly recognised track record in this area.  I hope in other legislation he promised, particularly on proposals to establish the Heritage Council on a statutory footing and to provide for the appointment of autonomous boards for the National Museum and National Library, there will be a greater commitment from the Government.</P>
    <P>Is the presentation of the Bill influenced by an impending court judgement on the finding of the Armada wrecks on Streedagh beach in County Sligo?  Perhaps the Minister will be more forthcoming on the reasons for the delay in the legislation and how he proposes to rectify the existing problems in light of the important legislation he has identified. The undue delay in introducing this legislation is worthy of comment from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states there is no cost to the Exchequer arising out of these proposals and no staffing implications for the Department.  In the Minister's opening remarks, which were incisive and considerate, he stated that for the first time a Government Department has &ldquo;overall responsibility under one administrative structure for co-ordinating policy in respect of all the strands encompassed within the discipline of archaeology ranging from the moment an object is discovered in a field, the conservation and interpretation of the object found, its public exhibition and its integration into the context of history, education and art&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, and his Cabinet colleague with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Dempsey, publicly disagreed on the interpretative centres.  It would be regrettable if they also disagreed on this issue, with the Minister and his Department having no input into <Col N="1351" /> policing the legislation he is passing.  An interesting insight was given, in a more politically acceptable form, to the Minister by one of his colleagues in the Seanad, Senator Ormonde who said:</P>
    <P>When I was doing my research in relation to this area, I had difficulty in so far as we have a couple of Departments not working under the umbrella for the preservation of our national heritage, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works.  One area devises policy and another deals with its implementation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extensive.  It establishes the State's right to ownership of all archaeological objects with no known owner, found after the enactment of the Bill, and provides for the retention by the State of such objects.  The Bill extends the statutory protection and preservation of archaeological objects to include the concept of treasure trove and provides for the payment of rewards to the finders of archaeological objects.  Procedures are also established for the reporting of the finding and initial preservation of archaeological objects and creates offences relating to the possession, sale or acquisition of unreported archaeological objects found since 1930.  There is work to be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>To state that there are no Exchequer costs and no staffing implications for the Department with responsibility for implementing the legislation is a calculated insult by the Minister to his colleague with whom he has had, to say the least, a very strained relationship on the interpretative centres issue.  On the eve of a court decision on that matter when Charlie Bird interviewed the Minister, Deputy Higgins, and the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, there was evidence of a clear division of authority and responsibility in this area.  It is regrettable that that difference of opinion has extended to the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>The teething problems on the establishment of the Department of Arts, Culture <Col N="1352" /> and the Gaeltacht, which is a welcome development, have not been resolved.  The Minister has not been given the wherewithal to implement or supervise the implementation of the very desirable policy objectives he is pursuing. If this problem is not resolved there will be a continuing rift between the two Ministries with the bulk of the responsibility for the preservation and protection of National Monuments.  The additional works which need to be carried out require additional staff.  If these staff are not provided the Minister's statement that there are no costs to the Exchequer and no staffing implications will be a calculated insult to the Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  It is also insulting to the staff in the office to suggest that it is over staffed and over financed and can easily accommodate the additional duties imposed on it by this legislation.  I ask the Minister to address this issue in greater detail in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the other legislative initiatives which will place the Heritage Council on a statutory basis and establish the boards of the National Library and National Museum as autonomous entities.  These are very welcome developments.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say where the proposal to develop Collins Barracks now stands?  In view of the European funding debacle and the loss of significant revenue, is it not the case that certain projects earmarked by the Minister, including Collins Barracks, may not be completed?  Has the Minister got a commitment from his Cabinet colleagues that this fine project will be completed or will an undue burden be imposed on his Department to do so?  It is recognised that moneys spent in the areas of arts and culture give an economic return to the Exchequer.  It would be very undesirable if the Collins Barracks project was one of the fall guys for the Government's bungling in the negotiations for European funding.  This matter will be the acid test of the Minister's clout at the Cabinet table.  I will watch developments in this area with some interest and give the Minister <Col N="1353" /> whatever help I can as spokesperson on Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>The proposed interpretative centres have proved to be an expensive lesson for the Department.  We are the guardians of our heritage for future generations.  We should therefore, err on the side of caution in any new developments.  This issue should not be played out on the political stage with two Ministers flexing their muscles and acting in a Bolshie manner. The only losers in this debate will be those who want to preserve our heritage and culture for future generations.</P>
    <P>The pressure exerted by Government policy in recent years to increase the number of visitors coming to Ireland has led to a significant investment in the development of heritage and interpretative centres.  I am concerned that the budget for these developments is being administered by a Department which is not sympathetic to or adequately informed about these matters and does not have adequately qualified staff. Recently I was involved in putting forward proposals to the Cork-Kerry Tourism Board about the development of a heritage centre in Macroom.  Its response was that all its moneys were being invested in a number of heritage centres in the Kerry area and elsewhere as it believed that the maximum number of tourists could be attracted to these areas. A number of developments in other areas which may be of merit from a cultural, archaeological and heritage point of view have been put on the back burner or ignored.  It is time responsibility for the administration of the budget for the development of heritage centres was transferred from the Department of Tourism and Trade to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht or the Office of Public Works where there is a greater appreciation of what is involved. We need to exploit our heritage and culture so as to help our economy and attract more tourists.  However, this must be done in a sensitive way which does not undermine the cultural value of these attractions.</P>

      <P>We are bombarded in this computer era with telecommunications and many influences which are alien to our cultural heritage.  It is interesting that during the GATT negotiations one of the concessions achieved by the French Government related to the audio-visual industry.  It based its argument on the fact that countries were being over-run by a culture which was not their own &mdash; a 20th century pop culture which is alien, a commercially driven and bland culture which is trying to impose a uniformity on people and which does not take any cognisance of cultural diversity.  We have a unique cultural heritage which needs to be preserved, and the Bill goes a long way in doing this.  Our music, buildings, folklore and archaeology are unique and will continue to develop and grow.  It is important that we know where we have come from if we are to understand where we are and where we are going.</P>
      <P>In this context our educational system, both formal and informal, has a significant role to play in developing an empathy with our cultural heritage. Students and younger children are bombarded by a Coca-Cola pop culture which is bland and uniform and which does not take any cognisance of our heritage.  We tended in the past to develop a sympathy rather than an empathy with our heritage and past.  The Minister is undoubtedly aware of the number of historical societies and local museums which have mushroomed in recent years and which have played a major role in fostering an appreciation of our heritage.  Most of us can recall school tours to Dublin to visit the National Museum.  The Tara Brooch, the Ardagh Chalice and the Book of Kells spark an interest in this area for many students.  The educational system, both formal and informal, can continue to play a significant role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> I have some reservations about section 3 which states:</P>
    <P>Whenever, before or after the coming into operation of this section, any archaeological object becomes the property of the State, the Minister, on the advice of the Director, may waive the ownership of the State to such an object.</P>
    <P>In view of the development nationwide of local museums and historical societies there is some merit in the Minister considering the establishment of a voluntary register in his Department where such objects, if not required by the National Museum, could be made available for display in local museums.  That would not tax the resources of the Office of Public Works or the Minister's Department and would enhance the public's appreciation of our unique cultural heritage.  It would also help to counterbalance the blandness of the culture that has been foisted upon us in the latter part of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about section 11 which deals with the acquisition of national monuments by the Commissioners. The Minister is well aware of the anxiety among landowners who have national monuments located on their farms.  They are liable for the safety of anyone entering their lands who may fall accidentally and suffer injury.  It would have been desirable if the Minister had dealt with the necessary legislation on occupier's liability in advance of this legislation.  There is widespread concern among the farming community in particular about the increased powers being granted to the Office of Public Works compulsorily to acquire rights of way to national monuments.  The Minister is running the risk of eroding the goodwill that has existed over generations among landowners by his failure to remedy the occupier's liability problem and by producing legislation without consulting those directly affected.  We must have some assurances from the Minister that these provisions will not be put in place until such time as the question of occupier's liability has been resolved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> The Government has dragged its feet on this issue.  Last year, my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, introduced a Bill that would have resolved this problem but because it was introduced by the Opposition the Government hid behind the Law Reform Commission and refused to accept it.  If the Minister proceeds with this section in advance of dealing with the question of occupier's liability he will face many difficulties.  Last year in a number of scenic amenities along our coastline &mdash; in particular the Slea Head area of Kerry &mdash; signs were erected indicating that visitors were not welcome because of the Government's failure to remedy this problem.  If it is not resolved, we will undermine our tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I have reservations also about section 7 (1) (b) which deals with the confiscation by the Garda of diving equipment. Because of inadequate resources, particularly for the Garda Sub-Aqua Club, there is a dependence on volunteer divers to recover bodies.  No person has ever been prosecuted for spoiling an area of underwater archaeological interest. These are draconian powers, particularly section 7 (1) (b) which refers to &ldquo;any diving equipment which he reasonably believes is about to be used&rdquo;.  There is no provision in the legislation for the return of equipment which may be confiscated. These matters require greater scrutiny and I would like to know why the Minister did not consider trawling, which has the potential for far greater damage to underwater wrecks.  This section of the Bill is poorly thought out and is draconian in its targeting of a particular area.  The Office of Public Works has on many occasions relied on the expertise of the Irish Underwater Council to assist it with underwater archaeological investigations including the initial investigations of the site for the heritage centre in the Boyne Valley.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is in many ways an adequate response.  I have some reservations about it which we can tease out in a constructive way on Committee Stage to the satisfaction of all concerned and for the benefit of future generations for whom we are empowered to preserve <Col N="1357" /> and protect our archaeological and cultural heritage.</P>

      <P>The Minister welcomed Deputy Creed as spokesperson for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I wish to be associated with those remarks as I am particularly pleased to have a Cork Deputy with me dealing with these matters. I hope among the many benefits that will accrue from this appointment will be a better balance between funding made available for arts and culture infrastructure in the capital and in the provinces. I wish Deputy Creed well and congratulate him on his speech.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and commend the Minister on bringing it forward so quickly.  I pledge the full support of my party for the overall thrust of the Bill. We will, however, put down a number of key amendments on Committee Stage.  I welcome also the Minister's promises on other related matters, for example, his intention to bring forward shortly legislative proposals to put the Heritage Council on a statutory footing.  That is necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated he has a Bill in advanced stage of preparation to establish the National Museum as an autonomous entity with the objective of affording it as much freedom as possible to develop its role as an integral part of the national culture.  That is a sensible measure well overdue.  He indicated also his intention to establish an interim board to advise on the future direction of the National Museum.  These measures taken in tandem will effect an enormous improvement in the key area of our national culture.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased the Minister is addressing the matter.  I suppose there are times in history when a Minister matches the mood of the times and the mood of the times matches a Minister in a particular portfolio.  That can be said of this Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The climate is ripe for the kind of comprehensive approach to our heritage which the Minister outlined this morning. We are lucky to have a fully fledged Department with specific responsibility <Col N="1358" /> for art, culture and the Gaeltacht, for the first time since independence.  We are equally lucky to have a committed Minister in charge of that Department.</P>
    <P>There has been a sea change in the manner in which modern Ireland views itself, in which its people seek to define themselves in the last decade of the 20th century.  This generation has turned its back on those who seek to define Irishness in terms of the long struggle with perfidious Albion; it is meaningless to young people of this generation. Equally, Irish people have turned their backs on those who would seek to reduce Irishness to a series of barren slogans and shibboleths.  That is also a fact to which we must give recognition and having done so it is then important that a broader, deeper and more creative concept of our Irishness is advanced, cultivated and developed.  It is equally important, for our spiritual nourishment to draw on the rich reservoir of ancient art and artefact and to aim to present this rich, dramatic heritage not alone to ourselves and our children but to an appreciative audience of discerning tourists. That is part of the spirit I know is behind the formulation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Before going into its text I want to pay tribute to the many local historical and archaeological societies who, with little assistance from the State, have kept alive an appreciation of the importance of ancient monuments and other heritage items under discussion.  I pay particular tribute to the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, which is 105 years old this year, for the sterling work of its members over the long term of its existence.  In this tribute I include bodies like An Taisce for its practical work in its relentless efforts to keep intact items such as those we are discussing today, to preserve and pass on to the next generation items of priceless value.  They have done that on many occasions with very little support, sometimes against great odds.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated the steps he intends to take in relation to the exhibition of items of our national heritage. I acknowledge the funding already provided by his Department for the long <Col N="1359" /> overdue development of the National Museum, which should be the flagship, the major shop window, for our priceless collection of heritage items.  I commend that investment.  However, investments in the National Museum should not be to the exclusion of long overdue investment in regional and local museums; both must keep pace with and run in tandem.  I warn the Minister that investment in local museums must keep pace with the level of investment he has very wisely made in our National Museum.  We must never underestimate the key importance of the local museum as a focus for local pride, local interest and local tourist activity, as an influence, a force within the community which, by exercising public opinion, will render the aims and objectives of this Bill possible.</P>
    <P>I make a strong plea for proper infrastructural funding for the Cork Public Museum which will celebrate its 50th birthday next year.  It houses an excellent collection of objects and artefacts adjudged by experts to be the finest anywhere outside the National Museum. However, more than 50 per cent of its collection cannot be put on display because of lack of proper space and display furniture.  For ten years the curator and trustees of this museum have sought funds to put in place a proper extension and undertake a refurbishment of the building.  Their application was submitted to Cork Corporation but, through lack of funding, perhaps lack of will or even lack of proper priorities, the money was never made available.  An application has been made for European Union funding of £1.3 million to enable major extension and refurbishment of the Cork Public Museum.  I strongly appeal to the Minister to take an interest in this application, to use all his influence to advance it, to ensure that this money, which is long overdue, will be forthcoming in the disbursement of EU funds. The museum in question plays a key role not alone in Cork city but in the overall Munster region, 50 per cent of its annual visitors are overseas tourists.  Under the expert stewardship of its recently <Col N="1360" /> appointed young woman curator, Stella Cherry, the museum is now poised to grow and respond to the growing wave of interest, local, national and overseas. However, the investment of which I speak is essential if that potential is to be realised, if the public museum is to attain the standard in terms of display space and modern technology, that pertains in newer developments such as the Queenstown heritage development in Cobh, the Cork Women's Jail in Sunday's Well in Cork city and the other new museum at Bessborough.  We must not lose sight of that standard.  The centres I have mentioned in the Cork region are all functioning extremely well, based on the principles of traditional museums with modern technology.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do not lose sight of our well established museums when we make money available for these new fangled and trendy interpretative centres. I will not re-enter the battle of interpretative centres as enough has been said.  However, it is fundamentally important that established museums, such as the one to which I referred, would not be starved of funds in our headlong rush to build interpretative centres here, there and everywhere.  The established museums are tried and trusted institutions. They are responding well to the needs of young people, to the needs of education and to the overall needs in their region.  Their need for funding, development and modernisation must not be overlooked.  Any parallel development with interpretative centres ought not take from the fundamental need to ensure that funding is provided for local and regional museums.  We depend on them to preserve our heritage.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, is present I wish to make a related point about public libraries.  Public museums and public libraries are the mainstay of culture at local level. Recently I detected, and not without reason, a fall off in funding for public libraries while at the same time there has been a tremendous development of local <Col N="1361" /> art centres.  That is positive and is something of which I approve but not to the neglect of our public libraries.  In our headlong rush to modernise let us not lose sight of our public libraries and museums.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for proper funding for the Cork public museum, the application for which has been approved. He should ensure that in the divide-up the requisite £1.3 million is made available.</P>
    <P>Ireland, unlike other countries particularly the Scandinavian countries, has been slow to develop this type of legislation. I suspect that the strong emphasis placed on private property in our Constitution has been an inhibiting factor. Whatever the reason a great deal of priceless objects have been pillaged, plundered and taken out of this country.  I hope this Bill will arrest that.  This Bill is a direct response to the <i>Webb v. Ireland</i> case.  That decision challenged us to give a statutory basis to that judgement i.e. the rights and obligations of the State in relation to objects of archaeological interest and national importance which are discovered with no known owner.</P>
    <P>The principle of State ownership of archaeological and similar objects is correct. The State has both the right and the duty to preserve all that is good and worthwhile in our national heritage and to hold it in trust to be passed on to successive generations of Irish women and men.  What we speak of is not the private preserve of any person or any privileged group, it is the birthright of every Irish person.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives extra responsibilities to the Director of the National Museum. That is the correct way to proceed.  If the aims and objectives of the Bill are to be fully met, additional staff and resources will have to be provided to enable the director to carry out his work.  That point was made very cogently by Deputy Creed.  Law, without the wherewithal to enforce it, is of little benefit to anybody and makes a mockery of it.  This legislation outlines specific duties for the Director of the National Museum.  He will not be able to carry out these duties <Col N="1362" /> unless he is given additional staff.  At present the Director of the National Museum is grossly overworked.  He has items in the ownership of the museum which he has neither the time to catalogue nor the space to display them.  A plan is in place to rectify the space problem but he must also be given the additional personnel.</P>
    <P>The Bill defines the right of the State to claim objects which have no known owner, without any corresponding obligation to pay compensation.  That is in accordance with the Supreme Court judgment in the <i>Webb v Ireland</i> case.  The Bill makes provision for the payment of a reward for people who come forward, having discovered an object and present it for recording and adding to the national stock.  At first I wondered why anybody should be rewarded for doing what is their duty as good citizens.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is important that there be an incentive to encourage people who make these finds to present the objects to the State.  I do not take issue with the principle of rewarding those who present archaeological items to the State.</P>
    <P>It is important that this provision is not used by unscrupulous cowboys to convert public property into private gain.  Clear criteria should be set out as to when a reward will be made and the amount of such reward.  We do not want scarce resources, which are needed to implement the provisions of this Bill, drained away in rewards to people who for one reason or another, through luck or otherwise, discover items of archaeological or historical interest.  It is important that discretion be exercised.  The best way of ensuring that greed will not take a grip is to strengthen local historicial societies and local museums, that it will be seen to be good citizenship to hand such items up and that those who go for the kill will be frowned upon in their communities.  The reward system should not be used to feather anybody's nest.</P>
    <P>The issue of compensation is referred to in paragraph 5 (1) of the Schedule. People are to be compensated for the acquisition of land, easement, title or interest.  This is important and it is fundamental <Col N="1363" /> that provision be made for it. People who find objects will be rewarded with a cash payment.  However, the director of the museum my enter land to safeguard or remove an object and if in the act of entering the land, property is damaged the Bill does not provide for compensation to be paid to the owner for the damage caused.  That is a key flaw in the Bill and one which I will seek to amend on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I accept that landowners are compensated where land is vested or acquired.  There are and will be cases where there is no need to acquire land. In a submission made in the context of this Bill An Taisce is clear in stating that its members do not consider it necessary or desirable to allow the compulsory acquisition of land to provide facilities for visitors other than a pathway or related works such as levelling a pathway to facilitate access by disabled visitors.  I fully support that and ask the Minister to take it on board.  It is important that proper provision be made in law to compensate landowners for damage caused by the director or somebody nominated on his behalf in the act of entering land to carry out work.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis cogently argued this point in the Seanad, giving graphic examples to support his argument.  As a result, the Minister of State undertook to rectify the matter and stated &mdash; Column 818, Volume 139 of the Official Report&mdash;&ldquo;As regards the Director of the National Museum, I will put down an amendment on Report Stage which will allay Senator Dardis's fears&rdquo;.  He did not do that.  I am giving notice that I will put down an identical amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed referred to section 7.  I have grave reservations about this.  I am concerned about the impact it will have on the 1,800 voluntary divers.  It is well known that diving and subaqua clubs provide a valuable service.  They provide a support service for the Garda and for the Director of the National Museum.  If this section is not amended it will alienate diving clubs and put them out of business. <Col N="1364" /> As framed, it is draconian and must be amended or deleted.  I fail to understand why divers are mentioned specifically while there is no reference to other groups engaged in underwater activities.</P>
    <P>In the case of the wreck of the <i>Lusitania</i> and the <i>Titanic</i> artefacts were plundered by people engaged in underwater salvage in contravention of the 1987 law. That should be recognised.  There is no record of any damage caused to our archaeological riches by a member of any diving club.  I will seek to amend this section and ask the Minister to see if &ldquo;diver&rdquo; could not be deleted or if what is intended could not be better achieved by broadening the definition to include all kinds of underwater salvage persons in addition to divers.  I will not support this section as currently framed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill and look forward to the Minister putting in place legislation which will take on board my two key considerations &mdash; compensation for landowners for damage caused on entering their land and my opposition to section 7 which gives draconian, unwarranted and unjustified powers to the Garda, powers which cannot be supported by thinking members.</P>
    <P>We do not have a good record of maintaining national monuments.  I say this without blaming anyone but ourselves because we failed to provide the necessary facilities and finance to enable them to be maintained properly.  There is little point in putting this legislation in place unless we make proper financial provision for the maintenance and development of national monuments.  When we give leadership in that respect we will get the necessary co-operation from the public to make this Bill work.</P>

      <P>We welcome the Bill and recognise the importance of protecting our heritage which has a deep significance for Irish people.  It has taken considerable time to introduce the Bill but it is welcome.  There have been serious incidents, including theft, which have caused considerable public concern and put into sharp focus the need for proper conservation and protection of our heritage.</P>
      <P>Apart from the illegal damage and theft, not all the efforts made by the State over the years to protect our heritage have been fully successful.  As someone who fought tenaciously against the location of the Lugalla Interpretative Centre in County Wicklow I understand there may well be genuine commitment by officialdom towards preserving both our natural and built environment but that does not always mean that it is being done well or in a way that does justice to our past.  Sometimes it was done badly and our understanding of the past was diminished rather than enhanced by it.  It has been said that only by learning from our past can we make sense of our future, but the past is often distorted through a prism of wishful thinking, of nostalgia, of official thought policing, of sheer ignorance, or by sanitisation, and it is that last phenomenon that characterises the approach of the Office of Public Works to interpretative centres.  This is of particular concern to me.  I understand that in Strokestown there is a different approach to the creation of an interpretative centre, in this case a centre dealing with the Famine.  I have not seen it, but having read reports of the method used by the initiator of the project it seems to be a far more appropriate way to interpret our past.  It presents the evidence of different viewpoints &mdash; indeed sometimes conflicting viewpoints &mdash; in a way that respects the modern person's intelligence and leaves the questions open for deliberation and judgment by individual observers.  Through a babble of voices and not through one, inevitably restricted or even moribund view, do we gain a better insight into our past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that many of our <Col N="1366" /> national monuments are scattered around the countryside and therefore open to vandalism.  The principle of severe penalties and proper marshalling and control is very important as is the clear statement of ownership by the State and obligations of the private individual. G. K. Chesterton once said:</P>
    <P>...the modern world seems to have no notion of preserving different things side by side, of allowing its proper and proportionate, place to each, of saving the whole varied heritage of culture.  It has no notion except that of simplifying something by destroying nearly everything.</P>
    <P>That motto could be adopted by the Office of Public Works in relation to interpretative centres.  However, Chesterton was writing in a different time and to be fair to today's conservationists and the Office of Public Works, there is a growing understanding and spreading consciousness of the importance of the variation of her heritage.  One has only to look at small museums and heritage centres around the country to know that for many people there is a fundamental need to be in touch with the past and to be able to enjoy the heritage expressed in stone, brick, in written form or in any other medium.</P>
    <P>William Morris once said that history records what man has destroyed but art records what man has created.  Whether it is the art of the early prehistoric period, that we are so rich in or recent Victorian art and architecture, we carry a responsibility to protect and preserve what is worthwhile.  I welcome the fact that this Bill is setting out to provide this protection.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate what is needed.  It is worth noting that the explanatory and financial memorandum states there are no staffing implications and no cost to the Exchequer arising from this Bill.  I find this hard to believe because of the implications in the Bill for acquisitions by the State.  If there are no cost or staff implications, one would wonder about the effectiveness of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> There are major cost implications in the acquisition of monuments and sites and certainly the knock-on effect of ensuring the protection of our heritage sites is that the State must acquire a site to ensure its protection.  I can cite an example in my own constituency.  Until recently St. Crispin's Cell was not registered by the Office of Public Works. However Professor F. X. Martin says that the most recent discoveries at Rathdown confirm it to be a major medieval site of national and international importance. This treasure is an important part of our national heritage and requires careful nurturing and development.  Mr. Leo Swan, a senior archaeologist says that it is inconceivable that any development or change in land usage should be contemplated, much less permitted here, which might endanger or impinge upon the surviving earthworks, structures or other features of this uniquely historic landscape.  It is now registered by the Office of Public Works but that has not saved the site.  Incredibly, a local developer owns the site and had planning permission for a housing estate on it.  The only reason it has not been developed for this purpose is that there is a corps of vigilant people &mdash; whom I would describe as local heroes &mdash; who have dedicated their lives to ensure that this major site of international and national importance is protected and conserved.  They went to the bother of producing a book on St. Crispin's Cell and ancient Rathdown. These people have to see that a Bill such as this has meaning at local level.  Inevitably that has cost implications.  A site such as the site at St. Crispin's Cell, Rathdown, will have to be acquired by the State in some shape or form to ensure its future.</P>
    <P>Everybody involved at local level in local history will have had experience at some stage, perhaps not as dramatic as that in Rathdown, of trying to preserve a monument which may not be designated as such by the Office of Public Works but which is nevertheless a building of significance under threat.  It is often necessary to acquire the building or site <Col N="1368" /> and there is no source of readily available income for this purpose.  The local authorities are overstretched providing for essential services and in normal circumstances are unable to undertake such a project.  Private funding is very limited, sadly so, as there is a role for such funding. The Heritage Council which will have statutory footing, does not have major resources.  The European Union has a fund for this purpose but it is thinly spread across Europe which has a considerable wealth of archaeological and historical remains that require conservation.</P>
    <P>According to the regional development manager of Bord Fáilte at least £200 million will have to be spent during the nineties to upgrade Ireland's heritage attractions to a standard at which they can be marketed internationally.  There is a very clear link between the protection of our heritage, our history and the development of tourism.  People come to Ireland because they associate it with a history, with a wealth of artistic excellence, and not because we provide the usual attractions of mass tourism which are largely dependent on sunshine.</P>
    <P>A fundamental question about Government policy and the Office of Public Works in particular, is why the bulk of resources should be spent on interpretative centres which concentrate finance into very specific types of provision and which increasingly have lost the confidence of people generally and environmentalists in particular.  They are, to say the least, suspect and out of date in view of the modern approach to interpreting our landscape and history at an international level.</P>
    <P>In County Wicklow the way forward favoured by the local people and environmentalists which would directly benefit County Wicklow, is the provision of small scale visitor centres appropriate to local needs and which express the resources of local communities.  Instead we have a white elephant at the top of a mountain. Admittedly, it is slightly smaller, though not much different, than what was proposed originally.</P>
    <P>The question of landowners' liability <Col N="1369" /> has been raised by other Deputies.  The failure of successive Governments to tackle this problem has diminished and impoverished many aspects of Irish life. It certainly relates to the question of preserving heritage but it comes down to the fundamental question of whether we will have playgrounds for our children.  The matter has to be dealt with.  I understand the Law Reform Commission has made recommendations but we have still not seen the response from the Government which will allow this problem to be faced once and for all.  This matter is a source of concern for landowners as they are liable to claims by people who may injure themselves, through no fault of the landowner, while crossing their land.  It adds to their headache if a national monument is located on their property.</P>
    <P>Brusselstown Fort in west Wicklow is a major prehistoric settlement site. Because of the fears of landowners, people could not gain access to this site last summer.  Signs stating &ldquo;keep out&rdquo; and &ldquo;no trespassing&rdquo; had been erected. I do not blame the landowners for this; unless the issue of public liability is tackled and a realistic view adopted this important resource, located in a deprived part of Wicklow where there are few employment opportunities, will not be developed to maximise its tourism potential.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to ensure that people take responsibility for their actions.  As we are aware, Ireland is inclined to be a litigious country.  This is not of benefit to society; individuals benefit, particularly if they are awarded large sums.  Private landowners are not the only people affected, in the past the Forestry Division has been subject to large claims while any national body or local authority could find themselves sued for large amounts of money.  This matter is out of control.</P>
    <P>The preservation of Edward Carson's birthplace in Dublin has been surrounded by controversy.  We should take the opportunity to reinforce the point that there are two traditions on this island. The history of Northern Ireland is intertwined with the history of the South and <Col N="1370" /> the tradition of the majority there has as much right as the Catholic tradition to be celebrated and recorded.  Private landowners have a responsibility to preserve buildings of historical importance.  It is a privilege to own such a building.  I am fortunate to live in a house of historical significance; it was the home of James Joyce.  Having received many visitors I realise the importance a single family home can have in recording the history of a society.  At times we tend to underestimate the extraordinary knowledge foreigners possess of our past but this is not always mirrored at home by policy makers in ensuring that the complexities and variations are reflected in what is preserved.  I cite the house of Edward Carson as a good example of where we will lose out if we fail to appreciate the complexities.  Our island is too small to fragment our history into categories where one tradition is somehow more important than the other.</P>
    <P>The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal project is nearing completion.  This project shows that there can be cross-Border development without injuring political sensibilities or convictions to enrich communities on both sides of the Border. Engineering works have not been celebrated in the same way as literary, historical or archaeological works.  In the last century William Dargan transformed the town of Bray where I live.  There is a statute of him outside the National Gallery but as a major figure in modernising Ireland he has been forgotten.  However, a bridge was named after him in Belfast recently.  The transport museum in Belfast has also paid homage to him as a major innovator both in rail transport and the development of canals and the construction of industrial buildings.  We would do well to remember that our heritage includes not just architecture and the works of painters and writers but also engineers, scientists, builders and fabricators who have shaped the architectural fabric of our towns, villages and cities.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by groups such as the Irish Underwater Council and even by those who own metal detectors <Col N="1371" /> although the restrictions were provided for in the original Bill.  We need to strike a balance and the best approach would be to work with these groups in protecting our heritage.  I am aware that sports divers have assisted the Office of Public Works and the National Museum in underwater archaeology.  This activity will be illegal under the Bill despite the fact that no sports diver has ever been charged for infringing the provisions of the original National Monuments Act. Underwater divers are responsible people; they have to be as their sport is not for the reckless.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that we now have a Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht which has responsibility to bring the many disparate strands together.  They were fragmented in the past.  However, there is still a question mark over the Office of Public Works.  It is very difficult to serve two masters and because two Ministers are involved inevitably there is ambiguity and uncertainty. I refer in particular to the development of the national park in County Wicklow.  Its establishment was announced some time ago by the previous Taoiseach and because it is not fully owned by the State it is unique.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht determines policy for the Office of Public Works and its implementation is overseen by the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
    <P>Proposals concerning the management of this new national park are being considered. Such a proposition has never been considered before.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Higgins, would adopt an imaginative approach to the management of this national park.  I do not want to put words in his mouth but, on his record, it is clear he would see the benefits to be gained in including local people in a partnership.  However, as in other parks, the Office of Public Works intends to exercise tight control.  While there will be a consultative committee on which local interest groups, environmentalists, famers, local authorities and public representatives will be represented <Col N="1372" /> the Office of Public Works will call the shots.  This is not in keeping with the imaginative approach the Minister would adopt; it is more in line with the traditional thinking of the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>What policy will be adopted?  Will local people, who will be affected by decisions made by the Office of Public Works, have a voice?  Unkind things have been said about the Office of Public Works and while I do not agree with everything that has been said &mdash; because in many ways the Office of Public Works has done some tremendous work &mdash; democracy is not one of its strong points.  It has been described as the last bastion of Stalinism in Europe.  That is a bit harsh but it has not been accountable or as open as one would expect.  I may be straying somewhat from the point but it is an important fundamental principle that people should have an input to decisions made about their destiny, their community, their landscape, their heritage.  Their input must be meaningful, not merely cosmetic, and dealt with in a way that will not ultimately disappoint.  In the case of St. Crispin's Cell there has been an enormous contribution to the State through the efforts of local people to highlight the fact that even in what is essentially a suburban area in the greater Dublin Metropolitan area there is a wealth of international heritage lying literally under the ground that deserves our protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta de Valera. This Bill is welcome in that it modifies and modernises the Principal Act of 1930 and the Act of 1987.  I am taken by the Minister's wish to strike a reasonable balance between the common good and the rights of the individual within the parameters of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal effect of the Bill is to establish State ownership of archaeology objects with no known owner.  It is interesting, and not commonly known, that title deeds of land and land registration exclude mineral rights.  The Bill also includes a right to waive the State's <Col N="1373" /> right of ownership and provides a certain flexibility to be exercised with common sense.  There is a need for flexibility in the general approach of State bodies to local matters.</P>
    <P>Section 4, which is probably the principal section, makes it an offence to sell, offer for sale, exchange or dispose of property as outlined and applies to property found after the enactment of the Principal Act of 1930.  I suspect there could be some difficulty in establishing when exactly certain objects were found and what constitutes their being found. There are hundreds, perhaps even more small stone crosses, síle-na-gigs and other stone ornaments whose locations and dimensions have not been formally recorded and logged in any register. Many of them have disappeared.  In some cases they have been taken out of the country.  Perhaps some provision could be made to repatriate them on relocating them.</P>
    <P>The use of metal detectors and other machines of this nature had already been outlawed but is referred to further in this Bill.  One of the effects of using these devices is to make excavation and archaeological assessment very difficult.  I am particularly pleased that the prohibition on such devices is reinforced in the Bill, but I have reservations about the inclusion of diving equipment in the fairly general manner that could be construed from the Bill.  Perhaps bona fide diving clubs and search and rescue services might be excluded.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for a reward for the finders of archaeological objects.  It might be prudent to make specific exclusions in that regard.  I am aware that a reward differs somewhat from a specific payment, but the finder might be a trespasser or a person who has not complied with the other requirements of the Bill.  For example, he might have used a metal detector.  There are substantial penalties for using metal detectors and it might be desirable to exclude such people from getting a reward.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision for payment to the owner and the occupier of a property, I would have thought that either <Col N="1374" /> one or the other would have been more appropriate.  I worry that the provision relating to the payment of a reward might place an undue obligation on the director acting for the State.  That must be balanced against the enticement it is to the finder to report the finding of the object. However, it might militate against the less valuable finds being reported because they might not be the subject of a reward.  It might be advisable to look to stricter criteria in relation to the bona fides of a finder.</P>
    <P>Section 11 which provides for the right to acquire national monuments by agreement or compulsorily is long overdue.  I represent a constituency which has a very large number of stone forts and wedge tombs and other sites of archaeological interest and I, therefore, have a particular interest in the Bill.  The O'Davren Law School at Cahermacnaughdeen near Ballyvaughan is no longer accessible to the public.  Where this happens the local person takes such action as a last resort, having suffered and having been maligned for a number of years.  Although it may not be specifically provided for in the Bill, there is an onus on the Office of Public Works to meet the people concerned and attempt to strike a balance which protects the right of public access to a monument and the right of the people who own it or live beside it to enjoy reasonable comfort, without the worry that nowadays goes with ownership of rights of way and sites of national monuments.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (1) (e) would occasion considerable worry in my constituency particularly if it extends, as some people think, to conferring rights of public access and providing rights of way for members of the public where such have not previously existed.  A number of controversies have brought this home strongly to us in County Clare.  Only this week Clare County Council extinguished a right of way to the Cliffs of Moher because of difficulties in the proper control and management of the area specifically relating to casual trading.  Some of those concerns are addressed in the Casual Trading Bill currently before the <Col N="1375" /> House.  However, the issue of rights of way tends to become very emotive and there are implications for landowners.  In the Burren generally there is a proliferation of &ldquo;no trespassing&rdquo; signs along the main tourist routes arising partly from the difficulty of public liability and, more specifically, from the controversy about the visitors centre.  There is a similar problem with the centre proposed in Wicklow and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar with the difficulties that can arise.</P>
    <P>Tourism is hugely important, particularly in rural Ireland, and a campaign that gives the impression that the country is unwelcoming is detrimental and must be addressed quickly.  There are two areas of difficulty in my constituency, one relating to controversy about the interpretative centre at Mullaghmore and the other to the general principle of occupier's liability.  This has been raised in the House many times, not least by my colleague, Deputy de Valera, and I too support the campaign to ensure that legislation is introduced as quickly as possible to deal with this major difficulty.</P>
    <P>Section 12 which provides for a record of monuments and places of interest, including a map which will be made publicly available, is most welcome.  I would like to see some provision in this section for logging all those places which previously had little stone crosses and other items of interest which have gone elsewhere, frequently not too far, and which are sometimes in the possession of people who have a particular interest in archaeological matters.  Ultimately, the provisions of this Bill should extend to giving the Director of the National Museum the power to locate and map the location of such items and list them.  Of course, it is questionable whether some of them disappeared before the 1930 Act was enacted.</P>
    <P>Where access to a monument site by the Director of the National Museum, the Commissioners for Public Works or the general public is established it is important that the landowner is protected, but the necessary legislation may <Col N="1376" /> be difficult to implement.  It might be possible to provide an insurance scheme to cover the relatively small number of locations arising under this legislation to enable landowners to allow access to such sites without concern.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the general provisions of the Bill and I hope it will be possible to introduce measures to overcome the minor difficulties I outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which will give recognition to the importance of our heritage by emphasising the need to catalogue national monuments and underlining the State's responsibility to preserve, maintain, store, protect and display our rich heritage.  As the Minister stated, the Bill gives important statutory expression to the rights of the people, to the physical representation of our culture and heritage in regard to archaeological objects, monuments or sites of archaeological interest.</P>
      <P>The National Monuments Bill, 1930, although updated in 1954 and again in 1987, is no longer adequate to deal with present day realities.  Webb <i>v.</i> Ireland and its landmark judgment highlighted the need for immediate legislative change.  This legislation refers to the relationship between treasure trove and the reward to persons reporting the findings of archaeological objects.  I am pleased to note that in regard to a reward the Minister in the Seanad was at pains to make a distinction between the reward showing due recognition to the responsibility of the citizen and the possible commercial value of the find.  There is no question of the reward being used as a negotiation ploy by the finder with a view to selling to the highest bidder.  Such artefacts or finds are property of the people and there can be no question of paying what could be termed a ransom for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kernel of this Bill is designed to ensure that all items found after the enactment of the Bill, where there is no known owner, must be reported and deemed the property of the State.  The Bill also acknowledges the need for early investigation by the proper authorities of <Col N="1377" /> the physical content in which such objects are found.  The legislation raises our consciousness to the beauty and importance of our national heritage with which we are entrusted for future generations.  One of the proposals put forward in Chief Justice Finlay's judgment was the concept of treasure trove.  The possession, sale and acquisition of archaeological objects found after the enactment of the Bill is prohibited unless the State has waived its rights to ownership.  Heavy penalties will be imposed under this Bill if those restrictions are breached and I am sure every Member of the House will support that.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate further comment from the Minister on section 7 with regard to the seizure and forfeiture of unauthorised detection devices and diving equipment found at the site of a national monument or a site protected by an underwater heritage order.  Like many other Members of this House, I have received correspondence from the Irish Underwater Council in which, in referring to this legislation, it states:</P>
    <P>It is unusual and specifically antidiver to seize equipment prior to an activity in the belief that an illegal act may take place.  We believe that apart from drug related and terrorist offences there is no similar provision in the Irish criminal legal code.</P>
    <P>Similar reservations have been voiced by many Members of this House and I would like to hear the Minister's comments, particularly in regard to section 7.</P>
    <P>The second purpose of this legislation is to amend certain provisions of the National Monuments Acts of 1930 and 1987 by extending the protection given to monuments and historic sites under them.  Legislation under the 1930 Act protects not only a national monument but also some lands around it.  It refers to the monument, the site of the monument, the means of access and such portion of land adjoining the site as may be required to fence, cover or otherwise preserve the amenity.  Where a monument is on private property I understand it is the policy of the Office of Public Works to <Col N="1378" /> come to an amicable agreement with the landowner about the maintenance of the site.  There is no doubt the Office of Public Works will be aware of the sensitivities of the landowner in that regard. While we all accept that national monuments belong to the nation, we must also realise that the land surrounding them may have been in the landowner's family for many generations.</P>
    <P>I note that section 11 of the Bill refers to compulsory purchase which is to be used only as a last resort.  Section 11 also deals with the acquisition of land by agreement with the landowner.  I am sure the Minister is aware there was a great deal of genuine concern among landowners in north Clare last summer with regard to access to national monuments on their lands and their position in law <i>vis-à-vis</i> occupier's liability.  Some of the well known sites in north Clare were closed to the public as the landowners felt they could not leave themselves open to the compensation culture which, unfortunately, pervades society.  I have been told that the Office of Public Works intends to buy lands to resolve the problem of access, but a great deal of compensation would be required to do that. From where will the money come for compensation and how realistic in the short term is such a proposal?  It shows the need for the introduction of immediate legislation on occupier's liability.  I do not apologise for taking this opportunity to raise this matter again and I appreciate the kind words of my colleague, Deputy Killeen, about my interest in the matter. This issue is under review.  Will the Minister discuss with his colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, the necessity to introduce immediate legislation on occupier's liability?</P>
    <P>In the meantime, with the approaching tourist season, will the Minister, under this legislation, compensate by way of public liability insurance the landowner in question whose land is being crossed by people visiting the national monument? In the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, acknowledged that public liability is a problem in regard to people visiting monuments.  I understand <Col N="1379" /> that if the State acquires land in the vicinity of a monument to ensure access the State is then liable for public liability. There is still the problem of occupier's liability for the landowner whose land surrounds the monuments as there is no guarantee that some members of the public will not take short cuts across the land to gain access to the national monument. I am sure the Minister will appreciate the great difficulty facing farmers and landowners in that regard.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 21 March, 1994 is headed: &ldquo;Minister in bid to limit injury claims&rdquo; and states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Commerce and Technology, Mr. Seamus Brennan, has established an Insurance Reform Unit within his Department to examine ways of reducing huge personal injury claims.</P>
    <P>That would alleviate the fears that many of our leading tourist attractions could be forced to close because of high public liability awards.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's comments on that issue.</P>
    <P>I commend section 12 which provides for the compilation by the Commissioners of Public Works of a list of all monuments and places where they consider monuments are located.  Much work has been carried out by the Office of Public Works on the compilation of survey maps structured on a county by county basis.  Those SMRs are an invaluable tool of our educators.  I understand 150,000 monuments have been recorded and that section 12 will guard against the destruction of those important sites.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to underline and acknowledge the wonderful work being carried our under the discovery programme. I spent an interesting day last August with people working on that programme in Maughan Fort, an area with which I am sure the Minister is familiar. It is good that those archaeologists are able to share their expertise with us and provide us with an insight into our nation's distant past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> I wish to draw to the Minister's attention some practical difficulties encountered by local community groups who wish to clean up graveyards of historical interest.  It has been brought to my attention that with the best will in the world long delays can occur waiting for expert advice and the overlapping of responsibility of some State agencies in that matter can occur particularly with regard to the implementation of schemes to carry out work on graveyards.  Like other speakers, I agree with the concept of regionalisation.  I would like to see further opportunties in areas outside Dublin &mdash; naturally, I plug unashamedly for my constituency &mdash; where space could be made available, means of preservation provided and insurance costs covered for items of interest to be displayed to the public.  That would enhance an appreciation of our heritage and assist educators to give our young people an understanding of our heritage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this enlightened legislation.  I am aware of his personal knowledge and appreciation of such issues.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  Since this country gained independence little attention has been paid to introducing legislation to deal with the preservation and protection of our past. While I congratulate the Minister on introducing badly needed legislation I must point out that much has been omitted from the Bill.  Deputies should devote some time to commenting on what is omitted from it.  On the National Museum the Minister stated that legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation to establish the National Museum as an autonomous entity with the objective of affording it as much freedom as possible to develop its role as an integral part of the national culture.  I was delighted to hear that but it is regrettable that the services of the national monuments branch of the Office of Public Works and the National Museum cannot <Col N="1381" /> be co-ordinated to create a single autonomous body.</P>
      <P>The national monuments branch of the Office of Public Works is under the control of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht effectively only has control over the National Museum and finds of historical interest. The Minister should clarify the position. Separate Estimates are listed for both in the Book of Estimates.  There is a special allocation for the maintenance of national monuments and in the Estimate for the Office of Public Works and the Estimate for the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht there is a special subhead for the National Museum.  The National Museum and the national monuments branch of the Office of Public Works are treated as separate entities.  The Minister should in the legislation to grant autonomy to the National Museum link the national monuments branch at present administered by the Office of Public Works.  That would lead to more co-ordinated and complementary action for monument preservation and improvement in the protection of artefacts and finds using the expertise of the national monuments branch of the Office of Public Works and the National Museum under one umbrella.  Both bodies maintain separate archives but those records could be merged.  They should be granted autonomy and innovative administrative structures with the power to act outside the strictures of Civil Service regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I visited Navan Fort outside Armagh on Eamain Macha, one of the country's leading archaeological sites. What has taken place there is extraordinary. A new interpretative centre and access programme was established there in the past few years.  A special board of trustees was appointed to carry out improvements on the construction of the interpretative centre and facilities at Navan Fort.  That body acted autonomously and was able to draw moneys from the EC Structural Funds and from the International Fund for Ireland.  Such a procedure could not be followed in <Col N="1382" /> regard to archaeological sites here.  It would be instructive for the Minister to visit Navan Fort or Eamain Macha and consider the approach to those developments. They are a credit to the people involved.  There was no controversy about the building of that interpretative centre.  The presentation of the history of that site by the use of graphics and audio visual aids and the provision of facilities for visitors such as car parks and refreshments facilites are excellent.</P>
    <P>The National Museum and the national monuments branch of the Office of Public Works should be autonomous and empowered to draw down funds whether from EC Structural Funds or other sources to carry out badly needed improvements.  I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill which clarifies the legal position in respect of ownership of artefacts found at national monument sites or elsewhere. A survey reveals that 150,000 historical-archaeological sites have been mapped. Ten years ago it was claimed that only 80,000 such sites existed.  Since the national monuments branch of the Office of Public Works was established 112 to 113 years ago only 700 monuments have been taken into State care.  I am sure many hundreds of such sites are not under protection.  Those sites have the nominal paper protection under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>In many cases no protection is afforded.  Is restoration work being carried out to those sites?  Many of them have fallen into ruin due to natural climatic conditions.  The largest stone castle in Ireland in Ballintubber, County Roscommon is falling into ruin.  It has 1,000 feet of curtain wall and is the finest example of a medieval-Norman castle here.  No hand has been raised to protect that monument although it is supposed to be under the protection of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>Magnificent work is taking place at Cashel, Clonmacnoise and other sites.  I am involved with a small local community on the restoration of an ancient cemetery close to where I live.  On that site are the remains of a 13th century monastic <Col N="1383" /> settlement, with a very well preserved Dominican tower.  Recently we requested the Office of Public Works to assist us with some of the restoration works.  I commented to one of the officials who visited us that it would probably cost about £10,000 to take the ivy off the tower and to seal the top of the tower to prevent water from seeping down through the building once the protection of the ivy cover was taken away. The reply was that it would cost at least £100,000 to do the work, which is greatly exaggerated.  The obstacle of finance is immediately put forward.  That approach is very often taken to the protection of our national monuments.  Communities should be given the necessary finance and expert advice to carry out simple restoration and protection work that would not need the services of skilled people.  The strictures that exist in this area should be removed.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister has a genuine interest in this matter &mdash; I heard him on many occasions on the Opposition benches in this House and the other House express innovative and refreshing ideas, and I hope he will bring to his Ministry the ideas which he so eloquently expressed then.</P>
    <P>I judge Government policy in terms of what it proposes to spend.  In the current year a sum of £48,138,000 has been allocated to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Under the heading grant-in-aid to the National Museum, the National Library and the National Archive, proposed expenditure in the current year is £455,000, a small sum when compared with the overall budget. Grant-in-aid to cultural institutions and agencies &mdash; I take it the National Museum is included in this category &mdash; amounts to £3,094,000, a substantial figure, but it is a reduction of 42 per cent on the 1993 figure of £5,302,000.</P>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates published the allocation to the Office of Public Works for this year is £180,958,000.  Under the headings relevant to this Bill &mdash; conservation works on national monuments and archaeological sites &mdash; the sum of <Col N="1384" /> money allocated is £1,150,000, a significant increase on the figure for the previous year which was £80,000, but in terms of the overall budget of the Office of Public Works it is quite small.  The sum allocated in the current year for national monuments and historic properties is £17,645,000 a 7 per cent reduction on the £18,978,000 allocated under the same heading in 1993.  The Minister's understanding of these problems and his proposals in this area are not matched by the figures in the Book of Estimates.  The money provided is inadequate.</P>
    <P>I understand that 75 per cent of the artefacts in the National Museum are in storage &mdash; in other words, 25 per cent are on display.  The practice of revolving displays has ended.  Some of the finest artefacts in the museum are on permanent display and I compliment the Director and staff of the National Museum on the way they present them. When I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts a few years ago I had the opportunity to visit the National Museum and was amazed that one major display room which was opened 25 or 30 years ago is now closed and antique furniture is strewn all over the place.  I visited the museum again within the last three months and that area is still not open.  The Minister should ensure that this display area is open to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I do.  The National Museum on Kildare Street, which is a magnificent building, should be used to its optimum.  I visited the basement of that building where there are serried rows of shelving and drawers in which hundreds of thousands of artefacts from Egypt, India and China are stored.  I commented to an assistant that it must be an enormous job to carry out a manual inventory of the stock there and his reply was that there are drawers there which have not been looked into for 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we developed a proper <Col N="1385" /> regional policy for our museums.  For instance, in Wales, which is not an independent country, the amount of money spent on the national heritage is three or four times that spent in Ireland.  A tremendous network of local museums has been developed there.  In towns such as Caernarvon and Pontypridd there are local museums displaying artefacts that are not alone relevant to their areas but to the history of Wales and the island of Great Britain.  There is no reason this could not be done in Ireland.</P>
    <P>County Roscommon will probably be one of the first beneficiaries of the policy of regionalisation.  It is hoped later this year to open in Strokestown House the famime museum, an extension of the National Museum.  Artefacts from the famine period not on display in the National Museum will be put on display in the courtyard and rooms of Strokestown House.  I know this excellent development will be fully supported by the Minister.  This type of development needs to be undertaken in other areas. It is not appropriate that hundreds of thousands of artefacts which are part of the national collection should be stored away for periods as long as a quarter of a century.  That policy is untenable and something will have to be done about it.</P>
    <P>I support the concept of interpretative centres.  There is an appropriate approach to them.  Our archaeological treasure is not built of stone.  The medieval castles and cathedrals in Europe are built of stone and are very well preserved. Visitors can relate very easily to these buildings.  Reference is made to them in story books and Walt Disney used them to great effect in cartoons.  Our archaeological treasure dates back to the middle Stone Age while the great earthworks, many of which are in my county, date back to the Bronze Age.  In Rathcroghan in my constituency there is a vast array of these earthworks.  This is a primitive presentation to onlookers in the sense that they are not easily understood.  For that reason we need interpretative centres on such sites.  However, there must be a proper approach to such centres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> The Minister should appreciate the benefits of interpretative centres.  We need a single national interpretative centre which can instruct people on our unique Celtic archaeology, the earthwork forts.  Such a centre should be located in the area with the greatest collection of these forts, not at Tara or Cashel, where there is a stone fort, but at the other great ancient site of Rathcroghan.  This site, which extends over several square miles, would be the most appropriate location for a national interpretative centre which would instruct visitors on our unique archaeology.</P>

      <P>I welcome this essential Bill which many people may think is not very exciting or exotic.  I also welcome its introduction by a Minister who, long before it became popular or profitable, ploughed a distinctive furrow in our cultural fields.  He served a long apprenticeship in this area through his various cultural pursuits and is coming into his own now as a Minister.  The Bill could not have been introduced by a more enlightened or enthusiastic Minister.  I am delighted he has responsibility for arts and culture and long may he prosper in that office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connor, a neighbour of the Minister's, should wait and see what the Minister will do in this area.  Some of the Deputy's comments about funding were correct, but the Minister does not have a magic wand with which he can conjure up money.  We all know the hullabaloo the Deputy's party kicked up about the measly £5 million the Government is trying to raise through the property tax so as to shift the burden from taxpayers. There is no point in Deputies telling the Minister more money should be spent if they do not tell him where it can be found.</P>

      <P>I an not being censorious but am simply pointing out that there was a flaw in his speech.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the role of the State in this area.  This enlightened, sensitive and vitally necessary extension has my full support.  I also welcome the procedures for the reporting and initial preservation of archaeological objects and artefacts.  Some critics have said that it is not possible to implement the provisions in the Bill without some cost to the Exchequer.  I cannot see any costs, hidden or otherwise, in the Bill, but I suppose everything costs money and I will wait and see what happens.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect of the Bill is that it reasserts the role of the State in the preservation of our history and heritage.  It is important that we have an enlightened attitude not only to the preservation of buildings but also to the other objects referred to in the debate. Many of these objects have been stolen and taken out of the country.  One of the most important private collections in the Limerick city museum, the Dunraven collection which was found mainly in Lough Gur and Adare, County Limerick, was stolen during a transitional period. Some of the items recently turned up in Northern Ireland where, I think, they were being offered for sale on the black market.  I was interviewed by the BBC on the matter.  These items may not be returned to the museum in Limerick because the insurance has been paid on them and a dispute has arisen.  The Dunraven family was so upset after the theft that it withdrew all the other items in the collection from the museum in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many examples of families who have given the public the benefit of their collections.  In this connection, the Hunt family comes to mind.  John Hunt <Col N="1388" /> spent his lifetime collecting artefacts and his son, John Hunt Junior, and his daughter, Trudie, gave the city of Limerick a private collection worth £35 million, which included two paintings by Picasso and works by many other leading artists. There is no better example of public generosity than the donation of this collection to the public with no strings attached.  On behalf of the people of Limerick I thank the Hunt family for their generosity.  The Hunt collection will be displayed in a converted custom house building in Limerick.  Money is being made available from the public purse to ensure that the building is refurbished within 12 months so that the collection will have a permanent home.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for this very enlightened response to this generous gesture by the Hunt family.  Contrary to the image some people may have of him, the Minister drives a hard bargain. Money does not come from heaven but if people are willing to put money on the table the Minister will match it pound for pound.  The Deputy is mistaken if he thinks he can pull the wool over the Minister's eyes.</P>

I hope the Deputy will come to Limerick to see what can be done when there is enlightened public support for a very generous gesture. I could give other examples also of public benefactors who have been most generous in making available to the State items of historic interest not only from the Limerick area but also from other parts of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Fresh meat from animals to which hormonal substances prohibited within the European Union have been administered may not be imported to member states.  To provide for equal treatment of EU meat producers with their competitors from third countries, the EU decided that third countries trading meat into the Union must submit plans giving guarantees for the checking of residues for controlled substances equivalent to those operating in member states.  Consequently, imports of beef from the USA are restricted to consignments where guarantees as to non-application of such substances are satisfactory. The recently negotiated GATT includes a framework for dealing with sanitary and phytosanitary issues in the context of international trade.  The Union will be assessing the compatibility of the hormone ban with these measures in the course of its examination of the implementation arrangements for GATT commitments generally.</P>

The compatibility of the EU's hormone ban with the SPS discipline of the new GATT has not been determined and it would be premature to anticipate any decision on that matter.  The GATT will come into force on 1 January 1995 and in the meantime Commission policy is to seek further reductions in relation to difficulties with the United States.  We seek compatible conditions in the testing of residues and the production process of third countries exporting their product to the EU.</P>

      <P>Ewe premium entitlement is payable in accordance with EU regulations.  Normally payments are made by way of three instalments.  Payment of any of the instalments cannot be made until the European Commission fixes the amount to be paid and until up to seven days have elapsed from the date of publication of that decision in the Official Journal.  In 1993 it was decided that the first and second instalments could be paid together following publication of the second instalment decision in the Official Journal on 2 June 1993.  In Ireland's case payment of the first and second instalments commenced on 27 July 1993.  The European Commission has recently fixed the third and final instalment and that decision was published on 7 March 1994, facilitating payment amounting to an estimated £50 million by 15 March at the earliest.  The intention is to commence payment of the final instalment in Ireland before Easter and most payments should be made by the middle of April.</P>

      <P>The appeals panel commenced its work on reclassification of disadvantaged areas in November 1993. As provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the criteria for use in reclassifying areas from less-favoured to more severely handicapped status had been revised.  It is on this basis that the appeals panel has been carrying out its work.</P>
      <P>The appeals panel is now at an advanced stage of its work.  Clarification was sought by it in respect of the interpretation of one of the criteria being used for reclassification.  This clarification has been given by the Department and I hope this will permit the appeals panel to complete its analysis and to finalise its submission to me.  After examination of this submission by my Department, I will submit a proposal for reclassification of disadvantaged areas to the European Commission at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already forwarded to the Commission, in November 1993, a submission <Col N="1393" /> on the extension of disadvantaged areas. Although some preliminary work has been done on the submission, it is unclear when the Commission services will be in a position to complete its examination.  If the Commission accepts the submission, a detailed proposal will be made to the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers where a final decision will be taken after consultation with the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is likely that the Commission will wish to examine the submissions on extension and reclassfication of disadvantaged areas together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit in having a more open application period for certain schemes.  It is my intention that any farmer applying for a special beef premium in 1995 will be allowed to apply up to three times in the calendar year at times of his or her choice during that year.  This will meet the marketing requirements of individual farmers and should be helpful from the point of view of farmers and the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also considering introducing on a trial basis more flexible application arrangements for deseasonalisation slaughter premium in 1995 for animals slaughtered in the period January to <Col N="1395" /> April, which would allow an applicant to submit more than a single application.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to accept that the present system causes many problems to the orderly marketing of cattle by farmers and factories as the latter made great efforts recently to market outside the intervention system and under other European aids. However, for the Minister to say that he intends extending the provisions of the scheme in 1995 is unacceptable to many farmers.  Can this not be done immediately, considering that last June, July and August, marts, factories and all concerned were without cattle because they simply could not be sold?  There was also a drought in September when the price and marketing of beef suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, I have a great deal of sympathy for farmers and the position of the industry in relation to these schemes but they are new schemes, the total applications amounting to approximately 650,000, in respect of which there have been teething problems and difficulties in their implementation.  We are endeavouring to streamline and simplify them, ensuring that the supply of cattle to the industry is not disrupted.  In these circumstances, farmers could help substantially because, as the Deputy knows, there is a retention period applicable to most of the schemes, in some cases a two months' retention period, nevertheless farmers are slow to return completed application forms.  In the case of most schemes we are under pressure to extend the deadline, which we do to be helpful, but it would be very helpful if farmers, in their own interests and those of the industry, returned completed application forms quickly, when the retention period could be brought forward considerably.  However, for some reason or another, many completed application forms are not submitted until the last minute, creating a logjam, for the industry itself and in respect of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, in <Col N="1396" /> some cases, farmers have only two opportunities to apply which means they must ensure that all their cattle, purchased or not, are sent in for slaughter at those times.  Is it true that we are one of the few countries in Europe that does not have an open-ended application period, which would considerably ease the overall position?  I cannot see any reason for the Minister not implementing that extension immediately in the interests of the overall industry because it is costing farmers quite an amount.  While I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister's Department in dealing with all these new schemes nonetheless this matter should be dealt with urgently.  I ask the Minister to implement four application periods annually rather than three.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that a very effective way of preventing this practice would be to name people who used illegal substances on their animals? While commending the fact that the detection system operating within meat plants has resulted, at least in this instance, in identifying cases where illegal substances have been used, will the Minister say when he intends to implement that kind of testing on all carcases in meat plants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We must operate within the law, that is the point I am making. The Deputy, I think, referred to the ENFER system, a pilot project which has been undertaken.  Obviously it has to be reviewed from the point of view of effectiveness <Col N="1398" /> and so on.  The bottom line from the Department's point of view is to provide an absolute guarantee to consumers. In that context we will review the ENFER pilot project but at this stage it would be premature to make any predictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make sense when we have an Animal Remedies Act, which was introduced because of a major problem in the State, that we now have an open-ended response as regards detecting the use of illegal substances. It is not as if the Act came into force yesterday.  It has been in place since last October and we now have a pilot scheme which presumably the Department has had an opportunity to assess.  Is the Minister saying he does not know when he will introduce the full testing system for carcases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>There are procedures in place for the implementation of the Act. This morning two people in the north-west were handed down considerable jail sentences on conviction in relation to this area.  It would be premature to speak in terms of the effectiveness or otherwise of the ENFER test.  We have to examine the results of the pilot test which was funded by the Commission.  In general terms our level of testing is way above the average in the Community.  The ENFER test is a pilot project with a particular type of process.  We have to review the pilot test and see whether it will be the most relevant and useful instrument for the removal of these substances from production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister name the two individuals who have been penalised? The names of people who do not pay their taxes appear in the media and it has a certain effect, even if limited. We have to deal with this in a realistic fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the process.  When a conviction is obtained in open court the names of those convicted is a matter of <Col N="1399" /> public record.  I do not have the names of the individuals concerned but I am sure they will be available to the Deputy through the media, as they will be to me. If the Deputy wishes I can convey that information to her later this evening.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 8, 10, 34, 35, 40, 45, 49, 54, 57, 58 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Horticulture, which includes cut flower production, is aided under a number of measures.  The main ones are the farm improvement programme and the greenhouse grants scheme.  The promotion of cut flowers is catered for by An Bord Glas and in addition Teagasc provides research and advisory services to the sector.  As cut flower production is subject to a common organisation of the market member states of the European <Col N="1401" /> Union are precluded from providing State aid for such production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said the cut flower industry in Ireland is aided under a number of measures, the main ones being the farm improvement programme and the greenhouse grants scheme.  I understand that last year we imported £12 million to £14 million worth of cut flowers.  We produced £750,000 worth of cut flowers in a climate which is eminently suited, certainly under glass, for the production of fresh flowers.  Is he aware that the Netherlands, which is not a tropical country and has a climate similar to ours, is the premier producer of cut flowers in Europe and exported of the order of 4 billion guilders worth in 1992?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest of respect to you, it appears the Minister needs a good deal of instruction in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the figures I have given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not give much information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the lecture was not clear.  I will follow up with more detail on the question which the Deputy put in the first place.  In order to qualify for grant aid under the farm improvement scheme, applicants must satisfy certain training and/or experience criteria.  They must spend 50 per cent of their time in agricultural production and derive 50 per cent of their income from it.  The rate of grant is 35 per cent of approved cost, subject to a maximum investment of £180,000 per applicant. The greenhouse grants scheme was introduced on 1 August 1989 for a period of <Col N="1402" /> five years and caters for those who do not qualify under the farm improvement programme.  The grant rate is 25 per cent of approved cost.  Horticulture is also supported under the operational programme for rural development and the Leader programme 1991-93.  Similar type support is envisaged under the new round of Structural Funds 1994-97.  That is the financial assistance available from EU sources.  Because of the structure of the market within the Union we are not allowed to provide assistance from national funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the preparation of operational programme for agriculture and especially alternative enterprises, would the Minister agree that greater assistance should be directed to that area?  Can he say how many people are employed in the cut flower industry in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figures requested.  The Deputy can take it that in our discussions in Brussels we will seek to advance all sectors of the horticultural industry.  Because of the nature of the market the Deputy will accept that decision in relation to these grants will be made at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister make a case for a greater share?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mr. T. Ahearn Mr. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this is an area that could be of particular interest to women?  There are many successful flower clubs throughout the country, mainly involving women. Has the Minister any plans to help women to develop this industry?  Having listened to the eligibility criteria for grant assistance, the women in the flower clubs would have great difficulty in qualifying for a grant.  Is the Minister prepared to make a submission to Brussels seeking grant aid for rural women who have a genuine interest in flowers and can contribute much to this industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Should the Department not take a greater interest in this matter given that we import such huge quantities of flowers?  We should promote this and give whatever grant aid is necessary.  Could the Leader programme be used to help this sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We are anxious to assist any sector of the horticultural industry. On the eve of St. Valentines's Day we exported daffodils to the US.  Our best potential lies in producing field flowers <Col N="1404" /> or field produce generally out of season when it could command a premium price in the market.  Many years were spent developing the Dutch operation to the sophisticated point it is at and there are huge economies of scale involved.  The Leader submissions are made by groups in each of the potential Leader areas. These are forwarded to the Department and then to Brussels for approval.  The Deputy is aware of the process involved in Leader programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a common programme in the Community in relation to horticulture and the cut flower industry. Does that policy operate to our disadvantage in that it is heavily concentrated in low lying and other countries in Western Europe?  In the discussions on the funds under the agricultural-horticultural programme the Minister should seek a greater share of funding for that industry because of its very low base.  We have a comparative advantage in that we have good soil, climate and so on.  I accept that the Dutch, through their own innovation and ingenuity, have a highly developed industry.  However, we should seek this assistance and get a favourable loading in terms of funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 18, 21, 24, 41, 51, 52, 65, 68, 72 and 92 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the problems associated with inconsistencies in the ages of animals involved in January/February 1993 applications by comparison with the ages declared for the same animals the previous November/December.  Indeed my Department took up the matter with the European Commission in April 1993.  In its response to my Department in June 1993 the European Commission agreed as an exception that no farmers should be held to the ages declared in 1992 where the ages declared in 1993 were different provided that the age declarations were made by different producers.  In other words, they agreed that a farmer declaring <Col N="1409" /> the ages of animals in good faith in 1993 should not be penalised because a different farmer declared different ages in 1992.  Where, however, the same farmer declared different ages for male cattle in 1992 and 1993 the Commission did not indicate that this flexibility could apply.</P>
    <P>In the light of this reply from the EU Commission the Department was left with no choice but to penalise farmers where ages were declared differently by the same applicants in 1992 and 1993 and where such differences made animals which seemed to be ineligible for 1993 22 month premium on foot of the ages declared in 1992 seem eligible for that premium on foot of the ages declared in 1993.  I have, however, arranged to have the issue raised again with the Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his helpful reply to the effect that the Department is seeking to remove this anomaly.  The Minister accepts that some farmers who applied for the ten month beef premium in December 1992 may have been somewhat inaccurate regarding the age of the animal &mdash; it only had to be ten months.  Under the first application of the special beef premium applied for in 1993 a specific age was demanded.  Would the Minister agree that it is wrong for the Department to issue a circular informing farmers that they are being disqualified by reason of the inconsistency in the ages?  Does he further agree that it is wrong that there should be a paragraph which reads: &ldquo;Such an applicant should be regarded as having made a deliberate false declaration and should not be paid any beef premium for 1993 and should be excluded also from the 1994 special beef premium scheme.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I took the matter up with the Commission in April 1993.  This is an EU scheme paid for by the Community and it laid down the rules. Some farmers applied in November-December 1992 for nine month old animals and within three months the same animals owned by the same farmers seemed to become eligible for the 22 month premium.  The European Commission could not fathom this and were not prepared to accept that farmers did not have a reasonable knowledge of the age of the animals concerned.  I will take the matter up with the Commission in an effort to resolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the forms are so complicated that the ordinary farmer would need expert advice &mdash; perhaps the advice of the Attorney General &mdash; when filling them in?  Does the Department plan to simpify the form so that ordinary farmers with a few head of cattle on the land can fill them in and not be accused of supplying false information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that initially at least the forms were quite complex.  The difficulty is that there is a substantial amount of money involved.  There will be in the region of £600 million paid to farmers under these schemes next year, which is a considerable amount of money.  All of the moneys paid out under the premium schemes come from Europe, so it feels entitled to lay down the regulations and is entitled to accountability for this substantial sum.  Since the inception of the schemes we have sought to simplify the forms and in conjunction with Teagasc we have organised a range of information meetings and the staff of <Col N="1411" /> Teagasc is available at information offices throughout the county to help farmers. There is a plethora of advice and help lines available.  Farmers would prefer to be out on the land than filling up forms. For each eligible animal a farmer is entitled to a special beef premium of £73 at ten months and at 22 months.  The Commission is entitled to have the expenditure of that money accounted for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that we are coming to the stage where farmers will need secretarial assistance to ensure they qualify for the premium and shortly each animal will need to have a birth and a death certificate?  I am aware that farmers have been refused premiums because they could not remember the exact day the animal was born &mdash; farmers do not celebrate or record the birth of an animal &mdash; and they may lose their premiums because they did not inform the office of the loss of an animal within ten days of its death.  Is it proposed to inform Brussels that keeping the necessary records is causing a great deal of distress to farmers?  Would he agree that the penalties are too severe when unintentional errors occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the forms are complex but the subsidies involved are very generous.  Forms have to be filled out when applying for any grant or subsidy and there is a requirement that people must be entitled to the payments. Assistance to fill out the forms is available at weekends and at night from Teagasc, which has gone out of its way to be available to farmers day or night.  If I wanted to be smart I could say that these are voluntary schemes and people do not have to apply if they do not want the money.</P>

      <P>There is no question of a trip up.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry staff throughout its regional offices, as well as Teagasc staff in a the farm centres, are available to help people.  The service is free for small farmers in the west and the charge is £30 per annum for everybody else who avails of this service.  This is a very good service and I encourage farmers to use it more extensively.  It would be in their own interests and it would make it easier for the Department to implement the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept on reflection that his references to farmers' form filling was derogatory? Would he not agree that it is complex and farmers would need to have a computer in the back kitchen to keep up to date with the plethora of schemes and the complexity of the forms involved? How much assistance is available to farmers? I am not referring to Teagasc as its staff is overworked and cannot keep up with what it has to do.  There are 4,000 civil servants in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and why is a form that it is not properly completed not returned immediately to the farmer with the inconsistencies pointed out?  Why is it necessary to impose such penalties for innocent mistakes?  Would he not accept that they are entirely unfair and will he take steps to ensure that this unfair regime is lifted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that in the first instance the forms are complex.  They have been set by the European Union, the piper who pays the farmers.  The Commission insists on returns and that farmers comply with the regulations. <Col N="1413" /> Nevertheless following negotiations with the Commission we have introduced a number of measures to simplify and rationalise the forms.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that one needs a computer in the back kitchen when filling up such forms.  The Department at all its offices throughout the country and Teagasc have been outstandingly helpful to farmers.  The implication that Teagasc has not been doing its job is outrageous.</P>

      <P>They have been available day and night and at weekends and they have come to cold draughty halls throughout the length and breadth of the country to explain the schemes.  They have been very helpful.  Farmers should avail of the services, the help sheets and the help lines that Teagasc and the Department provide and that would make life easier for them and for the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Cé mhéid feirmeoirí atá i gceist?  In how many cases have discrepancies arisen?  Would the Minister agree that the application forms for the special beef premium are causing the problem and that discrepancies should be notified to the district veterinary officers who can address the matter directly with the farmer and have it sorted out before the Department submits the application to the European Union?</P>
      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by the Minister about the tremendous service that Teasgasc has given to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Department and Teagasc are providing an outstanding service I accept there is room for improvement.  The forms are complex and farmers are required to fill them in using the correct tag numbers.  They are also required to submit documentation such as identification cards.  If forms are filled in correctly the process can be speeded up.  Since the introduction of large compensatory payments European <Col N="1414" /> Union auditors have visited the Department and farmers and insisted that proper records are kept.  The accounting officer and departmental officials have to account for any discrepancies.  This matter has to be taken seriously.  In recent times in the completion of forms for the special beef premium scheme there has been a marked improvement.  I expect a new system to be in place by the end of the year to simplify and speed up the process.</P>

Will he put some system in place to allow farmers gain access, particularly at critical times?</P>

I wish social welfare recipients were offered the same service given that the forms are very complex. Will these workers be employed on a continuous basis to provide this service or only at the times when forms have to be completed?</P>

Additional moneys were provided in the budget for computerisation to speed up the process of making payments to farmers under these schemes.  The question of staff is a matter in the first instance for Teagasc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 86 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The distribution of farm income across the agriculture sector reflects, in part, the relative profitability of differing farm enterprises.  My Department operates a series of schemes designed to maintain farm incomes at viable levels, some of which also go in the direction of alleviating income disparities within the agricultural sector and I would draw attention to the following points.</P>
      <P>Under CAP reform there has been a shift from market support measures towards direct income payments to farmers. These payments i.e. suckler cow premium, special beef premium, ewe premium, slaughter premium and extensification premium are designed to protect farmers income and to achieve a better balance in the distribution of income support across the farming community.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the 0.6 per cent increase in the national milk qouta secured as part of the 1993-94 prices package will be distributed to small scale milk producers who require additional quota to improve the structure of their operations.  In deciding on the allocation of the suckler cow quota from the national reserve a number of factors will be taken into account to ensure that farmers on low incomes and small scale milk producers are given priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the disadvantaged areas schemes, farmers in less favoured areas receive substantial headage payments on cattle, beef cows and sheep.  Expenditure under this scheme in 1994 will exceed £125 million.  A number of these schemes apply limits on the number of eligible animals of the amount of payment and so have the effect of focusing support towards smaller farmers.  For example, cattle headage payments in disadvantaged areas are modulated to allow <Col N="1419" /> higher payments in respect of beef cows in more severely handicapped and less severaly handicapped areas.  In more severely handicapped areas the modulation of cattle headage is as follows: first eight livestock units &mdash; £84 each if beef cow, £40 each if other cattle livestock units; next 22 livestock units &mdash; £84 each if beef cows, £33 each if other cattle livestock units; next ten livestock units &mdash; £84 each if beef cow, nil if other cattle livestock units; maximum payable is £3.360 on 40 beef cows.  Only ten dairy cows may qualify for grants in a herd.</P>
    <P>Farmers can avail of farm profile forms which are designed to allow them complete their tax returns without the need for professional assistance.  This is of particular benefit to small farmers as it reduces the administrative costs associated with income tax payment.</P>
    <P>Extra funding totalling £2 million has been allocated to Teagasc for the provision of a free advisory service to small farmers whose viability is at risk.</P>
    <P>The accompanying measures under CAP reform and in particular the agri-environment and forestry schemes will offer additional opportunities for income generation in the coming years.  The rural environment protection scheme for Ireland approved by Government earlier this year is expected to involve expenditure of nearly £230 million up to 1997.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Rural Development and rural development proposals contained in the National Plan 1994-99 include measures to encourage the production of alternative products to help supplement existing farm income levels.</P>
    <P>Estimates of income per farm household are published in the Household Budget Survey which is conducted by the Central Statistics Office at seven yearly intervals.  The most recent survey was published in 1987.  For this reason, information is not available on the income of farm households in 1993.  In 1987 farm household weekly income amounted to £242 and close on 50 per cent of this income was derived from non-farm sources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> According to the Central Statistics Office there were some 170,000 farms in the country in 1991 and the number of persons classified as principal occupation farmer in that same year was 112,900. This means that some 57,000 people who own farms are not principal occupation farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the disparity between the better off farmer and the poorer farmer is considerable and has been exacerbated over the years by the CAP?  The top 25 per cent are eight times better off than the bottom 25 per cent and this has not been addressed.  Does the Minister set targets to narrow that disparity?  In regard to the agri-environmental scheme and the Leader programme, which the Minister did not mention but referred to as rural development, is it not difficult for people who are poor already to avail of the benefits as they cannot provide the matching funds?  Is this not one of the limitations of a fund which presumably is directed towards rural development and poorer rural areas?  Does the Minister agree that if it is up to local communities and individuals to come up with matching funds, that prevents people from developing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always difficult to ensure equity under various schemes, the vast bulk of which are based on headage of some kind so that the people with the largest number of livestock get the largest amount of subsidy or income.  Nevertheless we are modulating headage grants so that those with smaller numbers get a larger income.  I have had some criticism from the southern part of the country because people in the west and north-west got almost double what they got under the milk redistribution scheme. That was a consequence of trying to be helpful to the north-west and western part of the country.  Under the Leader programme there is an acute problem for people in isolated areas, especially coastal areas; the larger their grant the greater trouble they are in because they must provide matching finance.  What we <Col N="1421" /> are trying to do is to put money which was going into intervention for storage of produce into the farmers' pockets and into circulation in rural areas.  For example, sheep farmers get about £125 million per annum which is a substantial subsidy, almost equivalent to the value of the sheep.  I acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed.  We are endeavouring to target the less well off for the greatest benefit under the schemes at our disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the lengthy answer the Minister has given.  It is strange that he has not referred to either pig farmers or poultry farmers who have not received this massive increase that the Minister suggests is being paid to farmers this year.  Pig farmers have had their worst period in years which has lasted since October 1992.  The Minister has power to do many things.  Will he, at this late stage, agree to withdraw the veterinary levy or at least reduce it to the same level as that in other European countries?  Will the Minister also agree to take immediate steps to sort out the problems in the poultry industry?  Poultry farmers are having to close their doors because of the reduction in their income? A note sent out to supermarkets by one operator in the poultry industry indicated they were proud to be able to say they have kept poultry prices at 1984 levels. Has any other sector had to live on a 1984 income?  Although pigs and poultry are not covered by the CAP there are ways in which the Minister can help.  I ask him to help them immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question on poultry which I will be glad to answer later.  In regard to the pig sector, I am aware that despite the general well being of agriculture and farming, the pig sector had a very difficult year in 1993.  At my <Col N="1422" /> request a number of measures were taken at European Community level to help the industry.  Nevertheless, it is still suffering severe income problems.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I met members of the industry during the past few weeks to seek to improve their position.  It is a difficult problem.  For example, feedstuff is the main cost in milk production.  I was requested by pig farmers to do something about the price of grain, but grain farmers were not happy about that as it would mean a loss of income.  I do not want to improve the position of one sector by creating a difficulty for another.  Nevertheless, in the next few days I hope to announce the introduction of a package for pig farmers to assist them in overcoming their difficulties.  Pig farming works in cycles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight years ago Teagasc produced figures to show that a farmer with 80 adjusted acres of land received 100 per cent of the then average industrial wage, but a similar farmer today with 80 adjusted acres receives approximately 65 per cent of the average industrial wage.  Is the Minister aware Teagasc figures show that there are up to 10,000 farmers with incomes of less than £5,000 per annum. Is he further aware that the Conference of Major Religious Superiors in examining this problem some years ago pointed out that several thousand farmers here were living well below the poverty line and that poverty was more prevalent and growing more rapidly among small farmers than among any other economic group?  Is the Minister aware of those figures and, if so, what is he doing to alter them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the <Col N="1423" /> surveys carried out by Teagasc and of the position in areas such as the Beara Peninsula and the Mizen Head and Kilcrohane Peninsulas where farming is very difficult.  We are introducing Leader programmes, agri-environment and agri-tourism schemes, operational programmes for rural development and so on in an effort to help in particular the less well off and small farmers.  If it was not for the direct incomes from such programmes and schemes very few people would be living in those areas, except perhaps those who recently took up residence. Unemployment assistance and the various subsidies are keeping the structure of society in place in such areas. Many State, semi-State and local authority schemes provide incentives for professional people such as local engineers and Teagasc advisers to reside in those areas in an effort to help the local people. As far as possible we are trying to tilt the balance in favour of the small and less well off farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Each member state is entitled to establish a reserve for ewes and suckler cows.  We are processing that at present and targeting priority categories, including young farmers who did not receive a quota for 1991.  However, the amount of reserve and the number of applications leave a relatively small quota to distribute.  When I suggested reducing the quotas of large quota holders they reacted strongly because they had built up their quotas and felt they were entitled to retain them.  In fact they suggested it might not be legal to do so.  Nevertheless, I am endeavouring to increase the quota for small holders and to allocate a quota to well-trained young farmers for sheep and suckler cows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's recognition of the problems in the pig industry.  In advance of his announcement to representatives of pig farmers next week, will he consider introducing a scheme of low interest or subsidised loans from his Department to help pig producers who need to invest in their pig farms to improve production efficiency? Is he aware that the pig is now the only conventional farm animal for which there is not direct financial assistance from the European Union?  Is the Minister considering any European initiatives to assist the pig industry?</P>

      <P>I requested the European Community to take a number of measures in respect of special sale <Col N="1425" /> schemes to Eastern Europe and prior to Christmas they held three special sales.  I accept that the pig does not come under any of the livestock schemes in respect of headage payments and so on, all changes are market led.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, there are still a number of quadrupeds for which we might seek to extend the headage schemes, but extending those schemes means reducing them in areas which already receive them.  I am considering those matters and will consider the Deputy's suggestion to make on-farm grant aid available to improve efficiency at farm level.</P>
      <P>I contacted the financial institutions on low interest loans and I was informed that interest rates are relatively low at present.  From their experience they did not view the pig industry as a problem sector.  The co-ops and factories who purchase pigs experience difficulties with the pig producers.  I inquired if low interest finance would be available for that sector. However, I understand from submissions by representatives of the industry that cash incentives per pig or per sow would be more effective than a medium or long term loan facility in resolving their acute cash flow problems.  I will seek to obtain such incentives in the package.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the schemes are highly complex.  However, because of the amount of money involved &mdash; as much as £600 million when the CAP reforms are fully in place in 1995 &mdash; it is not unreasonable that the EU Commission lays down very specific conditions for the completion of forms and the meeting of other requirements.  My objective is to keep administrative procedures as simple as possible within the constraints of the Commission regulations.  My Department is continuously monitoring all aspects of the scheme with this in mind. Help sheets are available with all scheme application forms and in addition assistance is available to farmers by way of information seminars held throughout the country by the Department in conjunction with Teagasc and by way of the Teagasc CAP consultancy service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>We live in a selfish society in which there are many acquisitive people.  However, benevolent gestures are made by individuals and families.  The Hunt family donated a collection of works worth £35 million to the city of Limerick, one of the largest and finest private collections in existence.  It is important to capitalise on the bequest and make Limerick a centre of excellence in regard to museums.  Other museums in the city include King John's Castle which has been refurbished recently and is worth visiting.  It is one of the finest examples of Norman architecture here. Close by is another fine historical building, St. Mary's Cathedral built in 1168. Closer to my heart is the city museum located in John's Square in cramped conditions. There is also museum space available in City Hall on Merchant's Quay but because one wall is porous the building cannot be used to house the city's heritage collection.  The Minister should consider opening a museum in the City Hall where the local collection as <Col N="1475" /> well as artefacts which are closed off to the public could be exhibited.  For too long artefacts in the possession of the National Museum have been locked away in Letterfrack and other places mentioned by Deputy Connor.  If money was provided to renovate the stone wall of the building in Limerick, many important artefacts could be exhibited there.</P>
      <P>The idea of opening a centre of excellence in Limerick is worth pursuing as it would have spin-off effects for the city. The Hunt museum in Limerick attracts tourists as well as scholars and students, people who are interested in culture. Other attractions could also be provided in the area to encourage tourists to stay as long as possible in the country.</P>
      <P>We hear much about the Ardagh chalice, the Derrynaflan hoard, the Lisheen collar and the Book of Kells, but there are many other artefacts which are significant in a local context and which are seldom seen by the public.  There is no reason these items should not be displayed for our own people as well as for visitors.  Perhaps the Minister will consider this suggestion.  I am dwelling on much of what Deputy Connor said but I was impressed with his contribution.  It is important that buildings are renovated, with an emphasis on stonework.  The Minister should use his influence with the Office of Public Works to ensure that training is provided for apprentices in this area.  Skills in the laying and cutting of stone can be passed on and the experience of stonemasons should be used to the advantage of young people.  Since brain surgeons can be trained in five or six years there is no reason that stonemasons cannot be trained if they have the willingness and aptitude to learn the trade.  The Minister should ensure that the best possible training is provided for apprentices not only in the building of new interpretative centres but in the maintenance of existing structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connor referred to the interpretative centre in Navan, near Armagh.  I have not visited that centre but I intend to do so.  I support the concept of providing interpretative centres <Col N="1476" /> in populated areas where visitors have access to the local taverns, restaurants, hotels and craftshops.  This would be to the advantage of the areas concerned and would mean that the tourists would not simply go from a hotel to an interpretative centre and back again, without meeting the local people.  Deputy Connor's views in this regard are in line with Labour Party policy &mdash; I do not care what feathers are ruffled in saying that.</P>
    <P>I visited Cobh in County Cork five times in the last eight months and visited the interpretative centre on two occasions.  That centre is a painful reminder of the people forced to emigrate to America, Australia and New Zealand, many of whom left from Cobh. My mother was one of 15 children from County Clare, 14 of whom emigrated to New England via Cobh.  For that reason I have a personal interest in this area. The interpretative centre in Cobh, which is located on the site of the old railway station, is one of the best centres in the world.  I welcome the fact that brick and stone were used in the renovation of that building.  People who visit the interpretative centre usually spend the day in Cobh, spending money in the area, to the benefit of the local economy.</P>
    <P>I opposed some of the interpretative centres referred to, not for any perverse reason but because it was proposed to locate them in isolated areas.  From the media one may get the impression I am a person without common sense and practical understanding of this country, but my objections to interpretative centres were based on common sense and experience.  I am a stonemason, as were my father, grandfather and great grandfather, and I speak from knowledge and understanding of archaeological sites and interpretative centres.  I spent a great part of my life working with stone and I know as much about this matter as any Minister.</P>
    <P>It was on the basis of my knowledge in this area that I opposed the Mullaghmore interpretative centre.  I strenuously opposed my partners in Government on this issue and will continue to do so without <Col N="1477" /> apology.  Even though the Labour Party is in Government with Fianna Fáil I will continue to express my views, as I do at our parliamentary party meetings, and I apologise to nobody for so doing. In a democracy people lose out, and I have lost many struggles even within my own party.  Even in one's household, where the woman usually rules the roost, for the sake of peace one must sometimes compromise.  In this case I am stating my views and I have no objection to people opposing me.</P>
    <P>Much was made of this issue by Deputies Killeen and de Valera, who both represent County Clare.  Deputies in the same constituency, particularly members of the same party, do not always speak well of each other.  I applaud the fact that these two Deputies who are now in a party of their own, in a kind of limbo, spoke well of each other. They made a case for the farmers and landowners who experience difficulties in terms of rights of way.  Perhaps they had in mind Poulnabrone Dolmen in the Burren, County Clare.  I know that area very well because I frequently visit Ballyvaughan. To get to that area one has to trample over ditches and fences.  Where monuments are situated in isolated areas such as this, carparks should be provided close by so that people visiting the area will not block the roads.  That would be welcomed, particularly by middle-aged and older tourists.</P>
    <P>There is a compensation culture in this country, not so much in the area of the Office of Public Works, but in the area of local authorities.  The Minister should face up to the fact that an increased number of visitors will wish to visit our artefacts and monuments and natural terrain. Land should be acquired in these areas to provide facilities for them.</P>
    <P>The objections to the Bill from the other side of the House were very flimsy. I welcome the central thrust of the Bill which gives the State more power, not in an obtrusive way but in a way that will assert the State's role in this regard.  Too much of our heritage is being destroyed, lost and stolen, and we should not accept that.  The State has a right not only to <Col N="1478" /> preserve our heritage and history but to display it in a practical way where it can be seen by all our people, particularly our young people, as well as by tourists. I welcome the Bill and believe the criticisms of it are misplaced and will be proven wrong in time and wish the Minister all the best.</P>

      <P>I fully support the extension of the State's role in the conservation of national monuments and I applaud many of the measures taken by the Office of Public Works in their conservation. I wish it had additional resources to do more.  Every Member probably has a favourite monument and view on this subject.  When one listens to a debate such as this, one hears interesting views about monuments which have been neglected.</P>
      <P>I hope nobody will take offence at my statement that the waterways interpretative centre in the Grand Canal harbour in my constituency was a missed opportunity. Much more could have been achieved with the large amount of money put into this centre if an old warehouse near the canal had been coverted.  The centre is very interesting from an architectural point of view and shows great ingenuity on the part of the people who built it.  However, on balance, it was a waste of resources and a missed opportunity to build a really good centre for the interpretation of the waterways.  I say that fully cognisant that many of the things done by the Office of Public Works, for example, the Céide Fields interpretative centre and other conservation projects, are triumphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I impress on the Minister my strong view that display case museums are an old fashioned concept.  If I may encourage the Minister to go on a junket, the next time he is in Western Canada he should visit the remarkable museum on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. <Col N="1479" /> This modern museum is dramatically different from any on this side of the world &mdash; it displays artefacts of Canadian history and culture in a totally different milieu from anything we are used to.  I appreciate that the staff of the National Museum are doing their best with the limited resources available to them, but the idea of displaying gold torque and amulets in a case is not the way to convey their historical and cultural context.  Displaying a 20 to 30 foot long dug out canoe in a box on the side of a Victorian building which has Victorian display cases and terrazzo floor does not convey the culture surrounding the making of the artefact.</P>
    <P>I will not attempt to describe the museum in British Columbia save to say that it created in huge spaces, which were built on an industrial scale, a sense of time and history in a way I have never seen on this side of the Atlantic.  It was exciting to see that museum, from which we could learn.  I do not know if the Collins Barracks project will include massive spaces, but we have had enough of the display case museum concept. Something radically different is needed to feed the appetite among tourists and the public generally for Irish culture.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in the conservation of national monuments to simply conserve and leave objects in a ruinous state. I do not know if this is a wise idea.  There are two schools of thought on this issue, one of which believes that to restore is to destroy.  The restoration of buildings is a worthy enterprise as it makes buildings much more interesting to tourists and understandable to members of the public seeking to plumb their cultural origins. Regardless of what they are used for, restored monasteries are much more interesting than a destroyed monastic ruin in a field.  Even if it requires some conjectural work, which may not please every archaeological purist, it is worth carrying out restoration work if it conveys the scale, size and function of the object. The Office of Public Works should be more adventurous in this area.</P>
    <P>I have always favoured the restoration <Col N="1480" /> of Lemenagh Castle in County Clare &mdash; this would have been a much more worthy project than building an interpretative centre.  Tourists and the public generally would be much more interested in a castle which had been restored than a modern building which has been erected to interpret the Burren. We should be more creative in using older buildings and monuments to achieve results.</P>
    <P>I am something of a national monuments buff &mdash; on long weekends I tramp marshy fields to get to Castleroche Castle in County Louth and other sites.  People who do not bring books with them must be very disappointed when they arrive at a monument to find a bilingual notice telling then not to intefere with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often there is no notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often there is no notice to explain the nature of the monument.  I fully support that proposition that national monuments should not be interfered with but if people go to the bother of erecting notices at national monuments they should interpret them for tourists.  Perhaps the stonemasons referred to by Deputy Kemmy could erect stone plaques or other permanent notices.  I am not talking about maps which can become mouldy or a plastic notice which may collapse or require maintenance after a few years.  I am talking about permanent notices which will give tourists or people interested in the cultural roots some background information about the monument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to striking a constitutional balance between the rights of landowners and the rights of the public to see its heritage, I am completely on the side of the public.  No one has the right to tell the community they want to be compensated, except in the most exiguous way, for access to monuments. Landowners should not be liable for compensation because that excuse is a rather threadbare one in many cases.  The public has a right of access to our heritage and <Col N="1481" /> it is a constitutional value which should be enshrined in our laws.  Property owners here should realise, as Mr. Drummond said in the 19th century, they have duties as well as rights.  If one owns a structure which is a national monument &mdash; and in general terms such structures should be vested as far as possible in the community &mdash; they carry with them a responsibility and not simply a right.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated in the House today it was proposed to introduce legislation to put the Heritage Council on a statutory basis which I welcome.  I presume it will have a function at some stage in relation to conservation of our built environment.  I do not draw a sharp distinction between Norman and Tudor structures and those of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.  I ask the Minister to enshrine in our laws some protection for our built environment over and above that which exists under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act which is primarily concerned with building suburban estates in addition to planning and zoning.</P>
    <P>When I consider what has happened in Harcourt Street, for instance, where two houses dating from the 1780s, one of which had very elaborate internal plaster work, were vandalised and had their roofs removed, I weep because no other city in Europe would allow such houses to be destroyed at the whim of a development programme.  No other city in Europe would permit property owners in these circumstances to allow slates fall off the roof and three or four years of weathering to take its toll.  No other city in Europe would be so careless of its built heritage as Dublin has been.</P>
    <P>As a Dublin representative I believe we need an entirely new set of statutory provisions dealing with conservation of our built environment.  The time has come to admit that simply listing a building but doing nothing to stop someone destroying it by neglect is not good enough.  If one travels around inner city north Dublin one can see the gems of architecture there that are cemented up because some of their owners choose to leave them in that condition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> We must put in place a statutory basis for the conservation of our built environment and to impose on the owners of houses in Merrion Square, Henrietta Street or Mountjoy Square in Dublin and other areas the duty of conserving them. Nobody could interpret the Constitution as it was interpreted primarily by the Department of the Environment in the past, when many successive Governments were given advice to the effect that property was simply a set of rights, that there was no responsibility attached thereto and that in a municipality there was no municipal right to conservation of the municipality.  That was never implicit in our Constitution but now must be made explicit in our statute law.</P>
    <P>Whether the responsibility lies with this Minister or his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, the time has come for new statutory measures to preserve our built environment.  We must impose on owners of our architectural heritage an obligation to maintain it.  We must end the reliance on the planning Acts, which are inadequate, to deal with preservation of our architectural environment. Our architectural culture should be valued in the same way as, for instance, the Derrynaflan chalice.  Would we allow somebody to put the Derrynaflan chalice in their garage simply because they discovered it?  Would we allow somebody to paint it, batter it or neglect it?  We would not.  Why are we so careless of our architectural heritage?</P>
    <P>The north inner city of Dublin is one example of a lost opportunity to prevent urban decay.  Deputy Kemmy's city, Limerick, suffered greatly from decay and the absence of a strong conservation agency with statutory powers.  In a new climate we can now reverse in Ireland the tradition of neglect of our built environment but only if the Government, with its great majority, its advisers and its much trumpeted ingenuity and commitment to change, puts in place within the coming years a statutory basis to implement these measures.  We have an immensely valuable culture and it is sad to see it decaying in front of our eyes for want of action being taken to express the value of caring <Col N="1483" /> for the environment.  We must put the obligation and duties of property above the rights of property.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this comprehensive Bill.  It should be established in law that the State expressly has a right of ownership of all archaeological objects found in the State <Col N="1484" /> which have no known owner.  It is common sense to include a provision that the State may waive its rights.  We know that the National Museum has many artefacts in its possession and has not space to display them.  For the reasons the Minister stated in his introductory remarks, it is only proper and fair that the State may give up its rights in this area.  It is a problem to which the Minister is devoting attention, through the Collins Barracks project.  I share Deputy Michael McDowell's concerns about the various ways in which artefacts can be displayed.</P>
      <P>Not far from my home there is a very large repository of National Museum artefacts in the former reformatory in Daingean in County Offaly.  It would be reasonable to argue that some of those artefacts, relating to agriculture in particular, could be best exhibited within a rural context.  I have had some discussions with the Minister on this and intend to take the matter up directly with the National Museum authorities.</P>
      <P>I would urge all concerned to guard against the idea that, once the Collins Barracks project is in place, everything will be centralised in Dublin.  Certain aspects of the National Museum collection would be best exhibited and appreciated within their own environment. I would urge the Minister to bear that in mind in the plans for the National Museum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of section 12 providing for the establishment by the Commissioners of Public Works, on a statutory basis of a list of all monuments and places where they believe monuments are located, the lack of which to date has resulted in the destruction of an immeasurable part of our heritage.  The proliferation of golf courses, new motorways and so on around the country has endangered many of these places.  A comprehensive national register is to be available on a county by county basis for consultation by the public and all those who may have an interest in it.  I should like this provision to be highlighted as much as possible after the enactment of this Bill.  There are many groups with a tremendous interest in local archaeology <Col N="1485" /> and local history who have fears about the destruction of such sites.  The provisions of section 12 will help highlight the existence of these sites and the efforts undertaken by those concerned to protect them.</P>
    <P>When replying, or possibly on Committee Stage, I would ask the Minister to elaborate on the provisions of section 7 which strengthen the powers of the Garda to intervene in the usage of metal detectors on such sites, a very contentious area.  Most of the provisions of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987 were concerned with the control of indiscriminate metal detecting, which was indeed necessary.  However, it must be realised and appreciated that there are some genuine archaeological hobbyists out there who would be prepared to co-operate with the National Museum authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works but who fear that the provisions of that earlier Act, strengthened by the provisions of this Bill, will render such co-operation ever more difficult.  I should like to think that an atmosphere of co-operation with the responsible elements of that hobbyist group could be fostered.</P>
    <P>Some points made to me relate to the existing definition of what constitutes an archaeological area.  The definition is so wide as to include and control any artefact, whether of ancient or modern vintage.  Representatives of the National Museum say that a common sense approach is adopted in the application of such control.  That should be the case in the application of all law.  However, the area warrants further examination in that current practice, if not legislation, needs to be improved in order to remove the fears of those who wish to engage in such excavation activities as a genuine hobby. It is reasonable for such people to expect that they would not be accused of looking for archaeological objects in breach of the law, particularly in areas which are non-sensitive or have not been listed to date.  Under this Bill, there will be an obligation on them to report anything they find to the authorities within four <Col N="1486" /> days.  That should be sufficient to cover non-sensitive areas nationwide.</P>
    <P>In reply to the points I am making, it could be argued that the provision existed in the 1987 Act for permits to be granted to such people.  In practice, it has been proven to be extremely difficult to have such permits granted.  I am aware of one enthusiast in my area who applied for permission to detect objects in a Victorian rifle range in an old military barracks.  He was told that, in practice, archaeologists only, or people with archaeological training, could be licensed.  While I can understand that the National Museum authorities might advocate such a policy, there is a middle ground worth exploring in that there are responsible elements within that hobbyist group willing, if necessary, to undergo training in aspects of archaeological appreciation.  Such people assisted in my area when the Portlaoise by-pass excavation work commenced, checking whether there were any objects of archaeological interest to be found there. They are capable of working out a compromise in co-operation with the National Museum.  I ask the Minister to address that matter as the Bill progresses.</P>
    <P>If that matter is not addressed my fear is that the information network of an informal nature which obtained between the National Museum, the Office of Public Works and the hobbyists might be put at risk.  For example, there were items which may not have been of a strict archaeological nature but deserving of examination which were reported willingly at local level and checked out.  Such a network could be lost if a strong arm of the law approach is adopted by the authorities.  This might reinforce the efforts of those endeavouring to take such objects out of the country illegally.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address the points I have raised and I look forward to his response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  My colleague, Deputy John Connor, made a very substantive contribution so far as the overall national issue is concerned, <Col N="1487" /> so I shall confine my remarks to local issues.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the total neglect of the archaeological heritage in the Sligo area.  As he said in his introductory remarks, maps were compiled recently showing sites and monuments records, on the basis of surveys undertaken over the past ten or 20 years. No area in the country is richer in these monuments than County Sligo.  There is one area in Monasteraden where continuous problems arise with regard to the granting of planning permissions, where people cannot build the foundations for a house without hitting an ancient monastery or some archaeological site.  That obtains all over County Sligo, yet, there is total neglect of that area.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the initiative of a local development group I visited Knocknarea Hill Fort, an enclosure dating back to about 1,000 BC, the third largest such enclosure in the country.  There is one large, megalithic passage tomb there and 30 hut dwellings.  It is not even classified as a national monument.  Deputy Michael McDowell complained about inadequate signage.  There is no sign or any indication of what is there, despite its great archaeological interest.  That is neglect of what I regard as one of the outstanding sites of this nature in the whole country.  It is one of our largest and has the remains of 30 hut dwellings.  If that was in another part of the country, for example, in Meath or Galway, considerable work would be done.  As far as Sligo is concerned there is total neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister inform the House what happened to the Armada ships found in Streedagh, County Sligo, many year ago?  Thanks to my intervention their artefacts were kept safely in the State and I asked that nothing would be done without the authority of the State. I know court cases are pending but I would be glad if the Minister would tell us what will happen to these artefacts.  I saw a reference in a number of publications to the effect that the Minister has ambitions to set up a maritime museum in Galway and is considering the <Col N="1488" /> suitability of artefacts from the Armada ships in Streedagh, County Sligo for that museum.  I have the cuttings of the articles which were widely reported.</P>

      <P>When the Armada survivors got ashore in Sligo some were roughly treated and many lost their lives.

      <P>Deputy Gallagher referred to the folk collection.  This was one of the great works of the early part of the State.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;until I went down to Daingean, presided at their opening and started a scheme for their preservation.  I am delighted with the activities as far as Collins Barracks is concerned but that does not mean there should not be local <Col N="1489" /> museums.  In our national folk collection we have four or five examples of every artefact.  Perhaps they were over enthusiastic about the collection.  Therefore, we can have local museums without taking from the ambition to have a major national collection.  That is very important and it should be possible to have local museums which can become major collections.  As Deputy McDowell said, they should be live museums with craftsmen available, at least during the tourist season.  In conjunction with the folk museums the Minister should introduce the folklore collection.  Copies of the material available in University College, Dublin, and in the folk commission there should be available as an added dimension wherever there are folk museums.</P>

      <P>The statement I am about to make is in accordance with the terms I submitted to your office.  Yesterday I made a statement to the House on the Second Stage of the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1994.  One aspect of my speech, as it was presented, could be interpreted as indicating that in relation to the beef inquiry, the present Attorney General appointed the original State legal team and agreed their fees.  While the present Attorney General made many decisions in relation to the beef tribunal, he did not make these initial ones.  While this error does not alter the central arguments of my speech I, nonetheless, regret it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> Second, I express regret also if I offended against the procedures of the House but I did so under the impression that the Attorney General was answerable to this House.  Third, some of my critics stated that I impugned the integrity of the President of the High Court by reference to his position.  I categorically reject that assertion.  No such implication was ever intended and in so far as any inference has been drawn, I unreservedly withdraw it.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, the President of the High Court, as I said yesterday, is an illustrious judge.  I will go further and say that he is a judge of the highest standing and held in the utmost respect.  He matches up to the highest judicial standards internationally.</P>
    <P>My point yesterday was that it was utterly wrong that such an illustrious judge should be placed by the system and by the coincidence of events in what I regard as an invidious position.  The system itself is what I am strongly critical of.  If the reports of my remarks have caused him any embarrassment I hope that my comments today redress the matter as he had no hand, act or part in any of the matters of which I complained yesterday.</P>
    <P>Finally, by being allowed this opportunity by you, a Cheann Comhairle, for which I express my gratitude I hope that any unintentional wrong I have done to any individual is corrected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise this matter.  I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for being in attendance to respond to my request.  I wish to make a case on behalf of a limited number of people who were born in England of Irish parents and adopted in England by Irish parents. Because their place of birth was England they have been declared ineligible for Morrison visas.  That is an unfortunate clause in the legislation governing the US <Col N="1491" /> Morrison visa system.  As far as I am aware the regulations are based on the country of birth rather than a nationality clause.  I have had a number of queries in this regard.  I thought the first query was a single case.  Following telephone calls to the embassy and to a number of adoption agencies I discovered there were many similar queries throughout the country.  The queries were from people born in England who after two or three days were adopted by Irish parents. Their natural parents were also Irish.  They live in Ireland, are Irish citizens and have Irish passports but are ineligible for a Morrison visa because their place of birth is England.  The only suggestion the American authorities have to offer is that they should apply for a Morrison visa from the English allocation.  They would have a million to one chance of getting one.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister make representations to the appropriate US authorities?  I am sure this was an oversight in the regulations but it disqualifies a limited number of people from applying for a Morrison visa from the Irish allocation. They are bitterly disappointed and would be grateful for any assistance he may be able to give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to respond to the anomaly raised by Deputy Bradford about the eligibility of certain Irish citizens for Morrision visas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Morrison visas are issued by the US embassies under the US Immigration and Nationality Act, 1990.  It provides for a certain number of visas &mdash; 48,000 in our case &mdash; over a three year period ending next September to 35 countries from which people traditionally emigrate to the US. Section 202 (b) of the Act states that natives of the countries concerned, that is people born in those countries, irrespective of their nationality or citizenship are charged to that country's visa application.  People of Irish parentage born in Britain are therefore chargeable against the British allocation.  The only exceptions to that rule are children born <Col N="1492" /> of people temporarily resident in a country other than their own such as diplomats, missionaries, or employees of international companies.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy said, my Department is aware that a number of Irish citizens born in Britain and adopted here are not regarded as eligible for Ireland's allocation. I understand one is a baby whose parents already have Morrison visas.  Part of the difficulty in seeking to address this problem is that the deadline for applications under the last round of the Morrison programme was 31 March 1993.  As Deputies are aware, the programme ends in September.  Given that the deadline for applications has passed it has become more complicated to address problems arising at this stage.  Notwithstanding that we raised these problems with the US authorities who promised to review the applications carefully in consultation with Washington.  My Department has also had discussion with the US embassy in the matter.</P>
    <P>In our recent dealings with the US authorities we have found the US embassy to be very constructive in dealing with consular problems which we have brought to their attention.  Every effort is being made to resolve these difficulties. We are in close contact with the embassy and I hope for a positive outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this further opportunity to raise this matter. It concerns two couples experiencing real hardship having been refused mortgage interest supplement.  The first case is in Drimnagh, Dublin 12 where the couple pay £207 per month but only have unemployment assistance of £116 per week. The man concerned worked until 21 May 1993 and while still working got final approval from Dublin Corporation for the purchase of his house on 27 April 1993.  The shared owners reference is R459.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The couple did not collect the keys of <Col N="1493" /> the house until 28 June after the man became unemployed although they signed the contract a month before he became unemployed.  Since he was out of work when the keys were collected, the health board refused to pay the mortgage interest supplement.  This couple cannot pay the mortgage and due to a technicality are refused the mortgage interest subsidy.  They are at the end of their tether and will have to surrender their house and go back on the housing list whereas if they were given assistance for a few months the problems could be resolved cost effectively.</P>
    <P>The second case is similar and concerns a couple in Crumlin, Dublin, where the man was working when the couple signed the contract but had been let go from his job by the time they received the keys of the house.  They have an endowment policy on which the payment is £310 per month and cannot meet their repayment out of their unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In neither case were the people unemployed when the loan was given or the agreement entered into.  If they had been the local authority would not have given them the loan.  The unemployment took place between the time of signing the contract and getting the keys and in both cases the couples are experiencing extreme hardship.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will be as concerned as I am.  It is up to us as legislators to ensure that families do not suffer bureaucratic hardship such as is happening in these cases.  If something is not done these couples will lose their deposits and investment and will be thrown back on the State.  They will be on the housing list again whereas if they were given help for a few months they would be in a position to meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>This is my second time to raise this matter and I appeal to the Minister to issue a directive that these couples be assisted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows I have been in touch with the Eastern Health Board in both of these cases.  Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare <Col N="1494" /> allowance scheme, the determination of individual applications for assistance with mortgage interest repayments is a matter entirely for the health board.</P>
      <P>Under the guidelines, the issues in each of the two cases involved are quite clear. The people concerned took on mortgage commitments when they were unemployed and not in a position to meet the mortgage repayments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell explained the case accurately.  At the time the couple entered into the commitment they were employed but they were not when they entered into the final agreement.</P>
      <P>In the first case, which involves a male applicant, the person in question applied in March 1993 to purchase a house under the shared ownership scheme operated by Dublin Corporation.  In May 1993, however, this person became unemployed. The sale of the house was closed on 28 June 1993 when the applicant obtained a mortgage of £21,000.</P>
      <P>In the second case, which involves a female applicant, a building society mortgage was taken out in 1993 to purchase a house with her partner when both were in receipt of unemployment payments. The person in question applied for a mortgage supplement in June 1993.</P>
      <P>In both cases, the Eastern Health Board refused payment of mortgate supplements on the grounds that the persons in question were not in a position to meet the repayments when they entered into the financial commitment.  Both cases were appealed and the appeals officer of the Eastern Health Board upheld the decision of the board in each case.</P>
      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance legislation the Minister for Social Welfare has no function in relation to the determination of entitlement to an allowance or the amount of any such allowance.  These are matters for decision by the chief executive officer of the health board.  I have again been in touch with the Eastern Health Board in relation to both cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has advised me that in the case of the second applicant, certain documentation was requested by the board in support of her mortgage supplement <Col N="1495" /> application which has not been furnished to date.  The board will reconsider her case when this documentation is provided.  In the first case the board has advised me that no new facts have come to light which would warrant a reversal of their original decision.</P>
    <P>The guidelines on payment of rent and mortgage supplements are being reviewed by an advisory committee involving all the health boards and chaired by my Department.  I expect to receive their report shortly.  In this context, I propose to review the present supplementary welfare allowance appeals procedure and in particular its ability to deal with exceptional or unusual housing needs as illustrated in these cases.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the appeals procedure and its inability to deal with cases of this nature.  If we assume the bona fides of the people who entered into these arrangements it appears that an appeals officer would look sympathetically at the case.  Even though the general guidelines do not permit the payment of a mortgage supplement where people are not employed at the time they take out a mortgage the guidelines are being reviewed and I will have the report of the advisory committee shortly.  I will then examine the ability of the appeals procedure to deal with exceptional cases and I will bear in mind the urgency of the two cases mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance's announcement in the budget that the urban renewal scheme has been extended to 12 additional urban centres was very welcome but for south Tipperary there was no such good news.  I wish to highlight the utter disappointment, frustration and deep anger of the people in Carrick-on-Suir who have been ignored for urban renewal designation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that towns that have such an alarming level of unemployment, and the consequent serious <Col N="1496" /> social problems, should be considered worthy for urban renewal.  Carrick-on-Suir satisfies all the criteria laid down by the Minister for eligibility but its name did not appear on the list.  Carrick-on-Suir is surrounded by towns which have been fortunate to be designated as urban renewal areas such as Clonmel, Kilkenny, Waterford and Dungarvan which is included in a new programme. This is having a detrimental effect on Carrick-on-Suir in terms of its commercial and industrial development because the financial incentives are in the surrounding towns.  As a result, it is not only having an effect on the level of new development in the town but also on the morale of the people.  It is exacerbating to know that any available investment is being diverted to neighbouring towns because the financial advantages dictate that it would be ludicrous to invest in Carrick-on-Suir when much more profit can be made in the neighbouring towns.</P>
    <P>The prevailing unemployment level and the recent closure of the leather finishing factory is proof that Carrick-on-Suir will stagnate unless something is done to revitalise the town and to encourage people to invest in development and in commercial businesses.  This will not happen unless the Government looks upon Carrick-on-Suir as a town of special need, a town that needs incentives and which will not develop until such time as benefits are given by the Government to it.  I plead with the Minister, on behalf of Carrick-on-Suir Urban Council, the business people and the public of the town and the surrounding area to add Carrick-on-Suir's name to the urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>I have experience of the advantages of the urban renewal scheme.  In Clonmel I witness every day the great activity and the ongoing building programme.  Thankfully many of the derelict sites have been turned into thriving economic centres. Clonmel is benefiting from urban renewal status at a time of great unemployment. It had the advantage that it had urban renewal status and that is what is keeping it alive.  The people of Carrick-on-Suir cannot be expected to watch Kilkenny, Clonmel, Waterford and Dungarvan thrive and progress because of the status <Col N="1497" /> they had been granted.  The town of Carrick-on-Suir in the centre of this circle cannot be allowed to die &mdash; and die it will unless it is granted the urban renewal status that it deserves.</P>
    <P>I speak for all the people of Carrick-on-Suir who are waiting to have their town designated.  They are making tremendous efforts to promote and encourage investment in their town but that determination will not continue unless they are given urban renewal status.  In the interests of exploiting the potential of this fine urban town I urge the Minister to grant it urban renewal status and allow the town to grow and develop and thereby leave the people secure in the knowledge that their future is in their home town.  I look forward to a positive response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the numerous and well prepared reports and submissions received from various interests in Carrick-on-Suir and other areas seeking designated status for their towns.  It is the very limited nature of the urban renewal scheme that has contributed to its success to date.</P>
      <P>The urban renewal scheme is based on a wide range of special tax incentives and rates relief for new construction and refurbishment works in areas designated for urban renewal.  As I have informed the House on several occasions, it would be counter-productive to make these incentives available on a widespread basis as it would virtually convert the special incentives into standard ones and in doing so would diminish the potential for redevelopment in the areas most in need.  A scheme limited in area and time is necessary to focus the attention of potential investors and developers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing urban renewal scheme which was introduced in 1986 originally designated areas in the five major cities, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  The scheme has been extended since then to 24 centres throughout the country.  While the present scheme expires on 31 July 1994, a new scheme will come into operation on 1 August 1994 and will continue for a period of three years.  The scheme will <Col N="1498" /> continue to operate in towns already designated and will be extended to small areas in the 12 additional towns of Ballinasloe, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Killarney, Mallow, Monaghan, Mullingar, Navan, Nenagh, Newbridge, Roscommon and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>In selecting these additional towns for inclusion in the new scheme, factors considered included their size and status, regional considerations, the extent of urban decay, location and general character of the area, potential for redevelopment, the need to promote residential development in core inner areas of our towns and cities, and the historical or architectural significance of the area.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the cases made for inclusion of Carrick-on-Suir and other places in the scheme are worthwhile but the dilemma is that in a limited scheme such as this, many towns, or indeed areas within towns which have been designated, will have to be left out.  There would always be towns which would consider themselves left out regardless of how many areas were designated.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a good balance has been struck in revising the urban renewal scheme and that a reasonable regional distribution has been achieved.  I regret that, given the circumstances that I have just outlined, we were unable to designate areas of Carrick-on-Suir for urban renewal on this occasion.  The case made for designating the town will of course be borne in mind in any future review of the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  I strongly support the application which has been made by Sligo County Council to have the existing fire station in Enniscrone replaced.  This thriving and expanding seaside resort urgently needs a modern, state of the art fire fighting facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fire station serves an area, 22 miles by 80 miles, stretching from the Mayo border, near Ballina, to Skreen in County Sligo, including the villages of Templeboy, Dromore West, Raghly and Culleens <Col N="1499" /> and the seaside resort of Easkey.  This coastline, which is one of the most beautiful in the country, is densely populated.</P>
    <P>The existing fire station was built in the early fifties and its landrover type fire brigade served its purpose well.  Times have changed and they now have a modern fire fighting engine.  Before this can be reversed into the station its 35 foot extension ladder has to be removed and dismantled.  Once this manoeuvre has been completed successfully there is a gap of only four inches when the doors are closed.  There is no space available to carry out fire fighting drills or necessary tasks such as cleaning ladders, hoses and other essential equipment such as breathing apparatus.  Neither are there any drying or tea making facilities.  All maintenance work on the vehicle, ladder or hoses has to be done outside.  The nearest fire station at which they can carry out fire drills is Sligo which is 35 miles away. There are no rooms available to hold lectures or show videos on the most up-to-date fire fighting practices, even though oil pollution now poses a greater threat to the beach in Enniscrone.  If there was a major oil spillage off the north west coast the fire brigade with Civil Defence personnel would be first on the scene.</P>
    <P>The town of Enniscrone has expanded considerably in recent years.  There are five hotels in the town with several bed and breakfast premises, restaurants, caravan sites, shops, churches, pubs, entertainment and leisure facilities and nursing homes.  The ladders available to the fire station are unsuitable and inadequate for some of the tall buildings. If a fire were to break out the consequences could be catastrophic.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a modern, fully equipped fire station.  This would enable the nine part-time firemen to cope with any emergency.  I urge the Minister of State to issue approval for this fire station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline the position to him and the House.  There is no <Col N="1500" /> difference between us on the case for providing a replacement fire station in Enniscrone.  Approval in principle for the provision of a new two bay fire station with drill yard and training tower issued from my Department to Sligo County Council in September 1990.  The matter has since progressed to the stage that contract documents have been submitted to the Department by the council which has sought approval to seek tenders for the project.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy was advised in reply to a Dáil question on Tuesday, consideration is being given to the projects to be financed from the 1994 capital allocation for the fire service.  The proposal for a new fire station in Enniscrone will be evaluated in that context.  The Deputy will appreciate that capital funds are limited and that many projects are being considered for funding from the 1994 allocation.</P>
      <P>The Government values highly the work of the fire service and is fully aware of the importance of providing up-to-date facilities, equipment and training.  Since 1981, £72 million has been invested in the provision of 81 fire stations, the purchase of 286 new fire appliances and other fire fighting equipment and the development of a new regional computer-based mobilisation and call out system.  In addition, the Fire Services Council has provided 135 training courses both at home and abroad for a total of 2,428 participants in the last ten years.</P>
      <P>Sligo has benefited from this notable progress.  A new headquarters fire station has been provided in Sligo town at a cost of almost £1 million and new fire appliances and other fire service equipment costing over £300,000 have been purchased with the aid of grants from my Department.  Approval issued last month to the council to seek tenders for a further fire appliance at an estimated cost of £120,000 which will be paid for in full from the fire service capital allocation.</P>
      <P>The need for a new fire station in Enniscrone is accepted.  This proposal will receive the fullest consideration in the allocation of the fire service capital provision this year.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 29 March 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 12, 16, 17, 22, 23, 29, 33, 38, 39, 47, 69 and 70 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already announced an extension to the closing date for receipt of simplified area aid applications from farmers who are livestock producers only <Col N="1431" /> because of difficulties experienced by those farmers in obtaining maps or drawing the boundaries of their holdings on those maps.  This extension brings the closing date up to Friday, 29 April 1994, practically a full month after the original closing date of 31 March 1994.</P>
    <P>I would stress that the original closing date of 31 March 1994 still applies to farmers submitting combined EU area aid applications covering both tillage and livestock schemes.  As those farmers submitted maps in 1993 they should have no great difficulties in relation to maps in 1994 and there is no need, therefore, to extend the closing date for submission of their area aid applications this year.</P>
    <P>I would stress also that any farmers who are livestock producers only who are in a position to submit their area aid applications before the original deadline <Col N="1432" /> of 31 March 1994 should do so.  The sooner any farmer submits an area aid application the sooner it can be processed and the sooner 1994 livestock aid can be paid to that farmer later this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 20 together. The 1994 testing allocations for TB and brucellosis have been issued to private veterinary practitioners and a certain volume of testing has already been completed. The objective is to complete a smooth and orderly round of testing during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions have recently been held with the Irish Veterinary Union about its claim for a special fees review and the conditions under which this claim can be progressed have been outlined to the <Col N="1433" /> union.  I would hope that the issue can be resolved through negotiation without disruption to the annual round of testing. Any such action by the union would be contrary to the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and would be totally unwarranted as a method of pursuing its claim.</P>

      <P>Due to recent changes in the rules on set-aside, it is not possible at this stage to estimate the acreage which will be taken out of production this year under the EU set-aside scheme.  Similarly it is not possible to estimate the number of farmers expected to qualify or the total amount likely to be paid in compensation.  However, in 1993 approximately 26,000 hectares were set aside by 2,680 applicants under the scheme and approximately £6.8 million was paid in compensation.</P>

      <P>The number of persons still employed in connection with the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, apart from the Sole Member of the tribunal, is eight.

      <P>Total payments made to date in respect of the beef tribunal by my Department are £7,255,639.09.  Of this amount, £6,632,780.27 has been paid in respect of fees, withholding tax, salaries, overtime, travel expenses, etc. to persons engaged at the tribunal as detailed in the tabular statement which I am circulating.  Information on total payments made to each person, apart from counsel, is not readily available.</P>
      <P>Total payments to date by my Department to the senior counsel who have been engaged on behalf of the State and the tribunal since its inception are £3,259,025.60 including £740,042.30 withholding tax.  The rates of payments for briefs and refresher fees were established by the Attorney General in office at the time.  The present Attorney General established the amount of the fees payable for days when the tribunal was working but not sitting in public.  I am circulating a table outlining the payments made to senior counsel.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate what the final total professional legal fees will be as this will depend <i>inter alia</i> on whether and to whom costs may be awarded and the level of such costs.</P>

    <P>The number of random tests for clenbuterol (41,187 or 2.9 per cent of cattle slaughtered) carried out in 1993 on animal material taken from slaughterhouses was considerably in excess of the testing levels required by EU legislation. In addition, samples were also tested from any carcase in which the presence of clenbuterol was suspected.  I am <Col N="1438" /> satisfied as a result of this extensive testing and the other measures which I have put in place, including the setting up of a special investigation unit in my Department and a substantial increase in the level of fines and duration of prison sentencing for offences, that the testing levels are adequate and that Irish meat products are among the safest in the European Union.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy's interest is in the quality of land used for forestry.</P>
      <P>All proposals for the afforestation of over 200 hectares require planning permission but there are no restrictions from a quality of land viewpoint on a landowner choosing to afforest land as opposed to utilising it for other agricultural purposes.</P>
      <P>However, where a landowner seeks grant aid for afforestation my Department sets certain standards regarding the suitability of land to grow a commercial crop and also requires compliance with specific environmental criteria.  Land which has low fertility, severe exposure or drainage problems will have limited growth potential.  On the other hand, a landowner wishing to grow diverse conifers or broadleaf trees, in order to maximise premium income under the new EU afforestation scheme, must plant on better quality land.  The growing of diverse conifers and broadleaf trees on better quality land will in time produce higher quality and more valuable timber.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 42, 46, 89 and 99 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the various premium schemes involve complexity for farmers and my Department is constantly monitoring the various requirements in the interest of simplifying the procedures. However, as I said earlier given that the schemes involve considerable amounts of money &mdash; as much as £600 million when the CAP reforms are fully in place in 1995 &mdash; it is not, therefore, unreasonable that the European Commission lays down very specific conditions for the filling of forms and the meeting of other requirements.  The complexity of the schemes also bear on the administration.  I have recently announced a £4.8 million investment for 1994 to develop and upgrade computer facilities and other resources particularly <Col N="1441" /> in local offices with the objective of achieving the optimum delivery of my Department's services to farmers and with special emphasis on the timely payment of headage and premia grants.</P>
    <P>The position is that, generally speaking, payments are not refused because of insufficient information being supplied by applicants.  The problem is that failure to properly complete an application form leads to delay in processing an individual case for payment.  Detailed statistics are not maintained in respect of improperly completed application forms for each individual scheme.</P>
    <P>In the case of the June 1993 special beef premium scheme, for example, a recent analysis showed that up to 40,000 applicants had to be written to by my Department.  Despite several reminder letters, responses are still outstanding in many cases.  In general, the vast bulk of unpaid cases under each scheme are the subject of unresolved queries.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce a scheme of the type mentioned in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>EU supported schemes do not provide funding for reforestation activities, and therefore the costs of such a scheme would have to be met solely from Exchequer resources.  These costs would be substantial in view of the fact that Coillte currently reforest some 4,000 hectares per annum, a level of activity which is projected to increase by approximately 50 per cent over the next four years.</P>
      <P>While there are clear budgetary constraints, I am not, in any event, convinced as to the necessity for such a scheme bearing in mind the substantial timber revenues which accrue from the clear-felling of sites.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concern expressed in relation to the sale of subsidised EU beef to West African countries and the issue was in fact discussed at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in January last.  Members of the Council, including Ireland, supported continuous monitoring by the EU Commission of the impact of subsidised beef exports to west African countries to ensure that damage to domestic production <Col N="1444" /> is avoided.  The refund on beef exports to these countries has been reduced by 28 per cent over the past nine months.</P>
      <P>The use of refunds for exports of beef, and of other agricultural products, from the EU has been, and remains, a central element of the market support regime for Irish agricultural and food products and consequently is of major benefit to farmers' incomes, employment in the processing sector and the national economy as a whole.  I regard the EU export refund system as an essential part of the Common Agricultural Policy but I also favour modification of its effects where its operation creates particular difficulties for developing countries.</P>

      <P>The tuberculin test is the standard biological and legal test used in all member states in the EU for the identification of TB infected animals. The procedures currently applying to the diagnosis, reporting and clearance of herds affected by bovine tuberculosis are those specified in the EU Directive on animal health problems affecting intra Community trade.  This directive is currently the subject of a review and updating procedure and it is expected that a uniform system of reporting will be included in the revision.  There is no evidence to indicate any great disparity between the reporting methodologies in different member states but a completely <Col N="1445" /> uniform system would be desirable.  The specific definitions relating to suspect disease and confirmed disease have yet to be discussed but it is hoped that a more discerning set of definitions will emerge as part of the review.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, from replies to earlier questions and from other discussions in this House that I had major reservations from the outset as regards the potential impact of the original Blair House agreement. Arising from efforts made by the Commissioner, other Ministers and myself, very significant adjustments to that agreement were secured and are now part of the final outcome for agriculture.</P>
      <P>The main modifications related to the export support commitments, market access and the peace clause.  By comparison with the Blair House Agreement, the revised arrangements will allow the European Union in the period up to 1999 to export some additional 362,000 tonnes of beef, 146,000 tonnes of dairy products, 8 million tonnes of cereals and 269,000 tonnes of poultry and eggs.  The acceptance of the Union's market access arrangements will help to safeguard Community preference while the extension of the peace clause will ensure that European Union agriculture support measures are not subject to undue challenge in the GATT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These modifications almost fully address the concerns I expressed regarding the Blair House Agreement.  Our analysis of the effects of the final agreement is that it should not impose undue <Col N="1446" /> constraints over and above the Common Agriculture Policy reform decisions for most sectors.</P>
    <P>However, in the event that additional measures might be necessary, I secured explicit assurances at the Agriculture Council in December that, if this was the case, any consequential measures would be based on principles already agreed and in particular that any such measures would be shared out fairly, taking account of the circumstances of certain categories of producers and of the most affected regions.  The Council also, at my specific request, asked the Commission to make full use of its statutory powers to ensure stability on internal markets adversely affected by commitments made within the GATT.</P>
    <P>While the GATT outcome is therefore much more positive than might have been the case, this is not to say that it will not present challenges for the agriculture sector.  It will be necessary for the sector to become more market-led and competitive and this is an approach I have been advocating for some years.  Based on results to date I am confident that the industry will meet the coming challenges.</P>
    <P>The Government for its part will continue to provide every support to the industry.  In this context, legislation is currently being drawn up to establish the new agency which will be known as An Bord Bia.  The task of the board will be to promote, develop and assist the marketing of Irish food products.  The establishment of the new body is but one part of a five year programme which has been drawn up for the further development of the food industry, including improvement of competitiveness.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance is a pilot scheme which I introduced in September last to help the creation of new job opportunities and to encourage unemployed people on the live register and lone parents to return to the active labour force.  Even though the scheme has only been in operation for a short period, 1,500 new jobs have already been approved and over 1,000 people are receiving an allowance at an average weekly rate of £80.  More than three-quarters of the people receiving the allowance are engaged in self-employment <Col N="1451" /> in a wide and diverse range of projects.</P>
      <P>The present conditions of the scheme do not permit the payment of the allowance in the form of a lump sum to recipients.  However since the scheme is a pilot scheme it will be subject to a detailed review and evaluation after 12 months to assess its effectiveness in meeting its objectives.  The issue of payment of the entire allowance, or part of the allowance, in the form of a lump sum will be considered in the context of this evaluation.</P>
      <P>At present unemployed people who apply for the allowance and who wish to engage in self-employment projects have their applications assessed by locally based job facilitators.  As part of this assessment job facilitators will, where possible, assist the application by directing them towards other agencies or organisations who might be of benefit to them in their project.  In this context the job facilitators would be aware of local and national sources of funding which might be available and suitable for the particular type of project being undertaken and the applicant would be directed towards these.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because its primary objective is to provide income support in the event of certain prescribed needs, the social welfare system does not usually facilitate weekly payment under two separate schemes simultaneously.  Given their special circumstances, an exception was traditionally made in the case of <Col N="1452" /> recipients of widow's contributory pension, lone parent's allowance and other similar payments.  Prior to 1988, in certain circumstances and subject to the usual qualifying conditions, widows could qualify for unemployment benefit or unrestricted disability benefit in addition to their pension or allowance. Benefit in such cases was paid at half of the present rate of unemployment benefit or disability benefit.</P>
      <P>Given the need to direct scarce resources where need was greatest, the payment of additional half-rate disability benefit for widows and other lone parents was discontinued, for new claimants only, from January 1988.  Anyone who was in receipt of disability benefit at that time did not lose their entitlement and continued to qualify for half-rate disability benefit provided that they continued to be medically unfit for work. Following a review of this measure the half-rate payment was restored from April 1990 and is now paid for a maximum of 15 months in respect of new claimants after that date.  A person who has been paid disability benefit for the maximum period can requalify for a further 15 months on payment of a further 13 PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>The information on the number of recipients is not collected in the form requested by the Deputy.  However, there are currently some 1,500 lone parents and widows in receipt of half-rate, long term and short term payments.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme is intended to help households, who are dependent on long term social welfare or health board payments, with their heating costs.  An applicant for a fuel allowance must also satisfy a means-test to <Col N="1453" /> establish that he is unable to provide for his own heating needs.  One fuel allowence is payable per household.</P>
      <P>An applicant and his household who have a combined income, from any source including from an occupational pension, of more than £5 a week above the relevant contributory social welfare income will not qualify for a fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing the limit for additional income would have financial implications and could be considered only in a budgetary context.  The estimated cost of the scheme for 1994 is £39.5 million.</P>

      <P>The provision of a new closed prison for 150 adult male offenders, to be located at St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, County Roscommon, is an integral part of my comprehensive law and order package announced in December last.  The decision to locate the prison in Castlerea is in line with the Government's commitment to a decentralisation of State services and is also a measure of its commitment to the socio-economic development of the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending design of the new facility and consultations in regard to the categories of prisoners to be accommodated and the regime of the prison, it is not possible to indicate precisely the number of prison staff that will be required to operate it. However, the overall ratio of prison staff <Col N="1454" /> to offenders in the Prison Service is about one to one and it is expected that the staffing for the new prison will be within this ratio.  In addition to prison staff, jobs will, of course, be created for the duration of the major building works associated with the adaptation of the hospital for use as a prison.  Furthermore, arising from the influx of new permanent Prison Service staff to Castlerea, there will undoubtedly be generation of employment downstream in the local economy.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible at this early stage to give a precise indication of the cost of converting St. Patrick's Hospital into a prison facility, the preliminary estimates indicate that these would be of the same order as the cost of constructing an equivalent facility on a green field site.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 to 85, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attention has been drawn to a proposal for a US-backed boat building project <Col N="1456" /> based in Ireland, one possible location for which could be the privatelyowned Cork Dockyard Holdings Limited. I understand that Forbairt has had discussions with the Irish promoters of this project.  The nature of these discussions is, understandably, confidential at this stage.</P>
    <P>Cork Dockyard Holdings Limited has advised the Department that since the disposal of the yard by the State in 1991 ten jobs have been created and sustained. Additional casual employment on subcontract depends on the work available. Average casual employment has been 35 to 40 rising to a peak of 65.</P>
    <P>I am advised that total capital grants approved by IDA-Forbairt for Cork Dockyard Holdings Limited since disposal by the State amount to £210,000 of which £171,605 has been paid.  The grants relate to refurbishment of the yard and the purchase of new equipment.  No training or other IDA-Forbairt grants have been paid.  The grants are linked to normal IDA-Forbairt capital grant conditions and include a target of 59 jobs, including full-time equivalents of casual labour.</P>
    <P>I understand that the agreement for sale of the Verolme Cork Dockyard Limited to Cork Dockyard Holdings Limited included an anti-asset stripping clause. The Minister for Finance and ICC Bank hold responsibility for the contract of sale.</P>

    <P>Because of accounting mechanisms it is not possible to readily separate the exact expenditure on bovine TB.  The bulk of brucellosis testing is carried out in conjunction with TB testing and is estimated to cost annually some one sixth of the combined expenditure.</P>
    <P>The level of reactors is indicating a reduction in the incidence level of bovine TB; the 1993 APT, reactors per thousand tests, was 2.9 compared with APT levels of 3.3 and 4.4 in 1992 and 1991 respectively.</P>
    <P>While the common sources of transmission of the disease are recognised, considerable research into other sources including the role of wildlife is being carried out.  Research is also being carried out into new diagnostic methods.</P>

      <P>I am of course concerned that rights of way are protected and that public access to rural areas is facilitated.  Under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme, REPS, there will be provision for extra payments on top of the basic premium for farmers who undertake additional environmentally friendly activities including allowing public access to their land for leisure activities.  It is expected that this measure will assist farmers with agri-tourism projects in scenic areas.  Detailed guidelines on REPS will be available shortly.</P>

An agreement subject to contract, reached with the landowners, <Col N="1463" /> provides for the purchase of the property by Wicklow County Council.  This means that some 2,000 mature trees in the wood, including over 1,800 oak trees, will not now be commercially felled.  Instead, the wood will be preserved and managed as an amenity which will be of benefit to the people of Wicklow and further afield.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  In the case of Fore national school there were 60 pupils enrolled on 30 September, 1992, which warrants a staff of principal; plus one assistant for the 1993-94 school year.</P>
      <P>There were 57 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September, 1993, which warrants a staff of principal plus one assistant for the 1994-95 school year.

    <P>The only exceptions that can be made <Col N="1467" /> from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware I have secured substantial increases in the capitation grant for primary schools over the last two years.  The standard rate of capitation grant has increased from a level of £28 in 1992 to £33 in 1993 and £38 in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme receive extra financial assistance, in addition to concessionary <Col N="1470" /> ex-quota teaching posts.  The level of this extra assistance currently stands at £17 per pupil.</P>
    <P>It is not a pre-requisite of the disadvantaged areas scheme that the community should match the additional grant paid with an additional local contribution. However this does not rule out the possibility of additional local contributions being made where communities are in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to abolish the local contribution at primary level.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of my policy of targeting additional resources at schools serving children from disadvantaged areas, a sum of £250,000 was made available in 1993 to alleviate the burden on certain primary schools in disadvantaged areas that were experiencing financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>A standard rate of £150 per capita grant is payable in respect of recognised pupils in secondary schools.  The system of capitation grants does not apply to vocational, community or comprehensive schools which are financed by a system of budgets.</P>
    <P>For 1994, I am pleased to state that an increase of £2.768 million has been provided in the provision for the general running costs of secondary schools with effect from 1 January, 1994.  The disbursement of these additional funds is under consideration and I will be making an announcement shortly.  There is no requirement for a local contribution for post-primary schools.</P>

      <P>My Department's policy is to make maximum use of existing school accommodation for the purposes in question. Where such suitable accommodation is not available vocational education committees acquire accommodation through renting and other arrangements.</P>
      <P>My Department does not provide funding for purpose-built buildings for adult education or literacy education programmes and is not aware of the existence of such.</P>
      <P>The question of accommodation for this area of education is under ongoing review and any necessary steps will be taken within available resources.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to the deployment of all the 200 teacher posts in question to facilitate the provision of additional supports for children with special educational needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> The selection of teachers and their assignment to these posts may be delayed for a variety of reasons.  In the case of the additional three visiting teachers for Traveller children, it was necessary to identify the areas to which the posts should be assigned on a priority basis before any appointments could be made. That process has been completed and the appointments are now being offered to selected teachers.</P>
    <P>In the case of the posts for pre-school projects, it was necessary to undertake detailed planning, including an examination of whether the projects should be linked into a broad integrated programme of measures for areas of particular disadvantage.  I expect that this process will be completed shortly and that the pre-school projects will commence operation in the near future.</P>
    <P>The breakdown by county of the distribution of the posts referred to by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
