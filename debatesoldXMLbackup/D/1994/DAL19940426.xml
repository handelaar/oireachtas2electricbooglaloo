      <Quest>the response, if any, he has received from politicians in Northern Ireland to his recent speech to the Ógra Fianna Fáil conference in which he said that he would be prepared to guarantee 30 per cent of places in an all-Ireland Government for representatives from Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>A key aspect of the Joint Declaration is that it is entirely legitimate to pursue the goal of a united Ireland.  This must be sought by democratic political means only and paragraph seven makes clear that Irish unity would be achieved only by those who favour this outcome persuading those who do not, peacefully and without coercion or violence.</P>
      <P>In my address to the Ógra Fianna Fáil annual conference on 16 April, I acknowledged that, realistically, a united Ireland by agreement is a long term goal, but it is also a reality that the ideal of Irish unity in the right conditions is a cherished aspiration which is dearly held by a great many people, North and South.  I therefore do not accept that it is inappropriate or that it is illegitimate even to discuss and debate this prospect or to present unity in an attractive form. It is contradictory and illogical to claim on the one hand to support the Joint Declaration and on the other hand to condemn any discussion of Irish unity. That type of attitude, which seeks to deter any democratic discussion of unity, only serves to perpetuate violence.</P>
      <P>The underlying point of my speech was that in any future form of Government, the notion that a majority can simply override minorities in either Northern Ireland or in an all-Ireland situation has to be discarded.  That clear message was directed to the communities in the North and the people in the Republic.  Simple majoritarianism amounts to coercion and is contrary to the spirit and principles of the Joint Declaration.  An accommodation is what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of what Unionists could expect in a new agreed Ireland has been raised with me on many occasions by moderate Unionists from the North. Would their worst fears be realised?  In the course of a lengthy speech, which covered many other topics, I put forward the idea that, in the event of future unity, the two communities could expect their <Col N="1691" /> fair share of places in an enlarged Government, and throughout the public sector, for as long as was necessary and in accordance with systems that have been developed on parts of the European Continent and elsewhere.  There could also be, if desired, as part of that framework a regional responsibility-sharing Government. Even under a more limited settlement, a regional administration could be one important element alongside North-South institutions in replacing violence by providing a return to real politics in the North.  Central to the ideas which I put forward was that in determining a new agreed Ireland the principles of agreement and consent must apply.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I never expected the idea to be warmly embraced by Unionist politicians in the short term.  Nevertheless, most of the comments from the Ulster Unionist Party have been moderate and measured.  The Reverend Martin Smyth, for instance, recognised that there is greater openness and generosity in the idea, but said of course that the plan denied the essence of Unionism.  Eddie McGrady of the SDLP said that the speech contained elements which could embody the aspirations of both communities and become a catalyst in future discussions.  The Sinn Féin president welcomed the principle of a national partnership government, having already accepted that Unionists should not be coerced into a united Ireland and that their agreement should be sought through a process of democratic persuasion only.  A central point in my speech was that, together with the Joint Declaration, this acceptance removes any remaining perceived justification for continued armed struggle.  In this regard, I wholeheartedly support Cardinal Cahal Daly's weekend statement when he said: &ldquo;Politically, the continuance of IRA violence is merely confusing the real issues and obscuring the real problems of the present and the future of this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it important to repeat here again the underlying theme of my Ógra Fianna Fáil speech.  An eventual political settlement must be achieved by agreement <Col N="1692" /> and consent.  To ensure its acceptance and durability, the system of government which is ultimately agreed must provide rock-solid guarantees for the rights, identities and aspirations of both traditions.  In my speech, I set out one possible way in which these fundamental principles would apply in the event of a united Ireland being agreed at some date in the future.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding some reservations expressed by other politicians and in parts of the media, Deputies should take careful note that I am not aware of any reaction which described any element of my speech as manifestly unfair to either tradition.  I therefore believe that it deserves over a period of time full and careful deliberation by all who seek a new agreed way of life in an environment of peaceful co-existence for the people of this island.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that on one occasion moderate Unionists raised with him the question of what might be on offer in the context of a united Ireland?  Does he accept, in the unlikely event of a united Ireland being agreed, that the make up of a Cabinet would be a matter for negotiation?  Does he also accept that the escalation in violence during the weekend indicates that Sinn Féin is not going to accept the Downing Street Declaration and that we need to move ahead without waiting any longer for a response from Sinn Féin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is yes.  In the event of a united Ireland being agreed, the two communities could expect their fair share of Cabinet positions and positions in the public service.  This would be the subject of talks and negotiations.  I deplore the continuance of violence and hope that we will not see a return to the tit for tat violence which we have seen in the past. I mentioned last week that Loyalists were responsible for eight of the 11 deaths this year.  Since then we have seen a return to barbaric violence on the part of the Provisional IRA.  There is no justification for a return to tit for tat violence; there <Col N="1693" /> is a clear way ahead to deal with the problems.  Many of the reasons for violence have been answered in the Joint Declaration.  Both Governments are working strongly behind the scenes to resolve the remaining problems in a peaceful democratic way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of what has happened since his speech to Ógra Fianna Fáil, will the Taoiseach accept that there was a certain air of unreality, even day-dreaming, about that speech and that what is necessary now is to get back to the current realities?  Will he agree there is a need for the Dáil to send a message to the lord high executioners of the IRA that peace will not come out of the barrel of a gun, that they are speaking for nobody except themselves, that they are now hiding behind a smokescreen of violence and killing for blood lust?  Will the Taoiseach further agree that the way forward is to try to accelerate the political process, that in that context what is needed is to inject a sense of urgency into the discussions between the two Governments so that the framework agreement mentioned in the past and, again, in the communiqué to the conference yesterday can be ready quickly? In that context can he give any idea when that framework agreement between the two Governments will be completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of some people, there is always an air of unreality when looking at the problems of Northern Ireland.  We have continuously sent a very clear message from this House, supported by all parties that, in the words of the Downing Street Joint Declaration, Irish people &mdash; 97 per cent of whom agree with the declaration&mdash; have determined how they want to see it work in future and how they want the agreement approached, that is, by consent and by working it out.  That is what the Irish people &mdash; and the Dáil &mdash; want and we continuously send that message. I do not accept that there is any slackening of the efforts of both Governments in trying to work out a framework for a resumption of the talks.  There was a long <Col N="1694" /> Anglo-Irish Conference yesterday in Belfast at which that topic was discussed for a considerable period.  Both Governments approach this as a matter of urgency because we do not want to see another life taken as a result of the problems in Northern Ireland.  I have said often enough that there will be no military victory on either side.  Consequently, the continuance of violence is the road to nowhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that one of the major arguments within the republican movement against accepting the declaration is that the Brits, as they would put it, are about to withdraw and all that is required is one last push by them to push them out?  Will he also agree that his speech outlining the framework for a united Ireland simply lends credence to that view among the republican movement and that in that respect his speech was unhelpful in bringing about peace on this island?  In that regard also, given the Taoiseach's reply today that he understands that Sinn Féin said it does not accept that Unionists should be coerced into a united Ireland, why does he think Sinn Féin and the IRA murdered a policeman last week, two Protestant working men the other night, another man last night and mutilated 16 others?  If they believe it is not possible or legitimate to coerce people into a united Ireland, why does the Taoiseach think they are continuing to bomb, murder and maim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only people who can answer those questions are the Provisional IRA.  I do not speak for them and I do not have the inside track on them any more than the Deputy does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To say that my speech contributes to their campaign is a gross insult to the intelligence of people in both communities <Col N="1695" /> in the North and of the large majority of people in the South.  If the Deputy had been speaking to Loyalists and moderate Unionists, as I have been doing for quite some time, he would appreciate that they describe themselves as a community under siege and uncertain of their future.  That is what they say to me, and they have said it to others.  I have responded openly to every possible angle put to me in relation to the problems in Northern Ireland and I reject Deputy De Rossa's assertion that my speech in any way had the effect he says it had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it fair that the suspension of section 31 is being used by Sinn Féin to pick and choose the times when they appear on radio?  For example, they are allowed to appear to talk about community problems in Crossmaglen arising from the British Army presence there and allowed to choose not to appear as Sinn Féin to explain their support for atrocities such as those in Garvagh, County Derry.  Does the Taoiseach consider that this manipulation of our airwaves and the generosity of the Government in regard to section 31, to put it at its kindest, is fair to the majority of us who do not support violence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is fully aware that I have no function in regard to who appears on radio or television at any given time on any given subject. Consequently, I have no more to say about that.  However, since the non-renewal of section 31, support for Sinn Féin as a political party has decreased, if we are to take the results of recent opinion polls as a guide.  Therefore, all the arguments that there would be a huge uplift in support for Sinn Féin as a result of not renewing section 31 have proved groundless.  My own observation is that they are finding it very difficult, in some of the interviews I heard, to justify some of the things they are doing at the <Col N="1696" /> moment and that is the way the people are beginning to see it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the problem with his Malahide speech to Ógra Fianna Fáil was that, like somebody with long sight, he was able to be a very clear on the detail of something which he now concedes to this House is a long way off, but has signally failed to point out what, in the short run and in the proximate future, is the path to reconciliation in Northern Ireland?  Will the Taoiseach not agree it would be appropriate to spell out in detail what will happen in two, three or four years if he can get the moderate people of Northern Ireland to work together, and what kind of institutions he sees in Northern Ireland to bring that about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject Deputy McDowell's assertion that I was trying to set it in the short to medium-term.  I certainly was not.  If he studied my speech he would see exactly where it was set. It contained a message that had to be delivered not alone to both communities in the North but to many people in the South.  If the Deputy saw no purpose in that, he is entitled to his view.  I saw a purpose in it and I stand over the usefulness of having delivered that message. Unionists themselves would bear that out.  From <i>The Guardian</i> editorial, it is clear that they understood the message and it is amazing that Deputy McDowell does not understand why it was said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Michael McGimpsey who sat on the same platform and said he could not follow what the Taoiseach was up to?  He is a moderate Unionist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  Doctor Martin Smyth said it was very generous.  If Deputy McDowell goes further out, that is his prerogative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of an internal settlement in Northern Ireland, at which Deputy McDowell is pointing his finger, I have said time and again in this House <Col N="1697" /> that an internal settlement on its own will not work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about an internal settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked about internal institutions in the North. I cannot, therefore, understand what he is pointing at if not at an internal settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there not be internal institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said clearly that part of the solution can be a responsibility-sharing Government with strong institutional links between North and South. That is the type of idea being processed between the two Governments in our joint attempt to set out a framework on which the talks process can resume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like more information on the question of the discussions between the two Governments because that is the way forward and the sooner we have an agreed framework the sooner the political process will again get under way.  I get the impression that the Irish Government is wholeheartedly behind a framework being produced quickly, but is the UK Government contributing wholeheartedly to the process? Is there similar enthusiasm on the part of the UK Government for an agreed framework in the near future?  Can the Taoiseach give us an idea as to when we might have such a framework?  Are we talking about months or years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly hope we are not talking about years.  I hope that within a number of months the general framework will be provided.  I assure the Deputy that both Governments are working behind the scenes to provide the framework as soon as possible.  Some may believe that nothing is happening on the political front, but plenty is happening on that front between the two Governments in an effort to move the process forward.  As I stated on a number <Col N="1698" /> of occasions here, both Governments have agreed that the Downing Street Declaration is the new starting point.  A cessation of violence would certainly be helpful, but we will continue our work in this regard.  There is no question of the paramilitaries deciding the agenda for the two sovereign Governments.</P>

Is the Taoiseach aware that the Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party advised him to come down to earth and face reality?  The Leader of the DUP described his speech as a disgrace, the Leader of the Alliance Party said it could not be taken seriously and Michael McGimpsey, who attended the Ógra Fianna Fáil conference, said it was half baked.</P>

I have been meeting Unionists for a quarter of a century and I have a good idea how they think.  The way in which Deputy De Rossa is trying to portray them here is far removed from the genuine constructive Unionist person who has made a great contribution to many aspects of life in the North.  I genuinely believe Unionists could make a tremendous contribution to the overall development of the island of Ireland if there was a cessation of violence.  I reject what the Deputy said.</P>

      <P>In relation to the position which the Taoiseach envisages, how does he propose to distribute 30 per cent of the seats in the Cabinet between the two traditions in Northern Ireland? Would people have to vote in favour of one tradition or would the quota be distributed to all parties who obtain a minimum number of seats in a Northern assembly or among the Northern seats in an all-Ireland body?  How would the 30 per cent quota apply to positions in the public service?  Would it apply to all Civil Service Departments and State bodies or merely at board level?  In regard to the scenario which the Taoiseach envisages, namely, a long term position of a United Ireland, can I take it that any settlement would have to respect the rights, identities and aspirations of all?  If so, what arrangements does he propose to recognise the British identity and the aspiration to unity with Britain of a minority on the island who are currently a majority in Northern Ireland in the final settlement he envisages?  How would such a British aspiration of a certain section of the community be recognised?</P>

      <P>I answered the question in relation to the identity of the Unionists here last week, dual citizenship will continue.  I stated time and time again that the rights and identities of both communities and traditions must be accommodated in any overall settlement. Anything that falls short of that will not work and will not be durable.  In the first instance, the 30 per cent representation in the Government will be a matter for the Irish people to decide by referendum, <Col N="1701" /> it is a constitutional matter as the number of Cabinet seats is laid down in the Constitution. At the end of the day, it would be part of an overall constitutional settlement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the estimated financial liability incurred by his Department in reaching agreement with the 1,800 women before the matter went to the High Court?  As that settlement was subject to a confidentiality clause, does he agree it is unfair on those women and their solicitors to impose such a veil of secrecy?  How can he justify imposing such a clause when he and his Department are accountable to this House and to the Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>

Will he indicate how many cases are currently listed for court, apart from those settled?  If none is listed why is he treating the matter as if it were <i>sub judice</i>?  Why does he continue to insist on putting thousands of women to the expense of engaging solicitors to claim what a European Court decided is their right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained those matters on numerous occasions.  These and other court proceedings arise because of a failure to implement the necessary measures to give effect to Directive 79/7 by the required deadline of December 1984. Arising from that delay a number of court proceedings were initiated in some cases as far back as 1985.  In three instances the Irish courts made references to the European Court of Justice.  In the light of clarification of the legal issues provided by the European Court, the Government introduced retrospective legislation in 1992 which provided for equal treatment during the period of delay.  That legislation was provided for by way of statutory instrument under the European Communities Act, 1972 which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in June 1992.  Retrospective legislation made good the default arising from the delay in implementing the directive. Subject to certain provisions designed to avoid double payments, the measures brought into force in 1992 entitled married women to payments they would otherwise have received if the directive had been implemented in December 1984.  Those provisions address the problem arising from the delay in a fair, reasonable and equitable manner.  All the entitlements due under retrospective legislation were paid to more than 70,000 women by the end of last year.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare agreed a settlement in three cases before the courts recently involving 1,800 married women who had initiated legal proceedings in relation to the delay beyond the 1984 deadline for implementing the EC Directive on Equal Treatment.  The women involved in those cases initiated court proceedings before the Government introduced implementing measures in 1992 which provided for equal treatment covering the period of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I stated in an Adjournment debate and during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill that my Department proposes to continue the process of reaching settlements in cases in which proceedings were initiated prior to the <Col N="1707" /> introduction of retrospective legislation in 1992.  The legal entitlements provided for in that legislation have been paid in full.  Since the introduction of the legislation proceedings have been initiated in about 80 further cases involving some 7,300 married women.  Those married women affected by the delay have been paid the amounts which they would otherwise have received if the directive had been implemented on time.  In some quarters there appears to be an expectation that those involved would have their entitlements in the period of delay determined on the basis of rules previously in force.  That was not the intention of the Oireachtas in enacting legislation to provide for equal treatment generally.  A number of these cases is still before the courts.</P>

      <P>The last time we discussed this matter on the Adjournment I fell foul of the Chair.  The Minister is again attempting to blind us with waffle.  This is a unique case.  Is the Minister confident he can regulate or legislate retrospectively to deny people, especially women, their rights?  Will the Minister give the cost to date of the settlements made and the estimated cost of the claims that are with the Department?  They are not before the courts and the Minister is attempting to side-step the issue.  No writs have been issued in this regard.</P>

      <P>Determining entitlements on the basis of the rules that previously applied would involve making payments in circumstances which cannot be justified by any reasonable criteria.

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to introduce alleviation measures to help persons whose family incomes have been reduced suddenly and substantially by the decisions to tax disability benefit and unemployment benefit payments coupled to the decision to reduce tax relief on mortgage interest.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Disability benefit has been reckonable as income for tax purposes since 6 April 1993.  In this year's budget, the Minister for Finance announced that unemployment benefit would become <Col N="1712" /> reckonable as income for tax purposes from 6 April 1994.  As a result people on the same level of income are now treated in the same way for tax purposes, irrespective of the source of that income.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, which came into effect on 6 April 1994, my Department will continue to pay unemployment benefit directly to the recipient without deduction of income tax.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners take account of unemployment benefit when dealing with claims to refunds of tax after a person becomes unemployed, when employment is resumed, or when reviewing the tax affairs of recipients or their spouses.  The extent to which a tax liability arises will depend on other income that recipients or their spouses receive in the same tax year.  This system is similar to the one in existence for payment of disability benefit since last year. A liability to tax only arises where there is income in addition to the benefit payment.</P>
      <P>In his statement on the publication of the Finance Bill the Minister for Finance announced that in recognition of the special circumstances of workers who on 5 April 1994 were participating in a systematic short-time working arrangement, such workers will be temporarily exempted from the new tax arrangements for the duration of their current unemployment benefit claim or to the end of the tax year, whichever is the earlier.</P>

Would he agree he is selectively implementing the recommendations in the report of the Commission of Social Welfare?  That report made many recommendations which the Minister has not implemented. Would the Minister accept that in some cases family income has been reduced by £30 to £50 per week and that this is a severe jolt to families on the breadline? Would the Minister consider an alleviation payment to these people?  May I ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is somewhat exaggerating the figures, but that is not my responsibility.  The taxation of disability benefit has been in operation for over a year and the taxation of unemployment benefit has been introduced recently.  In all of these cases, the basic payment is made to the beneficiary and taxation would arise where people have additional income over and above that. It is highly unlikely that it would arise otherwise.</P>

      <P>In regard to the question raised by the Deputy on the Commission on Social Welfare's recommendation regarding the taxation of these benefits, I want good, basic social welfare benefits and payments. Taxation applies in many ways; widows pension, old age pension, invalidity pension and others are taxable but one is not taxed unless one has additional income.  My philosophy has been to have good pensions in the first instance.  If the taxation, which applies to everybody, claws back some of the additional income, that is fair and equitable across the board.</P>

We have consistently increased the rates and we will continue to do so.  We have passed all the priority rates this year.  Many of the payments are now 95 and 96 per cent of the main rate which was proposed and we will exceed those rates.</P>

In the circumstances, the question of publishing details of projects that may be cancelled or reduced in my Department's area of responsibility does not arise.</P>
      <P>However, my Department will be closely involved in the implementation of the local development programme which is set out in chapter 7 of the plan and the Department is represented on a steering committee chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach in this regard.  This programme builds on the experience of, <i>inter alia,</i> the community development programme and will provide specific funds for community development activity which will complement and enhance the work undertaken in the community development programme.  The local development programme also provides for a range of programmes of work, education and training for the long term unemployed which build on initiatives undertaken in this regard over recent years and which will improve the range of opportunities available to long term unemployed people in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In so far as the publication of the Community Support Framework for the next round of Structural Funds is concerned, the position, as already indicated by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to the House, is that discussions are currently underway with the European Commission with a view to agreeing the Community Support Framework, which will set out the broad national and sectoral strategies for the use of EU Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>EC Directive 79/7 provided for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment <Col N="1717" /> between men and women in matters of social security.  This directive applies to schemes providing protection against sickness, invalidity, old age, accidents at work, occupational diseases and unemployment. The scope of the directive does not extend to survivor's benefits.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1994 provides for the introduction of a new survivor's pension which I propose to bring into force from October next.  This new scheme will entitle widowers to a contributory pension on the same terms and subject to the same contribution conditions as currently apply to widows. Over 9,000 widowers will benefit under the new arrangements which are being introduced at a cost of some £27 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new survivor's pension is a major achievement in the provision of equal treatment in the social insurance system following on progress already made in the area of social assistance payments.  I introduced a new social assistance allowance for widowers with dependent children in 1989 which was subsequently incorporated into the lone parent's allowance which I introduced in 1990.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department introduced a new personal social services card in 1992.  This card is a plastic card with an encoded magnetic stripe.  Over 400,000 people have already received their personal social services cards.  The social services <Col N="1718" /> card replaces the registration cards issued to people entering the social welfare system.  Those cards have been in use for a great many years.  The card will also in time replace the &ldquo;signing card&rdquo; currently in use at local offices of my Department.  The new social services card is part of my strategy of modernising the administration of social welfare services and providing better services for customers.</P>
      <P>The social services card is designed to full banking standards and is being used to provide speedier access to unemployment payments at post offices where the counter services have been modernised.</P>
      <P>It is also sometimes used by people cashing sickness benefit cheques in banks and shops.  Such incidental uses are an important indication of the need for a secure and durable card.</P>
      <P>The person's RSI number, date of birth and sex are magnetically encoded on the card.  Only the person's name and RSI number are actually visible on the front of the card.  The card will facilitate easier and quicker access, not alone to social welfare services but also to Revenue services.</P>
      <P>The Data Protection Act gives the individual the right to be supplied with details of any personal information on the social services card.</P>

Similar controls apply where we would have an exchange of information with the Revenue Commissioners. Anything we do concerning <Col N="1719" /> the card is covered by the legislation which I brought before the House last year.  If we wanted to extend it I would need to seek the approval of the House.</P>

Would the Minister consider having a five year cutoff period so that unnecessary information not required for the processing of a current claim would not be stored on the card?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The card is strictly a social services one and is made available to everyone for their voluntary use.  People find it useful and convenient.  It is not a universal identity system and is not intended as such.  People may use it in different circumstances and that is a matter for themselves.  The information is protected and would be covered in the legislation approved by the House.  We have electronic fund transfers and people with a card can get the payments they need.  Many of our offices are cashless and people can do business using their card if they wish.  If the use of the card were to be extended the matter would have to be fully discussed in the House. It is a social services card to be used to avail of services.</P>

Community welfare officers could feed into the system and it would be more efficient. We have reduced interim payments which in turn has reduced pressure on community welfare officers.  They have more time to do the work they were appointed to do.</P>

      <P>We are concerned about the privacy of the individual; that is the bottom line.  While the facility of this card is important in so far as it goes, Deputies on this side of the House are concerned about the extent of the information recorded and the ability of an individual to check it.  Will the Minister agree that a print out of the information <Col N="1721" /> stored on individuals who have cards should be issued to them once a year &mdash; or once every two years &mdash; so that they know precisely the information stored on them?  These cards have tended to evolve as identity cards in other countries where they have been introduced.  Because it is generally people in the lower income group who have these cards there is a tendency for certain elements in authority to misuse them.  I am not suggesting that is the case in Ireland, but it has tended to happen in other countries.  We need assurances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>People have a right to the information; if they want it they can have it.  This right is covered under the data protection legislation.  On the question of abuse, we are certainly anxious to guard against any misuse of the cards and we would pursue any cases of misuse brought to our attention.  At the outset there was pressure to provide the cards first to the unemployed, the people who could use them immediately and for whom they would be most convenient.  I resisted this pressure and opted to make the cards available across the board as a general services card.  We started with younger people, and more than 4,000 people now have cards.  It is intended that everyone should have a card eventually.  At present the cards give a person's RSI number, date of birth, which is encoded, their sex and name.</P>

I am surprised that this initiative has gone so far at this stage. In light of the fact that we cannot get information in the House about social welfare matters, the Minister should curtail any further development of this system until the freedom of information legislation has been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.

I am very anxious, and I am sure the Deputies will be very watchful, to ensure that there is no abuse in the system and that people do not become over enthusiastic about what they can do with these cards.  This is why I introduced the legislation last year, it was debated fully in the House at that stage and any further changes would also have to be debated in the House.  The Deputies can be assured that we will adopt a balanced approach to this matter, and they will be part of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of reviewing guidelines aimed at achieving equal treatment between women and men in the social welfare area was one of the recommendations in the second report of the Commission on the Status of Women. The report also recommended that the situation should be monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The context in which the Commission on the Status of Women considered this issue related to the questioning of female claimants for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit about child minding arrangements when similar questions were not put to male claimants. The position is that, following the issue of comprehensive guidelines to all local offices of the Department in July 1986, all claimants with family and childcare responsibilities are treated equally.  In determining whether claimants for unemployment payments are available for and genuinely seeking work, there is no discrimination between claimants, either directly or indirectly, on grounds of sex, family or marital status.  The existing guidelines form an integral part of the Department's training programme for staff involved in deciding claims.  In line with the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women, the anti-discrimination guidelines are kept under review and monitored on an ongoing basis at local office level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is all very well in theory and I accept that there is no discrimination at official level. However, will the Minister agree that lone parents, mainly women, face a major risk of falling into the poverty trap?  Access to childcare facilities is a major problem for women who command low wages.  How does the Minister propose to deal with the unofficial obstacles which are leading to a feminisation of the poverty problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>This was one of the first <Col N="1724" /> issues I was interested in addressing on my appointment as Minister of State.  The expert working group which I set up to examine the integration of our tax and social welfare systems, in its interim report, presented prior to the budget, dealt with poverty traps, specifically as they related to lone parents.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that specific provisions were included in the budget to increase the disregards for lone parents by a significant level.  In addition, the new community employment programme being implemented at present can be availed of by people in receipt of lone parent's allowance.  This measure was specifically designed to be of benefit to lone parents.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that lone parents are very much at risk of falling into the poverty trap.  The recent ESRI publication on poverty and policy in Ireland also makes this point.  This area is being specifically examined by the Department. In addition, a number of childcare initiatives are being undertaken by other Departments as part of the Programme for a Partnership Government.  This area is being given priority.  There will be a significant increase in the number of lone parents availing of part-time and other work as a consequence of the changes introduced in this year's budget.  In addition, I hope that, under the new community employment programme being implemented, lone parents will avail of the opportunities now afforded them to participate.</P>

      <P>Social welfare statistics for 1992 show there are in the region of 12,000 deserted wives and 35,000 lone parents here.  While agreeing that certain developments are taking place, how can the Minister of State reconcile them with the recent departmental initiative as a result of which the incomes of some lone parents have been cut by £50 per week because of the Department's insistence on seizing maintenance moneys awarded to deserted wives by the courts?  How can the Minister of State reconcile what she has said with the reality of life for deserted wives and their children who have experienced cuts of anything from <Col N="1725" /> £50, £60 and £70 per week because of the Department seizing maintenance payments under the 1992 regulations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was dealt with in detail by the Minister in a recent reply to the Deputy about the liable relatives regulations.  As all organisations dealing with social welfare matters have acknowledged, these greatly advantage the majority of lone parents who, as a consequence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Allen, I deal with large numbers of lone parents. Those regulations give lone parents a guarantee of maintenance if they wish to avail of an income payment from the Department of Social Welfare.  Some 11,000 lone parents are deserted wives. The number of people who will be placed at a disadvantage as a result of these regulations is very small &mdash; a figure of 50 out of a total of 11,000 was mentioned. The purpose of the regulations, which have been widely welcomed by organisations dealing with lone parents, was to give women in those circumstances a guaranteed income.  Unfortunately, in many cases where maintenance arrangements are made between husbands and wives in the unfortunate circumstance of a marriage breakdown, as I am sure the Deputy will be aware, the husband subsequently defaults; he may do so on a substantial number of occasions.  That regulation provides for a guaranteed income for the lone parent in those circumstances. This matter was dealt with in great detail by the Minister recently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle the provision on maintenance is a good one. Nevertheless there are, as the Minister said, at least 50 women &mdash; I suspect there are many more &mdash; who have been disadvantaged by these regulations.  Effectively, they suffered a loss of income, placing them again in a low income category. What steps will the Minister or Minister of State take to alleviate the <Col N="1726" /> sudden poverty into which these women have fallen resulting from the operation of these regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>All issues in relation to poverty and/or income traps are being examined by the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare and the issue of lone parents is of particular concern to them.  The purpose of the regulations is to enable people receive a guaranteed maintenance payment. The alternative may be that people will have to apply for court orders against defaulting spouses.  Under the new regulations they will have a guaranteed income from the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department will monitor the regulations closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious issue for many women.  Indeed the 50 mentioned by the Minister of State must be located in my constituency; I suspect the figure would be much greater.  Will the Minister introduce alleviation payments to overcome the awful hardship experienced by many deserted wives and their children?  Is she aware that some women who were receiving their maintenance payments weekly were issued with a demand from the Minister that unless they signed over their maintenance payments their deserted wife's benefit would be reduced accordingly?  Does the Minister realise that severe hardship is being caused to many such women?  I am not trying to make a political point out of this but rather asking the Minister, for humane reasons, to initiate an alleviation payment for those women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recent ESRI report on lone parents and also the study Teen Parenting in Ireland by the National Youth Federation.  The contents of these reports are being considered within my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to outline some of the ways in which my Department is encouraging lone parents to take up work, training and study opportunities.  A lone parent can take up employment and still qualify for the lone parent's allowance.  The rules in relation to the means test at present allow for a disregard of earnings amounting to £6 per week, increased by a further £6 per week for each dependent child. This year, to improve the position for lone parents who want to take up work the means test is being eased.  I am replacing the current earnings disregard of £6 for each child with a flat-rate disregard of £30 and, where earnings exceed the new disregards, the amount of lone parents <Col N="1728" /> allowance payable will be reduced by £1 for every £2 earned, instead of the £1 for £1 arrangements currently applied. These new arrangements will come into effect on 21 July next.</P>
    <P>Child-minding expenses arising from work are also disregarded when assessing means.</P>
    <P>Lone parents can also avail of the family income supplement scheme, subject to satisfying the qualifying criteria. The FIS scheme provides weekly cash support to families with children on low wages.</P>
    <P>We have also included lone parents in the back-to-work allowance scheme whereby they can receive 75 per cent of their weekly payment for 12 months while they take up work, and 50 per cent in the second year, and retain their extra benefits.</P>
    <P>From September of last year the Government extended the vocational training opportunities scheme to allow lone parents to participate while retaining all their benefits.  I have also extended the third-level education scheme to eligible lone parents and any higher education grants payable are disregarded in assessing means.  In addition, we have introduced a scheme of grants for projects to assist lone parents to return to second chance education or to the workforce. These represent positive measures in terms of affording lone parents who are seeking employment, a better opportunity of participating in the labour market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an impressive list of what the Minister is doing. While welcoming the steps taken thus far, why is there a distinction being drawn between one lone parent and another?  I refer specifically to the community employment programme under which unmarried mothers are being treated as lone parents but deserted wives in receipt of disability benefit are refused an opportunity to participate.  Would he agree that this is undermining his work to assist lone parents have a life outside of the home? Has he investigated the claim by the National Youth Federation in their <Col N="1729" /> report in March that some lone parents were being advised by housing authority officials to have more babies in order to qualify for housing?  Were those claims accurate and, if so, what steps are being taken to deal with them?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister taking up the suggestion in the National Youth Federation's report that there is a need for family centres and community child care workers to facilitate lone parents taking up training opportunities and working either in the community or outside it?</P>

I realise the need for such a development and it is something we will encourage in the areas in which we are involved.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that I previously spoke in the Dáil on the proposed introduction in the United Kingdom of an habitual residence test in assessing entitlement to Income Support, Housing and Council Tax Benefit during the Adjournment debate on 8 February.  I indicated then that I was very concerned at the implications for Irish citizens of this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally attach the greatest importance to the social welfare rights of our emigrants both in the country in which they work and on their return to Ireland. I am gravely concerned at any move which might erode the right of access <Col N="1732" /> currently held by our citizens to UK social protection.  Irish citizens are currently entitled to avail of British social services on a similar basis to British citizens; by the same token, British citizens here have full and equal access to our entitlements.  Introduction of an habitual residence test as proposed would place an onus on anyone claiming the payments listed above to show that they had or were intending to form close connections with the United Kingdom in such matters as family ties, long term employment and permanent residence before they would be entitled to these payments.  Clearly this would have the potential to affect the entitlement of many if not most of our first-time emigrants and, possibly, some longer term Irish residents of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Irish people emigrate to Britain in the main for the purpose of taking up employment or genuinely seeking work and cannot be regarded as benefit tourists. In general, they are entitled to levels of social protection in Ireland which are equal to &mdash; if not higher than &mdash; that currently available in Britain.  Therefore, there is no incentive for Irish people to engage in benefit tourism.  Irish people contribute to the British economy and to British society in general and because of the close and productive relationship between the two countries they assimilate well in Britain.  It was abundantly clear from comments by Members of the Oireachtas, media reports and representations I received from Irish welfare groups in Britain that the concerns I voiced on 8 February are widely shared.</P>
    <P>Arising from these concerns I raised the issue at two levels.  First, I raised the matter directly with my opposite number in the United Kingdom, Peter Lilley, MP, Secretary of State for Social Security. We met on 3 March when I stressed that the matter was of the greatest importance in Ireland and that it would be a grave blow to Irish citizens if the proposals were allowed to proceed as planned.  For his part the Secretary of State assured me that the new test was not intended to interfere with the traditional working arrangements and free movement <Col N="1733" /> of people between the two countries. We agreed that a high level group of officials would meet to develop a formula which would achieve the objective agreed by Secretary of State Lilley and myself, namely to ensure there is no negative impact on the traditional working arrangements and pattern of migration between the two countries.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department and the United Kingdom Department of Social Security met on a number of occasions in London to discuss the matter.  The Irish officials made a number of proposals, designed to achieve the objective agreed by the Secretary of State and me, which the UK side undertook to examine in consultation with their legal services.  The two sides have maintained contact since then.  The current position is that the British Department of Social Security are continuing, in consultation with their Attorney General's office, to study the means by which this can be achieved.</P>
    <P>On the basis of this agreement I am hopeful that the concerns shared by all can be allayed and that Irish people can continue to avail of British social protection while working or seeking work there.</P>
    <P>The proposed test raises a number of complex legal issues concerning free movement of workers and their access to social protection.  As these issues are within the competence of the European Union, in addition to raising the matter bilaterally with my opposite number in the United Kingdom, I asked the European Commission to investigate the proposals and, in particular, to examine their compatibility with the European Union Treaty and legislation in the freedom of movement of workers and their entitlement to social protection.  The Commission is continuing its inquiries.</P>
    <P>I should add that, when in London for my meeting with Secretary of State Mr. Lilley on 3 March, I met representatives of a number of British based Irish groups. I have since then sought to keep them informed of developments, as I have done with Irish based emigrant liaison groups.  In turn I have been kept aware of the energetic campaign being waged <Col N="1734" /> by these groups within Britain on this issue.  I am sure all Members will join me in expressing our gratitude to such groups for their remarkable and wholly commendable solidarity with their fellow citizens on this issue.  I reassure the House that every effort is being made and will continue to be made to protect the traditional rights enjoyed by our citizens who migrate to the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>Other Opposition Deputies and I raised this matter prior to the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1994.  I admire the Minister's diligence in dealing with the British Government on a clearly anti-Irish regulation.  In that context, is he satisfied that the traditional rights of third level students who seek work in the United Kingdom &mdash; because of the abolition of unemployment assistance &mdash; will be protected?  The imposition of this regulation will affect Irish people in the main.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare system does not discriminate against families based on marriage.  Indeed, any such discrimination <Col N="1735" /> would be in conflict with the constitutional guarantee to protect the family and the institution of marriage.</P>
      <P>The social welfare system is family orientated as illustrated by the fact that the weekly rates of payments under the social welfare code vary with family size with higher payments for larger families. The particular needs of different types of families are recognised and catered for in the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Social Welfare, I have introduced various measures designed to meet the particular needs of different family units.  These include the lone parent's allowance which I introduced in 1990 and more recently the new survivor's pension provided for in this year's Social Welfare Act.</P>
      <P>Over successive budgets, we made many improvements which benefited families.  Between 1987 and 1994 families on long term unemployment assistance with three children received an increase in payment of 49 per cent in nominal terms, or 23 per cent in real terms.  The weekly income thresholds for eligibility for family income supplement have been continually increased, most recently by £10 in this year's budget.  At a cost of £3.3 million in a full year, this year's improvement will give an additional £6 a week to 9,600 families.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is paid to all families with children, regardless of income or labour force status.  Since coming into office, this Government has made substantial improvements in child benefit at an extra cost of £61.5 million in a full year.  The rate for each of the first three children is now £20 a month and £23 for the fourth and subsequent children.  From September this goes up to £25 for the third and subsequent children benefiting over 270,000 children.</P>
      <P>I will continue to keep the system under review, and to improve the situation of families in the social welfare system as resources permit.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will know that this is one of the issues highlighted in the Programme for Government.</P>

      <P>The income of a woman in receipt of the unmarried mother's allowance with a boyfriend on the dole in receipt of social welfare payments exceeds the social welfare payments to a married couple with one child.  Will the Minister agree this is discrimination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand it correctly, the Deputy is referring to a woman in receipt of the unmarried mothers allowance cohabitating with someone on the dole, but obviously that is in breach of the legislation which supports families and cannot be blamed.  If such a couple are found to be cohabitating, they will not receive certain payments.  That is one of the problems in the system but it applies in other cases.  I do not think this takes from the work of the Department or the Government's strong support for a basic income for families of which there is factual evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clohessy dealt with one aspect of discrimination against families.  Will the Minister not accept that young unemployed people living at home are seriously discriminated against when they apply for unemployment assistance?  If parents have a certain income young people do not receive unemployment assistance, but if they leave home to live in a flat or caravan they are entitled to social welfare.  This will cost the State a great deal more money than if they were paid social welfare while living at home.  I have argued before that this is serious discrimination against the family and it could be corrected by giving the unemployed person living at home a portion, perhaps three-quarters or one-half of the allowance, thus avoiding the need to leave home to qualify for benefit.</P>

      <P>A study was done in the Dublin area specifically which showed that 32 per cent of applicants had moved to Dublin from the provinces in search of employment; 19 per cent were considered to be cohabiting and 5 per cent had moved out of home because of family disputes.  It was considered unlikely that any of these applicants which account for 56 per cent of the total would have remained in the family home if the social welfare provisions regarding benefit and privilege were different.  A large proportion of the remainder had broken the link with the family home some years before.  I am conscious of the difficulty in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 18 to 20, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Where it is proposed to make orders and regulations under this Act a draft of the orders and regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the orders and regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all the amendments I have tabled, I have endeavoured to ensure that as much power as possible is devolved to local authorities and the Minister is removed, as far as possible, from dealing with matters that can well be dealt with by local authorities themselves; and where the Minister does retain minimal powers to make orders and regulations, that such orders and regulations will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas for confirmation.  Far too much legislation is passed in this House where the Minister retains power to make regulations by placing an order before the House which can be annulled within 21 days.  In reality Members on the Opposition benches never get an opportunity to debate such regulations or orders, and that is not healthy.  What I am proposing should be in all legislation, but particularly in legislation <Col N="1813" /> relating to local government. There has been much talk both on the Government and Opposition benches about the need to devolve power to the local authorities.  I fully support that concept. Which will allow local representatives to be more answerable to the people that elect them.  I do not see a role for central Government in local government except in exceptional circumstances. If that concept were accepted by the Minister and the Government, the number of orders we would have to deal with in this House would be very small.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment in the spirit in which it is tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Barrett's amendment.  I have a somewhat similar amendment on section 18 seeking that the regulations it is proposed to make be subject to the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Increasingly we are seeing in this House a tendency towards using primary legislation simply as a means of enabling the Minister, in whatever Department, to make and issue regulations as absolute writ.  This practice has been adopted quite widely by the present Minister. During the week he made an announcement at a press conference, where most announcements are made these days, about extensive new planning regulations. I happen to agree with many of the planning regulations the Minister announced.  However, it is wrong that, effectively, the Minister should be allowed to announce regulations at press conferences without their being subject to examination here.  Under the planning regulations the provision permitting up to four bedrooms in a house to be used for bed and breakfast purposes should have been teased out here or in special committee.  In principle, it is regrettable that the Minister is taking this course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to anticipate the debate on section 18, but I want to draw attention to what Deputy Barrett's amendment would address.  Section 18 allows the Minister to change the boundaries of towns and, in subsection (2), to change <Col N="1814" /> the boundaries of counties.  Subsection (2) states that where the extension of a town boundary overlaps a county boundary, effectively the Minister can change the county boundary.  That should not be permitted without debate in this House. I support Deputy Barrett's amendment which proposes to require all orders and regulations to be brought before the House.  I have tabled a separate amendment.</P>

As the Deputy is well aware, the only circumstance in which those powers are exercised is when there is agreement at local level.  In regard to the planning regulations, he more than anybody &mdash; because he was a front bench spokesman during the debate on the planning Bill &mdash; knows that I made a number of statements in this House about my desire to consolidate the planning regulations and to take account of the various opinions expressed in regard to transparency.  I took advice from all sides and I am glad the Deputy welcomes generally all those provisions.</P>

      <P>Amendments such as that tabled by Deputy Barrett are put down regularly and I am sure most Members are aware of the position.  If we accept these amendments and the Bill is passed by both Houses, what will be the result?  Both the Dáil and the Seanad are likely to have before them next week orders to implement provisions of the Act.  A few days later each House will <Col N="1815" /> have before it regulations to give effect to the town boundary alterations and then an order to fix the polling date for the June elections.  This amendment would require in every instance the approval of both Houses to a draft of the order or the regulations concerned.  It would only then be possible for the order or regulations to be made by the Minister. One obvious effect would be that the making of the necessary orders and regulations would be so protracted and time consuming that elections could not be held in June this year, given the statutory time limits for notice of poll, nominations and so on, which apply in the lead-in to local elections.  Such a lead-in process requires that the relevant provisions of this Bill are implemented immediately on enactment if the elections are to take place in June.  That is required by law.  On foot of this amendment, similar procedures would apply in the case of the implementation of all other provisions of this Bill as they are brought into operation on a phased basis. In every case the matter would have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and I am sure Deputy Barrett and others realise the sheer impossibility of such an arrangement.</P>
      <P>All regulations under this Bill must be laid before both Houses and are subject to annulment by resolution of either House.  In a number of specific cases, regulations must be approved in draft by resolutions of each House before they can be made.  There is no question, therefore, of a <i>carte blanche</i> in the use of regulatory powers.  Provision for the making of regulations is common throughout the local government code. The regulatory provisions in the Bill follow well established precedent.  We cannot simply dispense with subordinate legislation and deal with every minute detail in this House.  Last year more than 400 statutory instruments were made. The Oireachtas could not function and would be swamped if it were to become involved with a legislative volume of such a scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of regulations and the <Col N="1816" /> procedures to apply to them has been debated at considerable length in this House, most recently during the passage of the Local Government (Dublin) Bill. During the debate on that Bill I listened carefully to the points made by Opposition speakers and they heard me explain why it is necessary to include provisions for regulations.  I still hold the view that the position in regard to this Bill is not any different.  Regulations with the usual annulment procedure are a necessary part of the legislative framework and will remain so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  This is 1994 and the last local elections were held in June 1991.  At that stage the Government, of which the Minister was a member, decided that the town elections would be postponed pending reorganisation of local government at that level.  It was not the fault of an Opposition party or Deputy that this did not happen.  Three years later we have legislation before us which proposes to set up a commission to do work that was supposed to have been done in the past three years.  The Opposition did not hold up this legislation. This is 26 April.  The Bill was introduced and passed Second Stage in the Dáil last week and we are asked to pass all remaining Stages of it this week. It is unacceptable for the Minister to say that we would delay the holding of elections in June and that we are the bad guys in seeking this reasonable control of Government regulations.  As long as Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann allow this to continue Ministers will have an easy way out.  When they want to get a difficult decision through they can produce legislation stating they will retain power to make orders and regulations and, in effect, the Dáil or Seanad do not have a say.  The procedure of laying an order before both Houses and allowing 21 days to annul it is a joke because neither the Dáil nor the Seanad gets an opportunity to do so due to time constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to holding the local elections in June, if the Minister wishes to introduce the orders next week we will cooperate <Col N="1817" /> in debating them.  I am sure both issues to which he referred would pass through both Houses in approximately half an hour.  It is the principle behind the amendment I support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the points made by Deputy Molloy.  The regulations governing the conduct of local elections must be confirmed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  An order specifying a local election year must be confirmed by resolution of both Houses. The list of orders is extensive and I do not wish to delay the House unnecessarily by reading them out.  Those are the types of orders about which we are talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the arguments made by Deputy Barrett about the delay in introducing this Bill.  The Minister's argument that debating the proposed regulations will delay elections and cause disruption is an example of the disparaging way central Government has treated the local government system for the past 20 years or more.  Local elections have been postponed to give the Government an opportunity to put forward reform proposals.  It is not good enough that the Minister delayed until now the introduction of this Bill dealing with local elections to be held in early June.  This is a last minute rush to put the regulations in place.  There is no genuine excuse for this delay apart from political reasons.  It is disturbing that so many central Government politics are coming into play in determining our local government system.  There has been a huge reluctance by parties in Government to bring about meaningful change in the local government system.  When other parties were in office boundaries were changed in March or April before the elections in June of that year.  Criticism of that attitude must be aired because the local government system does not have the power to alter its functions to give it the role in the community desired by the people.  They want a meaningful and effective Authority which can respond to their needs but they cannot create one because they can only operate under legislation sponsored <Col N="1818" /> by the Government.  The sad history of local government highlights that changes have been made reluctantly and at the last moment by an attempt to take political advantage through delaying the process so that there can be no proper debate because the legislation has to be rushed through and regulations implemented.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Barrett's points.  If we are to have a proper local government system there must be transparency in changes and the House must have an opportunity to approve them.  The power vested in the Minister has not been used for the purpose of advancing the local government system.  We are generations behind the development of local government in Europe, but that does not concern central Government.  The introduction of this half-baked Bill is a sop, no major change has been made. During the years there has been a huge reluctance to make meaningful changes. Following the Barrington report one hoped a more enlightened approach might have emerged at Government level, but its main recommendations have been watered down and there has been a delay in introducing legislation to implement them.  There is no excuse for the time wasted by the Department of the Environment in preparing legislation for the reform of the local government system in its structures and functions on a proper statutory basis for funding that is seen to be fair and equitable, which is not the case at present.  A great number of regulations can be implemented under this Bill by the Minister without due regard to the House except through the complicated system of the 20 day's annulment procedure.  That procedure is not practical as Opposition Members cannot control the Order of Business or decide when these matters can be raised; they are limited to short periods and the Government largely determines the business of the House.  It is wrong to give such a degree of control to the Minister, through these regulations, in this easy fashion.  When making regulations he should be required to put them before the House for approval.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to make a second contribution on this amendment but the Minister's response to Deputy Barrett would provoke even the most patient Member to comment on his sheer hard neck in introducing overdue legislation at the eleventh hour, and to argue that by questioning or seeking to amend it there was a danger the Opposition would delay the elections.  The elections to be held in June should have been held four years ago in 1990.  At that time the composition of the Government was different. In 1990 the Minister's predecessor &mdash; now an EC Commissioner &mdash; postponed the elections that should have been held that year until 1991 on the grounds that he would reform local government.  In 1991 he told us he had completed only half the job, that elections could only be held for county and city councils and that the fundamental root and branch reform of town councils would take place after 1991.  He even went as far as to say that the legislation on town councils would be introduced in February 1992.  Those elections will now be held four years later and the promised legislation was not introduced.  At the beginning of 1993 the Minister announced the Government was setting up a committee to reorganise district councils, town councils and so on with a view to them being reorganised in time for the elections in 1994.  However, nothing was done until the beginning of this year when the Minister issued a circular to county managers asking them to submit new town boundaries by the end of March so that elections could proceed in June this year.  Those elections are proceeding on a purely electoral basis. The town boundaries have been changed &mdash; or proposed to be changed &mdash; but only for electoral purposes.  The administration, refuse collection, provision of water and other services will not be provided by the councils to which people in the suburbs will elect councillors in June. The Minister must take the prize for cheek &mdash; having presided over the postponement of elections for four years &mdash; then introducing a Bill which postpones county council elections for a further two <Col N="1820" /> years or more and saying that the Opposition, by questioning his approach, will delay the elections.  If the Minister does not introduce the legislation the Opposition has called for until the eleventh hour he cannot complain if it questions and seeks to amend it.</P>

      <P>Ní raibh sé i gceist agam labhairt ar an leasú seo.  However, I detect from the pace of the proceedings that we will probably not reach all the amendments, if that is not a gross understatement. In that event the amendment proposed by Deputy Barrett is a stopgap to prevent the Minister acquiring further powers than those already vested in him. Many of the later amendments contain provisions which will substantially clip his wings.  It is necessary to put in place a safety net to enable the House to reflect a more democratic opinion than the Minister's order.  I support Deputy Barrett's amendment as a stop-gap in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind, despite the Minister's statements in support of this legislation, that what is possible under our legislation is not possible under local government legislation in other countries.  We may postpone elections and basically decide according to political criteria when an election is to be held or postponed.  I would argue that the Minister would have postponed the European elections if he could have done so.  He is retaining power in terms of other elections and that is not acceptable. It makes this country the joker in the pack as elections may be decided on political and other considerations that ought not come into play in a democracy.  It is not acceptable to talk about local government reform on the one hand and to set up special arrangements to postpone elections on the other.  This amendment should be carried to safeguard against excessive ministerial orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A great many issues have been raised which are perhaps more appropriate to a Second Stage debate but I will quickly deal with some of them. Part of the reason for deferring local elections <Col N="1821" /> to 1998 is to ensure that candidates who are successful in the local elections in June will not be required to seek election in two years' time, to give them a reasonable mandate to bring all local elections into line.  I am deleting the section under which the Minister will retain power to defer local elections. Deputy Molloy, who served as Minister with responsibility for local government for a longer period than many people, knows the constraints in this area.  There are up to 70 sections in this Bill and it is outrageous to say that all of these developed last January.  A long process of examination and discussion preceded this comprehensive legislation which received great support from a number of Members of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; the municipal authorities, the National Libraries Association and a number of other groups. There is a time constraint involved.  We are rushing to enfranchise town residents who have been disenfranchised for the greater part of this century.  I am very appreciative of the support and contribution of local authorities in making that possible.  It is untrue to say I am using the excuse that there is need to facilitate an election on 9 June to introduce these powers.  They have been a necessary part of legislation for time immemorial.  It is not true that we can simply dispense with subordinate legislation and deal with very minute detail that comes into the House.  I said there was 400 instruments last year, and the whole system would be cluttered up if all of them were to be debated.  It is not administratively possible to provide for the inclusion of all these matters in primary <Col N="1822" /> legislation.  I know of no country in the world where it is done.</P>

      <P>The more I see of this Bill and the longer I listen to the Minister the more I think that the Bill was introduced to save face.  The last Government, who did not have such a big majority, promised a total reform of the second tier of local government, but that legislation was not introduced.  As a result local elections were postponed and people have been serving on local councils for ten years.  I know of no democracy where people have served for such a long period.  The only people who served longer than the present incumbents of town commissions, urban district councils and a number of borough councils such as Sligo Corporation are the members of the national parliament of Chiang Kai-Shek who crossed from mainland China to Taiwan.  As many Deputies who were recently in Taiwan will know, those people are still members of the parliament there.</P>
      <P>A perfect example of where an opportunity was lost is in boundary revision, and Sligo town is a good example.  The members of Sligo Corporation had to hold a marathon midnight meeting, such as that held in Brussels when a solution could not be found, and the result was a compromise.  We all know compromises are the worst of all worlds.  Unfortunately, a great opportunity for total reform of the second tier of local government was lost.  Why should a country area not have a second tier of government? There is nothing in the Bill to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>On the revision of boundaries, more than 70 local authorities were involved, more than 50 of whom, including Sligo, agreed boundary changes.  Agreement was not reached in some areas, but that does not mean that boundary changes are not needed.</P>

      <P>That is not the way to proceed.  Sometimes conflicts of interest arise between a county area and a town <Col N="1823" /> area for economic and financial reasons. When people failed to make a decision on boundary changes the Minister decided to leave those areas as they were. He is admitting that changes are needed but is saying he will not make the changes. That is no way to introduce local government reform.  The Minister did many good things, including the introduction of the recent Roads Bill, and I know he has a deep interest in this matter, but on this occasion his hand was forced and he lost a great opportunity to reform local government.  It is unlikely we will have another opportunity to do so for a long time.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the extension of the life of county councils to 1998 so that all local authorities at county level and sub-county level, which he calls town authorities, will hold their elections on the same date from 1998 onwards.  There is no statutory obligation to provide that local authorities at every level hold their elections on the same date.  It is not good that all elections be held on the same date and I do not believe the Government, whoever is in power, would welcome the holding of all elections on the one date as a barometer test of how national Government is performing. In many countries that is not the case.  The elections are staggered.</P>
      <P>There is no justification for the proposal contained in a later section of the Bill to extend the life of the county councils and the county boroughs by two years when the elections that were held were for a period of five years.  Already the Minister is interfering with the life of those councils and proposing in this Bill that they be extended.  It is ludicrous for him to be introducing a provision which will take away his power to postpone elections in the future.  If the Minister thinks that I or anybody on this side of the House believes that, he must think we are very native people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One simply has to examine the record of previous Governments and Ministers for the Environment in regard to local government to see the gross way in which <Col N="1824" /> they have interfered with the local government system through the postponement of elections in most cases for political reasons, in order to avoid having an election in a year where the Government of the day thought it might not do well.  This was done irrespective of the views of the community or of the other parties in this House.  If the Minister believes he is convincing us that all that will end now, he is expecting us to believe too much.  The only way in which he could so convince us if there was some constitutional requirement prohibiting the Government from interfering in the local government system in this way and that there was an obligation on the State to hold the elections within a fixed period, say, the five year period which has been the case up to now.  Until something of that nature is put in place, either by adopting the European charter or some constitutional change to give constitutional rights to local government, the political parties in power will continue to distort the whole local government system to their own advantage.</P>
    <P>We will never have a meaningful system of local government while that position obtains.  This section is critical to the way Government has been abusing the local government system by making regulations.  The least that should be required is that in future any such regulations would require the stamp of approval of Leinster House and that they must be put before the House for formal approval as is proposed in the amendment.</P>

      <P>Obviously the Minister does not intend to agree to this amendment, and that is regrettable.  It confirms our suspicion that the Government has no intention of devolving power to local authorities.  We have the most centralised system of Government here.  The Minister, by his own admission, says that if we were to accept this amendment where each order or regulation would have to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, we would greatly delay many aspects of the legislation.  That highlights the fact that this so-called reforming <Col N="1825" /> legislation continues to have the dead hand of central Government stamped all over it.</P>
      <P>If the Minister and central Government were devolving real power to local authorities, there would be no necessity to have many orders or regulations laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas for confirmation because they would not exist.  There is a fundamental principle here and it is a question of whether one believes that local government should stand on its own two feet, that the Government of the day should realise that the public elect people to local authorities that the public should decide whether those people are doing their job and should indicate their satisfaction or otherwise at the following election.  One either agrees with that principle or disagrees with it.</P>
      <P>This Government wants to retain as much control centrally as possible.  In view of the vast number of amendments before us, it is a pointless exercise to delay the legislation any longer.  This is an issue worth voting on because it will highlight which side of the argument one is on, whether one is for or against devolving powers to local government or retaining control at central level.  That is the issue and there is little point trying to put forward excuses about delays and so on.  This is a typical example of the Government bringing in so-called reforming local government legislation on which the Opposition have two or three days to deal with all Stages simply because the introduction of the legislation was left until the last moment.  I ask for the question to be put and for the House to vote on the issue.</P>

      <P>I do not have my copy of the Barrington report with me but I recall its contents very clearly and while the Minister may have read the quotation accurately into the record, he has seriously misrepresented what Barrington was proposing.  In the totality of his report, Barrington proposed very fundamental changes in local government. He proposed a process of change which did not include the postponement of elections and which would certainly have allowed for the making of regulations. What he had in mind was putting in place a framework, in the form of primary legislation, for reform of local government followed by the process of regulations. What we are getting in the Minister's Bill is the tired old traditional way in which regulations are used by central Government, namely, to exercise a type of supervisory role and a control over local government.</P>
      <P>If we take the example I quoted earlier in relation to local government boundaries, Barrington proposed that there should be a boundaries commission, that boundaries would not be drawn in the way the Minister is proposing but by way of regulation.  That is completely different. When introducing this legislation the Minister described it as the finest reforming legislation in local government in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>Introducing the Bill, the Minister described it as the finest piece of reforming legislation in the history of the State. It is nothing of the kind.  It is poor legislation and an excuse to postpone elections. It is a way to put structural reform at local government level back on the shelf.  We have the pathetic sight of the Minister being caught out time and again, looking for some paragraph of the Barrington report, which he quotes out of context, to support his poor legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 11.4 of the Barrington report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various changes recommended <Col N="1828" /> to widen the remit of local government (e.g. a general competence power; such legislative provisions as may be necessary to allow for devolution to proceed in a simple and flexible manner; removal of outdated control; move to a general discretionary grant system etc.) should be included in the first piece of reform legislation to ensure local government has the freedom to adapt and develop to its expanding role.  This legislation should set out the broad local government framework and allow for necessary consequential changes to be implemented by way of statutory order.  This would provide the legal flexibility and adaptability to proceed quickly on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is justifying his rejection of the amendment on that paragraph he is doing a great disservice to those who served on the commission.  Barrington supports every argument we put today and the principle that central Government should take its hands off local government, expand the powers of local authorities and give them flexibility and independence.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The postponement of local elections shows the contempt in which local democracy is held.  Local elections should be held at a specified time.  Local democracy is floundering and being on a county council is just about as useless a piece of work as one could find.  They have very little money.  There is not even sufficient to fill in potholes.  They have no power. Everything is dictated by the Government. Over 90 per cent of what we do at county council level is controlled by the Government.  I do not know what purpose local democracy serves.  It is a pity the Bill does not deal with that aspect and allow local authorities the necessary finance and power to deal with local problems.</P>

For the Minister to quote the Barrington report selectively does a serious disservice to the local government system.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Minister's party are saying to me how difficult it is to find people who are interested in standing for election at this level.  They see local government as a charade and has no real function.  They know the <Col N="1831" /> Government has no intention of strengthening the role of local representatives in the community or giving them any meaningful function which would enable them to respond to the needs of the locality.</P>
      <P>Mr. Barrington proposed an implementation commission be set up.  He knew from his extensive knowledge of the public service and the political system that unless there was an independent group &mdash; he even suggested that there be a judge on it to ensure its independence &mdash; to oversee the implementation of the proposals there was little chance that they would be implemented.  He did not trust the political parties and primarily the party of which the Minister is a member. Fianna Fáil has proved a major obstacle to the implementation of any kind of decent local government reform which would give local authorities a role in the community.  People are crying out for that and the Minister is denying them that reform for political reasons.</P>
      <P>Mr. Barrington stated that legislation should set out the broad local government framework based on the proposals in the report.  This Bill does not do that. It bears no resemblance to any of the main recommendations contained in the report regarding sub-county level.  The Barrington report stated:</P>
      <P>At the sub-county level, the Committee have put two possible options forward for consideration &mdash; either a directly elected district tier of authorities or the formal establishment of district committees of the county councils;</P>
      <P>under both options the existing sub-county authorities would cease to exist and be replaced by new arrangements. The logic of this situation, is that if either option is to be pursued, local elections should not be held in June to the existing sub-county authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was on the basis that some kind of radical reform of the system was about to be made that my party, in Government, agreed to the postponement of the local <Col N="1832" /> elections.  We left Government without getting agreement on this issue from the Minister.  The measure brought forward by the Minister, surprisingly with the agreement of the Labour Party, bears no relationship whatsoever to the radical options put forward by the Barrington Commission.  He is proposing a minor alteration, extending the boundaries of some towns to include the bit of suburbanisation on the periphery.  The Minister is opposed to extending local government outside the town system.  He has not even extended the local government system to those towns which have a population far in excess of many of the towns included under the 1891 Act.  This debate on reform is a charade and it is disgraceful that it is taking place within the national Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister's predecessor came into the House in May 1990 to postpone the local elections from 1990 to 1991 my party opposed the proposal.  I again opposed the postponement of the town council elections in 1991 to, as it now happens, 1994.  I have repeatedly called at Question Time, on the Order of Business and on other occasions for the holding of elections when they are due.  During the debate on the 1991 Act I tabled an amendment which proposed that the local elections should be held at five yearly intervals and no facility given to Ministers to postpone those elections.  That remains my view. The people who voted in the last county council elections in 1991 had a right to expect that the people they were electing would serve for a period of five years and not eight years, which they will serve under the Minister's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point relates to regulations, which is what we are really debating in the context of this amendment.  I was not entirely happy with certain parts of its provisions, but I concede that by and large the 1991 Act was good legislation. The problem is that the Minister has muzzled the 1991 Act which effectively enabled local authorities, if they were allowed to do it, to re-organise much local government.  Part VI of the Act <Col N="1833" /> allowed for the establishment of committees and the involvement of community groups, sporting clubs and the wider community in the running of local services.  For example, a local authority might decide that its parks should be governed by a committee in which sports clubs and the users of parks would be involved.  Yet three years later the Minister has not made the regulations or the order commencing the sections of the 1991 Act which would have allowed local authorities to introduce those reforms.</P>
    <P>The Minister not only wants to have additional powers and regulations which will enable him to have a say in the affairs of local authorities but he will not exercise his existing powers.  He has had three years within which to allow local authorities to proceed with the 1991 Act, yet he has not done so.  Instead of saying he does not know the sections of the 1991 Act which have not yet been commenced, the Minister should tell us not only the sections but why they have not been commenced. <Col N="1834" /> We are entitled to an explanation after three years.</P>

      <P>I cannot let go unchallenged the Minister's sweeping statement that Members on this side of the House are seeking to postpone elections.  It was very ungracious of the Minister to make such a statement and he knows full well that it is not true.  He sought to qualify his remarks by stating that the larger Opposition parties collaborated in perpetrating this injustice.  This merely serves to reinforce my original suspicion that not only is the Minister adopting a dismissive attitude to local government through the retention of power at central Government level but he is also adopting a dismissive attitude to those people who vote for smaller parties.  This is an insult to people who vote for smaller parties, including the Green Party.  This type of attitude is not becoming and the Minister should clarify the position.</P>

      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), lines 32 to 38, to delete paragraphs (d) to (g) and substitute the following:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to debate a local government Bill when it contains what the Minister proposes and not the type of reform the other parties would wish.  The changes proposed go nowhere near what my party <Col N="1837" /> would wish.  The Bill is only tipping the hat at the Barrington ideas and does not go anywhere near what was proposed.  In an effort to improve local government I tabled this amendment which refers to the dual mandate.  I am putting forward the principle that local government should be able to deliver a wide a range of services to the people and should have an adequate statutory basis for its funding. There should be a clear dividing line between the role of local authorities and that of central Government.  Unfortunately, central Government continues to control a wide range of functions.  If we were to apply the principle of subsidiarity it would not be administered by central Government but at local level.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve our objective of strengthening local government I propose that the functions of councils be increased and that the Minister's authority be strengthened through legislation. There is a conflict where the dual mandate is maintained.  I have exercised it.  There is no point in the Minister telling the House that Deputy Molloy has been a member of a corporation, a county council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have made other transitions in my life, much more fundamental than this and I hope the Minister recognises that.  I am prepared to take a stand on issues that I regard as important.  I do not want my credibility in this regard qustioned in this manner.  We could have Deputy McCormack rushing in to remind the House that I was once appointed a member of a sheep dipping committee.  Perhaps the sheep dipping committees did valuable work, I do not know as I never attended such a meeting.</P>

      <P>In order that local government be capable of delivering services in the community I am advocating that a Member of the House should not be authorised to stand for election to a local authority.  I realise that if a member of a local authority is elected to the Dáil he or she can hold the dual mandate until the subsequent election.  A similar position obtains in the case of those elected to the European Parliament.  If they are Members of this House they retain their seat until the subsequent general election. That is the position in my party and other parties are adopting the same approach.  Generally, we would not support the dual mandate.  This is very radical and is absolutely anathema to members of Fianna Fáil, of other parties and, perhaps, also to members of Fine Gael.  I am pleased Deputy Barrett is supporting the same principle.</P>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister's party to support the amendment.  I despair of the Labour Party standing for anything in the line of reform because when its members get into office they are the poorest performers on delivering on their own policies although when in Opposition they made many fine speeches in the House. I do not expect the Minister will accept my amendment.  It is not that I do not believe it is possible for Members to serve both bodies &mdash; it involves much jigging around of the scheduling of meetings of local authorities to facilitate those who are also Members of the Dáil or Seanad. That may not necessarily be a good thing. If we had the kind of local government that my party would like no Member of the House would be able to stand for election to a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When my party was in Government we advocated the barring of Ministers and Ministers of State from standing for election to local authorities.  That was one of the few reforms we succeeded in having accepted.  This amendment is an extension of that principle.  I am putting it <Col N="1839" /> forward on the basis that local government would benefit from it.  I fear for local government if the Minister does not deliver on the powers and functions we would like to see given to local authorities. The continuous postponement of major decision-making in this area has been a cause of much concern and leads one to despair as to whether anything worthwhile will emerge.</P>
    <P>One would despair at local elections being postponed four years in a row, extending the tenure of elected representatives to nine years.  It is absolutely extraordinary that this has happened.  It quite clearly reflects the attitude of certain members of the Government to local government.  For that reason I am sure they will not want to support an amendment of this kind.</P>
    <P>My amendment would benefit greatly the local government system.  Oireachtas Members are inclined to dominate the proceedings at local authority meetings. As members of the Oireachtas have the opportunity to represent the people of their area at national level, they are an inhibiting factor in local community involvement.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little between the Opposition on this issue. The Fine Gael Party would prefer to see legislation giving effect to reform and reorganisation of local government and we will continue to press for it.  My amendment No. 8 is slightly different from those of my Opposition colleagues. It states:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) (a) When local authorities have been conferred with real and substantial powers to perform their functions, the Minister may, by regulations, disqualify members of the Houses of the Oireachtas for being elected, for being co-opted, or for being a member of a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> My amendment proposes also that where such a regulation is made it be confirmed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, in keeping with the principle we debated earlier.  When we have effective local government, people can decide whether they wish to represent their constitutents at local or national level.  When we arrive at that day the onus on local government representatives will be to represent people at local rather than national level so that membership of a local authority will not be used as a vehicle to dislodge an elected Member of the Oireachtas. Let us be frank and admit that members of local authorities use local government as a platform to be elected to this House. We all did it.  If we are to have effective local government, local authority members must break their service before seeking election to this House.  It is reasonable that there should be a <i>quid pro quo</i> from members of the Oireachtas. We will never deal with the issue until we face up to that situation.</P>
    <P>My party fully supports the recommendations in the Barrington report to devolve powers to local government and when a Government has the courage to act on those recommendations it will be impossible to serve on a local authority as well as being a member of this House. The additional responsibilities imposed on local authority members would, in my opinion, make that impossible.  When we face up to that task I believe a substantial number will want to serve on local authorities.  Political parties, and Fianna Fáil is no different from us, would admit that it is proving difficult to find attractive candidates to serve in local government because they do not see it as meaningful. That is the truth, whether or not one wants to accept it.  People believe the present system of local government representation means nothing and I agree with them.</P>
    <P>The question of the dual mandate will arise when we have effective local government.  Debarring Members of the Oireachtas from membership of local authorities would not make a great difference under the present arrangements. If we want to make effective local government <Col N="1841" /> an issue, my amendment deserves support.</P>
    <P>A member of the European Parliament may be a member of a local authority. From my reading of the Bill, a member of the European Parliament can serve also as cathaoirleach or leas-chathaoirleach of a county council as there is no reference to this in the Bill.  I have tabled an amendment that members of the European Parliament should not be eligible to serve as cathaoirleach or leas-chathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>We should continue the struggle to seek the devolution of power to local authorities.  When we have meaningful local government I believe it will be impossible for Members of the Oireachtas to serve at local government level.  The Fine Gael Party holds this view and I fully support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is similar to Deputy Molloy's.  The Minister will be aware if he has read the submission of the General Council of County Councils that county councils are crying out for this reform.  It is regrettable that elections will be postponed until 1998 but some Deputies have intimated that they be further delayed until 1999 if we can do a deal.  That may be just what is needed to allow intrepid Deputies who are county councillors get used to the idea of reform and that county councillors are equal in their own right.  The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, will remember my previous allusion to the work of the spectre of George Orwell, which looms over this aspect of the Bill where councillors are all equal but some are more equal than others.  It is high time that we seize the opportunity presented by the postponement of local authority elections to put in place the necessary changes and allow each party to take stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we clarify a matter not clarified during the debate on the European Parliament Bill.  When I tabled a similar amendment to prevent a member of the European Parliament from being a Member of Dáil Éireann I was informed in conversations with officials of the European Commission in <Col N="1842" /> Brussels that under European law we could not prevent anybody from holding a dual mandate.  That matter should be clarified because the House has been misled.  I cannot find the European legislation which states that we cannot end the dual mandate at European and national level.</P>
    <P>We do not have to tip our caps to Europe.  Our local authorities and national Parliament have been demeaned and diminished by this practive.  According to the General Council of County Councils the dual mandate has had an adverse impact on local government, given that 60 per cent of the Members of Dáil Éireann are also members of a local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is usual in Irish politics for members of councils to be Members of Dáil Éireann and <i>vice versa</i> the people are confused about what a councillor and a Deputy are meant to be doing.  Some assume that every Deputy is a councillor and <i>vice versa</i>.  That is their perception and it does nothing to dispel cynicism about politicians.  Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann are considered to be higher grade county councillors.  As a consequence they have a wider brief than county councillors.  The organisation of meetings at local level is controlled by the activities of the Oireachtas.  In the same way the passage of legislation is impeded because committees which ought to meet every day of the week are encouraged by their members not to meet at the same time as local authorities.  The local authorities and the national Parliament are diminished by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are short-changing a large segment of the population, as pinpointed in the report of the Council for the Status of Women.  This view is shared by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  He was anxious to ensure that political parties would accept the recommendations made in that report, which states that women are discriminated against in entering politics because there is an <Col N="1843" /> assumption that a councillor, to be effective, must also be a Deputy in order to pull the right strings and have influence. This matter has to be addressed.  All the Members present are male.  We have failed to introduce this necessary reform.</P>
    <P>Provision must be made for a transition period to educate the public and politicians at national and local level.  That matter can be addressed by way of amendment to this legislation.  I understand from reports in the <i>Irish Independent</i> that initially the Minister was keen to end the dual mandate.  I realise that something has happened behind closed doors but Deputies need not be afraid of what lies in store; they should bear in mind that we will not have local elections for some considerable time and that their parties would do far better if more women were encouraged to become involved in politics.</P>
    <P>I did not resign my seat immediately. Provision was made for a transition period to train a new councillor who happened to be a woman.</P>

      <P>There was not.  Interested members of the Green Party in the area took part in a selection process.  The people in a Balbriggan and north Dublin are represented much more effectively because members are not allowed to hold a dual mandate.  It is time we met the wishes of the people and reflected on the submission of the General Council of County Councils.  We should be brave and not hide behind closed doors for personal and political reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled an amendment to this section which deals with those employed in the office of a Minister or Minister of State, that is, a handler, an adviser or a manager.  These will be prevented from being members of a local authority.  I have not tabled an amendment to prevent a Member of the Oireachtas from being a member of a local authority because I do not believe <Col N="1844" /> there should be such an exclusion.  If I did believe that Members of the Oireachtas should not be members of a local authority I would follow this to its conclusion and either resign my seat on the local authority or in the House.</P>
      <P>I have been listening to the debate on the dual mandate both inside and outside the House in the context of membership of a local authority and the Oireachtas. This is a political red herring.  Local government needs fundamental reform. I believe that strongly and I have spoken about it repeatedly.  Central Government, the national Legislature and the Department of the Environment should devolve much more of their power to local government.  In Denmark about two thirds of the functions of Government are performed at local level and I would like to see us moving in that direction. Indeed, the logic of our membership of the European Union will force us in that direction because, increasingly, at one level decision-making is in the European Union and its institutions and at another level it is in towns, counties and cities. The problem here is that we have not devolved enough powers to local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central and most urgent question that needs to be debated in the context of local government is its funding.  Within the past few weeks the Taoiseach said he would reintroduce rates.  However, within the week the Minister for the Environment dissociated himself from that statement.  We need to know how local government will be funded because the biggest problem is not that Dáil Deputies sit on the council but that it does not have the money to provide the services demanded by the people.  For example, there are 30,000 people on local authority housing waiting lists; thousands of houses in substandard condition, some without bathrooms or indoor toilets; and roads that one would not put a horse and cart on, much less a motor vehicle.  In urban areas there is a lack of community facilities.  These are the real issues of local government &mdash; people demand services, that the roads be fixed, footpaths repaired, good housing conditions, clean <Col N="1845" /> water and a proper environment.  Last week's report from Greenpeace listed thousands of breaches of European and environmental regulations in Cork. However, what is raised here as the central issue, as the big problem of local government, is that members of local authorities are also Dáil Deputies or Senators.  That is daft.  The reason for this being raised is that every so often a phrase arises that becomes a political touchstone which nobody can oppose; it is a dose of political correctness, the sexy issue, the page three pin-up of local government.  That issue is the question of the dual mandate, and the Minister was the first to recognise it.  In bringing a Bill before the House to postpone local elections and put reforms on the shelf &mdash; the most undemocratic thing he could do to local government &mdash; the Minister or his public relations people needed to figure out how to get a headline on the issue.  They certainly did not want a headline on the postponement for another two years of the county council elections, or to the effect that having waited four years for reform at district council level they had not done anything about it other than to redraw the electoral boundaries.  They had to produce something for a headline and they dug out the old chestnut of the dual mandate.  The Minister is in with the stick saying that Dáil Deputies cannot be chairmen of the county councils, etc.  In most of the reportage of the debate on the Local Government Bill, limited as it was, that was the main issue addressed.</P>
    <P>The principal reason the issue should be addressed is the way politics is practised at a practical level, with multi-seat constituencies and the local, and often personal, relationship that exists between public representatives and their constituents which is a good thing; far too often social welfare, health and environment regulations and so on are written in offices by people who never see those affected by them.  I am in favour of a good deal of contact between public representatives and the people they represent.</P>
    <P>In addition to that dimension of politics, referred to by Deputy Barrett, there <Col N="1846" /> is a more fundamental question, whether local government will be better if there are no Dáil Deputies or Senators on the councils.  There is separation of powers here, including the separation of judicial. Executive and legislative powers.  At local government level there is the separation of the reserved functions and the Executive functions.  Now there is to be another dogma, the boxing off of local government from national Government. That is not desirable because what happens at local level works its way through to national level.  It may be very neat from the point of view of somebody drawing a chart of what constitutes government to be able to separate them so that never the twain shall meet.  However, the two do meet on issues like housing where the funding for its provision and the rules regarding the construction of private housing come from central Government. Building regulations also relate to what happens at local level.  If a community wants funds for the development of a community facility it is not just a local issue.  The national lottery which is controlled at central level is involved.</P>
    <P>There was a debate last week about whether there should be a community school or a community college in a particular part of the country.  It is not practical to separate the local from the national, nor is it desirable.  There is a relationship between the two which should, on occasion, be reflected in common membership of the national parliament and of local government.  They are not separated in other countries.  In France and the United States, for example, the people who often end up running for presidency and senior government positions are mayors of cities, not necessarily members of the Legislature.  That is the way their local government is structured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but they have a different arrangement.  There is no evidence of a public demand for the separation of local and national Government. Very often it is the reverse.  One <Col N="1847" /> only has to look at electoral returns &mdash; I do not know of any better way of testing it &mdash; to see that members of local authorities are elected to the Oireachtas and <i>vice versa</i>.  The question of deciding who should be a member of a local authority should be left to the electorate.  If we are to introduce reform in this area, it should be to consider having some memberships of local authorities on a full-time basis, <Col N="1848" /> particularly in some of the larger local authorities.  It is very difficult now, if one is a member, a part-time member, of, for example, Cork Corporation or Dublin Corporation, to keep in touch with what is happening.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 36 together.  The back to school clothing and footwear scheme has been administered by the health boards on my behalf since its introduction in 1990.</P>
      <P>In September 1993 delays were experienced by clients of the Eastern Health Board in receiving allowances under this scheme.  Because of these difficulties the board was asked to carry out an examination which would ascertain the reasons for these problems and would put measures in place to ensure that they do not arise in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its report, which I received in February, the Eastern Health Board identified a number of areas which gave rise <Col N="1739" /> to delays in the issue of payments in 1993. I have been assured that measures are being put in place at present to ensure that clients do not experience such difficulties in the 1994 scheme.</P>
    <P>My Department's circular on the 1994 scheme issued to the eight regional health boards on 31 March 1994.  This year the scheme will commence on 1 June and eligible people can apply for the allowance any time between that date and 30 September.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the issue of payments are a matter for each health board, however, I have asked all boards to ensure that the majority of payments are made by 31 July 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in the legislation governing the assessment of the benefit of free board and lodgings for applicants for unemployment assistance living in the family home.  Neither has there been any change in the guidelines with regard to the legislation for deciding an appeals officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the supplementary welfare scheme a rent supplement may be paid to persons in receipt of social welfare or health board payments whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.  Account is taken of whether <Col N="1740" /> accommodation is available or not in the family home and the circumstances in which the decision to leave home was taken.  I am not aware of any change in the number of young people availing of rent supplements under the scheme and there have been no changes in the guidelines issued to community welfare officers which would give rise to restricting rent supplement payments.</P>
    <P>Research carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute on behalf of the Department indicates that the assessment of the value of board and lodging is not a prime motivating factor in inducing young single people to leave the family home and thus qualify for higher unemployment payments and rent supplements.</P>
    <P>I am committed to further improve the present system where feasible.  In order to extend a greater degree of financial independence to young unemployed people living at home I introduced a minimum weekly payment of £5 in 1991 for people who are assessed with benefit of board and lodgings.  This payment will be increased later this year to £10.  Also, in order to provide opportunities for young people to participate in employment, education or training I am taking special measures through the school leavers scheme which will provide real alternatives for young people to early dependence on the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is only available for the last three years and this is set out in the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While control of fraud and abuse of social welfare payments has always been a function of my Department it has been given added emphasis in recent years.  In 1991 my Department initiated a project <Col N="1741" /> with the aim of creating a more focused approach across all its schemes and in the area of employer compliance.  This was followed in 1992 by the setting up of a control division with a dedicated role to analyse, co-ordinate and report on all anti-fraud and abuse initiatives and activities.</P>
    <P>The success of this strategy is illustrated by the fact that in the period 1991 to 1993 savings from these measures amounted to £235.5 million with £106 million of this being achieved in 1993.</P>

      <P>The means tests used to determine entitlement to all social assistance schemes include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments held by the applicant in order to determine the level of their social welfare entitlement. The assessment rates vary depending on the scheme.  For unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, 5 per cent is assessed against the first £400 of capital and 10 per cent is assessed on the balance.  The figure arrived at is then divided by 52 to give the weekly value.  A similar assessment is used for old age pension purpose i.e. after an initial disregard for £200,5 per <Col N="1742" /> cent of the next £375 is assessed and 10 per cent of the balance.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> contains a commitment to streamlining and standardising application and assessment procedures, including means testing, in respect of social welfare and other applicants for means-tested State assistance.  In this context the possibility of rationalising the different methods of assessing the value of capital will be examined.</P>

      <P>The resources to be provided to the Combat Poverty Agency to carry out its statutory functions are decided in the context of the annual estimates process and the budget.  The agency's allocation has increased from some £1 million in 1987 to over £1.6 million in 1994.  Under the Combat Poverty Agency Act 1986, the number and kind of employees the agency may engage is subject to the approval of the Minister for Social Welfare, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Such approval has now been delegated to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the agency include advising the Minister in relation to policies and programmes of statutory and other bodies in so far as such policies affect poverty issues, promotion of greater public understanding of the nature and causes of poverty, identification of possible new policies to combat poverty and testing these on a pilot basis, dissemination of information on poverty and community development, fostering and assisting voluntary activities to overcome poverty.  In its work in the discharge of these functions, the agency assists my Department in the management of the community development programme, funds a number of <Col N="1743" /> pilot initiatives to tackle poverty, including providing the Exchequer funding requirement for the projects in the EU Poverty 3 Programme and operates a community development education and training grants scheme.</P>
    <P>This year's budget made an additional £132,000 available to the agency to meet increased pay costs and to allow the agency launch a new pilot programme aimed at working with marginalised young people.</P>
    <P>The board of the agency has recently sought approval to recruit additional members of staff and this request is currently being examined.</P>

      <P>Since I became Minister for Social Welfare I have been constantly seeking ways of improving the quality of service to the public.  A regional structure was set up in 1991 with the objective of giving a more localised and speedy service.  As a result of new procedures, processing times for all claims under the various schemes have been reduced.  In the case of unemployment assistance, the average processing time nationwide is now eight working days while in the case of unemployment benefit the figure is five working days.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately longer delays do occur in some instances.  I understand the Deputy has the particular case of a self employed person in mind which took considerably longer than the average length of time to finalise.  I am glad to say now that unemployment assistance is now in payment and all arrears due to the person concerned were paid to him on 22 March last.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed, as I know that many Members on both sides of the House are, that agreement could not be reached at last week's Social Affairs Council on the proposals for a fourth EU Poverty Programme.  The issues will come up again for discussion at the Social Affairs Council in June.  The three EU poverty programmes that have been implemented to date have been very successful in increasing awareness of poverty across Europe and have encouraged new thinking and new approaches to this issue.  The delay in agreeing this proposal sends the wrong signal to the poor and unemployed of Europe.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the arguments of the other member states will convince our German colleagues that the poverty programme &mdash; which accounts for a mere .03 per cent of the overall EU budget &mdash; has a very important role in a people's Europe and a Europe that is concerned about the situation of disadvantaged communities and groups within the union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three Irish pilot projects are funded under the existing Poverty 3 Programme which ends in June.  I am satisfied that these projects have had considerable success in achieving their objectives and now that their European funding is coming to an end in any event, the priority must be to ensure that their activities are continued and the lessons that have been learned from the projects are taken on board.  The work of the projects is relevant across a number of different Department and agencies and I am arranging for discussions with those agencies <Col N="1745" /> to see how the work of the projects can be built on for the future.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a health board may make a single payment to meet an exceptional need, including assistance with the cost of clothing.  It is recognised that confirmation and communion times may involve families in additional expense and assistance may be provided towards these costs.</P>
      <P>The back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme assists parents on low incomes with meeting the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. The scheme is administered by the health boards as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and a sum of £10.5 million has been allocated to the scheme in 1994.  In 1993, some 108,000 families were assisted in respect of 255,000 children.</P>

      <P>In October 1993, I introduced a <Col N="1746" /> back to work allowance scheme to create and encourage additional employment opportunities for unemployed persons and for lone parents.  This new scheme provides unemployed people with the opportunity to try their hand at self-employment ventures or try out work in areas earmarked for development such as fisheries, local heritage projects, crafts enterprise, local tourism, horticulture, community development and work with voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>People who participate in the scheme receive 75 per cent of their weekly social welfare entitlement for the first year of payment and 50 per cent for the second year.  In addition, they are allowed to retain any secondary benefits, to which they were automatically entitled when they were in receipt of a social welfare payment.  My Department advised all health boards in November 1993, that participants on the back-to-school scheme are entitled to retain all secondary benefits to which they were entitled prior to participation on the scheme provided that the combination of income from employment or self employment, the back-to-work allowance and family income supplement is less than £250 gross per week.</P>

      <P>The main costs of the social welfare commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> relate to the annual increases in social welfare rates of payment over the period of the programme. The progamme commits the Government to continue to maintain the real income position of those on social welfare and to continue the progress already made towards achieving the main recommended rates of the Commission <Col N="1747" /> on Social Welfare.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Commission's priority rates have been provided for in this year's budget.</P>
      <P>The programme acknowledges that further progress in reaching the Commission on Social Welfare's main recommended rates will have regard to the capacity of the economy and the budget to support the increase in expenditure involved.  It is not possible to estimate the cost of the improvements which will be made over the period of the programme. I should mention, however, that the social welfare improvements announced in last January's budget will cost some £168 million in a full year. The extent and the cost of future annual increases in rates of payment will be matters for consideration by Government at the appropriate time.  Other commitments in the programme which would have financial implications over the period of the programme will also fall to be considered by Government at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>The expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems was established last July by my colleague Deputy Burton, Minister of State.  The terms of reference of the group are: &ldquo;To identify the problems arising from the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and to identify the steps necessary to achieve greater co-ordination/integration of the two systems, with particular attention to the impact on people's incomes, and to the <Col N="1748" /> tax code, social welfare system, budgetary and administrative implications.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister of State asked the working group to furnish an interim report on measures which could be undertaken in the 1994 budget to reduce poverty traps and increase incentives to work.  The working groups has presented its interim report to the Minister of State, and its findings were released in mid-January. Copies of the interim report were placed in the Oireachtas Library.  I am arranging to have a copy of the report sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The working group made two specific recommendations for the budget.  The first of these relates to the means test for lone parent's allowance and the second relates to the arrangement whereby employers of medical card holders are liable for the employees' health contribution and employment and training levy.  Both of these issues were addressed in the budget, and the necessary legislation was included in the recent Social Welfare Act.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question raises what are, in effect, two separate issues: First, the issue of the adequacy of social welfare payments; second, the issue of moving away from the concept of dependency in the social welfare code towards individual entitlement for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> In relation to the issue of adequacy, I have ensured that during my time as Minister for Social Welfare, social welfare payments have not only kept pace with inflation but showed substantial real increases.</P>
    <P>These increases can be seen in a continuing rise towards the levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  All long term rates now exceed the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rates.  From next July, short term rates will be brought above that level.</P>
    <P>The concept of dependency in the social welfare system has its origins in the traditional family structure of a breadwinner with dependent spouse and children. I am aware that the social welfare system needs to be constantly evaluated in the light of changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have stated on several occasions my commitment to the provision of pensions cover for women who work full time in the home.  The Commission for the Status of Women was of the view that adult dependants of social welfare recipients, the vast bulk of whom are married women, should be given recognition in their own right and the term &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; should be replaced.  The National Pensions Board recommended that when persons who have been full-time homemakers reach pensionable age, the allowance currently paid in respect of them as adult dependants should instead be paid directly to them.  I am currently considering the implications of these recommendations with a view to developing proposals.</P>
    <P>A broader system of individual rights and payments would represent a significant change in the existing social welfare system and would have significant cost inmplications.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance <Col N="1750" /> scheme operated by my Department is available to people who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who are either living alone or only with children or with persons who, because they are so permanently incapacitated, could not get help in an emergency.  The main purpose of the scheme is to ensure that people in this vulnerable situation, particularly elderly people, have some way of getting help when it is needed.</P>
      <P>The living alone condition has been modified to suit exceptional circumstances in a household.  For example, if the applicant is a person who is permanently incapacitated and could not get help in an emergency, one other person may come to live with the applicant without affecting the entitlement.  I am introducing two further improvements from July next in the free telephone rental allowance.  First, if the applicant is in need of constant care and attention, a carer may join the household to take care of the applicant without affecting the entitlement.  Second, if the recipient is 75 years of age or over, he or she will be entitled even if there is another person living in the household.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the free telephone rental allowance to additional groups not covered at present would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.  The number of people currently availing of the allowance is about 114,000 and the annual cost of the scheme is about £20 million.</P>
      <P>In so far as widows are concerned, I would like to mention that I have extended entitlement to my Department's free schemes from July next so as to allow widows of 60 years and over to retain entitlement to any free schemes formerly granted to their late husbands.</P>

      <P>Employees earning £30 or more per week are generally covered by Class A social insurance, and can qualify for the full range of benefits, including disability benefit.  In the case of people earning less than £70 per week, some benefits including disability benefit are paid at graduated reduced rates.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of March 1994 there were approximately 2,470 people in receipt of disability benefit at the graduated rates of payment.  It is estimated that approximately 300 or 12 per cent of these recipients were also in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of widespread concern among the business community along the lines referred to by the Deputy, though I have noted views expressed on behalf of exporters to the UK.</P>
      <P>I would make a number of points in relation to such views.  To begin with, the value of Sterling has been fluctuating on the foreign currency markets.  While the Irish pound has appreciated against Sterling over recent months, it is still well below the level against Sterling at which it was trading after the January 1993 devaluation.  Against other currencies its value is less than it was before the January 1993 devaluation and overall, i.e. on a trade-weighted basis, it is still somewhat below the level which obtained before the 1992 ERM crisis.  Of course, price stability continues to be the objective of exchange rate policy and policy is not designed to target any currency or basket of currencies.</P>
      <P>In any event the ability of industry to compete abroad does not depend solely on exchange rate levels.  A key requirement is that it operate in a macroeconomic framework characterised by low inflation, low interest rates, and pay moderation.  This is the environment which Governments have been providing over recent years: it is dependent on the maintenance of an exchange rate policy directed at price stability, as Ireland's is. The Government is committed to maintaining this environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has of course also been active in other ways to improve the ability of Irish industry to compete internationally.  The recently-concluded <Col N="1754" /><i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the National Development Plan for the use of EU Structural Funds should prove of significant help in this regard.  Many of the measures in the 1994 budget will also be of assistance to industry.</P>

      <P>The part-time job incentive scheme is a nationwide scheme designed to allow persons who are in receipt of the <Col N="1755" /> long term rate of unemployment assistance to take up part-time employment of up to 24 hours per week.  Participants are paid a fixed weekly amount, £37.80 in the case of single persons and £62.10 for married persons.  This payment is unaffected by earnings.  Currently over 500 persons have availed of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Payments under the part-time job incentive scheme are taken into account in addition to insurable earnings in determining whether a mortgage interest supplement is payable.  Payment of the mortgage interest supplement to the person concerned is under review by the community welfare officer and he will be informed of any revision in due course.</P>
      <P>The scheme is a valuable component of the array of schemes available for the long term unemployed.  The fixed payment available under the scheme allows unemployed persons an opportunity to investigate work opportunities which, over time may develop into full-time employment.</P>

      <P>I am committed to providing social welfare customers with improved services.  In this context, the range of payment methods and options which are available to my Department's customers have been considerably expanded and modernised in recent years.  My aim is to provide, on a phased basis, a range of modern payment options which will be more convenient for our customers.</P>
      <P>In late 1992 my Department and An Post concluded a new service agreement which provides a platform for the transfer of social welfare payment services from my Department's local offices to post offices.  Social welfare customers can receive a significantly improved service at post offices where the more modern facilities have been introduced.</P>
      <P>My Department and An Post have jointly developed a range of direct credit payment facilities for child benefit and certain pension customers.  These may now choose to have their payments credited to a savings account with An Post.</P>
      <P>This facility is being provided as an alternative to, rather than a replacement for, payment by books of orders which may be cashed at post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1758" /> In parallel, payment by direct credit to accounts at banks and certain other financial institutions which participate in the banks' electronic funds transfer and clearing system, is now available for child benefit customers, certain pensions customers and some unemployed customers of my Department.  People in these categories who, for one reason or another, find this payment method is more suited to their personal needs and preferences may choose accordingly.</P>
    <P>I am also looking at the possibility of extending our payment options so that Credit Unions would be included. However, there are a number of issues of a banking, technical and administrative nature that would need to be resolved before this option will be available to social welfare customers.</P>
    <P>In line with my objective of providing improved services, the process of extending the range and flexibility of payment options available to social welfare customers generally will continue.  As they come on stream, new technologies and money transmission facilities will be examined with a view to further expending the range of payment methods from which my Departments customers may choose according to personal preferences.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the area of the Royal Canal between Cross Gun's Bridge and Binn's Bridge is policed by the gardaí from Mountjoy station.  The area is patrolled on a 24-hour basis particularly by foot as well as by mobile patrols, including the community garda with responsibility for this area.  The Garda authorities are aware that problems can occur in the vicinity of the canal from time to time in relation to youths drinking cider.  However, they report that the local gardaí closely monitor the situation and ensure that these problems are dealt with effectively.  The Deputy will be aware that additional new powers have been provided under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 for the Garda to deal with situations of this nature, including the power of confiscation if alcohol is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the increased grants available to local authorities for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads are used to maximum effect and that the best long term value is obtained in relation to the condition of roads.  It is incumbent on local authorities to adopt practices and techniques which offer the most effective solution to the road maintenance problems they encounter.  While I have made it clear that public money cannot be wasted on repeated temporary filling of the same potholes, I recognise that the repair of potholes, using effective techniques, is a suitable response in situations where the structure of the road is basically sound and where its useful life can be extended by pothole patching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has assisted local authorities from time to time in evaluating new techniques to perfect cost-effective and long term pothole repairs and has monitored international developments <Col N="1768" /> in this area.  A working party representative of my Department and local authorities has recently presented a report evaluating developments in the automation of velocity patching, a process whereby each chipping is fired in an air stream at speed through a bitumen spray and then into the pothole.  The working party had, as its starting point, recent developments in this regard and reviews of the available machinery undertaken in the US and elsewhere, including the work of the US Federal Highway Administration Pavement Division. The machine considered to offer the most effective solution in Irish conditions was selected for trials in Cavan and Meath; these were carried out in 1992 and 1993 and performance and operational costs were evaluated against conventional patching units.  The working party concluded that the machine produced good quality work and that its use is more cost-effective than the conventional method.  Other claimed advantages are ease of mobilisation, extension of the working season and improved health and safety conditions for the operator.</P>
    <P>The working party is satisfied that the machine concerned has the potential to make a worthwhile contribution to road maintenance here but it would wish to see certain modifications made to it, and their performance proven, before the machine is brought into general use.  I am considering the working party's report in the matter and its recommendations, including those concerning the further development and evaluation of the machine.</P>

      <P>Under the Presidential Elections Act, 1993, polling staff whose duties at a presidential election prevent them voting at their local polling station may be authorised to vote at another station, whether or not that station is situated in the elector's own constituency.  Similar provision in relation to referenda is contained in the Referendum Bill which was recently passed by the Dáil.  In the case of a European election, an elector in the situation referred to may be authorised to vote at any polling station in the European Parliament constituency concerned.</P>
      <P>At a Dáil or local election, a separate election takes place in each constituency or electoral area and it would not be appropriate to authorise an elector to vote in a constituency or electoral area, other than the one for which he/she is registered.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views expressed by various sections of the shipping industry, including employees of B &amp; I, in relation to features of current national shipping policy.  I should point out however that Ireland is not alone in having to contend with competition from vessels employing low cost crews; this problem affects all EU member states.</P>
      <P>In line with the Programme for Government, I am reviewing ways in which the operating climate for the shipping sector can be enhanced to support the objectives of improved services, standards, modernisation and the ability to compete of the Irish-registered fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategic objective is to enable Irish shipping companies to meet international competition under comparable cost conditions but without compromising on safety.  The intention is to <Col N="1775" /> ensure the maintenance and creation of employment in the sector and to facilitate productive investment to modernise and expand the fleet.</P>
    <P>The review is being conducted in full consultation with the industry.  However, to further inform this process the Department plans to commission an economic evaluation of the sector shortly which will also address the case for additional support measures conducive to an efficient and competitive shipping industry.</P>

      <P>Both the companies referred to by the Deputy have announced ambitious plans for the introduction of new vessels on the central corridor.  I welcome these plans in the interests of exporters and the tourism trade.  These plans are in line with the Government's objectives for the modernisation of ferry services and it is the intention to encourage the necessary investment in Dublin Port, Dún Laoghaire as well as in Holyhead.</P>
      <P>The implementation of these plans also offers the best prospects for ensuring the highest sustainable employment in shipping lines on this corridor.  The costs of the Dún Laoghaire project will be of the order of £15 million and the financing arrangements have yet to be finalised.</P>

His application is being processed further at present and any balance due will be paid shortly.  EU regulations precluded payment under the suckler cow scheme before 1 November 1993 and even then limited the payments to 60 per cent advances.  Payment of the balances under that scheme is subject to EU requirements relating to the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density. This obliges member states to process all applications received from a particular applicant during the course of 1993 before paying out balances.  Payment of suckler cow scheme balances have now commenced.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 to 116, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The number of agricultural officers and higher agricultural officers engaged on livestock field duties is 169.  The number of officers on temporary transfer from other sections to the livestock section in 1993 was 31, excluding officers on duties related to clenbuterol.</P>
      <P>The total number of days worked by permanent officers in the livestock section on field inspection duties in 1993 was 13,950 man-days, and the average number of days worked was 77 man-days. The figures for staff on temporary transfer were 930 and 30 man-days, respectively.</P>
      <P>The total number of days worked on field inspection from 1 January 1994 to 31 March 1994 was 1,432 man-days and the average worked per officer was 8.5 man-days.  During this period ewe premium-sheep headage schemes had not commenced.  The only field inspections being carried out at this time were on special beef premium and suckler cow applicants, November-December 1993 applicants.</P>
      <P>The duties of agricultural officers include duties other than carrying out field inspections.  Staff are required to spend time familiarising themselves with the terms and conditions of the various schemes and with any changes which may occur from year to year.  These officers also carry out office duties in preparing for field inspections and in certain cases prepare reports for further assessment by supervisory officers.  In addition, during certain periods of the year staff may be required to carry out duties in other areas of my Department's work for example in meat factories.</P>
      <P>The total travelling and subsistence expenses paid for inspection of cattle and sheep for each of the years from 1988 to 1993 is as follows: 1988, £817,532; 1989, £777,341; 1990, £538,473; 1991, £691,925; 1992, £610,841 and 1993, £616,038.  It is not possible to give a break-down of expenses under each of the schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117, 118 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>In 1993, the total number of full time clerical/administrative staff assigned to livestock duties in my Department, other than the special beef premium unit, was 247.  The special beef premium unit commenced operation in June 1993 and at 31 December 1993, the total clerical/administrative staff in the unit was 87.  In addition, 14 staff were transferred temporarily from other sections of my Department to the livestock sections during the year.</P>
      <P>My Department also recruited twenty-four temporary staff to assist in the payment of beef premia for four to five weeks during that period at a salary cost of £18,579.54.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of fulltime clerical/administrative staff engaged in livestock duties in the first three months of this year had increased to 362.  This figure includes 17 staff on loan from other <Col N="1786" /> sections of my Department.  An additional 15 temporary staff were engaged on short term contracts during this period.  The total cost of salaries paid for the engagement of these temporary staff was £20,322.14.</P>
    <P>The system used by my Department for recording overtime does not facilitate the compilation of amounts spent on individual schemes.  Of a total amount of £1.7 million spent on overtime to all clerical/administrative staff in 1993, an estimated £.9 million approximately was paid for overtime on livestock duties.  It is estimated that of the £.62 million paid in overtime to administrative staff in the period 1 January to 31 March 1994, £.4 million was related to livestock duties.</P>

      <P>The matter of disposal of health care waste at hospitals, including Cork Regional Hospital, is being examined by a group in my Department.  A draft health services waste policy has been circulated to the health agencies and a process of consultation and feedback to the Department has been concluded.  An amended waste policy, taking account of the views of the agencies, will be issued shortly.</P>
      <P>When the policy is in place, the agencies will be required to prepare waste management plans which comply with the principles set out in the policy document. I understand that the Southern Health Board is already considering the incineration arrangements at Cork Regional Hospital in the context of the formulation of the board's proposed waste management plans.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of child abuse units is to provide a service for the assessment of allegations of child sexual abuse and to arrange any necessary treatment for victims. Some of the units have begun to develop programmes aimed at abusers. Such programmes are not strictly medical, being run by multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals including psychiatrists, psychologist and social workers.  They aim to help abusers examine their offending behaviour, their sexuality and victim experience.  Research indicates that with adult abusers, therapy is most successful with incest offenders and with men who abuse girls.</P>

    <P>I will sympathetically consider any applications for additional staffing that <Col N="1794" /> may be required to develop further such services.</P>

In the case of St. Brigid's girls national school there were 276 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1992, which warrants a staff of principal plus nine assistants for the 1993-94 school year.

      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached.

      <P>This report shows an average pupil-absence level from national schools of approximately 7 per cent in the school-year 1992-93.  The data available shows little or no variation of a regional nature. There are no comparable school attendance data for post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>I am making copies of the report widely available, and I will be happy to receive the considered views of all interested groups.  I have already taken a number of initiatives to target areas of disadvantage, where the rate of absenteeism is highest. I have recognised the value of the homeschool-community liaison scheme in enhancing the educational participation of young people, and I have in the current school year placed the scheme on a formal footing.</P>
      <P>There is also an important role in this area for a school psychological service, and I recently announced the appointment of an additional ten psychologists as part of a phased implementation of a national psychological service for primary schools.</P>

      <P>Maintenance grants for third level students on higher education grants and vocational education committee scholarships are paid directly to the students &ldquo;care of&rdquo; the bursar's office or equivalent of the colleges attended.  Maintenance grants for ESF are paid directly to the students in monthly instalments by the authorities of the college attended.</P>
      <P>In the context of the revised arrangements for the administration of third level student support which are being planned for implementation in the 1995-96 academic year I will be examining the feasibility of having the student maintenance grant paid directly into an account in a financial institution of the student's choice.</P>
