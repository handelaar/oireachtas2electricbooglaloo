      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 18, 14 and 2. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything contained in Standing Orders, that business shall be interrupted not later than 4.45 p.m. today and No. 8 shall be decided without debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Government proposes to debate the Budget Statement all day. That is a complete waste of time because, whereas yesterday the Tánaiste defended the residential property tax, we read in the morning papers that the Government is proceeding to abandon it. There is no point in discussing a budget to which the Government is not committed. The Government clearly does not know what it is doing about the residential property tax issue, it is working by leak and innuendo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Foley. It is understandable that Deputy John Bruton does not want the budget to be debated. There is so much good news in it that he does not want people to be aware of it. I assure him that we intend to debate it here and convey the information to the public who very much welcome the budget proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to reflect on the situation as it existed last year, and the contrast between now and then. This time last year we had extremely high interest rates, speculation against the punt and a general lack of confidence in the economy. In contrast, we now have historically low interest rates, the lowest rate of inflation for 30 years, confidence in the Government and in the economy, and a general mood of prosperity. This is due to the measures being adopted by the Government. This budget should not be assessed in isolation, but taken as part of an overall plan by the Government to <Col N="605" /> set the economy on a sound footing. The primary focus of the budget is undoubtedly job creation, and in particular to help the less well off in our society, social welfare recipients or low-paid workers. The Minister has attempted to tackle the problem of low pay and has succeeded in his objective.</P>
    <P>The move to provide funds for small businesses is welcome. If we are serious about creating jobs in future, we must look to our own and provide the resources necessary to allow the small businesses of the present to be the big employers of the future. Too often the banks have charged such businesses penal interest rates. I welcome the move by the Government to assist such industries in their endeavours to expand, and I have no doubt it will lead to the creation of many jobs in the coming years. The provisions for such businesses of a fund of £100 million pounds at special rates and with less restrictive credit terms than in the past is welcome. In addition, subsidised loans from the European Union will be provided to entrepreneurs in this country. There is no doubt that our economy has the capacity to grow at an enormous rate, provided the fundamentals are right.</P>
    <P>This Government has again shown its commitment to the underprivileged in society by the manner in which it is addressing social welfare issues. I welcome the 3 per cent increase in social welfare payments which, as inflation in the past year was only 1.5 per cent, was a significant increase. I am also glad that the Minister paid particular attention to people with families and increased the children's allowance for people with three and more children. The family income supplement is an excellent benefit for people who are low paid, and I am glad that the Minister has again maintained the incentive for people to work by increasing the benefit payable under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased the Government decided to extend the CEDP to all areas of the country. I am aware of the excellent work being done under this programme <Col N="606" /> in the north side of Cork city. The programme has many advantages, not least that it gets unemployed people out to work and gives them a sense of belonging and pride because they are working for the money they receive. It has also helped to clean up many neglected areas of the city.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in respect of survivors' contributory pensions. I am glad the Minister for Social Welfare, in particular, finally recognises the position of widowers. There have been many campaigns to highlight the fact that widowers were not entitled to a pension from the State. I am glad that anomaly has been corrected in the budget and pay tribute to the Minister for Finance and, in particular, the Minister for Social Welfare for recognising an important need in the community. All Members should welcome that positive step.</P>
    <P>The changes in personal taxation are significant and have been widely welcomed. Most people regardless of their level of income, will benefit from the changes announced in the budget. I welcome the fact that the 1 per cent levy has been removed, and that all employed people will benefit from the widening of the tax band. The Minister has taken an important step in reducing the marginal relief rate of tax to 40 per cent. This is a reduction of 8 per cent and will improve considerably the take home pay of low income employees and, indeed, improve the incentive to work, for people who heretofore would have been taxed to the hilt later in the year. Low paid workers will benefit further from the removal of the health levy and the employment and training levy to the tune of 2.25 per cent. This is a significant boost for people earning less than £9,000 per annum. Employers will save a significant amount of money also with the PRSI contribution being reduced from 12.2 per cent to 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Those are significant changes in regard to tax for the low paid and will no doubt lead to the creation of more employment and make it easier for people in business at present to sustain existing levels of employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> Concern has been expressed about the reduction in mortgage interest relief. However, it is important to point out a number of facts in this regard. Everyone, regardless of the amount of the mortgage, is in a better position now than one year ago, due to the fact that interest rates have decreased substantially. For most people the saving will be in the order of 30 per cent on what they were paying last year.</P>
    <P>Another important point is that fixed rate products are now available under which people can tie in at a fixed rate of interest for anything from one to ten years, depending on their circumstances. They will not have to worry about increases in interest rates for a number of years. The changes proposed by the Minister in personal taxation are a step in the right direction. He has protected the low paid in our society while at the same time ensuring that most people benefit. It is a step in the right direction towards providing a more equitable tax system for all. Surely at the end of the day this is what we all want.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased the Minister decided to replace the existing urban renewal scheme which is due to expire on 31 July. There is no doubt the present urban renewal scheme which has been in existence since October 1985 was very successful in achieving what it set out to do, that is, stimulate construction activity and revitalise the areas of our cities that had become run down and dilapidated.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in this since my time in the Department of the Environment as Minister of State with responsibility for urban renewal. During that time I visited most of the areas that qualified under the designated area scheme and saw at first hand the excellent work that has been done in reviltalising those areas. There is no doubt the scheme has great merit. It achieved its objective and it is essential that such a scheme is continued in some form.</P>
    <P>I note that the Government decided to replace it with a more targeted scheme and this will no doubt promote employment <Col N="608" /> in inner city areas. I am glad the Minister also decided to extend this scheme outside of the cities to towns around the country. Those towns will benefit greatly from the schemes when the details become available.</P>
    <P>There is much merit in the proposal to launch a pilot scheme to encourage people to live on the upper portions of business premises in city centre areas which are at present vacant. It is essential that people move back to city centres to live if we are to create a vibrant atmosphere. One need only look to cities on the Continent where people live over business premises to see the effect and benefit that such an initiative can have for a city. If we can get people to live in our city centres it will be to the benefit of all in the long term, including businesses in the area.</P>
    <P>Thus if one combines the various proposals, it is clear that the Minister managed to create a very exciting and positive budget which offers growth potential to a range of sectors and individuals. It is important to acknowledge that many provisions have been included by the Minister to improve overall living standards despite the fact that the national finances are constrained particularly because of the burden imposed by the national debt. I note that in excess of £2 billion will be required to service the public debt in 1994; this is equivalent to £1 in every £6 of State expenditure.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the overall financial situation and the major funding needs of the Departments of Social Welfare, Education and Health, the Minister must be complimented on the variety of positive measures in the budget. Taking the budget's provisions in conjunction with the vital reductions in bank interest rates, the climate is becoming increasingly more sympathetic to the needs of developing industry. This development is vital if we are to make substantial progress in our efforts to create long term employment opportunities. While we must explore every avenue which offers the potential of job creation, a major breakthrough in this area can only be achieved if we fully harness the creativity <Col N="609" /> of home-owned enterprises. The work of the Government over the past year, and the specific achievements of the Minister for Finance in particular, have undoubtedly been of great benefit to our business sector. When one considers the formidable obstacles which must be overcome by the modern business man or woman if they are to survive in an increasingly competitive market place, it is clear that they both need and deserve our full support in their endeavours. Further to the measures introduced in this budget, and the overall improvement in the financial climate, I hope the changed structures in the organisation of the IDA also prove to be of benefit in the development of our indigenous business.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I emphasise my strong support for this budget. In particular, I would like to highlight two key features of the Minister's proposals, namely, a continuing commitment to the particular needs of social welfare recipients and the acknowledgment of the need to provide a boost to those directly involved in job creation. I fervently hope that the encouragement provided by this budget will be quickly built on to accelerate the ongoing development of our economy to the benefit of all the people of Ireland. At present far too many people have much to offer but do not have an opportunity to play a role in the economic life of the country. All of our efforts must be focused on meeting the urgent needs of such individuals. Various elements of this budget, taken in conjunction with the National Development Plan, provide the momentum necessary for the rapid expansion of our economy. All our people, but in particular those currently suffering serious economic deprivation, must benefit substantially as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wallace for sharing his time with me. I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on his excellent budget. I compliment the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, as this budget forms part of a coherent medium term strategy designed to give a substantial imptus to creating sustainable employment in <Col N="610" /> Ireland. Real and lasting social progress depends ultimately on the achievement of that objective.</P>
      <P>The Joint Programme for a Partnership Government sets out a strategic framework for continuing and accelerating the positive performance in respect of employment and living standards in recent years. As outlined in the National Development Plan, 1994-99, this involves keeping public finances on a sustainable course, a stable exchange rate within the EMS, moderate evolution of costs and incomes, developing the country's essential infrastructure and making the broad array of public policies more supportive of employment and investment. This budget involves further significant tax reform and management of the public finances aimed at supporting industry, employment and an increase in real take home pay.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of an extra £15 million from the proceeds of the tax amnesty for the maintenance of national roads, better known as county roads. This will bring the 1994 provision to £28.3 million, an increase of 113 per cent compared with the 1993 allocation. As the Minister pointed out in his statement, non-national roads have an important and social role in Ireland because of the dispersed nature of the population and for reasons associated with industrial development, agriculture, tourism and rural and urban development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Kerry, especially north Kerry, have the worst roads in Ireland. This was highlighted in the Tourism Development and Marketing Plan for Kerry, 1993-1998, commissioned by Kerry County Council and prepared by Tourism Development International last year. It identified the impact of tourism on the economy of County Kerry and set out a development strategy for the industry for coming years. The study further identified the condition of the roads structure throughout the county as a major inhibiting factor in the development of the industry. This is understandable considering the report also identified that 40 per cent of tourists to the county travel by private car, while a further 31 per <Col N="611" /> cent travel by hired car and a further 14 per cent avail of coach services. The increase in population in the county during the peak tourist season places a substantial strain on the road structure. One-fifth of all overseas visitors to the county expressed a desire for an improvement in the roads and this is the main recommendation of the report in relation to the infrastructure in the county.</P>
    <P>Other industries in the county are also affected by the road structure, as are the efforts of various agencies involved in attracting other potential industry to the county. The peripheral location of the county gives rise to difficulties in respect of attracting industry, and the present inadequate road system must be improved if we are to attract further development to the county. Agriculture, which is always modernising, is heavily dependent on an efficient road network. The number of county roads supporting tourist traffic is extensive in the prime tourist county of Kerry. For this reason I appeal to the Minister to make a special allocation available to Kerry County Council in view of the serious condition of the roads, particularly the county roads. Kerry County Council made a elaborate submission in respect of a roads development plan for the county direct to the Department of the Environment in June 1993 and I hope that submission will be given priority in respect of essential funding now required.</P>
    <P>A further £12 million for local authority housing in 1994 is welcome. This level of expenditure on local authority and voluntary housing schemes represents a further significant step in the Government's commitment to deal with local authority waiting lists and the provision of housing for those in need. In 1993 Kerry County Council built a total of 164 houses, which represents almost three times the number of houses built in 1992. That is a tribute to Kerry County Council and the local urban authorities. In the recent lists circulated by the Department of the Environment on housing I was pleased to note that those authorities were only second to the authorities in Donegal, who <Col N="612" /> built 200 houses during 1993. Having regard to the additional funding available this year, we in Kerry hope to increase still further the number of new houses built. That would help to reduce the housing waiting list in the county.</P>
    <P>I would like to see greater promotion of the shared ownership scheme. It is a great incentive to young people and where possible they should be encouraged to opt for it. If they are not given that encouragement they will be forced to apply for local authority houses and may have to wait a number of years in view of the numbers on the present waiting list.</P>
    <P>Extra funding should be made available to local authorities in respect of disabled persons grants and essential repair schemes as there are long delays in processing those applications due to a short-fall of sufficient funding. In many cases those applicants come from the weaker sections of our community and are not in a position to highlight their cases. Therefore, their particular circumstances merit special consideration.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should also encourage housing estates within their remit to set up development committees or residents' associations. This will allow residents greater involvement in the running of their estates, which is essential to ensure the type of quality housing services they require. Residents know better than anyone the strengths, weaknesses and problems of their estate. The involvement of residents in such organisations can improve the standard of estates and help prevent their deterioration, which can give rise to social problems. Such involvement would also be helpful to local authorities as they would have a direct link with various estates, but funding is essential in this area. It will not be easy to persuade residents that they have an important role to play and that their views count. In many cases residents have strongly held and sometimes divided views on the problems of their estates and how they should be tackled. Dialogue can take place within residents' associations and residents can play a constructive role in the active running <Col N="613" /> of their estates. They can be assured that the local authority will respond to such involvement in an appropriate way.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the 1992 Act provides the statutory framework for the delegation by a housing authority in respect of the management and control of their dwellings as one of its reserved functions. Such a body must be established by and be representative of residents of the area, or be established jointly by such residents and the authority of such other body as the housing authority may approve. An extra amount of £157 million has been provided in social welfare to improve the income of those who depend on social welfare to support families and jobs. It will help strengthen voluntary and community services and will also provide a major development in social insurance cover.</P>
    <P>For the first time widowers will be able to claim a contributory pension. The widowers contributory pension is long overdue and is a further development of our social insurance system. It is the most significant measure to be introduced in social welfare in recent years. It also marks a major step forward in providing support for families where the mother has died. The new widower's contributory pension will be introduced next October. It will be available to widowers on the same terms and conditions as currently apply to widows. Regarding contributory pension claims arising next October, under the new arrangement both widows and widowers will be entitled to a contributory pension for the first year, after which a qualifying earnings limit will apply. I am also pleased that existing recipients of widow's pension will not be affected by those new arrangements. They will continue to receive their pensions irrespective of their level of earnings.</P>
    <P>Further improvements have been introduced in respect of child benefit in line with the overall approach to the relevant child benefit as the main element of child income support. Last year the monthly rates for all children were increased to £20 for each of the first three children and £23 per child thereafter. In <Col N="614" /> this budget the higher rate of £23 is being increased and has been applied to the third and subsequent children. The new payment structure from next September will be £20 for each of the first two children and £25 for each child thereafter.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement is providing much needed support for workers trying to bring up families on low pay. The Minister for Social Welfare stated that this scheme take-up has increased compared to that of last year; some 9,600 families currently receive family income supplement and more than 30,000 children benefit from this payment. The substantial improvements in the scheme last year are beginning to have an impact in respect of its take up. Building on last year's improvements, the weekly income thresholds have been adjusted to take account of the tax measures announced in the budget. The eligibility thresholds are being increased by £10 and families will receive an increase of £6 per week.</P>
    <P>The means test in respect of the lone parents scheme has been eased to help improve the position of young mothers who wish to take up work. That measure is most welcome. The current earnings disregard of £6 per child is being replaced by a flat rate disregard of £30 and a 50 per cent taper will apply where earnings are greater than £30 per week. Where earnings exceed the new disregards the amount of lone parent's allowance payable will be reduced by £1 for each £2 earned instead of the reduction of £1 for £1 earned which previously applied. I understand the impact of this improvement will result in an increase of £18.90 per week for a lone parent with one child and earning £80 per week.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 3 per cent increase, changes are being introduced to the means test through provision of an earnings disregard of £100 in respect of working spouses. Most criticism of the allowance has focused on the means test, in particular where the spouse or the carer was working.</P>
    <P>Most welcome news in regard to social welfare is the remit of the free schemes. A pensioner being cared for by a recipient <Col N="615" /> of a carer's allowance will in future retain the free telephone rental allowance. Previously this was discontinued because the living alone conditions ceased to be satisfied. Pensioners aged 75 or over who no longer live alone will retain the free telephone rental allowance. The age requirement of 80 which applies in the case of retaining the free electricity allowance will also be reduced to 75. Widows between the age of 60, and 65 whose late husbands had entitlements to the free scheme will retain entitlement notwithstanding their age. This is most welcome, as for many widows, following the death of their late husband who was in receipt of these entitlements, payment was withdrawn if they were not of pension age.</P>
    <P>The free electricity allowance scheme is being extended to include night storage schemes. This extension will allow unused day time units to be offset against the cost of night time units, and will enable pensioners with night storage heating to maximise their units under the scheme. The free travel companion pass is being extended to all wheelchair users currently entitled to avail of free travel under the Department scheme. Payment of dependant allowance is being continued for six weeks after the death of an adult dependant. In the case of a retirement pension, old age contributory, old age non-contributory pension, pre-retirement allowance, and invalidity pension, payments will be provided for six weeks after death.</P>
    <P>A major problem in many cities and urban areas throughout this country is the question of money lending, especially leading up to holiday time and at Christmas. An additional £250,000 is being provided to combat the problems of money lending, bringing the total allocation to £750,000. I would like to compliment and congratulate the many credit unions that have moved in on this major problem. I can say without fear of contradiction that in Tralee and north Kerry the credit unions have been responsible for resolving many serious problems with regard to money lending. I hope to see <Col N="616" /> them get a substantial slice of this extra funding as it will help them to further develop and expand the household budget management services they provide.</P>
    <P>In regard to employers' PRSI, from 6 April 1994 a reduced rate of 9 per cent will be levied on incomes up to £173 per week. Above £173 the normal rate of 12.2 per cent will apply. This morning I received a fax from a leading factory in Kerry with 450 employees, all earning just over £200 per week. They do not benefit under the single threshold proposal of a lower employers' PRSI rate. What they are seeking is the more logical graduated creative PRSI that applies, for example, in the UK. Following this budget the company will face an annual bill of some £450,000 more than their UK competitor companies on employers' PRSI alone. They have further issued a notice to their workforce today confirming that the European currency market remains seriously depressed and is currently in a plus 20 per cent over-capacity position. This means that there will be further lay-offs which will continue indefinitely. Arising from this continual large gap between demand and capacity, it is forecast that manufacturing rationalisation in Europe is inevitable. I hope that before the Finance Bill is published this most important issue will be effectively addressed by increasing the £173 per week to approximately £220 to £230. This problem not only relates to Kerry but also to many other factories throughout the country.</P>
    <P>For the past number of years health boards have been complaining about their large overdrafts which have caused them serious problems. The Minister is to be congratulated on making available £100 million from the tax amnesty proceeds to restore the financial position of health boards and hospitals. In this regard the Minister should take a serious view in the future of any health board not working within its budget.</P>
    <P>Time constraints do not allow me to refer to many other excellent aspects of this caring budget. It is a budget by which the great bulk of taxpayers receive substantial <Col N="617" /> benefit. The low paid are especially catered for. Social welfare increases in the last two budgets were higher than inflation. Extra places have been provided in the new community employment scheme for the long term unemployed. This is a tremendous and caring budget and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Few Ministers in recent years have had as much flexibility as had the present Minister to produce a positive budget and no Minister in recent times has disappointed so many people. A token gesture has been made to the unemployed, the sick and the elderly by crediting them with a 3 per cent increase, which is just in line with inflation. However, there has been a vicious onslaught on the middle class and employers have been hammered once again.</P>

      <P>Those in the middle and particularly the upper-middle income groups may in future need their personal accountants to establish their true position. The extension of the residential property tax, by reducing the value of property and the salary threshold, basically can be seen as a reintroduction of domestic rates. This budget has all the signs of being heavily influenced by the Labour Party who have repeated their historic attack on those who are prepared to help themselves. However, this attack on the self-reliant will also add to the misery of those on housing lists and hospital waiting lists. The extension of the property tax and the reduction of tax relief on VHI and mortgage repayments will have the cumulative effect of increasing the number of people on housing lists and hospital waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget has attacked the engine <Col N="618" /> house of our system, those who attempt to finance their health care and housing needs. The property tax is a reintroduction of domestic rates which Fianna Fáil abolished in 1977. The tax is most unfair in that it will be paid with moneys that have been heavily taxed already. It is heaping insult on insult. The tax has been introduced in a brutal and hamfisted way and will have the effect of torpedoing household budgets and personal plans. All of these measures show that the budget is anti-family. I will address the anti-family elements in the social welfare code at a later stage. The extension of the property tax is the thin end of the wedge and this downward spiral is likely to be repeated next year. The aim is to impose property tax on all householders in the not too distant future. People who are prepared to house themselves and pay for their health cover have been dealt a savage blow. The decision to lower tax relief will have a negative effect on the construction industry. The number of people able to afford VHI cover will be reduced and many people will be forced back onto the already over-stretched and under-financed public health services.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest his morning to the chairman of the Labour Party, Deputy Jim Kemmy, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. He said he supports property tax. He trotted out the sickening, pathetic reasons and explanations for the imposition of this tax. He made the excuse that promises made before the election in November 1992 should not be taken too seriously. He said they were made in the heat of an election campaign and, therefore, were not bona fide promises. A promise made should be met.</P>
    <P>Am I to take it, then, that people should not take too seriously anything said by Deputy Kemmy between now and the European elections? Should we take any promises made by him between now and June as merely comments made in an election campaign which should not be taken seriously? If that is the yardstick used to measure the commitments made by him during an election campaign it does not say too much for his principles. <Col N="619" /> As I said, promises which are made should be kept.</P>
    <P>The 1994 budget will be remembered as a budget of broken promises and misrepresentation: it is the typical three card trick repeated so often by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern. This budget has certainly done nothing to help the lower paid, the Minister has failed to grasp this first real opportunity to significantly ease the tax burden on lower paid workers, thereby assisting job creation. Despite all the hype, most of the tax reliefs announced by the Minister will amount to very little. The Minister has broken the promises to increase all social welfare payments above the lowest income threshold of £60. One in every ten social welfare claimants will remain below that rate.</P>
    <P>The promises made to safeguard children have also been broken. All child dependant payments will be increased by 40p per week, not even enough to cover the bus fare to and from school. The increase in the child dependant allowance does not apply to the first and second children; the increases apply only to the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>The introduction of taxation on social welfare payments such as unemployment benefit is in line with the recommendations made by the Commission on Social Welfare. However, the increases in personal tax allowances should be high enough to ensure that those dependent on social welfare alone will not be taxed. The abolition of pay-related unemployment benefit was not unexpected, but these moves by the Government should be taken in the context of the implementation of all the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare &mdash; the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, was a member of that commission &mdash; and not merely the implementation of those recommendations which suit the Government.</P>
    <P>The budget shows a worrying trend towards the further erosion of the insurance based system. Unemployment benefit is still means-tested for those <Col N="620" /> made redundant, the deserted wife's benefit is similarly limited and now the widow's pension will be subject to an income limit. This trend, which corrupts our social insurance system, must not continue. I welcome the introduction of the widower's pension, but in giving pensions to widowers the first step is being taken to take pensions from widows. Such a reprehensible move will affect vulnerable and lonely people. It is a hard-headed, callous and cowardly act against widows which must be reversed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in the lone parent's allowance system which will enable lone parents to seek work. However, the rate of £36, irrespective of the number of children, is much too low for those lone parents who have more than one child.</P>
    <P>The Government has announced the creation of 30,000 jobs under the new community employment programme which will replace the present jungle of work schemes. In bringing all of these work schemes under one roof the Minister is moving in the right direction. However, I must remind the House that schemes are not real work. In referring to work schemes I must again put forward my views on the concept of an optional work programme, similar to the proposal put forward by the CMRS. I am interested to see the conditions the Government will attach to the 1,000 places which have been made available in the pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Fine Gael Party put forward its proposals in regard to an optional work programme, with the emphasis on &ldquo;optional&rdquo;. Here again I must express my party's unhappiness about the proposals put forward by the Progressive Democrats. People must be given the choice of whether or not to take a place on a work scheme. Work schemes are not a substitute for real jobs and must not be used as a weapon to remove people from the social welfare system. Therefore, all work schemes must be monitored to ensure that they progress towards providing quality training and real work experience.</P>
    <P>The budget was introduced at a time when ongoing negotiations were taking place between the Government and the <Col N="621" /> Irish Congress of Trade Unions on another agreement. This agreement must be closely monitored. Any new programmes must give priority to addressing the unemployment crisis and there must be a national strategy to solve the problem of long term unemployment and crate jobs. Even though it may be a wage agreement, it must go further and include provisions which will deal in a real way with the problems of the long term unemployed and which will make some effort to create real jobs for at least 10,000 of the people on the dole queue.</P>
    <P>The budget has failed to bring about changes in the social welfare schemes which would support work, eliminate many of the anti-family provisions in the social welfare code, reverse in full the dirty dozen proposals and remove many of the employment traps in the social welfare system. With regard to the anti-family elements in the social welfare code, the present system forces young people out of their homes in order to qualify for unemployment assistance. Having been forced out of their home they can then qualify not only for unemployment assistance but also for a rent allowance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. This provision is blatantly anti-family and is socially undesirable. Single young adults living at home are subject to the benefit and privilege rules, the stated intention of which is to value the board and lodgings received by them, but which actually constitute a one-sided sharing rule between parents and children.</P>
    <P>How can a system under which elderly people lose their secondary benefits, for example, free electricity and free phone rental allowances &mdash; described by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, as perks&mdash;</P>

      <P>At a time when there are widespread attacks on the elderly living alone, surely this provision is anti-family. Elderly persons obtaining social welfare payments in the form of old age non-contributory pensions stand to lose their pensions if they arrange to have someone live with them for security reasons &mdash; their income is means tested. As their income increases the amount they receive by way of pension decreases. At a time when there have been more than 12,000 reported attacks on elderly people living alone this provision is short-sighted and anti-social.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other anti-family elements in our social welfare code. The improvements in the carer's allowance will bring a further 500 people into the scheme, giving a total of approximately 5,000 recipients. Approximately 40,000 people thought they would qualify for this allowance. The Government should give further consideration to this issue &mdash; I have dealt with it in the House on previous occasions. Improvements in this allowance would lead to knock-on beneficial effects for everyone, the Government and recipients. There needs to be a co-ordinated approach between the Departments of Health and Social Welfare, which are inter-related, in regard to this issue. The new nursing homes regulations and the new grants scheme which has been introduced are now <Col N="623" /> regarded as inadequate in terms of meeting the real needs of people.</P>
    <P>Time does not allow me to go into this matter in more detail but in relation to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> talks, I will await with interest the outcome of the negotiations in the smoke filled rooms between the social partners and the Government and I will certainly be casting an eagle eye over the details of this agreement. There has been much hype and shadow boxing between the social partners. Many of the discussions concern wage levels but there must also be structured agreements and measures to eliminate poverty and provide meaningful work for all our people.</P>
    <P>On a positive note, I welcome the £2 million for improvements in special education for handicapped children in line with the recommendations of the recently published report of the Committee for Special Education. I understand that an allocation of £100,000 has been provided for escorts on buses taking children with special needs to and from school. In view of the very serious alleged incident in Cork, highlighted by me in this House and in an article in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> in December, the parents of children in Cork have demanded escorts on buses and are refusing to allow their children to travel without an escort. The Minister's decision, while long awaited, is nevertheless welcome. I hope steps will be taken immediately to implement the provisions of the report and that escorts will be available on buses for these very special children as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The prime objective of any budget, apart from all the other issues, should be the reduction of the number of people unemployed and in this key element the budget has failed miserably. Even though the Minister announced the creation of a new FÁS programme to replace the existing one it is already unacceptable to all the organisations to whom I have spoken. It is basically a budget to provide schemes, not jobs. All the Government has done is to create more expensive quangos which of course will be filled at the top by its political friends.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> The budget was once the highlight of the political year. It is now a damp squib because not alone is there a national jobs strategy but the level of taxation and economic planning is decided in a hotel room or in Government Buildings without any input from representatives of the Opposition parties or the unemployed. In dealing in a general way with the budget the Minister must be condemned for the basic thrust of his policy which is to attempt to create temporary jobs while ignoring the importance of saving existing jobs. The Minister could have preserved hundreds and possibly thousands of jobs but he chose not to reduce VAT on clothing, footwear and newspapers where jobs are very much at risk. The Minister has not yet learned that the cost of saving a job is far less than the cost of creating one. Only by manufacturing products for which there is a demand will jobs be created.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation in the budget for the refurbishment of Collins Barracks, Dublin. However, the Minister should not be parochial, he should look beyond Dublin because many large public buildings are lying idle in towns and cities throughout the country. Our Lady's Hospital, a major architectural gem on the outskirts of Cork city is lying idle. It is a former psychiatric hospital in the ownership of the Southern Health Board and will soon be in the same condition as the North Infirmary in Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister should knock some heads together in Cork, in his Department and the Departments of Education and Health, and come to a decision in relation to that building. It is an asset owned by the taxpayers and I forecast it will either be sold to private enterprise at a low price or vandalised. There should be a scheme whereby Departments would come together in a joint effort to save the building and put it to productive use. This could have been done in the budget by the allocation of sufficient funds, say, to the university in Cork who could set up a secondary campus there because its present campus is overcrowded. Unfortunately, there is a compartmentalised approach to issues such as these. The <Col N="625" /> Departments of Education and Health should make a joint effort to save that building and put it to proper use.</P>
    <P>Finally, will somebody in Government spell out clearly its attitude to claims by women seeking arrears of alleviation payments arising from the decision of the European Court on 13 March 1991 in the Cotter and McDermott application? I tried to get information from the Minister for Social Welfare yesterday in the House but, as usual, he side-stepped the issue. Will the Minister state: (1) the total number of applications to date as a result of the European Court decision; (2) the average payment to each person and where possible, allow persons who have received payments through solicitors to know what was paid out on their behalf and (3) to advise women of their rights in this regard? He must come clean because for too long he has attempted to mislead the public on this issue. Will the Minister agree that tens of thousands of women throughout the country are entitled to approximately £140 million in payments? Will he also agree that they have been treated shabbily and as second class citizens? They have been denied information on the scheme and their rights; some of them &mdash; and I will again use the word &mdash; have been practically blackmailed because they have been warned that if they made public the level of payments steps would be taken to take it back.</P>
    <P>Women paid through solicitors cannot establish what payments were made on their behalf. The Minister denied this yesterday but I have letters here, one dated 13 August from Mr. Fred Burke, Correspondence Section, in relation to a woman that I will identify to the Minister and whose PRSI number is 2268532. I have another letter dated 14 December 1993 from Mr. Liam Kavanagh, higher executive officer, in relation to a person whose PRSI number is 3496714NW. The letter states:</P>
    <P>(Mrs. X) was among a number of married women who initiated court proceedings arising from the delay in implementing EC Directive 79/7. Conditions <Col N="626" /> as to confidentiality were provided for in relation to settlements made in these cases and for that reason details of payments cannot be provided.</P>
    <P>This person asked me to obtain details of payments to her solicitor. She is denied the information and I am also being denied it. So much for open Government, it is more like the Secret Service.</P>
    <P>The letter from Mr. Burke states:</P>
    <P>(Miss X) was among a number of married women on behalf of whom legal proceedings were taken seeking arrears over and above the provisions of the Regulations. A settlement was made in this case and payment was made through the legal representative. I regret to inform you that the details of the settlement cannot be supplied.</P>
    <P>That women received approximately £5,000 from a solicitor but she does not know what payment was made by the Department on her behalf to the solicitor. That is not justice and in an open society, where taxpayers' money is involved, people should know their entitlements but in cases where people have been paid they cannot establish what settlements were made on their behalf. This is a matter on which the Law Society must take steps in relation to the client-solicitor relationship. Surely the Minister, as a representative of the taxpayer, should take steps to ensure that there is full disclosure of facts. There is no point in the Minister hiding behind the excuse that the courts took a decision and we are bound by the courts. Retention of information that should be made available to the public is wrong and should be rectified.</P>
    <P>I have posed certain specific questions to the Minister to which he should respond either here in the House or in public. I attended a meeting in Connolly Hall, Cork, the other evening at which there were 500 women attempting to establish their entitlements. I have been misled, the people have been misled and are now forced into taking legal action against the Department. A similar meeting will be held in Limerick next week, <Col N="627" /> another in Waterford and others in cities and towns nationwide. The women of this country are being treated as second class citizens and very shabbily by the Minister for Social Welfare. I ask that somebody be accountable for their actions in this House.</P>

      <P>Budget day has become a real circus. Indeed, the indoctrination programme begins the previous September, dependent on which spin the Minister for Finance wants. Whether the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, takes part in it I do not know. There are leaks, counterleaks, estimates and so on, all speculative. The general attitude in Government and among political parties to the budget is to treat the people very shabbily, letting them down totally. Since the budget is an annual event, covering a full calendar year, its provisions could be debated in an ongoing fashion. For example, if Dáil reform was moving in the right direction and we had committees which could call witnesses, I predict the overall attitude to the budget and its provisions would change. But at present budgets tend to be used to provide political advantage for the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>This year the Government proposed the extension of the residential property tax. Some few days after that extension was announced the papers are full of reports of U-turns on the part of the Government.</P>

Indeed, I <Col N="628" /> recall the present Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs say at that time, in strident terms, that he would lead them in and lead them out &mdash; in other words, the Labour Party were not for selling, that they had their principles. Indeed, the residential property tax constituted a real ideological principle on which they stood. In this House yesterday the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs shouted accusingly at the Fine Gael benches that as far as he was concerned the residential property tax was a Fine Gael tax.</P>

      <P>The answer is yes, the purport of this tax was the result of pressure by the Labour Party, and rightly so.</P>
      <P>He was addressing those remarks to former Deputy John Kelly, who represented the same constituency as the Minister of State sitting opposite, Dublin South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could read into the record much more of what the Minister for Equality and Law Reform had to say at that time, that this was an ideological tax the Labour Party had foisted on that Government. Yet they are using its extension to improve, as they see it, the socialist base in Government. I do not know exactly what game the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is playing. Yesterday he endeavoured to give the impression that he was trying to get out of this tax, that he would be examining anomalies, if any, and so on. In fact, when interrupted he began with a de Valera quote, fancying himself as a successor to de Valera saying &ldquo;As I was saying before I was interrupted&rdquo;. I wonder where is this man going? What status does he believe he <Col N="629" /> has attained in Irish politics? Is he now God? Is he the man who decides everything for all of us? He was very ruffled in the House yesterday when Deputy John Bruton produced the document showing the U-turns the Tánaiste had taken on what he had promised the electorate and recalling that the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, had told the people in Dublin South that she did not intend to do anything about the property tax or relief on VHI premia.</P>

      <P>Before beginning my contribution on the budget proper I should like to refer to some of Deputy Allen's remarks earlier. He made a very good point in relation to the hospital in Cork, which I shall take up with my colleagues. In addition, the point he made about access to information was important. I am at present preparing a Freedom of Information Bill. One of the legislative provisions we hope to enact in <Col N="630" /> this House will ensure that everybody will have the right to information in respect of their own cases. That point he made was a very valid one. Might I suggest to Deputy Allen, in regard to the insurance numbers he read out, if he would table specific questions on them they could be followed up. I am unable to answer in detail the Cotter-McDermott position because I am not directly involved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen also made some good points in relation to social welfare. Indeed, there are many recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare which have not yet been implemented. We are committed to implementing them in full over the lifetime of this Government. The points Deputy Allen made about the carer's allowance, benefit and privilege, the need to continually improve the rates of payment, all are important. In this budget we have implemented some improvements in the social welfare system, but we have by no means finished the job of having a modern social welfare system that deals with people who have no income of their own in a caring and dignified manner. There is still room for improvement in that area. Those points were well made by Deputy Allen.</P>
      <P>Some of the Deputy's party colleagues have characterised this Government as being a tax and spend one. Deputy Allen made a very good case for increases in spending in some social welfare areas. In that context I hope he will be looking at the volume of public spending, the need to ensure that, within prudent financial limits, we do protect the weakest in our society, such as the mentally handicapped, the people participating in special education, carers and so on, showing that we are willing to put our money where our mouths are in relation to them rather than adopting a Thatcherite, fiscal approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget was a budget for jobs, which reduced the tax wedge considerably, which targeted income tax relief, particularly for those with low and middle incomes, which saw the first reductions in employers' PRSI, which simplified and streamlined tax affairs for <Col N="631" /> small business. Most important &mdash; and this marks the first step in real reform of the tax system &mdash; it was a budget on the lines suggested in so many reports, Culliton, the Commission on Taxation and the NESC. It was also a budget which marked a significant improvement in the overall range of provision for the long term unemployed, who without specially targeted action are highly unlikely to benefit from any overall upturn in the economy, because generally the rising tide does not lift all boats.</P>
    <P>The strategy is to build on the National Development Plan's programme for job creation, by a complementary fiscal and tax strategy which will encourage the maximum job potential from this enormous investment. The prudent financial management which has seen interest rates tumble is a major fillip to investment and job creation. That prudent strategy has been continued in this budget.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this House maintains that the creation of employment is the first aim of economic and social policy. Attaining that aim involves change, sometimes taking tough decisions, if we are serious about tackling unemployment.</P>
    <P>It would have been easier for us to have proposed lower tax give-aways, and leave the structure of our tax system alone. That structure, which has penalised productive earnings as compared to property investment, left our economy with lower investment for growth and fewer jobs than would a tax system restructured on the lines on which the Government has embarked. The Opposition has consistently called for the implementation of the Culliton report. The core recommendation of that report is to move towards a tax system which rewards productive work within which individuals and businesses will seek markets rather than tax breaks. Those tax changes will deliver higher growth in employment in the economy. As a Government which is serious about its commitment to job creation it would be irresponsible to bypass <Col N="632" /> the opportunity to restructure the tax system when it was possible to do so while leaving families better off.</P>
    <P>One of the main concerns of the Government in drawing up the budget was to ensure that it would focus on the low paid. To reach those under the existing tax exemption thresholds, additional relief was given by abolishing the employment and training levies and health levies for those earning under £9,000. This would not have been possible otherwise as they are already under the tax exemption threshold.</P>
    <P>This focus on the lowest paid helps those most likely to face serious unemployment traps. Health and employment and training levies are being abolished for the low paid under £9,000; tax exemption limits are being raised by £100 for each child; the marginal relief tax rate is reduced from 48 per cent to 40 per cent for those slightly above the income tax exemption limits &mdash; this important measure will help reduce poverty traps and reduce overall marginal tax rates; personal allowances are being increased by £350 for a couple; family income supplement is up by £6 a week and children's allowances are being increased for families of three and more. In addition, the 1 per cent income levy is being abolished for all income earners.</P>
    <P>The net result of these changes is to leave all taxpayers better off through significant increases in their take-home pay. The percentage increases are particularly tilted towards the lower paid, with for example a 2.8 per cent increase in take home pay for a single person on £9,000, and a married couple with four children on £11,000 receiving a 4 per cent increase in take home pay. It is unique in any budget to have this kind of focus on the low paid with higher percentage increases for the lower paid, unlike, for example, the budget strategy adopted by the Progressive Democrats where the higher tax breaks went to the higher paid.</P>
    <P>The 27 per cent tax band is being widened by £1,050 for a couple. The 1 per cent income levy is abolished. A married couple on PAYE will not now move into <Col N="633" /> the top 48 per cent tax band until they reach an income of £22,186.</P>
    <P>There are substantial tax reliefs in this budget for the middle income earners. The abolition of the 1 per cent levy, the raising of the tax allowances and the increase in the tax bands mean that a couple on £25,000 will gain, on the income tax side, £640, a couple on £30,000 will gain £690, a couple on £40,000 will gain £790 and a couple on £50,000 will gain almost £900 from the budget's reduction of taxes on income.</P>
    <P>Despite the dog's dinner and the meal being made by the Opposition about modest changes to the existing residential property tax, it must be viewed in the context of tax changes. The bottom line is that the middle income taxpayer will be significantly better off after this budget. The substantial gains are countered balanced by the restrictions on mortgage relief, and the changes in property tax but the net effect is to leave families at this income range significantly better off.</P>
    <P>I would like to illustrate the rationale of the budget's strategy with a simple example. In deciding to give a net gain of, say, £200 to a taxpayer, the Government could choose between giving a straight £200 reduction in income tax or giving a £300 reduction in income tax counter-balanced by an extra take on the property side of £100. The net effect for the taxpayer is the same, a £200 reduction in tax. But broadening the tax base through the retructuring should have an important spin-off for jobs.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation, the Culliton report and the NESC all recommended a shift in our tax structure away from taxes on income and towards reducing tax reliefs on property. If property rather than production is the more profitable investment, our economy will continue to under perform in terms of jobs, and all of us will be the poorer.</P>
    <P>The property tax for an average family is only a small fraction of the income tax gain. The property tax on a house worth £85,000-£90,000, the highest valued houses brought into the net for the first time, is a maximum of £125 a year. To <Col N="634" /> be liable for the tax, you have got to be earning £25,000 a year. The gain at £25,000 from the income tax changes in the budget is £640, comfortably more than the extra property tax. At the very minimum the net gain is of the order of £500. In addition, many families will benefit from the 10 per cent discount for every child, and the marginal relief discount of 20 per cent for each £1,000 step of income from £25,000 to £30,000, so that many families would in fact pay considerably less than £125. The budget's provisions must be seen as a package &mdash; the scale of the gains on the income tax side are only made possible through broadening the income tax base. The changes in property tax and the other taxes were made only in the context of very substantial give-backs on the income tax side and in the context that people, at the end of the day, would be significantly better off in financial terms. The message has to go out that the middle income group will be significantly better off, even after the changes in the structure of the tax system after this budget.</P>
    <P>Social welfare benefits are being increased to reach the Commission on Social Welfare's priority rates, and in the case of unemployment and disability benefits the increases are 10 per cent. This is accompanied by special measures targeted at the low paid and designed to reduce poverty traps, particularly unemployment traps.</P>
    <P>In addition to the macro-economic strategy to increase total employment, the budget has particular strategies to ensure that unemployed people are facilitated in taking up new job opportunities. The budget, plus the National Development Plan, will increase the total number of jobs in the economy. By tackling the poverty trap problem it will be financially realistic for people who are now unemployed to take up employment because of the manner in which we have targeted tax reliefs on the low paid.</P>
    <P>The budget provides for a major expansion of the range of measures to address the needs of the unemployed, and particularly the long-term unemployed, with the community employment <Col N="635" /> programme which will provide up to 40,000 places, providing work, education and training and progression opportunities for the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed. The changes we anticipate in overall employment levels as a result of this budget will not in themselves lift the long term unemployed out of that position. We are aware from surveys carried out by the Tallaght Partnership that private employers are not particularly interested in recruiting from people who have been unemployed for more than a year. The figures indicate clearly that if you have lost your job for over a year the chances of obtaining employment within the next year tend to be under 20 per cent. The chances of obtaining employment in year three are reduced to about 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>We will not reach into the heart of unemployment without specific measures targeted at the long term unemployed, and that is what the community employment programme is designed to do. This programme has been developed through learning from the experiences of other labour market programmes like social employment schemes, CEDP and VTOS, learning from the good and the bad aspects of these programmes, examining the research and evaluation of these programmes and, most importantly, from listening to the needs of the long term unemployed. This is not just another scheme, it is a programme developed through looking at the good and the bad aspects of these programmes and from listening and learning.</P>
    <P>In the light of the current levels of unemployment we have to do something about the long term unemployed, to reawaken the economic potential and bring them back into the economic mainstream: that is what the community employment programme is trying to do. First, the programme is about providing work for people who want to contribute their talents and energies to our society. It is about getting work done which would otherwise not be done in local communities, particularly in the long term unemployment blackspots, and <Col N="636" /> in State agencies and local authorities. Second, the programme is about development. It is not a make-work scheme, it is about giving people a real opportunity to enhance and develop their skills. The long term unemployed tend to be those who lost out on the education system, those who left school early or left without formal qualifications.</P>
    <P>The programme is about providing second chance education and development opportunities so that people can compete fairly in the labour market. It is about progression, and throughout its term participants have access to supportive counselling and job guidance. The aim of the programme is to facilitate people to move out of community employment into jobs on the open market. The programme is about targeting the long term unemployed and 25 places will be set aside for young people in this category.</P>
    <P>The programme is also about ensuring that people do not lose out because they take part, and secondary benefits will be preserved. On average people will work for 20 hours per week and will end up better off financially than when they were on social welfare. They will also be free to take up other work, education or training courses in their free time.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum, on which I am the Government representative, is undertaking a detailed examination of long term unemployment, including non-market work initiatives. We are starting here, but the programme is not written in tablets of stone and we will continue to listen, to learn from experience and to change the programme in the light of experience. One thousand places on the programme will be allocated to a pilot programme based on the recommendations of the CMRS. We want to try out their innovative and imaginative proposals so as to give a better deal to the long term unemployed, reawaken their economic potential and bring them back into the economic mainstream. This budget focuses on jobs, particularly on lower paid jobs, giving good increases in income to those in the lower and middle <Col N="637" /> income brackets and also targets the long term unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald said, this budget is about jobs. The Labour Party's priority in this budget is the creation of jobs. This budget will stimulate the economy and improve even further the prospects for growth over the next couple of years. It is part of an overall strategy which, together with the National Development Plan and the Public Capital Programme, will maximise the employment potential of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>In the 1992 general election the Labour Party campaigned on the theme &ldquo;put justice into economics&rdquo; and this budget is continuing evidence that we are remaining faithful to that pledge.</P>
      <P>This budget has initiated a process of tax reform and widening of the tax base. Through the years other political parties have called for and promised tax reform but none has ever had the courage and the conviction to carry out any significant reform of the tax system. I do not see any Member on the Opposition benches who has the courage to carry out widescale tax reform. However, the Government has started a process of tax reform which it intends to implement in full during its lifetime.</P>
      <P>PAYE workers, in overall terms, are now beginning to see substantial relief for the first time in many years. For a start, the budget abolished the 1 per cent income levy. In addition, there have been radical improvements for workers on low pay. The 2.25 per cent health and employment levies have been abolished for hundreds of thousands of workers on incomes of up to £9,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to distributing the tax burden to other sectors in society, the Government is still committed to significant levels of social spending. Deputy Yates has accused us of being a tax and spend Government. Is he seriously going to tell the people of his constituency and mine that they cannot have decent schools and good housing? Last year the Government built more than <Col N="638" /> 3,500 local authority houses and we intend to keep up the momentum in this area in 1994. People want good services and amenities; they do not want the stingy attitudes that we have been hearing from Deputy Yates.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to what my Department is doing in this area, in particular, to the urban renewal scheme, and the changes made to it in the budget. The present scheme, having been extended several times, is due to expire on 31 July next. Its success has been two-fold. The scheme demonstrated that urban decline can be halted. In just a few short years, the scheme has managed to dramatically transform once run-down and under-utilised areas into thriving business and residential communities thus creating physical, economic and social improvements to the areas that will remain long after the tax incentives have gone. The scheme has generated a substantial number of construction jobs and, most important, a significant number of long term term jobs.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report that by the end of June last year the urban renewal scheme had generated 869 projects with an estimated value of £654 million between projects in progress and those already completed with a further £423 million in planning. What has been clear to all is that without the incentives offered under the urban renewal scheme to prime these areas for development, the vast majority of these projects would have gone ahead and decline would have continued unabated. An important and pleasing aspect of the scheme has been the return of private sector housing to city centre locations. As far back as 1988 the Labour Party campaigned to breathe life back into our cities. This is especially visible in Dublin today as it is estimated that more than 50 per cent of purchasers of apartments in inner city Dublin are owner-occupiers &mdash; an undoubted vote of confidence in the future of Dublin as a truly living city.</P>
    <P>It was imperative, therefore, that the task of urban renewal should not be abandoned midstream. Rather, the proposals announced in the budget are the result of <Col N="639" /> a major review of the present scheme and an examination of the future role of urban renewal policy.</P>
    <P>The new proposals will encourage residential development in particular and will favour refurbishment over new building. The existing owner-occupier allowance will be retained at 50 per cent but will be increased to 100 per cent for refurbishment works. Allowances for provision of private rented accommodation &mdash; section 27 allowance &mdash; will be retained at the present level.</P>
    <P>Under one initiative, the maximum floor area for refurbished apartments will be increased from 90 to 125 square metres in designated areas. It has been argued in the past that the conversion of large buildings such as Georgian houses into separate residential units within the existing 90 square metre requirements for incentives has proved difficult to achieve without loss of overall character and appearance. It has also been argued that the size restrictions militate against family size apartments. In the same vein of conservation, pilot projects are being initiated in Cork, Dublin Galway, Limerick and Waterford to bring unused floor spaces back into every-day residential use. With city living becoming a reality once more, it is essential to maximise the available space in existing buildings. Under this measure, up to three streets will be designated in each of the cities for tax incentives to promote the living over the shop idea. We are also looking in detail at ways in which any obstacles to the success of such projects can be overcome.</P>
    <P>The new proposals will focus on areas where dereliction is most severe. The overall acreage of designated areas in the five cities will be considerably reduced and in the process some new areas will be included. It is intended generally to retain the designated areas in the provincial towns participating in the existing scheme. In addition it is also considered appropriate at this stage to extend the areas designated under the new scheme to include small areas in the following towns, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Killarney, <Col N="640" /> Mallow, Monaghan, Mullingar, Navan, Nenagh, Newbridge and Wicklow.</P>

      <P>This budget has been the best budget for housing for many years. It has specifically provided an extra £12 million for the local authority housing programme, an extra £2.5 million for remedial works, an extra £1.5 million for the provision of bathrooms, a special provision of £3 million for the replacement of windows in flat complexes and an extra £2 million for the Task Force on Housing Aid for the Elderly. These extra provisions &mdash; totalling £21 million &mdash; are on top of the already greatly increased provisions for the social housing programmes, including both local authority and voluntary housing in the 1994 Estimates.</P>
      <P>In the Programme for a Partnership Government we promised 3,500 local authority housing starts or acquisitions in 1993. In fact, we achieved 3,800 by taking up unused starts carried over from previous years; about 300 of these represented the purchase by local authorities of existing houses. The capital allocation for the provision of local authority housing was increased by more than 60 per cent in 1993 and we are now increasing it by a further 95 per cent to £129 million in 1994. This massive increase is necessary to secure completion in 1994 of the dwellings commenced in 1993 and to provide for a further 3,500 starts this year. This means that in 1994 a total of 7,000 council houses will be under construction with a jobs content of 14,000 in construction and downstream industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the strategy set out in the plan for social housing, the voluntary housing sector continues to make a growing contribution to meeting our <Col N="641" /> social housing needs. The 1994 provision for the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme is being increased to £13 million and that for the rental subsidy scheme is being increased substantially to £20 million.</P>
    <P>Between the completion of new dwellings, the purchase of existing dwellings and vacancies in the existing local authority housing stock, I expect that local authorities will rehouse well over 6,500 households in 1994. The voluntary sector should provide up to 1,000 additional units of accomodation and I expect that the £40 million provision for the shared ownership scheme will allow 1,100 shared ownership transactions to be completed. It might be easier to use the abbreviation for this scheme, the SOS, as it is a tongue tier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking these and all the other social housing measures together, I am confident that we will secure accommodation for at least 9,000 households in 1994 and 1995 compared to 7,000 in 1993 and only 6,000 in 1992. This level of output will mean a vast improvement in the housing prospects of every household on local authority waiting lists.</P>
      <P>We are committed to providing as quickly as possible bathroom facilities in local authority dwellings that still lack them. Accordingly, the allocation for the bathrooms sub-programme will be increased from £2.5 million in 1992 to £4 million this year in line with the Programme for Government. The commitment of extra funding will enable authorities to eliminate this deficiency in their housing stock and ensure that no local authority tenant will any longer have to put up indefinitely with the absence of such a basic facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that many Members on both sides of the House have an interest in the scheme of special housing aid for the elderly and I am particularly pleased that it has been possible to double the provision for this scheme from £2 million to £4 million. This is a very worthwhile <Col N="642" /> scheme which has in many cases helped old people stay in their own homes rather than having to move into local authority accommodation, health board care or private nursing homes. The work is carried out at no cost to the applicant. We expect to clear the backlog under this scheme this year.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, this is the best budget for housing which has been introduced for many a long day. When account is taken of the extra £21 million capital provided in the budget, the total housing capital provision for 1994 reaches £295 million, an increase of 58 per cent on the provisional out-turn for last year, and will more than double what was spent in 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the previous two speakers one would think that everything was rosy in the garden and that this was the greatest budget of all time. However, I can only describe it as a non-event because it displays a lack of enthusiasm and drive to arrest the scourge of rising unemployment. Indeed, it is commonly described as &ldquo;Bertie's buckshot budget&rdquo; by countless thousands of people who see no light at the end of the tunnel to deal with this unemployment malaise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that our major industries are agriculture, fisheries and tourism. What fillip will the budget provide for these important industries? Can the Minister point to one measure in his Budget Statement that will lead to the creation of extra jobs in any one of those three industries? In his lengthy statement, which ran to 48 pages, not once <Col N="643" /> did the Minister for Finance mention the fishing industry, which is of importance to the economy, or give any indication that financial aid would be made available to develop this vital industry, which has the greatest potential of all our natural industries for job creation. There is no early retirement scheme for fishermen, even though they pursue an arduous life. The motto of this Government is that fishermen must not retire, only drown while their craft are towed astern by foreign trawlers.</P>
    <P>Neither was it mentioned that fishermen would be allowed to avail of small business expansion loans, even though most fishing boats are family owned with a crew of four to six people. If there was ever an industry which deserved recognition by the Government it is fishing, which has been regarded as a cinderella industry for many years. Is the Minister aware that white fish trawlers have been unable to go to sea for the past ten weeks due to inclement weather conditions? Why has the Minister not set up a £1 million relief fund to aid these beleaguered fishermen like their counterparts in the horticultural and potato growing industries?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister for Finance aware that our farmers find themselves in a serious predicament at present? Millions of pounds due to them in cattle headage, suckler cow, beef cow, ten month and 22 month beef premium, sheep headage and ewe premium payments have not been paid. Coupled with this, in seeking to secure a viable suckler cow, beef cow and ewe quota they have been subjected to degrading treatment by Commissioner Steichen, who rides roughshod over the European Union book of regulations. Is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry going to accept this treatment like a lamb going to the slaughter?</P>
    <P>Why must farmers wait five years for an extension of the disadvantaged areas and reclassification from mildly handicapped to severely handicapped status? It is clear that red tape and bureaucracy, together with lack of control and vision, have led to the greatest débâcle <Col N="644" /> in the European Union. By virtue of the fact that this is the only island nation in the European Union this country should be given preferential treatment within the Union.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the euphoria over the budget. Perhaps section 31 of the Broadcasting Act should be applied to all members of the Cabinet to ensure that they are not able to hoodwink the ordinary taxpayer with promises of good times around the corner when the direct opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>On the national airwaves last week the Minister for Social Welfare boasted that people earning less than £25,000 per year had a positive future. It is apparent that life is like a game of snakes and ladders. It seems that an Irish citizen is not allowed to earn more than £25,000 per annum because if they do they will find themselves in a poverty trap which is worse than being on the dole. If they live in a respectable area and earn the sum of £25,000 they will be liable to property tax if the value of their house exceeds £75,000. This is the thin edge of the wedge so far as the introduction of rates on houses is concerned. No Minister in the Cabinet could be so naive as to believe otherwise. Does the Minister for Finance want to reduce middle income earners to paupers?</P>
    <P>The Minister saw fit to increase taxation on the old reliables &mdash; drink, cigarettes, petrol and diesel. In 1900 with one pound sterling one could purchase 80 pints of stout. In the early fifties the first inter-Party Government under the leadership of John A. Costello reduced the price of the pint by 3d. Successive budgets have increased the price of the pint so that it is at a staggering £2 today. How long more can the ordinary working man enjoy his pint at this exorbitant price?</P>
    <P>It was a welcome relief when the price of petrol and diesel was reduced recently, but the Minister eroded the benefit to the consumer by increasing the duty by almost 10p per gallon and this will have dire consequences for all business people.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would provide <Col N="645" /> £15 million from the tax amnesty towards maintenance of all non-national roads. Although it is a step in the right direction it is only a paltry sum in the light of the serious condition of the roads in question. When £5 million is divided between the almost 30 county councils in the country it will amount to only £.5 million per county. Will Cork, with an area equal to one-eighth of the country, get its fair share? What about the £8 million Whiddy package that was siphoned off by a previous Fianna Fáil Government to pave Grafton Street for the millennium celebrations? Will the Minister for Finance restore that £8 million to the people of west-Cork for housing, roads and other important needs in the area?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Stagg, said that in overall terms PAYE workers were beginning to see substantial relief for the first time in many years. He said that for a start the Government had abolished the 1 per cent levy and that there had been radical improvements for workers on low pay. What about the increases in their medical expenses? Medical expenses must now exceed £150 for an individual and £300 for a married couple before anything can be recouped. Before the budget, medical expenses had only to exceed £50 and £100 respectively. Is this a step in the right direction? Rosy speeches are all very fine but they do not provide bread. These provisions are cold comfort to the people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the special scheme to restore premises had been extended to towns and he named the following towns: Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Killarney, Mallow, Monaghan, Mullingar, Navan, Nenagh, Newbridge and Wicklow. He completely forgot about Bandon, Kinsale, Clonakilty, Skibberreen, Dunmanway, Bantry and Castletownbere. These towns are of equal importance and have the same problems as the towns that will now get direct assistance from the Government.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government faced up to its responsibilities. In the last 12 months unemployment has continued to <Col N="646" /> increase. The number of jobs created is completely eroded by factory closures and other job losses throughout the country. Common sense must prevail. The Government cannot continue to place the emphasis entirely on the capital in which 1.5 million people live. Rural Ireland must also be saved. The population in rural Ireland is dwindling day by day and we will see vast tracts of land from Malin Head to Mizen Head completely underpopulated. They will end up as a safari park for wealthy tourists coming to view the wild animals that will roam through that area if there is no change in Government policy and a move towards the renewal of rural Ireland and the preservation of the population in that part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Sheehan for sharing his time with me. First, I recognise that there are some positive provisions in this budget. The 1 per cent levy has been done away with. However, that should never have been introduced so all we are doing is rectifying an unjust situation. Second, there is the proposed exemption of the spouse from probate tax. That, again, is a recognition of all the arguments we put up on this side of the House at the time of the last Finance Bill, which were totally ignored at the time. Thankfully, those arguments have now been recognised and this provision has been backdated to the date of its introduction. It is a step forward, but that tax should not be levied at all; it still causes enormous hardship to the widows, widowers and orphans that are left behind and is totally anti-family. Sudden death, death by accident or because of serious disease, results in families having to go through enough trauma without having to pay this unjust tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the £100 million from the tax amnesty to relieve the over-expenditure of the health boards in recent years is also welcome and I hope it will ease some of the pressures on our hospitals and the health service generally. It must be remembered, however, that some health boards acted responsibly. I speak <Col N="647" /> specifically of the North-Eastern Health Board which did not over-expend to the same extent as many others. They must be rewarded for their efforts to keep within their budgets. My constituency of Cavan-Monaghan desperately needs financial aid to upgrade the hospital services, an immediate injection of capital to employ extra specialists and, above all, nurses. In Monaghan General Hospital there is a crisis; it has the lowest staff-patient ratio in the country. The nurses deserve better treatment than they are getting there at the moment. Health boards that have kept within their budgets must be recognised for doing so and those that have over-spent should be curtailed.</P>
    <P>The increase in social welfare benefits is also welcome. The 300,000 people unemployed and those in need, including the handicapped, widows, the aged, etc., need recognition and we on this side of the House fully support that. However, there is a sting in the tail because that increase will now be taxed and taxed at source. This is a retrograde step and we in Fine Gael have made that clear in the last few days.</P>
    <P>The increase in child benefit and the improvement in the family income supplement is also to be welcomed as is the recognition of the right to widowers to a pension. This is the first time it has been recognised in this House that a widower suffers similarly to a widow on the death of a spouse, but here again there is a sting in the tail because they will be subject to a means test after one year. Those who were taxed under the PAYE system and paid PRSI throughout their working lives are aware of the seriousness of that measure. We must recognise that those who contribute to the State and work hard all their lives are as entitled to their rightful share as those who decide not to work or provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>In theory it appears there will be a major change in respect of the carer's allowances in that the system will be loosened up to allow carers receive adequate assistance but, in relaity, that is not the case. A sum of £1 million was <Col N="648" /> allocated this year and £1.5 million for next year. One would not need to be a great mathematician to realise that will give approximately 350 to 400 carers their proper allocation this year. It will mean that this year my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan can hope to get a proper allowance for approximately ten carers for the work they do for their loved ones. That will probably mean five carers in County Monaghan. Does that represent a major step forward? The proposal may appear worth while but the reality is somewhat different.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Minister's commitment to provide extra funding for the improvement of school structures. For many schools in my constituency that is necessary. I welcome the Minister's commitment to build new schools in Killaney and Glaslough. I have called for the building of those schools on many occasions since I was elected to this House. A total of 27 schools were built in Galway in a few years compared with three in Monaghan in the same period. Monaghan has a long way to go to catch up. If not this year, I hope the Minister will take realistic steps to rectify the position in the county in the near future. Many schools there need major improvements. However, I welcome the funds allocated to improve sanitary and other facilities in Monaghan schools. Once again, the middle income group were given no hope in this budget in respect of third level education. In other words, that group will still be means-tested and receive no tax relief or other benefit to assist them in sending their children to third level colleges.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment spoke about the remedial works which need to be carried out to houses and about the improved housing programme. I welcome that, but many people who were encouraged, and in some cases forced, to buy their homes in the past number of years are now on social welfare. They were looking forward to receiving some assistance or grant structures to carry out improvement works to their houses. The Government has made its position on <Col N="649" /> private housing clear. The Labour Party element of the Government does not believe that people should have the right to own their own houses and people are now faced with the changes in the residential property tax which amount to a reintroduction of rates by the back door.</P>
    <P>During the last general election we were told there would not be any changes in residential property tax or mortgage interest relief. In fact we were told there would be an improvement in regard to them. We were also told that there would not be any change in tax relief on VHI premiums. The middle income group has once again been ignored in this budget and unless the people tell this Government otherwise in the European elections in June it will not be a residential property tax limit of £75,000 that will apply next year but £50,000 or even less. It was indicated here yesterday, and again today, that the income limits would be considered sympathetically. That was a reaction to Niall Andrews MEP and others who said that this measure will affect their election prospects. There is no doubt that the commitments of the Labour and Fianna Fáil parties prior to the last election are being reneged on. One has only to reflect on the message from the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs in this House yesterday. His answer was &ldquo;no&rdquo; to everything he promised. The main party in Government said it could make it happen and it has.</P>
    <P>Unlike West Cork, which was not designated for any urban renewal schemes we were in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. A total of 21 acres was allocated for redesignation in Longford, and the Minister referred to Cavan-Monaghan as a small area. We will watch with interest what will happen in the town of Monaghan when that area is designated to see if 21 or five acres are designated. Many people in the town of Monaghan are concerned because they have spent a great deal of money building up their businesses. They will now be excluded and outsiders can come in, reap the benefits and put local people's businesses at risk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> I welcome the exemption in respect of the 2.25 per cent levy and the change in PRSI for the low paid. When Fine Gael put forward a proposal in this House for a change in PRSI for low paid workers it was laughed at by Government backbenchers and we were told it could not be done. I am glad the Government decided to accept that PRSI is an unrealistic burden on job creation and has removed some levies. If we do not make it possible for people to work and industries to remain competitive there is no hope for the 300,000 people unemployed. This budget is supposed to benefit the unemployed, but what will it do? A total of 40,000 people are being put on special schemes. That will change the figures enormously but will not give any long term hope to those out of work. We need a much better thought-out package and a more realistic structure to give hope to those people.</P>
    <P>A measure which will impact greatly on my constituents is the increase in the price of petrol, diesel and drink. It is unfortunate that at a time when we are trying to develop good communications with Northern Ireland &mdash; although the Minister present may not agree &mdash; the price of drink, petrol and diesel is increased. Also, this is taking place at a time when traders in Border areas are building up their businesses again.</P>
    <P>My main concern relates to roads. The roads in Cavan-Monaghan have been a major issue in recent years. I welcome the fact that the Minister has allocated £15 million for road improvements. If that figure was solely for the Cavan-Monaghan area I would be quite happy, but it is obvious from the comments made by my colleagues Deputies Sheehan and Foley that all areas have bad roads. Nevertheless, it is recognised nationally that the roads in Cavan and Monaghan are deplorable. Some roads have practically disappeared because of heavy traffic in that area and it is accepted that funding is needed to improve them. If companies are to remain in business and retain the employment created, not by foreign industries but by local industries developed by the people of Cavan and <Col N="651" /> Monaghan without much help from the Government, the roads issue must be addressed. The roads structure is an important issue for the people in Cavan and Monaghan. The railroad closed in 1957 and although an annual amount of £100 million is allocated to subsidise bus services, those counties receive no funding by way of compensation for the lack of a rail service. Between 60 to 70 per cent of our poultry industry and more than 60 per cent of our mushroom industry are located in Cavan and Monaghan. Local authorities in those counties will receive only a pittance from the budget allocation, each county will probably receive £0.5 million. At the same time, £10 million is allocated to prepare Dublin Castle for special EU meetings and another £10 million for initial improvement works to Collins Barracks. They may be important issues but the people of Cavan and Monaghan consider the paltry allocation to those counties of £15 million of the proceeds of £200 million collected under the tax amnesty to be inadequate. We need action now in respect of roads in those constituencies.</P>
    <P>An independent report prepared by council officials recommended that it would cost £48 million to carry out essential road works in Monaghan to bring them up to an acceptable standard. It would cost a similar figure to carry out road works in County Cavan, yet the total budget allocation for such road works is a mere £15 million. County road funding has been promised by the EU and will probably be granted if there is a commitment to press for such funding, but it is not guaranteed. The proceeds of the tax amnesty presented an opportunity to provide funding for the repair of those roads. When I spoke on the debate on the tax amnesty, which my party opposed, I said I would support it to some degree if the proceeds were used to restructure the roads of Cavan and Monaghan. We can no longer tolerate this situation. Tourists, farmers and people travelling to work have their cars wrecked by travelling on those roads; indeed lorries and buses refuse to travel on them. The conditions <Col N="652" /> have not been caused by this year's weather but because successive Governments failed to recognise they have a responsibility in respect of the roads of Cavan and Monaghan. There has been a slight increase in road grants in recent years, yet we are constantly told by Government Deputies that the increase has been massive. Unless you consider the total figures allocated to a county council you will not get the true picture. Over a ten year period the local authorities in the Cavan-Monaghan area did not receive £31.5 million in rate support grants. If they had we would not have a problem in respect of the roads in those counties today. If local authorities in those counties had received some monetary recognition for not having a rail service or an airport serving industries which produce pigs, poultry and furniture, we would not now be out with the begging bowl. I hope the Minister will tell the Ministers for Finance and the Environment that the people of Cavan and Monaghan can no longer tolerate the condition of the roads in those counties.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Costello. Tá ríméad orm deis a fháil labhairt sa díospóireacht seo ar cháináisnéis 1994.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on the 1994 budget. I listened with great care to the contributions of Deputies opposite. Many of the urgent issues of rural renewal in respect of which Deputy Sheehan spoke are concerns which I share. He has lost none of his usual forthrightness and vigour in presenting a strong case for that general issue and particularly for west Cork. The thoughtful contributions of Deputy Crawford are welcome and the points he made in relation to the future development of our economy and its regional focus are worth bearing in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt when the immediate reactions to the budget of those who eagerly awaited it and who commented on it have died down, the question those people will want to ask is whether it contributes to employment. The biggest <Col N="653" /> single difficulty facing our people is the issue of unemployment and of turning growth into jobs. I have no doubt that, on reflection, this budget will be seen as a significant contribution to employment creation, enabling us to take advantage of improved circumstances in the external economy. When we combine the measures in the budget with those of the capital development programme of the National Development Plan, we will be able to create a further engine of growth which will help translate growth into jobs that are urgently needed. No member of the Government suggested that the existing level of unemployment is satisfactory. It behoves us to do more than comment on this. Rather than simply stating the problem of achieving growth, we must create jobs. We must be seen to be taking strategic measures which facilitate investment in the economy and job creation in varying numbers in different areas. I have no doubt that in the fullness of time when the provisions of the budget are combined with other Government measures the budget will be welcomed as a significant development.</P>
    <P>When the heat in respect of the budget proposals has evaporated it is important to recognise that personal allowances have been increased this year to a figure that represents total increases for the past six years; the standard rate tax band has been widened by four times the rate of the most recent inflation figure. Before this budget a single worker on an annual income of below £11,000, with normal PAYE and PRSI allowances would have been taxed at the upper rate, now he or she can earn up to £11,636 before paying it. The budget focused on the lower paid and on the vulnerable in society in an economy that needs to be invigorated. It also focused on important solidarities. I invite those who criticised the taxation measures in the budget to ask themselves if they would prefer us not to provide 3,500 houses in the current year as we did last year. Do they object to an additional allocation to maintain the attack on health waiting lists? Do they object to investing additional moneys in education, particularly special education? It <Col N="654" /> is an aspect of social solidarity that we take such measures, but they must be paid for in a way that, far from adversely affecting the lower paid and the vulnerable, will be apportioned in a just way through extension of the tax net. In relation to the area for which I have responsibility, Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, níl amhras ann ach go raibh dea-scéalta móra sa cháinaisnéis don Ghaeltacht féin agus do réimsí a bhaineann leis an ealaíon, leis an gcultúr agus le cúrsaí oidhreachta agus be mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoi sin.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to be able to secure an additional £1 million for An Chomhairle Ealaíon to the sum originally proposed in the Abridged Book of Estimates, thus increasing its funding from £11.5 million in 1993 to £13.25 million in 1994. When I became Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht the allocation available to the Arts Council was £10 million and this figure is being increased in 1994 to £13.25 million. This represents an increase of more than 15 per cent in one year and follows an increase of 13 per cent last year. Since this Government took office the increase in this area has been more than 30 per cent, a significantly greater increase than the commitments made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for a Partnership Government. This is money well spent. An Chomhairle's research has established that every pound invested in the arts generates an additional £1.80 in the arts community. The money made available to An Chomhairle in the current year will therefore represent an overall injection of more than £37 million into this creative and, I emphasise, labour-intensive sector of the economy. The spending of the Arts Council has a multiplier effect throughout the community.</P>
    <P>In raising the level of funding to An Chomhairle Ealaíon I am simply acknowledging the vital role it plays in the development of the artistic and cultural life of the nation and I am underlining its importance in the future to the mission this Government has undertaken. <Col N="655" /> We are committed to putting arts and culture at the centre of our experience. In line with the commitment given in the Programme for a Partnership Government, I have asked An Chomhairle to draw up a three year plan for funding of the arts. I am proud that the Government has clearly indicated its resolve to provide the Arts Council with the resources it needs for its important work by exceeding the commitment given in the Government programme.</P>
    <P>The success of this Government in allocating increased resources to An Chomhairle emphasises our commitment to a sustained, proactive and innovative approach to the development of the rich resource that the arts in Ireland represents. As well as the Structural Funds I have obtained under the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i>, it further underlines the success which I have achieved in moving arts, cultural and heritage issues from the margin of Government policy considerations to a central position as an important instrument in the economic and social development of this State.</P>

Tá mé cinnte gur chun tairbhe na Gaeltachta agus a muintire a rachaidh an t-airgead breise atá curtha ar fáil ag an Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, ní miste dom an deis seo a ghlacadh chun cúpla focal a rá faoi na torthaí a bhain an eagraíocht amach i 1993. Bhí bliain rathúil ag an Údarás arís anuraidh i dtaca le deiseanna fostaíochta breise a chruthú do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Ba í 1993 an dóú bliain déag i ndiaidh a chéile ina raibh glanmhéadú san fhostaíocht i dtionscail faoi scáth na heagraíochta sin.</P>
    <P>Cruthaíodh 879 bpost nua lánaimseartha ar an bhfód i 1993 i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás agus, tar éis caillteanais de 675 phost a chur san áireamh, bhí méadú glan de 204 phost sa bhliain sin. Ba é sin an méadú glan ba mhó le ceithre bliana anuas agus tá ardmholadh tuillte ag an Údarás dá bharr. Chomh maith leis sin, tháining méadú de 330 ar líon na bpost shéasúracha sa Ghaeltacht le linn 1993 &mdash; ó 2,580 duine i 1992 go dtí buaicphointe 2,910 duine i 1993.</P>
    <P>Bhí fadhb ar leith ag an Údarás le roinnt blianta anuas maidir le líon na bpost lánaimseartha a cailleadh sa Ghaeltacht gach bliain. Is maith liom a fheiceáil gur éirigh leis an Udarás i 1993 srian a chur ar chaillteanas post ar an iomlán &mdash; d'ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí tromchúiseacha a bhuail comhlachtaí áirithe sa Ghaeltacht i rith na bliana sin. Tá caomhnú post chomh tábhachtach agus níos tábhachtaí b'fhéidir, ná cruthú post. Tá súil agam go leanfar leis an dea-obair sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>I have already welcomed the announcement by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement that £10 million of Exchequer funding would be made available for the establishment of Collins Barracks as a major National Museum facility. I am confident that this <Col N="657" /> Exchequer funding, allied with Structural Funds available for the project, which could amount to an additional £15 million, will enable the completion of the first phase of establishing a top class National Museum facility at the barracks.</P>
    <P>The chronic needs of the National Museum in terms of exhibition space and conservation facilities are well known. A significant part of the invaluable collection of the museum is in storage in various buildings around the country and has never been on public display, which is a great tragedy &mdash; part of our own story is locked away from us. The difficulties faced in conserving this priceless part of the nation's heritage are also well known. A great debt of gratitude is owed to generations of directors and their staff for their heroic efforts in this regard. I believe that the Collins Barracks site presents a rare opportunity to resolve many of the problems associated with the museum in a coherent way and of allowing the Irish people to experience important elements of their national heritage currently locked away from them.</P>
    <P>When this idea was first mooted, I asked the Office of Public Works to examine the feasibility of converting Collins Barracks to museum use. I am happy to say that the Office of Public Works found that Collins Barracks is a most suitable location for the National Museum in terms of historical relevance, the geographical location, the suitability of existing structures and the potential of the overall site to meet the needs of the museum. The original Office of Public Works study envisaged an entire project cost in the region of £65 million, which was a daunting prospect. I believe that the funds allocated in the budget will enable us to start with confidence to determine how the first phase of the project should be tackled.</P>
    <P>The Collins Barracks project will have many important spin-off benefits as it will rejuvenate the North Quay area of the city &mdash; it will be the people's location for the museum &mdash; and I believe it will be warmly welcomed by city planners. It will also provide the long overdue opportunity for everyone to view and interact <Col N="658" /> with important elements of our heritage in a modern purposely designed environment. It will allow access by buses and by people to walk there, to view what is part of their heritage.</P>
    <P>I have recently circulated my proposals to other Ministers on the long term future structures of the National Museum and the National Library. As part of the process of putting such structures in place, I intend to establish an interim board for the museum to address and report to me on a number of critical issues facing this institution. One of the primary issues on which the interim board will advise me will be the Collins Barracks project in the context of resolving the museum's long standing accommodation problems, including both exhibition and storage.</P>
    <P>The Collins Barracks project, along with my proposals for future structures in both the National Museum and the National Library, will rejuvenate and enhance the importance and relevance of these institutions and the treasures under their care to the people of the nation. As I have indicated before, I intend to establish autonomous boards which will allow both institutions the maximum amount of control possible over their own destinies. It has long been recognised that the departmental structures currently in place are not the most appropriate. I hope to bring my detailed proposals to Government in the near future. The principle on which these proposals will be structured will be one of autonomy with responsibility. This will be achieved through consultation and discussion.</P>
    <P>Many issues will have to be tackled in providing for the new regimes in both the library and the museum. Staff numbers and structures, particularly with new facilities coming on stream and the associated running costs, will have to be addressed. A long term coherent strategy for the museum will have to be established. I expect my proposed interim board to advise on these issues so that the museum can realise its full potential in the cultural life of the nation.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the additional £250,000 provided in the budget for the <Col N="659" /> national cultural institutions. This has enabled me to make increased allocations in the current year to the National Library, the National Museum and the National Gallery. Many people now use these institutions with great benefit.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the specific aspects of the budget which will benefit my areas of arts, culture and the Gaeltacht, I should like to voice my concern about certain comments which have been made recently to the effect that particular attention might have been paid by me over the past year to certain sections of my brief &mdash; reference was made to films and broadcasting &mdash; to the detriment of other sections, for example, the arts. I should like to state categorically that such comments have no basis in fact. As this House is aware, my brief is a wide one, encompassing arts and culture, the Irish language and the Gaeltacht, heritage, broadcasting and film policy. However, this fact does not prevent me in any way from devoting my attention to each of these areas. I am not more committed to any one area than to another, and it is my firm resolve to make every effort to achieve whatever progress is possible in all of these areas during my time as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I am pursuing an integrated policy which will give more attention to the Irish language than it received previously and more attention to films and broadcasting that they ever received. I will also be linking the future of the arts and cultural institutions with that policy. It is only when we integrate the policy that everyone will benefit. As a corollary to this, I should like to state categorically that increased funding for any particular area is not achieved at the expense of any other. People have only to look at the increases to see the proof of this. The case for increased funding in any particular case is made on its merits and is approved, or not, accordingly. It is not a matter of taking from Peter to pay Paul. Rather it is a matter of giving Peter the highest level of financial support that circumstances permit, doing likewise with Paul, and integrating the <Col N="660" /> effect of giving both of them more. I am not conducting a war among the poor. Such a reaction would be miserable in the extreme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a pleasure to listen to the Minister's wide-ranging contribution which underlines the importance of having a Minister with responsibility for the arts, culture and the Gaeltacht. The value of investment in the arts in terms of the return and in job creation is second to none. I am particularly delighted with the investment in Collins Barracks where the very valuable treasures kept underground in the National Museum, which is a stone's throw from this House &mdash; there was no space available to display these treasures in the museum &mdash; will be put on display for the first time ever. This investment will also have the effect of rejuvenating a part of old Dublin which is very much in need of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a progressive budget and its principal features must be looked at in the context of a number of other items. <Col N="662" /> First, it must be looked at in the context of the National Development Plan, 1994-99, the EU cohesion and structural funding of approximately £8 billion and matching funds from this country and the emphasis placed on job creation, environmental matters, infrastructural development and the Government's specific target of an extra 70,000 jobs over the period of the plan. Second, it must be looked at in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The Government is presently negotiating a new pay deal with the private and public sectors to ensure that the emphasis is placed on job creation and competitiveness in the international market.</P>
    <P>Third, the budget must be looked at in the context of the restructuring of our tax system, something previous Governments shied away from because they were not prepared to grasp the nettle. This restructuring is absolutely essential for our development as an economic and competitive nation. The Government has placed the emphasis on job creation in the budget and has kept our Exchequer borrowing requirement within the Maastricht guidelines of 3 per cent &mdash; it will be 2.7 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>The budget marks the end of a long period of financial retrenchment, cutbacks in essential services and the depressing effects of high interest rates and debt service charges, which restricted the scope of many Governments to actively assist economic development in the past. When one looks at the post budget projected take in income tax, combined with the abolition of the 1 per cent levy, one can see that the Government does not propose to raise any additional revenue by way of tax. This will leave the bulk of pay increases in circulation so that net pay, when combined with the tax relief and pay increases under the new national wage agreement, will increase by approximately 4 per cent to 5 per cent for most workers. Given that inflation is just 1.5 per cent this year, this represents a boost to demand equivalent to 1 per cent to 2 per cent of gross national product and underpins the <Col N="663" /> forecast increase in employment of 21,000, which I believe will be exceeded in the following years as our economy gains strength.</P>
    <P>If one compares the tax and PRSI deductions for single people on low incomes which applied in 1987 with the changes introduced in this budget one can see that the percentage of income taken from someone on £5,000 a year dropped from 74 per cent to 14 per cent while for someone on £10,000 it dropped from 30.9 per cent to 25.5 per cent and on £15,000 it dropped from 40.7 per cent to 33.3 per cent. These are very extensive improvements for anybody on PAYE.</P>
    <P>For low paid workers increases in personal allowances are the single most important instrument in reducing their tax burden along with a reduction in PRSI contributions, which has been recognised as a regressive tax in that the higher paid have a lower deduction rate because of the ceiling that applies to contributions. This year workers earning up to £9,000 per year quite rightly make the largest percentage gain in the reductions in income tax, combined with the largest increase in personal allowances in the last seven budgets; in fact, the increase of £350 for a single person and £700 for a married couple matches the combined increases in allowances in the previous six budgets. Workers in this category will secure minimum increases in take home pay of at least 5 per cent when account is taken of the increases from the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>The economic effect of the reduction in employers' PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent for the same category of worker will be to reduce the cost of the 8 per cent pay agreement in the private sector to 5 per cent for a three year period to the employer. This will allow an expansion in service employment while protecting the position of the clothing and knitwear sectors that face strong competition from UK companies with lower PRSI rates.</P>
    <P>Of course, the whole economy will benefit greatly from the increased purchasing power that lower interest rates will provide. On a sustained basis a 1 per <Col N="664" /> cent reduction in real interest rates boosts employment by as much as 15,000. Debt interest charges have fallen substantially for the Exchequer and I believe there could be further savings on the budget estimate, which forecasts a £111 million reduction compared with 1993.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism that the process of tax reform was not radical enough in this budget. Given that mortgage interest relief and VHI relief is to be equalised for all taxpayers, it was important that this should be carried out on a phased basis with the benefits returned in the form of reduced income tax for the PAYE sector. The criticism that the reduction in income threshold for residential property tax would catch families on incomes which were not substantial is a matter which should be addressed and I would like the Minister to consider what changes could be made so that the tax would be on a net equity basis. It has been rightly pointed out by some of my colleagues and others in the Labour Party that a high mortgage combined with an income of just over £30,000 could see an appreciable rise in the tax liability for a small number of people. The concerns expressed that the tax should not impact unfairly on family circumstances must be dealt with and, if necessary, the Minister can recoup any shortfall in revenue through other measures.</P>
    <P>What I do not accept as legitimate is the attempt by some members of the Opposition to smear the Labour Party and the party leader in particular that we are breaking pledges given in the election manifesto. We are not. We have introduced no new property tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the reduction in the VHI and mortgage interest relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not such a long time ago that the Progressive Democrats were considering and indeed advocating the abolition of all mortgage and VHI relief so that we could have a top rate tax of 40 per cent and a standard rate of 25 per cent. Unlike the Opposition, I would not <Col N="665" /> now accuse the Progressive Democrats of telling lies. The difference between the position of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats on tax reform and that of the Labour Party is that we do not see the value of some technical tax reform that does not have a genuine progressive effect of reducing the tax burden on those with the lowest incomes. Neither will we countenance the wholesale expenditure cuts which both parties have advocated and would implement if they were in Government today.</P>
      <P>Mortgage interest relief and VHI relief, as we stated in the 1992 election campaign, will be maintained. The next three budgets will continue to implement the priorities outlined in the Programme for Government, which were to remove the low paid, especially families, out of the tax net; to broaden the standard tax band so that as in other countries only relatively high earners pay the higher rate of tax; to further reduce tax rates, especially the standard rate, when economic conditions permit; to maintain basic tax reliefs, such as mortgage interest and VHI, and consider measures in the 1993 budget to relieve the position faced by mortgage holders while the then situation of high interest rates lasted.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, this is a progressive budget. We will continue along the lines of tax restructuring in the years to come and I commend the budget to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the point in regard to widows' pensions in a moment, but, far from commending this budget to the House, Deputy Costello and his colleagues will retreat very fast from this issue in a very short time. That is my prediction. However, I will return to that point later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht did not remain in the House to hear my points in relation to the Irish language. He obviously does not want to hear the other side of the argument and may have thought it rather entertaining for his friends in the Public Gallery to have heard me say that <Col N="666" /> he has done as much damage to the Irish language as Cromwell. But let me explain to the House what I mean by that. In Dublin at present there is a very real chance of the Irish language recovering so that people like me who did not have the opportunity to learn the language will have that opportunity. I want to declare at the outset an interest in this matter; my four children attend an all-Irish school and I make no apology for that. They do so for cultural reasons; if they are to learn German, French and English, they can learn Irish.</P>
    <P>There are 18 all-Irish primary schools in Dublin. That figure could easily be 28, 38 or 48&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>And will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the parents of those children have no hang-ups about the Irish language. Having seen other countries throughout Europe where children are multilingual, parents here want the same for their children. But what have we done for them? We have refused to supply all-Irish secondary schools and are thereby strangling the enthusiasm there is at the conclusion of primary level. If one attends an all-Irish primary school, say, on the south of the city, at 12 years of age one can attend Coláiste Eoin-Íosagáin in Stillorgan or go out to Clondalkin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>There is nowhere for those children to attend school if they do not go to Coláiste Eoin-Íosagáin or to Clondalkin. Similarly, on the north side there are two all-Irish secondary schools. Yet in the inner city there are empty secondary and primary school buildings which could be converted with reasonable ease into all-Irish secondary schools. Furthermore, people are disposed to travel to attend all-Irish schools. Therefore, we would not have to build schools out in Tallaght, Clondalkin and other such places; people will travel if the facility is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Near Harold's Cross Bridge, in my constituency there are two secondary schools, Coláiste Chaoimhín, a Christian Brothers' school with a very fine campus, including a swimming pool, and, a short distance from that, the Marist convent, with an equally fine campus. I have been trying for a long time to persuade the Minister for Education or the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to take one of those schools and perhaps another vacant school premises on the north side of the city and give us at least six all-Irish secondary schools. Within a <Col N="668" /> very short time we would have to have, say, eight, ten, 12, 15 if not 20 such schools because when parents see that the secondary outlets are there more of them will send their children to all-Irish primary schools. I repeat, there are already 18, despite the fact that there are very few facilities and that people must travel considerable distances to attend those schools.</P>
    <P>The second thing I like about all-Irish schools is this. Not merely do they teach people Irish culture, which is a good thing in itself, but they are not inclined to be parish-based. People travel to them, which means there are the sons and daughters of professional people, of trades people, of labourers, of the unemployed &mdash; all sorts of people side by side in the same school. They are more egalitarian. What is the Government doing about it? The answer is nothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht congratulates himself on the great work he is doing. Every stroke pulled in relation to Gaeltacht expenditure appears to be pulled in favour of his constituency in Galway West, but he is doing precious little for Dublin. Dublin is being ignored by both the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Education, some big deal the Labour Party are doing in Government in relation to the Irish language. I put those facts on the record of this House. Instead of trying to denigrate me, let the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht come in here and deny those facts if they are not accurate.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with crime, I want to refer to another form of larceny, that is, the attempted larceny of widows' pensions. The 86,371 persons in receipt of contributory widows' pensions and the 71,861 persons in receipt of contributory old age pensions are in line for severe and unjust attacks on their entitlements if current Government proposals are allowed to go ahead. I use the word &ldquo;entitlements&rdquo; advisedly since these people have paid for their pensions.</P>
    <P>The proposal to means test widows' contributory pensions is one of the most pernicious policy proposals ever put forward <Col N="669" /> by an Irish Government. Yesterday, in an attempt to extricate himself from this debate, which I predict will get much hotter, the Minister for Social Welfare dug a deeper hole for himself by announcing that he intends to take only &ldquo;earned income&rdquo;, to quote him, into account when means testing widows. In other words, a wealthy widow in very comfortable circumstances, with enormous investment income &mdash; that is, unearned income &mdash; will not be means tested while her counterpart, perhaps with three or four children, who goes out to work to supplement her widow's pension will be subjected to the full rigours of these proposals. My advice to the Minister is this. When one is in a hole, stop digging; fill in the hole and forget this ruthless proposal.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out that many people have contributed up to 40 years to pensions for their widows. It is a form of Government larceny to attempt to take back what has been paid for through the nose by those seeking to provide for their families. Many such people have contributed from their after tax incomes amounts up to £1,300 or more annually. Furthermore, many contributors have planned their other private insurance contributions to provide for lower payouts in the event of death because they have taken into account their widows' entitlements to receive full contributory pension.</P>
    <P>This insidious proposal is the thin end of the wedge. The Government says that existing widows will not be affected. I predict that if this proposal is allowed to go ahead it will be only a matter of time before all contributory widows' pensions will be affected and that next in line for attack will be contributory old age pensions. Fine Gael will fight tooth and nail to prevent this measure going through. This proposal must be reversed. We will force a vote every inch of the way on this proposal. That marker has been put down for the Government to take heed. I predict that all of those back benchers who came in here and commended this budget to the House will run fast when they see the full implications of this and <Col N="670" /> when their constituents hear just how pernicious and insidious is this proposal. It is time for those Government back benchers who wrestle with their consciences on these issues to allow their consciences win.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the crime position in this city. I am particularly concerned about an aspect very rarely referred to, that is, the whole question of unemployment in relation to crime. I have to say that those people currently negotiating the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, mark II, should consider what it was that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the first <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> contributed either to national recovery or economic and social progress. All of the financial indicators in recent years have been good &mdash; low inflation, debt/GNP ratio under control, growth rates twice the European average, low interest rates, except for temporary aberrations, contributed to over a period by a number of Governments. All were good except one, employment.</P>
    <P>Who represents the unemployed at these so-called talks in the negotiations on the second <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>? I believe it is time the unemployed were represented directly at these talks. All that is represented at these talks is vested interests, including Government as a vested interest, sitting around the table, carving up the cake in their own interest while nobody speaks for the unemployed. That is the problem I have with these latest negotiations, because that unemployment problem is contributing to the very high levels of crime in this city. There are many places in the inner city where there is 70 per cent and 80 per cent unemployment, people who have never worked. Tell that to those people sitting around the table talking about <i>Programmes for National Recovery</i> and <i>Programmes for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>One other point I should like to make about this unemployment problem is the lack of research into the creation of jobs. It is an important point on which I intend <Col N="671" /> to spend some time. It would be my hope that when the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Finance and others, including Education &mdash; I see the Minister for Education present in the House &mdash; listen to these debates, they will take up these points. This is an essential factor in relation to long term job creation here. Indeed, the jobs crisis is the most critical problem facing the nation today. To tackle it properly will require mobilisation of all the sources at our disposal.</P>
    <P>It is recognised worldwide that knowledge-based industry and the creation of small to medium enterprises &mdash; SMEs &mdash; constitute one of the key contributors to job creation. In turn, this requires a sustained supply of well educated graduates and access to vibrant research and development expertise which generates and interprets new science and technology knowledge. This view was reinforced recently in <i>Fortune</i> magazine of 15 November 1993, which concluded from its survey of companies in the United States that a major attraction for mobile high-tech investment is a well resourced university in the immediate vicinity. It was also noted in <i>The Guardian</i> of 4 October 1993 that:</P>
    <P>Britain will never get the expansion it needs unless it harnesses science to economic planning . . . . . . science still holds the key to expansion.</P>
    <P>Ireland is uniquely endowed with a capable young population which, if properly trained, would cater for the manpower needs of knowledge-based industry. Ireland's research and development capabilities have a recognised international standing. In spite of both of these rich resources, it is unbelievable that they are not high on the agenda for job creation. The ability of the higher education sector to contribute fully is being severely compromised by a lack of adequate funding and by politics that are, to say the least, perplexing.</P>
    <P>The historic neglect of funding for knowledge-driven &mdash; basic &mdash; research in Ireland is now the subject of heated debate in the national and international <Col N="672" /> media. The effects are far-reaching both in the context of Ireland's international image as a prime location for the development of knowledge-based industry and in regard to the Government's overall strategy for job creation. Despite sustained representation from the research community, the response has been, to say the least, tardy and lukewarm. Policymakers still do not understand, or lack the will to understand, either the science of basic research or the need to support it even at a minimum threshold level.</P>
    <P>The case for basic research in science is summarised in the following 15 points.</P>
    <P>1. Those nations with access to new knowledge and the ability to apply it will prosper economically: those who do not will not.</P>
    <P>2. Basic research provides the seed corn and the soil out of which future development in technology can grow: it has underpinned the applied research achievements in Irish universities over the past decade and the significant additional job creation which has taken place in that sector.</P>
    <P>3. Without wide-ranging research, it is impossible to monitor, evaluate and exploit key developments in research worldwide: it is foolhardy to be disadvantaged in this way.</P>
    <P>4. Training by research is an excellent training in state-of-the-art skills which are in demand throughout high-tech industry.</P>
    <P>5. The attractiveness of Ireland as a place for major high-tech investment depends upon its international research profile.</P>
    <P>6. All highly developed countries explicitly recognise the role of scientific research in promoting economic growth. Investment in science and technology correlates with industrial performance.</P>
    <P>7. The ability of Ireland to attract the highest calibre people to fill university posts, and to keep them here, again depends on a healthy research environment. The EU's mobility programme has demonstrated cause for concern in the low level of applications from talented young scientists for temporary assignments in Ireland. This has immediate <Col N="673" /> knock-on effects on the quality of our graduate output as perceived internationally.</P>
    <P>8. Ireland invests very little in science compared with our EU partners, or almost any other country in the OECD. Our status in this regard is unique and embarrassing.</P>
    <P>9. It is increasingly difficult for Irish scientists to participate in joint European projects because of the very low level of national support. To be serious partners requires a minimum level of national support, of the order of £5 million annually for basic science. Most EU programmes presume an adequate level of background national support: Irish scientists are severely disadvantaged in this respect.</P>
    <P>10. Much of the current equipment base for research has passed its useful life span and is in desperate need of replacement. Current provision by the Higher Education Authority of £2 million per annum is considered, even by the Higher Education Authority, to be at least a factor of three too low. This figure takes no account of the major initial capital injection required to obviate the current level of equipment obsolescence in the third level sector. There was no improvement in the budget for research equipment in the allocation of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>11. Other points to be considered are, despite concessions in the budget, the question of VAT on research equipment is still far from satisfactory <i>vis-à-vis</i> other EU and OECD nations. This has been highlighted by the Wellcome Foundation which has threatened to withdraw its substantial funding of research in Ireland. VAT on all research equipment should be zero-rated.</P>
    <P>12. The research environment in the universities is also being eroded with the sustained increase in student numbers which have grown from 65,000 to 84,000 over the past five years with a projected target of 100,000 by 2000. In the recent carve-up of Structural Funds, the capital provision for the whole third level sector for the next five years is £120 million, of which less than one-third has been <Col N="674" /> allocated to the universities where the bulk of research is carried out. That figure represents a mere 27 per cent increase over the past five years when there was no exceptional Structural Funding available. When inflation is taken into account, the increase in spending in this area is negligible.</P>
    <P>13. In reply to criticism, the Department of Enterprise and Employment fails to recognise the symbiotic relationship between basic and applied science, in which each stimulates the other: any long term strategy which supports applied research and neglects basic research will not succeed.</P>
    <P>14. The most successful high-tech industries such as Hitachi typically invest 8 per cent of their budget in fundamental research.</P>
    <P>15. Scientists have been poorly represented on policy-making bodies, even on those boards which require their expertise. This tendency has reached its logical conclusion in Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland which is deeply resented by Irish scientists, who are frequently recognised in appointment to such roles by European bodies but not here at home.</P>
    <P>Arising from that I would like to put forward the following six recommendations:</P>
    <P>&mdash;First, research to generate and sustain an appropriate knowledge base in Ireland should be high on the national agenda.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Second, practising scientists should be more involved in the formulation of science policy at all levels as is the case in every other developed country.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Third, the proposed drastic cutbacks in research funding in the current year should be reversed and the research resources deployed more efficiently.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Fourth, 10 per cent of all research funding should be devoted to basic research.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Fifth, VAT on all research equipment should be removed.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Sixth, there is need to improve co-ordination <Col N="675" /> between those Government Departments which interface with the higher education sector in areas of training and research.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Education, who is present, will consider those suggestions. I have taken some trouble to put those points in a succinct way. I hope also that the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Finance will examine this matter because scientists here are at a significant disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of crime. I said that the whole area of job creation was related to the crime problem. The maximising of job opportunities is related to the crime problem. It is very disturbing to read in the newspapers today that when the Garda statistics are published, later today or tomorrow, they will again indicate an 8 per cent increase in crime in Dublin and a 4 per cent increase in the rate of crime in the country as a whole. Those statistics do not reflect the true level of crime; they only reflect the level of reported crime. Many people have simply given up on reporting or if they do they will be told at the Garda station that there is not a whole lot the Garda can do about it.</P>
    <P>Prison and sentencing statistics are pathetically sketchy. That has been referred to by the Whitaker report on Penal Reform and the Law Reform Commission report on sentencing. A national bureau of crime statistics, at no cost to the State, should be immediately established to ensure that legislators, judges and others are properly informed and can scientifically measure the true extent of crime. If we do not accurately measure categories and levels of crime we cannot have a plan to fight it. It is not good enough to hope that people will not notice and that the problem will go away. We should form a bureau comprising for instance the Director of the CSO, senior gardaí, the Comptoller and Auditor General and others, with statutory responsibility to publish crime, prison and sentencing statistics. At the moment one <Col N="676" /> judge does not know what another is doing. Some judges use community work orders, others apply suspended sentences and others impose the full sentence. Where a sentence is suspended pending review in say six months, an offender will be more inclined to behave. When judges sentence people to Mountjoy prison, the prison must allow others out to accommodate them. If 50 prisoners go into Mountjoy on Friday, 50 others must be allowed out. There is not a parole board and nobody need consider whether these prisoners should be let out.</P>
    <P>We need to review sentencing policy. Crime statistics could inform judges as to what penalties work and the Legislature should be informed of the true rates of recidivism, for instance. If one asks a question of the Minister for Justice as to the rate of recidivism, the reply can only be a guess because we do no have accurate statistics. The system with regard to criminal justice and crime statistics is a sham. If one wanted to put forward an education plan one would start with a Green Paper and we should do the same in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>The Government will not take on board my proposal for a national bureau of crime statistics because it would show the true level of crime and the Government would not get away with having the members of the Garda Síochána under strength. It is horrific that while crime is spiralling Garda numbers are 500 below the authorised level. It is no wonder that in two subdistricts in Dublin, the detection rate for indictable crime was as low as 14 per cent in one and 17.4 per cent in the other and that the rate of detection for the country for indictable crime, which includes crimes against the person, offences against property with violence, larceny and so on, is as low as 34 per cent. In the same year the detection rate for crimes against women under these headings was a low as 11 per cent and 15.6 per cent, respectively, in the two Dublin subdistricts to which I refer.</P>
    <P>Unless we are serious about fighting crime, starting with a national bureau of crime statistics we will not come to terms with a frightening reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget marks the beginning of my second year as Minister for Education and the second year of progress, advancement and improvement in the education of our young people. It also marks the second year of the implementation of the education commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
      <P>Education is a key element in the Programme for a Partnership Govenment. The programme recognises the vital part which education plays in advancing our economic performance, promoting equity and equal opportunity for our citizens and, most of all, in tackling disadvantage in and out of school.</P>
      <P>We all agree that more resources are needed in education. This budget with an 11 per cent increase on last year, has provided more resources. My task as Minister is to make choices, establish priorities and target spending. Often people in most need are furthest from where decisions are made and frequently have difficulty in making their voices heard. The marginalised in society are most easily ignored.</P>
      <P>As Minister, I know that, despite all that is positive and good in our education system, it has the capacity, even at first level, to reinforce and perpetuate inequity.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that early school leavers are very likely to face long term unemployment and I am concerned that large numbers of young people leave school each year with poor formal qualifications or none. I am concerned too that, even in 1994 young people from backgrounds of high socio-economic status are three times as likely to obtain a leaving certificate than young people from unskilled and semi-skilled backgrounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The choices I made in the budget are designed to remedy this problem. As Minister, I have the responsibility to make these choices; but I have made them in partnership, the most public expression of which was the recent National Education Convention which was marked by a spirit of optimism, co-operation <Col N="678" /> and agreement on priorities by all the partners in education.</P>
    <P>It showed a widespread agreement on the importance of promoting equity in education, retention of young people in the system and access to qualifications by them. This consensus has informed the choices I made in education spending this year.</P>
    <P>Primary schooling is vital for children, if they miss out at this stage it is very difficult to catch up later. I know that many of our primary schools are in poor repair and that in some, even basic sanitary facilities are sadly lacking. That is why I have increased capital expenditure at primary level from £19 million in 1993 to £26 million in 1994, why I allowed 72 additional major projects to commence this year and why I made a commitment that every school will have modern sanitation and hygiene facilities by the end of 1994.</P>
    <P>I know that our primary schools are under funded. That is why I increased the capitation grant by a further £5 per pupil. I have increased the disadvantaged fund by £707,000 to allow a range of initiatives in disadvantaged areas. I have set aside £16,000 to provide for the payment of television licences in schools designated as disadvantaged and have provided an allocation of a further £300,000 for the continued expansion of the caretaker and clerical services at primary level.</P>
    <P>I know that the isolation of some schools presents a particular problem and challenge to teachers, especially those in island schools. That is the reason I have allocated £36,000 for the installation of telecommunication facilities in all island schools. These facilities will include telephones, modems, computers and printers.</P>
    <P>As Minister I have ensured that, despite falling pupil numbers, all teaching posts will be retained in the primary school system. This reduces the pupil-teacher ratio to 23.4:1.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that a minimum of 400 teaching posts will be available this year to improve education in our schools. I intend to target these posts by appointing <Col N="679" /> 100 additional remedial teachers, by appointing additional teachers in schools designated as disadvantaged and by appointing additional teachers to the home-school-community liaison scheme. However, I will reserve a significant number of these teachers for the special education area as 1994 will be a year of initiatives on special education.</P>
    <P>I believe that a test of the civilisation of our society is how we treat our most vulnerable members. This is the reason I have a range of initiatives in Budget '94 for children with special educational needs: an additional 50 childcare assistant posts; an additional £2 million for a dramatic increase in capitation grants; capitation grant recognition of children of post-primary age in special schools; £100,000 for in-service training of teachers of children with a handicap; extra administrative principalships in schools of special education and £100,000 for the provision of escorts for children with a handicap.</P>
    <P>The provisions for children with special educational needs in this budget are the first part of a programme which has been mapped out by the report of the Special Education Review Committee. This committee's report contains much valuable research. I believe that our choices in education should be guided by such findings.</P>
    <P>Proper research can help target our resources to combat the problems in education. Therefore, I have set aside £35,000 to fund two major research projects. One will monitor the development of the pre-school programme and the other will involve the Combat Poverty Agency in providing an evaluation of the current criteria for designating disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In addition, I will shortly publish the consultancy study on the cost of school books commissioned by my Department. I have increased the funding for the books scheme by 17 per cent in this budget and the consultancy study will help us to use these funds to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>At present, 73 per cent of our young <Col N="680" /> people finish senior cycle at second level and our ambition is to increase this to 90 per cent in the near future. The increased numbers of young people in the second level system demand new buildings and new resources. I have, therefore, achieved an increase in capital expenditure for second level buildings from £20 million in 1992 to £27 million in 1993 and now to £37 million in 1994. The 1994 allocation represents an 85 per cent increase on the 1992 expenditure. It has allowed me to authorise 35 major building projects to commence this year.</P>
    <P>The funding at our secondary schools has been inadequate. There has been no increase in the capitation grant since 1990. This year I have obtained a 9 per cent increase on the 1993 allocation which will be distributed with particular emphasis on disadvantaged schools. I have allocated an additional £800,000 for the continuing expansion of the caretaker and clerical services in our second level schools. I have also allocated an additional £276,000, an increase of 55 per cent, for a series of initiatives to address disadvantage and special needs at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>The quality of education depends on the quality of our teachers. This year I will allocate an additional 45 career guidance posts, 25 remedial posts and 110 ex-quota vice-principalships. An additional 15 post-primary schools will be provided with the services of home-school liaison co-ordinators. I will allocate an additional 60 teaching posts to disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>Access to second level education means access for all our children. This includes our children with special needs. I have provided £50,000 for the first time, for the provision of equipment for children with special needs in ordinary secondary schools. I have arranged that a major pilot project will commence this year on the development of appropriate curricula for children with special needs of second level schoolgoing age.</P>
    <P>We live in a knowledge-based society and a knowledge-based world, a world in which access to higher education is increasingly important. More and more <Col N="681" /> of our young people progress to third level education. These young people's life chances are enhanced by their education at our universities and higher education colleges. The higher education of our young people brings cultural, economic and social benefits to our community as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is a need for improved facilities in our higher education colleges. This year, £35 million &mdash; £16 million from Exchequer funding and £19 million in the national plan &mdash; will allow for capital development in these institutions.</P>
    <P>I recognise the growing importance of regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and certain third level vocational education committee colleges in the higher education sector. An additional £20 million, an increase of 19 per cent on the 1993 out-turn, has been provided for the day to day funding of these colleges.</P>
    <P>I have increased the allocation for higher education grants to take account of increased numbers of students and the recent improvements in the higher education grants scheme. I have consulted widely on how we can encourage access to higher education and how we can remove barriers. I am aware of barriers which can affect individual students: barriers of mobility, barriers due to family circumstances, barriers due to disabilities. That is the reason I have provided for the first time a new fund of £200,000 for students in higher education. I will discuss with the authorities in third level institutions how best to use this new fund to ensure that students who experience particular difficulties have access to third level education.</P>
    <P>Each child has only one start in life, one chance in education. This is why education is so tremendously important and why failure in the education system has a life-long effect on many people. The education system has failed some people in the past. As a society we must recognise this. Hence, I have a particular commitment to adult and continuing education and to those who have missed out on educational opportunities.</P>
    <P>I have provided 2,500 extra places in <Col N="682" /> the vocational training and opportunities scheme for adults and 1,000 extra places for young people on Youthreach programmes. I have also increased the funding for adult education organisations by 10 per cent and have allocated £200,000 for iniatiatives for adults in disadvantaged communities. I have provided a 14 per cent increase to assist the ongoing work of the adult literacy and community education scheme.</P>
    <P>The year 1993 has been tremendous for Irish education. It has been a year of initiatives, of consultation, of reforms and of improvements, and 1994, with the publication of the White Paper on Education, will build on the foundations laid last year.</P>
    <P>Budget 1994, with a net increase of over 11 per cent in the education provision, provides a splendid start to the new year. It is a budget which has built on the partnership of the National Education Convention, has targeted our resources in an open and honest way and improved our young people's life chances.</P>
    <P>The education provisions in this budget are evidence of my determination to implement the education commitments to the Irish people in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this budget which will be a massive boost to economic activity on every front. This budget will, over the next few years, create a huge number of jobs in our economy. Furthermore, it provides for a significant increase in expenditure to assist every health board and includes considerable increases in other areas of social spending. It also includes the extra £15 million for county roads which is of significance to every family living in a rural area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the outstanding features of this budget is the decision by the Government to tackle the issue of tax reform. For many years parties on all sides of this House have made noises about introducing measures to reform the tax system. However, when push comes to shove, very few groups have the courage <Col N="683" /> to tackle this problem. This budget sees the start of a process of significant tax reform and a widening of the tax base. The majority of economic commentators in the media praised the Government's attempts to readjust the taxation system but what the majority of the people I represent want to know is whether their tax is going up or coming down. What is sickening the Opposition is that tax is being reduced at every level of income and, for the first time in the last seven years, those on low pay are getting a real look in with reductions in the employment and health levies combined with substantial increases in personal allowances.</P>
    <P>I would like to take issue with Deputy Yates. What might we expect from his party if he were the Minister for Finance? I remember reading <i>The Irish Times</i> on 28 April 1993 where he indicated that his tax reform proposals would cut Government spending by £200 million and raise another £500 million by widening the tax base. Among the options he was considering were &ldquo;the introduction of VAT on food and other zero-rated items and new local government charges&rdquo;. Deputy Yates and the Fine Gael Party were bursting blood vessels here yesterday over the £5 million widening of the tax base in the residential property tax. I would like to see the medical condition he and his leader would be in if they had to contemplate a £500 million widening of the tax base. I can tell him that if he were to put a tax on food the standing of his party in the polls would shrink to a level enjoyed by the Canadian Conservative Party who have very few seats in their Parliament at this time. The problem with people on very large incomes is that they often have small minds when it comes to issues like tax reform. Of course, the money can be raised in another way and given as tax cuts but it should not weigh heavily on the less well off. What is more, the people of Ireland would give short shrift to any politician who claimed that tax reform might require putting VAT on food.</P>
    <P>The real widening of the tax base that <Col N="684" /> this country needs is the implementation of policies that will increase the number of people at work. This is the only form of tax widening that is worth a damn in reducing the cost to Government of unemployment which, it turn, requires higher levels of taxation. This may seem a very simple point but it is the only way we can have a sustained increase in living standards without penalising vulnerable sections of the community who do not have the muscle to object if services on which they depend are cut. I ask those people who advocate cutting public expenditure if they would point out the exact areas where they would implement such cuts. In particular I want to know what is the right-wing philosophy in relation to the provision of local authority housing and would this be part of the public expenditure cuts so eloquently advocated by these parties. What would they say to the prospect of 330 people on the housing list in County Westmeath today?</P>
    <P>I am especially proud of the Labour Party's record in the provision of local authority housing and will continue unashamedly to encourage the Government to provide the necessary finance to ensure that waiting lists for houses are substantially reduced. There is no point in talking with forked tongue about this matter; we are either for public expenditure in this area or we are not, and if we are not we should point to exactly where the knife will fall. There is no point in being ambivalent. I can tell the people in County Westmeath what I stand for in relation to the provision of public sector housing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the community employment scheme by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Finance's announcement of extra places on the Youthreach programme. I wish to make a special plea for the community training workshops. These originated as work schemes for unemployed young people and were later taken up and expanded by Youthreach. They are now in danger of being left behind. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the community training workshops <Col N="685" /> are given extra funding and additional places to get them out of the limbo they are in for which the Department must take some responsibility. In particular I want to see an increase in the number of places available in Mullingar Community Training Workshop from its current level of 30 to 50 places, and I appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary funds for this.</P>
    <P>In the area of social welfare I warmly welcome the change in respect of the means test for the carer's allowance whereby the earnings disregard of the working spouse of a carer is being increased to £100. In addition pensioners who are being cared for by the recipients of a carer's allowance will be entitled to retain eligibility for the free telephone rental allowance and pensioners aged 75 years and over who no longer live alone will also retain eligibility for that allowance. In particular the extension of the allowance to widows aged between 60 and 65 years whose husbands were eligible under the free schemes is very necessary and long overdue.</P>
    <P>The increases in child benefit for the third and subsequent child, when combined with the increases in last year's budget, will be of major benefit to large families and continues the Labour Party's policy of reversing the previous freezing of child benefit which was a Thatcherite-inspired and anti-family policy. The increases in social welfare, for example, will result in an increase of £6.12 for a couple with four children on long term unemployment assistance, bringing their income to £171.70 per week. A couple with three children on short term unemployment assistance will be £6.75 per week better off. These increases exceed the inflation rate and, though not large in percentage terms, will help to improve the living standards of unemployed families.</P>
    <P>In the area of health, what the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin has secured in this budget will go down at the end of this Government's term in office as perhaps one of the greatest achievements by the Labour Party in the area of social policy. The waiting lists for hip, heart, eye and ear operations <Col N="686" /> have been reduced by more than 50 per cent in the past year and an additional £10 million is being provided to achieve a further reduction in waiting time. Therefore, the less well-off need not now fear requiring a serious operation for themselves or their children. The application of £30 million, in addition to the health boards' £100 million debt reduction, will ensure continuity of the tremendous service that is provided by health care personnel. Also, that service will be available to all citizens and not just to those who have the money to buy immediate medical attention which, unfortunately, is the position for many people after years of Thatcherism in the UK health service. The provision of £28 million for services for the mentally handicapped is further evidence that the Minister for Health, at the end of the term of office of this Government, will have transformed the Irish health service.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with an issue that needs examination and a Government decision as a matter of urgency, namely, eligibility criteria for higher education grants. I understand a review group will be reporting on this matter shortly and, as far as I am concerned, the sooner that happens the better. That issue affects middle income earners who find it particularly loathsome that assessment for eligibility is done on a gross income basis. Some time ago I called on the trade union movement to raise the matter in its discussion with the social partners because for a middle income family eligibility for higher education grants for family members is of far greater value in money terms than wage increases, of which a significant portion is clawed back in income tax. The time has come for the PAYE sector, who carry the bulk of the tax burden, to have the eligibility thresholds increased substantially or, alternatively, the basis of assessment should be on net and not gross income. The paymaster should get something in return.</P>
    <P>When I hear people talk about unemployment I recall that ten or 20 years ago in every village and town in rural Ireland five or six people were employed by the <Col N="687" /> local county council to maintain roads and do other necessary works. People were also employed on Office of Public Works drainage schemes and in Bord na Móna and the ESB. Those jobs were noteworthy in that they were all State or semi-State employment. Of course, if one is opposed to the semi-State sector &mdash; another area where there were public expenditure cutbacks &mdash; one cannot agree with a reversion to that type of policy. If I were Minister for Finance I would authorise local authorities to recruit people immediately to provide such services. It makes economic sense. Let us consider the condition of the roads in rural Ireland. If those roads were maintained on a regular basis there would be less need for expenditure on constant repairs and maintenance. That is a simple example, but on any cost-benefit analysis basis it would be worthwhile. I do not see the logic under any circumstances of not following that trend.</P>
    <P>Those opportunities are no longer there, but if we are serious about reducing unemployment levels local authorities must be given a more proactive employment generating role. For example, in major capital projects such as road construction the rules and regulations governing the award of such contracts should be changed at both national and European level to permit local authorities to undertake those projects in total. That would result in the employment of thousands of people by local authorities on direct labour. In that way European and national moneys could have a real impact on unemployment black spots.</P>
    <P>There should be further recruitment to the Permanent Defence Forces. The current recruitment campaign which will enlist 500 people into the Permanent Defence Forces and the Navy has attracted approximately 20 applicants for each available position. Further Army recruitment should be carried out on a planned basis. In Westmeath, where there are two important Army barracks, Custume Barracks in Athlone and Columb Barracks in Mullingar, it is hoped <Col N="688" /> that this is just a first step in a planned recruitment campaign.</P>

      <P>This is a thoroughly bad budget, perhaps the worst this country has seen in living political memory. It was made worse by the fact that a splendid budgetary opportunity was hopelessly squandered. Seldom has a Minister for Finance had so many favourable factors to his back when introducing a budget. The Minister had the wind at his back with low inflation, falling interest rates, a rake of money from the tax amnesty, a healthy position in relation to growth and, at political level, a solid majority that would have enabled him to introduce a set of radical measures to tackle the single most important issue facing the country today, namely, unemployment. The Minister squandered all those opportunities. He and his Government could not resist the temptation to be popular, to squander taxpayers' money, throw it out like confetti at a country wedding, giving a little to everybody and at the end of the day failing to put in place any measure that would be of long term benefit to our economy or people.</P>
      <P>We got nothing more in this budget than a lethal cocktail of high spending and high taxation measures. The budget lacks a coherent strategy for tackling the unemployment crisis and this time next year we will all be back in this House &mdash; with the proof of the pudding &mdash; with no new long term sustainable jobs created in any real measure. Seldom has there been so much expectations of a budget or advice and consensus about the shape a budget ought to have taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have examined the new PRSI measures carefully. In my view they will cancel one another out and at the end of the day we will be left with a scoreless draw on the jobs scoreboard. The attempt to address the tax wedge and poverty trap will succeed only in moving <Col N="689" /> the threshold, it will not solve the problem. We now have a new threshold under which workers earning £173 per week dare not look for or take a rise in wages because if they do so they will be liable for a new range of levies. Such people are trapped in that position and are as badly off as those on much lower pay, whom this budget boasted about setting out to relieve. That measure has failed and the poverty trap and tax wedge continues in the Irish economy. That is an example of the lack of coherence in respect of the long term outcome of that measure.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the increase in employers' PRSI and the manner in which it will affect workers earning £25,000 and more. That measure will have a devastating effect on employment in many sectors of the economy, especially areas in which there are highly skilled workers. I refer in particular to graduates in a number of industries in my area, for example, the chemical and financial services industries and the co-operatives which are replacing the manufacturing industries that collapsed in the 1980s.</P>

      <P>We now come to deal with priority questions. As Members will be aware, today is the first occasion that Question Time will be taken under the new sessional order passed by this House this morning. Under the new order the last priority question, if not reached, will be taken as the first ordinary question for oral answer. If that happens supplementary questions may be asked by other Members in addition to the Member who tabled that priority question. While this new facility is helpful it does not ensure that all priority questions will be replied to. Therefore, I earnestly request all Deputies concerned to be conscious of the limited time available for <Col N="690" /> priority questions and to deal with the five priority questions before us in the 20 minute period allowed. I hope the position is clear. This is a worthwhile improvement, but does not guarantee that we will dispose of all the priority questions before us.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the events surrounding her refusal to submit to the Government for approval the name of a member of the Garda Síochána who was recommended for promotion to Superintendent rank by the Garda Commissioner.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that however much I would wish to accommodate this House on this particular matter, I am constrained in discussing the events in question because they may become an issue in civil proceedings.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that I received correspondence from a solicitor acting on behalf of one of the parties involved and I have been in contact with the Chief State Solicitor in the matter.</P>
      <P>However, I must deal with certain comments concerning this matter which are the subject of understandable concern.</P>
      <P>First of all, there was no question of any telephone being tapped. I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that conversations made and received on a telephone in the Garda Anti-Racketeering Unit were taped by an officer engaged in those conversations. There is nothing in law which prevents anybody from making a recording of his or her own telephone conversations and, therefore, no question of authorisation by me or any of my predecessors arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be recognised also that there are circumstances in which gardaí, for valid operational reasons, might need to tape certain telephone conversations. It would be odd to insist on a rule that <Col N="691" /> the gardaí, who have the difficult job of enforcing the law, should never tape a conversation, even when there were sound operational reasons for doing so, while everybody else in society is perfectly free to tape their conversations with others, with or without their consent. I am not referring simply to 999 calls, which are taped as a matter of routine, primarily as a protection to the citizen. There can be other circumstances in which the gardaí need to have a record of conversations, where neither the accuracy nor the fact of the call can subsequently be disputed.</P>
    <P>However, I emphasise that I am talking only of taping conversations where there are valid operational reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>The general public need assurance that their telephone conversations with the gardaí are not taped willy-nilly on the whim of individual gardaí. I assure the House that I would utterly reject and condemn any such practice if it were found to exist. I am sure Deputies on all sides of this House agree with me. The fact that the Garda treat it as something which may be permissible only where there is operational justification for it, is evidenced by the fact that a thorough investigation is now under way concerning the circumstances and the justification for the taping of certain conversations by the anti-racketeering unit. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to let me have a full report on this matter without delay, and if it appears that any changes in practice are required in this area I assure the House that changes will be made.</P>
    <P>The most deeply worrying aspect of this case of course was that taped conversations were wrongfully removed from the offices of the anti-racketeering unit and passed on to a third party. This is a most serious matter and it, too, is the subject of investigation by the Garda authorities. It is beyond doubt that the public has a right to expect that their dealings with the Garda will enjoy confidentiality. We are fortunate that serious breaches of this nature by our police force <Col N="692" /> are a rarity but when they occur we clearly must do all in our power to see that the culprit is found and dealt with.</P>

      <P>People on both sides of this argument have attempted to contact me to represent their cases. I have not spoken to parties on either side and I do not represent any view or any disgruntled member or members of the Garda Síochána. Will the Minister agree that in regard to this matter there is a serious possibility that section 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, was breached and that an offence was committed? Section 98 reads:</P>
      <P>(1) A person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) intercepts or attempts to intercept, or</P>
      <P>(b) authorises, suffers or permits another person to intercept, or</P>

      <P>The Deputy raised a number of questions and I will attempt to answer them. I understand <Col N="693" /> that the section of the Act to which Deputy Mitchell referred has not been breached in that this matter did not involve the interception of a call, but the taping of telephone conversations by an officer in the former anti-racketeering unit who taped telephone conversations. In relation to the supposed breaches of the Official Secrets Act, there are no suggestions, other than those made by Deputy Mitchell today, that the inspector whose proposed promotion did not proceed was involved in any breach of that Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no suggestion that there was a breach of the Official Secrets Act. I became aware of difficulties in relation to this issue when a senior member of the Deputy's party contacted the secretary of my Department to give him information regarding the existence of a tape containing a number of conversations, including that of a Deputy who at the time was a member of Deputy Mitchell's party. As a result of that information, the secretary of the Department, on my instructions, informed the Garda Commissioner who instituted an internal Garda inquiry. As a result of information which has since come to light I have asked for a thorough investigation based on the facts at that time and accusations bandied about since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest any person may have been responsible. I asked if any persons were responsible; it may not have been the person whom the Minister suggested was responsible for distributing that tape. Does the Minister <Col N="694" /> consider it ethical, if she does not consider it a breach of the law, that a Member should have his telephone conversation with a Garda officer recorded and that that recording and one of a telephone conversation with a journalist and two businessmen should be widely circulated? Moneys were paid to members of the Garda Síochána by the organisation called INFACT, which were refunded and described as expenses. To whom were those moneys paid? Were they paid to members of the former anti-racketeering unit or to gardaí brought in from outside that unit? In what circumstances were they paid? Why is it not considered unusual that these moneys were repaid? Were these moneys refunded in full?</P>

In relation to payments, I have to be conscious that the circumstances surrounding this whole business are most likely to become the subject of civil proceedings and I must be careful that anything I say here in no way interferes with any aspects of those proceedings. In relation to payments to the anti-racketeering unit, when that question was raised the Garda Commissioner had an investigation carried out, on foot of which he took certain steps including the transfer to other duties of all members of the anti-racketeering unit from the rank of inspector down.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 2 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of probation and welfare officers currently employed by my Department is 170. This number will be substantially increased over the next four years: not only have I secured Government <Col N="696" /> approval, in the context of the law and order package which I announced in December, to employ an additional 50 probation and welfare officers over the next four years but I have also obtained approval to fill 20 existing vacancies this year. This total of 70 will represent an increase of more than 40 per cent in the strength of the service by 1997. I have every reason to be satisfied with this development and I am confident that the service will be well placed as a consequence to meet the additional workload which it is being asked to undertake. The real challenge will be to attract sufficient suitable candidates in that time-span and integrate them into the service in a way that will contribute most to meeting its objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there were 137 such officers at the end of 1993, an increase of 19 in five years, some of whom were required for the new prison in Wheatfield? Would she agree that the number of community service orders increased from 10,081 to 17,045, almost double, in the period 1989-92? In those circumstances would the Minister agree that the proposed increase in the so-called crime package of 12 probation officers a year for the next four years is a very meagre response indeed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when numbers are being curtailed in the public service, and have been for some time, an increase of 40 per cent is quite a significant achievement by any Minister. The probation and welfare staff do an amount of work on our behalf, both within and outside the prison service, in monitoring all the people involved in community service work orders and other such non-custodial sentencing. As the Deputy knows, these people are assisted in their work by an excellent corps of sessional supervisors as well as individuals and voluntary groups who provide supervision in individual placements. A 40 per cent increase is a substantial achievement at a time when no such increases are being granted in <Col N="697" /> public service numbers, and will meet the developing needs in this area. Not only is there provision for an extra 50 probation officers but permission has also been given to fill 20 vacancies in the present system. With the new recruits and the filling of existing vacancies we will have a probation service of which all of us can be proud.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 18, 33 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>In July last, I met two groups which represent the relatives of the victims of the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I informed both groups that the Garda Commissioner had appointed a senior Garda officer to examine the contents of the Yorkshire television programme on the bombings and I undertook to meet with both groups again when this examination was completed.</P>
      <P>Around mid-December, the Secretary of my Department received from the Commissioner the results of that examination, together with his own assessment. The secretary had this documentation considered by senior officials and following that consideration discussed the matter with me some days ago.</P>
      <P>Deputies will, I am sure, appreciate that the responsible course for me to follow now is to read through all the documentation and make my own assessment of the material. When I have completed this process which, I can assure Deputies will be in a matter of weeks, not months, it is my intention to get in touch with the families of the victims, in the first instance, and advise them of the conclusions, in advance of issuing a public statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am glad that there has been progress on this matter. I look forward to the outcome of the inquiry and the Minister's deliberations on it. This matter is not about an alleged miscarriage of justice but rather an omission of justice. At this stage, 20 years later, it is high time the State justified the long delay in explaining itself in this matter. One of the allegations made in the programme was that there was a distinct lack of co-operation by the RUC with the Garda authorities at the time. Given that there was very little co-operation in the 1970s between the Garda authorities and <Col N="699" /> the RUC &mdash; in the 1980s such co-operation was improving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the gardaí interviewed in the programme alleged that there was a lack of co-operation with the RUC, is there any evidence in the files in the Department of Justice to the effect that a complaint by the Garda was made to the Minister and the Department at the time that such co-operation was not forthcoming?</P>

      <P>As a result of the television programme the Garda Commissioner instituted, at my request, an inquiry into all the events surrounding what was probably the worst tragedy on this island since the troubles began. As a result of that investigation a report has been published and is in the possession of the Secretary of the Department. I became aware of that report a number of days ago when the Secretary discussed it with me. It is a substantial report and I need time to read through it &mdash; I think the Deputy will agree that is the proper procedure &mdash; and in the light of my assessment of that documentation I will decide what further action needs to be taken. As the relatives of the people who were killed are in constant communication with my office about this matter and there is genuine public concern that there may have been a lack of co-operation between the security forces here and those in the North, I will proceed with the utmost urgency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 82 together. Like many people who saw the television programmes referred to by the Deputies. I was disgusted at the scenes of brutality to live animals which were shown in them.</P>
      <P>The Garda are responsible for investigating allegations or complaints of acts of cruelty to animals which are prescribed as criminal offences under the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965. These include the baiting of animals and cover the use of live animals for &ldquo;blooding&rdquo; greyhounds. Badgers are also protected under the Wild Life Act, 1976.</P>
      <P>A Garda investigation has commenced into the events shown on the television programmes and the Garda are in possession of the unedited tapes of the programmes. I hope that the investigation will be completed quickly. As the investigation is continuing, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this stage other than to say that, if this investigation uncovers a breach of the law by any person, a file will be prepared and submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the normal manner for his directions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is particularly disquieting that the <Col N="704" /> laws of the State are being publicly broken in such a blatant and highly organised manner, in one instance at a prominent training ground and in the other in what must be the most heavily policed part of the State, around Portlaoise?

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Garda are not turning a blind eye to these activities. In regard to the television programmes concerned, the Garda are now satisfied that the evidence contained in the television programmes &mdash; the unedited copy of which they possess &mdash; provides sufficient grounds for them to initiate a criminal investigation. A formal complaint has been received by the Garda in regard to the incident involving greyhound blooding in Thurles.</P>
      <P>Any time a formal complaint is made to the Garda it is investigated fully. In the absence of a formal complaint the Garda do not carry out investigations. It is not correct, nor would I like it to remain on the record, that the Garda are turning a blind eye to the matter. As I said, if a formal complaint is made an investigation is carried out.</P>

As I said, once a complaint is made to the Garda an investigation takes place. The Garda have in their possession the unedited copies of the television programme material and are investigating the matter. The Garda are satisfied that the evidence provides sufficient grounds for initiating a criminal investigation. In this case the visual image displayed on the programme constitutes <i>prime facie</i> evidence of an offence having been committed and the Garda have seen it and are investigating it accordingly. That investigation will be carried out as quickly and as thoroughly as possible and whatever action has to be taken by the Garda, prosecution or otherwise, will be taken.</P>

    <P>My supplementary deals with the fines under the Wildlife Act. I put it to the Minister that erroneous or misleading statements have been coming from the Government in regard to increases by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy O'Shea, in the fines for cruelty to animals. No change has been made in recent <Col N="707" /> times so far as fines under the Wildlife Act are concerned.

I understand that this increased fine will be prescribed under the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, as amended by the Control of Dogs Act, 1986. The Minister announced his intention to do this and I presume in order to do it he needs to have an amendment to the Act, which I am sure he would bring before the House, or by regulation which he could also do.</P>

    <P>The increase in fines is a matter in the first instance for the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea. It would be a matter for his judgment, having evaluated it within his Department and with relevant parties, to decide what the appropriate fine might be. However, he would be constrained as to whether the type of fines <Col N="708" /> he might increase would be applied in the District Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8, 12, 26, 35, 45, 48, 51, 64 and 77 together. It may be helpful, a Cheann Comhairle, if initially I were to set out briefly the present understanding of the law in relation to the grounds on which bail may be refused.</P>
      <P>Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the O'Callaghan case in 1966 bail may be refused only if the court is satisfied (a) that there is a danger that the accused will not attend court for trial, or (b) that the accused will attempt to pervert the course of justice by interfering with witnesses or jurors or destroying or concealing evidence. The likelihood that an accused might commit further offences while on bail is not a ground for refusing it.</P>
      <P>The House may be interested to know that in a case in 1988 the Supreme Court was invited to reconsider its decision in the O'Callaghan case, particularly in the context of a submission to the effect that a decision to refuse bail on the basis of a likelihood of further offences being committed by an accused while on bail should be regarded as constitutionally permissible. The Supreme Court rejected that submission and reiterated its findings in the earlier case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept there is legitimate and widespread public concern about aspects of <Col N="711" /> the present situation in relation to bail and, indeed, I have made it clear publicly that I share that concern. However, it would not be conducive to a resolution of these difficulties to make exaggerated claims about the effect of our present bail laws on levels of crime or to ignore the complex nature of the issues which arise. In particular, I would have to reject as wide of the mark the reported contention in one of the questions to the effect that the bulk of major crime in the Dublin area can be attributed to a small number of offenders who are on bail.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the situation in relation to offences committed while on bail was greatly improved by the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which provided that a sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed for other offences. Largely because of this the number of offences for which persons on bail were charged fell from approximately 8,300 in 1983 to approximately 2,800 in 1992.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it remains the case that serious offenders facing the likelihood of a long period of imprisonment on other charges are tempted &mdash; and sometimes do &mdash; to use their time on bail to commit further offences. The Government regards that as being far from satisfactory and is determined that it should be addresed effectively.</P>
    <P>Complex problems of both principle and practice have to be addressed in devising an appropriate approach to this matter. While there are clear disadvantages with the operation of our present bail laws, I am sure most Deputies would accept that it would be equally unsatisfactory, in terms of principle, to bring about a situation where, irrespective of the seriousness of offences likely to be committed, a general presumption would exist against the granting of bail. This could result in the highly undesirable situation where a large number of unconvicted persons, many of whom might subsequently be found not guilty, would be incarcerated. In this context, it is worth mentioning that other <Col N="712" /> European countries are endeavouring to reduce the number of unconvicted persons in custody on the grounds of basic human rights.</P>
    <P>Apart from considerations of principle, there are sizeable practical difficulties associated with the idea of changing the bail laws. It has been estimated, for example, that if a very stringent bail regime were put in place it could necessitate the provision of upwards of 600 additional prison places at a capital cost of approximately £80 million and annual running costs of £20 million. Even if half that number of additional places were required, the cost would still be quite significant.</P>
    <P>In making these points about the complex issues which arise I am not, of course, to be taken as suggesting that the Government has a difficulty in principle with the need for changes in our bail laws or that it would be unwilling to provide the necessary resources to deal with the genuine difficulties to which the present situation gives rise. Far from it, but in the Government's view, it is important in looking at the question of bail to secure a degree of clarity and agreement as to what is actually required.</P>
    <P>In this context, and following a review of the situation which I initiated in my Department because of my concern about the operation of our bail laws, last week &mdash; with Government approval &mdash; I requested the Attorney General to secure the advice of the Law Reform Commission on the options that may be open in order to bring about a change in the law on bail. Given the difficult issues involved, I believe the commission is uniquely well placed to provide the type of in-depth analysis and considered proposals for changes which are required. I am sure all Deputies will join with me in wishing the commission well in carrying out this challenging task.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister why it has been deemed necessary to refer this matter to the Law Reform Commission? Is she aware that Fine Gael has published a Bill on the matter and does she find the contents of that Bill unacceptable? If so, what particular sections of the Bill does she find unacceptable and would she be prepared to offer amendments to that Bill? Will she agree that 28 years after the O'Callaghan case, the law should be amended to allow judges to take what they consider to be a decision in the public interest? Furthermore, does the Minister consider that words used in the editorial of a recent Garda magazine &mdash; to the effect that the bail laws are absurd, that many people are availing of the opportunity of bail to build up a next egg for when they come out of prison&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is concern in the public mind, among the Garda, and among all the people dealing with this whole area in relation to criminals out on bail committing other offences. After the O'Callaghan case <Col N="714" /> another case was taken to the Supreme Court to test the decision in the O'Callaghan case and the Supreme Court reaffirmed its decision.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Fine Gael Bill and its aspects with which we have difficulty &mdash; I do not think it would be appropriate for me to go into them here today as that should be done more appropriately at a time when the Deputy might propose his Bill be taken in Private Members' time, when I shall be delighted to go into them in detail &mdash; the Deputy asked why it should be referred to the Law Reform Commission. I did so because I thought I had dealt quite comprehensively with the fact that the whole area of bail is very complex. The Government is not afraid to take a decision in relation to introducing an amendment which would tighten up the laws in relation to granting bail if that constitutes the best way forward. It is important to know exactly what we want to achieve, so that we can put a straightforward question to the people if that is what the Law Reform Commission recommends. Of course it may recommend changes in our existing criminal law. If it does, I will have no difficulty in tabling amendments to legislation it considers should be amended. In the meantime, I think Deputy Gay Mitchell agrees, I stress that this is a complex area. The Law Reform Commission is uniquely placed to make a very comprehensive recommendation to me and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members of the House recognise the complexities of the matter in principle and in practice. Will the Minister agree that the practical matters would fall into place if we could overcome the principle? I am glad the Law Reform Commission will examine the matter. However, since there has been such widespread evidence of abuse of the bail laws &mdash; and because there has been a change in the make-up of the Supreme Court &mdash; would it be worth framing a Bill the constitutionality of which could be tested by the Supreme Court?</P>

Because of the complexities in the overall area of the granting of bail, I thought it was a better route to take. If we need to table amendments to our criminal legislation, I am prepared to do that. If the Law Reform Commission recommends a constitutional amendment, I am prepared to introduce it but it is uniquely placed to advise on this matter.</P>

      <P>Initially my view was that, if I had not referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission, perhaps June might be an appropriate time to at least consider holding a referendum on this issue. The difficulty is the framing of the question to be put to the people having regard to all the complexities in relation to granting bail. I have asked the Law Reform Commission to consider the matter. I have not imposed a time limit but I have stressed the urgency of the matter. I do not know if the Law Reform Commission will have made its recommendation in advance of the June elections but there will be plenty of other opportunities for us to put such an amendment to the people.</P>

Will she agree that the public and the Garda feel that the pendulum has swung too far in one direction and favours the criminal almost constantly? <Col N="716" /> Will she request the Law Reform Commission to report urgently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To give that facility to the courts would require amendments to Acts or a referendum. I am aware of the concern among the general public and the Garda in relation to this whole area. If it was within my power to change the manner in which we grant bail, the way in which the courts or judges view bail, I would do whatever was necessary, but it may well not be within my legislative powers to do so.</P>
      <P>As regards the pendulum swinging too much in one direction, Deputy Gay Mitchell is well aware from discussions in this House on various Bills &mdash; there were many opportunities for such discussion over the past year, at Question Time also &mdash; that I am very concerned about victims of crime. I have taken a number of positive actions in the past 12 months to help swing the pendulum in favour of the victims, not least of which was the substantial increase to the Irish Association for Victim Support and the good work they do for victims.</P>
      <P>With regard to requesting the Law Reform Commisison to hurry its report, I have no difficulty in stressing the urgency of this problem. Certainly it would suit me if its report and recommendation were issued quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister scrutinised the figures in relation to the number of incidents of a criminal nature committed by persons on bail and the number of repetitions of such incidents? Notwithstanding the right to presume innocence until proven guilty, given the information available from the Garda, will she agree there is a perception that they will be incapable of dealing with serious crime unless there is an immediate change in the bail laws?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's suggestion that the Garda will be incapable of dealing with serious crime unless there is a change in the bail laws. I have confidence in members of the Garda Síochána being able to deal with crime. I <Col N="717" /> gave a figure which responds in some part to Deputy Durkan's supplementary in my original reply, which was that, as a result of the change in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, the number of offences for which persons on bail were charged fell from approximately 8,300 in 1983 to approximately 2,800 in 1992.

      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that because of the length of time it has taken for the law in this area to be changed &mdash; in excess of 20 years &mdash; she should have moved her own Bill? Why did she decide to fall back on the Law Reform Commission? This is an area in which she should be brave. Is she afraid that legislation emanating from her Department will not withstand scrutiny?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Carey is serious when he accuses me of not being brave, my decisions over the past 12 months show a certain amount of bravery. I am not afraid to introduce a Bill on the basis that it might be found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. We have to be conscious of that fact and it would be grossly irresponsible of me, as Minister for Justice, to bring forward legislation if I had a serious doubt as to its constitutionality. That would be a gross mishandling of my portfolio and a waste of Members' time. That is the reason I asked the Attorney General to request the Law Reform Commission to examine this complex area. It is important that the recommendations are fully thought out and are constitutional.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of her undertaking in her statement of 14 December 1993 to provide 210 additional prison places, the closed St. Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital in Castlerea, County Roscommon, is being considered as one of the options for the location of a new prison; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>As announced in my comprehensive law and order package on 14 December 1993, the Government has approved the provision of 210 additional prison spaces, including a new, purpose-designed custodial facility for women to accommodate up to 60 offenders. To avoid any doubt I should say that the new facility for women will replace the existing facility in Mountjoy which will then be used to accommodate male offenders.</P>
      <P>The location of the new prison spaces will be a matter for specific decision by the Government and it would be inappropriate for me to comment in advance of that decision on the options being considered. The criteria that may be expected to be taken into account by the Government in deciding on locations include site availability, convenience within the prison system, any need for prisoner dispersal, the case for decentralisation, costs of development, ease and efficiency of operation and general management requirements.</P>
      <P>The weight given to these criteria respectively will be determined by the needs of the particular prisoner population to be accommodated. Planning for the new accommodation has not yet reached a stage where costs other than those associated with staff time are being incurred in the operation.</P>

      <P>Is the site being considered in the Minister's constituency? Can she tell the House whether the prison will be a women's prison? I recall the original plan for Wheatfield was that it would be a women's prison. Can the Minister assure the House that when this prison is built it will be used as a women's prison?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First, as the Deputy well knows the site is not located in my constituency. Second, this will be a specially dedicated women's prison. It has been represented to me by women prisoners and the prison management and staff in Mountjoy, by the Joint Committee on Women's Rights and other concerned groups that the existing facility is totally unsuitable for the type of women prisoner we have to accommodate. Women prisoners have special needs and should be accommodated in a specially dedicated unit. The Deputy can be assured that it will be such a unit.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recall what happened at Wheatfield when the Minister's colleague, Dr. Woods, then Minister for Justice, was not able to deal with the protests which accompanied the location of prisons. Is the Minister aware that about £12 million has been spent by her Department in designing prisons that have not been built? Will it be possible on this occasion to save money by using some or part of those designs rather than designing another prison at enormous cost to the taxpayer?</P>

      <P>As I announced publicly on 21 January, the steering committee will advise me in relation to a range of issues in connection with the provision of the new women's prison, including regime, facilities, services and design matters. The construction of this new facility represents a unique opportunity to provide modern, dedicated accommodation with high-grade facilities designed specifically to meet the needs of women prisoners. It is most important that these needs should be clearly identified in advance of any design work and that there should be a broad consensus on the type of facility required. The first task of the steering committee will be to complete this preparatory work as quickly as possible and to report to me with recommendations as to how we should proceed from there.</P>
      <P>The committee has held its first meeting and has placed advertisements in the national newspapers inviting submissions from all interested parties.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 2 December 1993, the Dublin-Dundalk passenger-mail train was interfered with near Balbriggan and a large number of mail bags were thrown off along the line. The gardaí recovered 23 mail bags; all of the bags had been opened, the registered mail removed and some other items of mail had been interfered with. All recovered mail was handed over to the postal authorities. The explanatory stamp on the item of mail in question indicates that this item was among the mail which was recovered.

In the case referred to, a letter to an MP was very carefully opened and a message stamped on afterwards to the effect that the item was delayed due to a mail robbery. For the sake of public confidence in the postal service and the general welfare of cross-Border relations, will the Minister consider providing greater security on the mail train and affixing to envelopes which have been opened a detailed note saying why the envelope came to be opened?</P>

      <P>As a former Minister for Communications with responsibility for An Post I appreciate the importance of ensuring confidence in our postal system. This is also important to me as Minister for Justice. In the incident referred to, 23 mail bags were interfered with. The Garda recovered 11 mail bags on the rail line, all of which had been slit open and registered mail removed and the other 12 mail bags were recovered at various locations along the River Boyne. Each had been opened and in the case of some of the bags, their contents had been interfered with. All of the recovered mail was then handed over by the Garda Síochána to An Post and I am assured by the Garda authorities no item of mail was opened by a member of the Garda Síochána. Any suggestion to the contrary is a most serious one and should not be made lightly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>In July 1993 we had a very successful conference on the issue of safety for women. During the conference the question of separate legal representation for rape victims was raised and I agreed to look at the matter. I made no secret of the fact that immediately before the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill was introduced in 1988, I had made representations to the then Minister for Justice advocating the inclusion of a provision allowing for separate legal representation in the Bill.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been introduced over the last few years to improve the position of the victim in the criminal trial process and these measures will reduce the sense of alienation and helplessness that sometimes arises. For example, procedures are now in force whereby the prosecution team arrange for pre-trial consultations with complainants in cases of serious sexual assaults to familiarise them with the legal procedures and to explain the layout and procedures of the court and the type of matters which may be the subject of examination by counsel. In 1991 the Civil Legal Aid Scheme was extended, subject to the normal conditions, to allow a complainant in cases of serious sexual assaults to consult a legal aid solicitor who may accompany the complainant into court and, of course, the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, further restricted the cross-examination of the claimant on his or her past sexual history. Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, the court is required, in fixing sentence, to take into account the effect of the crime on the victim and, if necessary, to hear the evidence of the victim on that aspect. That Act also enabled unduly lenient sentences in rape and other cases to be appealed by the prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> These are quite significant developments and it is incumbent on us to see how they operate before we embark on a course which would, in effect, involve rejection of the advice received on the subject of separate representation both from the Law Reform Commission and the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended that there should not be any provision for separate legal representation for the complainant. They questioned the constitutional propriety of such a proposal and stated that there must also be serious uncertainty as to the effect it would have on the trial of such cases, that in some cases, far from assisting in the conviction of guilty rapists, it might so complicate the hearing and alienate the jury as to result in unjustified acquittals. This is stated in the Law Reform Commission report on rape, LRC 24-1988. The Second Commission on the Status of Women in January 1993, also looked at this matter and decided that separate legal representation for the complainant was not feasible.</P>
    <P>I will continue to keep the situation of rape victims in criminal trials under close observation. The situation of victims appearing in our courts, in the past, was the subject of understandable public concern and if I am not satisfied that the various changes made since 1988 go far enough to assist the victim then I will certainly look at further measures, including separate representation for victims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply. The Minister mentioned victim impact evidence. Is the Minister happy that at the moment the relatives of victims can confront such victim impact evidence? For example, in a recent case evidence was presented to the court that the victims were mentally unscathed and there was no opportunity for the victims' relatives to have an input as to whether that finding by the Director of Public Prosecutions was correct.</P>

      <P>All the changes, <Col N="726" /> including the one referred to by Deputy O'Donnell, which have been made since the 1988 Act came into force are being monitored very closely in the Department because I am as concerned as Deputy O'Donnell and others about this matter. It would be wrong at this stage to go directly into separate legal representation until we have closely monitored this and have made decisions about the impact of the changes since 1988. My Department officials and I are looking at that very carefully and if it becomes clear that there are still difficulties we will look at other measures including separate legal representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>

The decisions in each of these cases are being closely monitored and if I believe on advice from my officials that there is a necessity to make further changes such changes will be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated on 18 January during the debate on the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993, before the Select Committee on Security and Legislation, I do not favour the introduction of a separate national drugs enforcement agency to deal with the problem of the availability of illegal drugs here. I have reached this conclusion after considerable thought and consultation with members of the Drug Enforcement Agency of the United States. I am not convinced that such an organisation would be appropriate for <Col N="728" /> the situation here, but I am determined to ensure that the resources of all the agencies involved here can be co-ordinated and used in the most effective way in the fight against drugs.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the drugs situation here on several occasions in the recent past. In October I provided the House with a detailed overview of the problem in the context of my response to a Private Member's motion on the crime situation generally. On 14 October and again on 25 November I dealt specifically with various aspects of the drugs problem in my answers to parliamentary questions, including a priority question. On those occasions I referred to certain measures which the Garda authorities had already taken to deal with the problem of drug abuse in areas of known drug activity, including the establishment of a special task force in the north inner city.</P>
    <P>I made it clear that the drugs problem is a matter of the highest priority to me. I have made this clear also to the Garda authorities. I am satisfied that the problem is on the top of their agenda too and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Garda Síochána on the success of their operation last weekend which led to a seizure of 1 kilo of heroin near Dublin Airport. This is one example of the efforts made by the Garda to tackle the availability of illicit drugs here. Other examples include successful raids on premises where so-called &ldquo;rave discos&rdquo; are taking place.</P>
    <P>Specifically in relation to Dublin I would like to mention two things: first, meetings are held on a monthly basis which are attended by members of the Dublin Drugs Squad and other units in the DMA at which recent seizures and trends are discussed and future operations are discussed and planned. Secondly, a detective superintendent was appointed on 21 October 1993 to head the Central Drugs Squad based at Harcourt Square on a full-time basis. These developments have resulted in major surveillance operations against persons involved in drugs activity.</P>
    <P>I assume that the reference to the central drugs office by Deputy McGrath is <Col N="729" /> in fact a reference to the Garda National drug administration office based at Garda headquarters, which has responsibility for co-ordination of national drug law enforcement and international liaison. I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are no plans at present to increase the strength of this office. The situation will, however, be kept under review in the light of assessments of the needs and demands in this area.</P>
    <P>I would now like to return to the question of inter-agency co-operation in regard to law enforcement. A senior official of my Department is currently preparing a report on this matter at my request. As part of his remit he is meeting with senior management of the other Departments and State agencies involved in the area &mdash; in particular with the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda authorities and the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The main task of the report is to secure the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies. The report will also address the level of resources required to tackle the problem, including the question of the greater use of the Naval Service and Air Corps. It will also address the question of whether legislative changes are necessary.</P>
    <P>I understand that substantial progress has already been made on the report and I expect to have it very soon. As soon as it is submitted to me I will consider it as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I recently visited the naval base at Haulbowline to fully inform myself about the capability of the naval services to provide support to the civil power in combating the importation of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>The drugs situation in Ireland is relatively small by international standards, but it is certainly serious and needs very close and continuous attention. International experience shows that it is a notoriously difficult problem to overcome, even for countries with much greater resources than we have. I am determined to make significant progress in the fight against drug abuse. Apart <Col N="730" /> from Garda initiatives, and maximum inter-agency co-operation, the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993, which I referred to already, contains provisions for the confiscation of proceeds of crime and deals with money laundering by criminals, including drug traffickers. I believe that this legislation represents a major initiative against the main players in the drugs scene. By targeting the proceeds and profits of drug traffickers I believe the legislation will help to turn the tide against the insidious growth of drug abuse in Ireland. As Deputies will be aware, the Bill is awaiting Report Stage in this House.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is aware, I raised this matter on Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill when she declined to accept my amendment under which a drugs enforcement agency would have been set up. The Minister is against the establishment of such an agency apparently because the American Drug Enforcement Agency advised against it. Would the Minister agree that Deputies such as myself, who represents south central Dublin, and Deputy Gregory and others who represent central Dublin, know more about the drugs problem as it affects people on the streets of this city than the American Drug Enforcement Agency? Does the Minister also agree that there is statistical information available which shows that some countries export more, in terms of gross national product, in illegal drugs than in all legitimate products added together? Would she therefore agree that the only way to tackle this problem is to set up a drugs enforcement agency comprising the Garda Síochána, the Departments of Health, Justice, Foreign Affairs, the Marine and Defence so that their efforts in tackling this problem can be co-ordinated not just nationally but internationally, through the European Union to ensure there is an offensive against those countries which continue to export these drugs with impunity?</P>

      <P>There is confusion as to what is meant by a drugs <Col N="731" /> enforcement agency. If such an agency was to be established here it would not be an amalgam of the Garda Síochána, the Naval Service, the Air Corps and Customs. It would be a separate and distinct law enforcement agency with responsibility only for drugs legislation enforcement, and no other force in the country would have a role to play in that regard. At present there are members of the Garda in every unit in every division, together with the Drugs Squad in each of the divisions, dealing with the drugs problem. It was appropriate for me, as Minister for Justice, in considering how we should tackle the problem, to find out how the issue is dealt with in other countries. It was appropriate also for the official in my Department who is preparing the report which is due to be presented to me shortly and, indeed, for me, to take the opportunity to meet with members of the American Drug Enforcement Agency when they visited this country. Here we have one single police force under one command and it is worth preserving. My priority is to retain that structure. What Deputy Mitchell is proposing is that the efforts of all the agencies involved &mdash; the Garda, Customs, the Naval Service and the Air Corps &mdash; should be co-ordinated. That is what I am striving to achieve.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Naval Service and the Air Corps should be given a greater role. There is a high level of co-operation at the top of the structure &mdash; we discussed this matter at great length at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security &mdash; and it is my hope that there will be a similar level of co-operation in day-to-day operations. That is what we all want to achieve in the most efficient and effective way possible. As I said in that respect I have the full support of management in the Garda Síochána, the Customs service and the Naval Service. I am awaiting the report being prepared by my departmental official and as soon as it is made available to me I will deal with the matter appropriately.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister <Col N="732" /> agree that if we decide to set up a drugs enforcement agency it will do what we ask it to do and that it will not, as she imagines, be separate from the Garda Síochána? Is she aware that in the amendment I put forward recently at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security I named various bodies and suggested that the Minister should have the power to bring these together to deal with the problem? Is she aware that Dublin is awash with drugs; that, in the words of a colleague of mine, the fastest growing indigenous industry in Dublin city is the distribution of illegal drugs? Is she aware that people commit crimes, such as thefts, car break-ins, handbag snatching and burglaries, to feed their serious drugs habit? Is she aware that the chairman of the US Senate sub-committee, Senator Carey, said that &ldquo;narco-dollars&rdquo; are distorting the figures for entire states given the scale of the problem? Accordingly, does she agree that it is time she reconsidered her opposition to the proposal that a drugs enforcement agency be set up? In reconsidering this matter will she consider the possibility of establishing a coast-guard service perhaps involving the European Community?</P>

      <P>In my initial response I outlined the changes that have been made to the Garda structure, particularly in the Dublin area, to deal specifically with the drugs problem. As the Deputy is aware, some of these changes were made following a visit I paid to certain areas in the north inner city. We now have specialised units. However, it would be wrong to think that these are the only units involved in surveillance of those operating in the underworld of drugs; all members of the Garda Síochána are involved in surveillance and that is as it should be. My concern in having a specialised agency is that that agency only would be involved and people would feel that the matter should be left to them. I believe that would be a bad day's work. On Committee Stage, when he spoke to his amendment to the Bill, Deputy Mitchell was anxious to ensure that there would be proper co-ordination <Col N="733" /> between each of the agencies involved. In this regard the European Union has a role to play. We now have EUROPOL while Ministers for Justice discuss all the issues involved at Council level.</P>
      <P>Probably the most important issue that European Ministers for Justice must discuss is that of drug trafficking within the European Union and its surrounding seas and that is being done. I want to ensure that the agencies here who are co-operating to deal with the situation are brought together in a co-ordinating way and that the level of co-operation at the top of each of those organisations is translated into the same level of co-operation in day-to-day operations.</P>

      <P>I outlined in my original reply the measures taken recently in the Dublin area, including the one in the north inner city and the appointment of a detective superintendent to head the Central Drugs Squad which is based at Harcourt Square. I also outlined the operational matters that have occurred under which every month there is a meeting of those involved in this area to discuss the trends, the seizures that have taken place, and to co-ordinate the levels of surveillance and other activities to ensure that future operations are on a planned basis. They report to me in the normal way. If I feel there are other specific measures that need to be taken I will have no hesitation in discussing them with the Garda Commissioner and, in particular, with the detective superintendent who is charged with responsibility for the Central Drugs Squad.</P>

      <P>This new employers' PRSI may prove to be the most sinister measure of this budget. It certainly is an anti-employment measure because it adds greatly to labour costs of which we ought to be conscious, particularly in the context of export industries which must keep their costs down if they are to remain competitive. Guinness has already said that the likelihood is that this one measure will add £1 million to its annual wage bill. That £1 million will go directly to the Government with no benefit either to the company or to its employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I telephoned a number of new chemical industries in Cork &mdash; these are the great white hope of a Cork that was bled to death with the collapse of the manufacturing industries of the 1980s, including Ford, Dunlops, Gouldings and Dwyer's. These new chemical companies were brought to the Cork region by the IDA at substantial cost to the public purse by way of grants and incentives. I asked these companies how this measure would impact on them. One new and expanding company told me that it would add about £150,000 to its wage bill at the end of the year, the kind of money that would enable this company to take on six additional workers. In this case, these workers would have been graduates who otherwise would be forced to emigrate adding to the great brain drain from this country. Is it not sad that the Government is putting <Col N="785" /> in place the kind of measures that will force graduates to seek work abroad, using the talents they acquired here at the expense of taxpayers for the benefit of competing companies in a shrinking world market? Is it not a sad irony that the Government did not take this factor into consideration when this measure was proposed?</P>
    <P>I talked to managers of co-operatives and they had a similar story to tell. The companies with highly skilled and graduate labour will suffer most. The co-operatives, the new high-tech chemical industries and the financial services companies are the main new employers of young graduates here, and they will be penalised and forced to shed staff at a time when we ought to be encouraging them to take on additional workers. We should consider the contradiction of providing State grants for these companies to induce them to set up here in the first place and introducing another measure in this budget to add to their labour costs.</P>
    <P>What type of impact will this measure have on the IDA's future plans for attracting job-generating enterprises to this country? Surely the cost of labour is a very important element in the decision of any company to locate in Ireland and anything that adds to labour costs is a disincentive to companies to come to Ireland and create badly needed jobs.</P>
    <P>This Government would wish us to believe that this is a job-creating budget. What a nonsense, and what a setback for those who live in the Cork region where there was a huge investment not just by national government but by local government to create the conditions where these companies could set up. Great efforts were made to create linkages between these companies and University College Cork and the regional college in Cork. What a setback this budgetary measure will be for those who live in Cork and who are so acutely aware of the need to retain existing jobs and create more jobs. Shame on whoever thought of this measure.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the residential property tax which is nothing more than a <Col N="786" /> badly thought out botched attempt to put in place a revenue-earning measure. It must be scrapped. It constitutes a charter of unfairness and bears no relation whatsoever to the ability of families to pay. It takes no account of a family's position in respect of a building society or lending house. Very few young people own their own houses; rather, they pay huge mortgages to building societies. Indeed, very few of us in middle age have paid off our mortgages. Yet it is proposed to levy a property tax on such people. It is a purely locational tax that will hit middle income families, ordinary people such as teachers, nurses and gardaí, who have invested their money wisely and built houses in certain locations in city areas.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, a house is valued by its location. Families who live in much more valuable houses in parts of rural Ireland will get away scot free. This measure bears no relation to the delivery of State or local government services and its level is dictated by the whim of the property market which can be very volatile. The aggregation of family or household income is discriminatory and will mean that a series of very modest incomes in a family will tip them over the income threshold of £25,000 per annum. It will impact greatly on families who will also be hit in this budget by the reduction in mortgage subsidy and VHI relief. Those families are the backbone of this country. They have to pay for their children's third level education, their health services and service charges to local government. They pay for everything. This is a mean discriminatory tax and I appeal to the Minister present to use his influence to scrap this part of the budget. The Progressive Democrats will do everything possible to ensure that this measure is defeated in the Finance Bill. It is nothing less than a disgrace, an assault on ordinary people trying to put a roof over their heads and maintain a standard for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I will refer to youth unemployment. At present there are 85,000 people under the age of 25 years on the live register, many of whom left <Col N="787" /> school and failed to find work. They went directly from education to a life of idleness, aimlessness and hopelessness. This budget gives them no hope or prospect of a job. Young people wishing to secure a place in apprenticeship schemes are failing to do so. It was rightly said in this House not long ago that it is easier for a young person to secure a place in a medical faculty of a university than to secure a place in an apprenticeship scheme. The way we treat our young people is scandalous and this budget gives no hope to such people. As I said at the outset, it is a bad budget and will do nothing to retain existing jobs and less to create new jobs. It must be condemned and my party will not support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>What a debacle this budget has turned out to be. From a position where there was no great pressure on it, the Government has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Why should that surprise us? This is a Government in which one party dumps policy for political expediency, allows Gerry Adams to be treated like a celebrity, whose first Bill was to be an Ethics in Government Bill and in which a Minister is asked to answer questions of conflict of interest on behalf of another Minister. This is a Government which has further mortgaged our future and that of our children, that spends nearly £1 million on one Minister's constituency and allows the Education budget to provide £5 million for a sports stadium while some schools are deemed seriously substandard.</P>
      <P>How can this Government expect an uplift in the economy through an expected upsurge in business confidence when it displays itself as being politically inept? What does it consider the public's reaction will be to the speculation on a rowing back of part of the budget provisions, however welcome that rowing back might be? What will business people think of the lack of judgment in applying a property tax and then having an apparent change of mind? Business confidence will not be built on the &ldquo;will they, won't they&rdquo; school of politics. How can that possibly help job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> The whole emphasis of this budget &mdash; or the lack of it &mdash; displays a Government that is unsure of itself, prevaricating and doing a little of this and a little of that. It tinkered with the tax system where there has been a small reform. For example, a single taxpayer will receive the maximum benefit of almost £200 per annum by a change in the personal allowances and standard rate tax band. It gave a small concession on levies for low income earners, a little too modest to have any real impact. It reduced employer's PRSI for low earners, a modest little gesture, but did it consider the possible ramifications? My colleague referred to the ramifications for those on higher incomes, but I will dwell on the revision of the PRSI rates for those earning £9,000 or less per annum.</P>
    <P>At first glance that measure might be welcome as a step towards reducing employment cuts. However, serious questions must be asked about the social credentials of a Government which is prepared to penalise employers who wish to pay their employees fair wages in favour of those employers who pay subsistence level wages. I accept that we should have some sympathy for the vulnerable sectors such as the clothing industry which has been bombarded from all sides &mdash; including the imposition of a 21 per cent VAT rate on clothing &mdash; but this measure is not restricted to those type of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; jobs. This measure will encourage companies to erode full time employment and replace it with lower paid part-time work. For example, in the United Kingdom one-third of the jobs in the retail sector are estimated to be part-time and lower paid and evidence suggests that the bulk of new jobs being created in the labour market there are lower paid and part-time. This follows on a United States trend where official Department of Labour figures show that up to 95 per cent of new jobs created in certain sectors of retailing in a ten year period were officially classified as &ldquo;dead end&rdquo; jobs. The Minister by his actions, whether intentional or not, has opened the door to the creation of a dead end, poorly rewarded underclass, with all the attendant social implications. <Col N="789" /> We have already heard about the penalties on employers who wish to reward those who are highly qualified.</P>
    <P>This is allegedly a Government of transparency and accountability. Let us consider its accounting principles. Normal Government accounting principles have been severely stretched over the past few years. For example, some, though not all, of the savings on the servicing of the national debt last year were carried into 1994 to be deducted from this year's debt service cost. However, arrears of public sector pay due to be paid this year were prepaid last year to raise last year's borrowing level. The comparison with last year is made even more complicated by the fact that there was a similar shifting around of payments at the end of 1992 when a public sector pay round was paid ahead of time so that the 1993 Exchequer borrowing requirement could be artificially reduced.</P>
    <P>Those changes were made to avoid the appearance of a good out-turn from the Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1993, which would have raised expectations considerably in the early part of 1994. That is not good practice. It would be much better to account for funds when spent rather than to move expenditure from one year to another for no good reason other than to make the figures look good. Setting such a precedent means that Governments could massage figures endlessly by allocating funds between different years on a large scale. That is not a sound practice for any Government. The Minister failed to give details of any plan to reduce over time the need to borrow money each year to fund the Government's expenditure.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1994 our national debt will be in excess of £29 billion. The Minister said that the EBR will be kept comfortably below 3 per cent of GNP. Any economist would say that the forecast of an addition of £800 million to the national debt cannot be described as an action which will reduce our debt burden. There is no attempt even to reduce new borrowing.</P>
    <P>Unless we believe that Government spending is so efficient that it produces <Col N="790" /> an economic return in perpetuity which is greater than the interest rate on the debt &mdash; an outcome very few business people would accept &mdash; and we want to reverse some of the progress made in controlling expenditure and borrowing, there must be a decision not just to reduce but to eliminate new borrowing. The Government has not carried through on this policy. Borrowing for day-to-day expenditure should be eliminated. There is no strategy for this in the budget, no strategy for the future of our country.</P>
    <P>This Government which has such a large majority &mdash; a monolith that staggers its way through &mdash; presided over the most hamfisted charade ever when it launched the so-called National Development Plan. We saw the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, who when he was on this side of the House, scourged his current colleagues on the Government side for lapses in ethics, go along with and participate in that charade managed by the spin doctors.</P>
    <P>A folk culture has been established through the generations of Fianna Fáil Governments, the fancy footworkers, the three card trick party of Irish politics. Labour is now well imbued with that culture. The property tax and the reduction in mortgage and VHI reliefs renege on previous promises. Who is leading whom?</P>
    <P>Of all the budget measures the extension of the property tax hits people hardest. It does so in two ways. People will have to pay tax on a national value, not on what they own. Very few people own their houses. I have not repaid even half my mortgage. Moneys used to pay this tax have already been taxed so it represents double taxation. People liable for this tax are not property speculators; they are not sitting on an expensive asset waiting for the highest bidders. They are people who have worked all their lives to provide a good home for their families. Young people who have scrimped and saved to buy their dream home, in which to raise their family are also victims of this tax. Those people have been dealt a double blow by the imposition of a tax on their home and a reduction in the <Col N="791" /> mortgage interest relief. They are stretched to the limit at present. How will those in receipt of a fixed income meet their commitments? The Government is creating another poverty trap.</P>
    <P>The property tax is a concerted attack on ordinary middle income families, who strive to put a roof over their heads, pay their own health insurance and be net contributors to society. They are being targeted by this soulless Government.</P>
    <P>There were absolute commitments given prior to the last general election by the two parties now in Government. They have introduced taxes that were then explicitly ruled out. Promises which Deputy Kemmy described today as being made in &ldquo;the white heat of the election campaign&rdquo; are coming back to haunt them. The middle income families whom they have explicitly targeted will not easily forget or forgive. People in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire will be penalised by the imposition of this tax because of where they live. I can imagine the message which will be sent out in forthcoming elections to the parties in Government.</P>
    <P>The proudest boast of the Labour Party at their conference this year will be that the only promise they have kept is to lift the ban under section 31 and make Gerry Adams a superstar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Callely. Having listened to Deputy Keogh take such high moral ground I thought she was not in the House last week, but I suppose that is an internal party matter to which we should not refer. Regarding the budget proposals and the background to it, we must consider how far this country has progressed since 1987 and how it performed from the early eighties until 1987. From 1982 to 1987 our rate of borrowing was between 13 per cent and 16 per cent of GNP, while under the 1994 budget projections our rate of borrowing will be less than 3 per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keogh referred to the public finances. The changes that have taken <Col N="792" /> place in public finances during the past number of years have led to an inflation rate here of approximately 1.5 per cent, the lowest inflation rate here since the fifties. The benefits to this country from that low inflation rate are obvious to all citizens. It has improved our living standards, perhaps not to the extent that everyone would have liked, but such improvements cannot be made without sacrifices.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the budget, the residential property tax and other taxes but there has been little talk about the changes in taxation in respect of personal allowances and the tax bands. There is a commitment that until such time as the proposed changes are fully implemented there will be ongoing adjustments in respect of the tax bands and rates so that people will not incur any financial loss in respect of taxes for which they are liable.</P>
    <P>I and my neighbours have paid indirect taxes by means of service charges for several years. Some people have been dealt a double blow in respect of those service charges in that they have had to pay for services, such as group water schemes, and also to pay the ongoing costs of maintaining those services. Yet people in this city and other cities do not pay any service charges. It is time the people who are up in arms about the property tax considered their position in respect of liability for service charges. If service charges had been applied such a measure might have obviated the need for the Minister for Finance to introduce a property tax.</P>
    <P>The budget catered for a number of groupings. Those in receipt of social welfare will benefit from the budget by receiving increases of 3 per cent at a time when the rate of inflation is 1.5 per cent. The budget also proposes increases in child benefit in respect of the third child and subsequent children. It has introduced the provision of a widower's pension which is an historic development. There have been changes in the social welfare system in respect of PRSI and the amounts to be paid by low income workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> The clothing and textile industry &mdash; and companies with tight profit margins &mdash; will welcome this change. The change in PRSI could well influence the prospects with regard to further job creation. With the other schemes such as the family income supplement, the budget is aimed at encouraging people to go out and work rather than to live on social welfare. The margin between living on social welfare and working in a low paid job had become very small and the changes in the budget will increase it.</P>
    <P>The increased funding provided for non-national roads is welcome in terms of development. If facilities are not provided in rural areas for people to travel to and from work and social activities the country will be denuded of its rural population. People will be forced to live in overcrowded towns and villages which lack services and a social environment. Despite what some people say, money will be provided on an ongoing basis to bring our rural roads up to a proper standard. In recent times roads have deteriorated due to inclement weather conditions.</P>
    <P>The housing policy will succeed in shortening waiting lists. We all welcome the opportunity of helping those most in need, who are not in a position to provide proper housing accommodation for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that some Deputies have not highlighted the changes in tax bands to the same extent as they have highlighted some of the minor changes. Single persons will receive an increase of £175 in their personal allowance while married couples will receive an increase of £350. The 27 per cent tax rate will apply to married couples earning up to £16,400. These are major changes in allowances and tax bands. People seem to think that because there was a surplus in last year's budget, there should have been hand-outs this year. Surplus moneys should be directed towards social problems. Our major social problem at the moment is unemployment and any money that can be diverted towards creating employment is welcome. The fact that £100 million of low interest <Col N="794" /> money is being provided for industry is welcome. If properly used, it will make an enormous contribution to our small industries and help them to compete in a wider market.</P>
    <P>We are living in a time of change with regard to social issues and what people are prepared to do for themselves. Many people will benefit from the tax changes, particularly the change in regard to probate tax. I thank the Minister for Finance for acceding to the request by many backbenchers in the last 12 months to change what everybody believed was an unfair tax on people when they are most vulnerable. The 1 per cent levy, which it was agreed 12 months ago would be introduced for one year, has now been dropped but the change has not received much recognition. Enormous benefits will accrue from the changes in PRSI for members of farming families and families of those involved in small industry and service sector. It will bring these people into line with other taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I hope that the ongoing negotiations with regard to public service pay will be brought to a speedy conclusion. Nothing has helped this country more in the last few years than the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It prevented industrial strikes which in the 1980s led us to believe that we were going nowhere. Every time there was a strike or a go-slow and wage increases were given, it was believed that the businesses were not in a position to sustain those increases.</P>
    <P>Changes in this budget will allow people to decide what way they want to spend their money. In terms of the property tax, perhaps the Minister should consider the level at which this tax is to be introduced and the exclusion of income of family members. It may not be fair to include the income of families as well as that of their parents as in many cases those people do not make a direct contribution to the household budget.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £100 million to wipe out health boards' debts. This will clear up a mess that had been ignored down the years. Because health boards were allowed to overspend in the 1980s they had built up a deficit of £100 million. <Col N="795" /> I hope that a word of warning will go to those health boards that, while they have been bailed out with amnesty moneys, it will not be available in future. The position with regard to waiting lists has also improved.</P>
    <P>Remedial works on local authority housing are ongoing and we all hope they will continue in the years ahead. The money provided to agriculture, which will go towards installing a proper computer system to help speed up payments to farmers, is welcome. Another welcome provision is the £5 million to tourism for which the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, will have responsibility. It is important that expenditure on tourism promotion is in the hands of those accountable to the public, namely, the elected public representatives or the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>Like many of my colleagues, I could go on at length about the benefits to the community from the changes in the budget. In the months and years ahead the country will benefit enormously from this budget.</P>

      <P>The 1994 budget is significant, not just in a budgetary context, it is a budget with a medium to long term strategy. It builds on the solid economic foundation developed by Fianna Fáil-led administrations since 1987. The dark days that resulted from the short stint in office of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition from 1982 to 1987 are gone and we can now move progressively forward.</P>
      <P>All the Opposition Deputies who have contributed to the debate have highlighted all that is wrong with the budget and have referred to the problems facing the country. I would not wish to deny a person the right to highlight an issue about which they are concerned but, in fairness, we should consider the progress made by Fianna Fáil-led administrations in tackling all national issues.</P>
      <P>In 1987, Fianna Fáil set out clearly the then Government objectives:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has firmly set for itself the following policy objectives <Col N="796" /> which are interdependent and related to each other.</P>
    <P>1. To restore the public finances by reducing overall Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>2. To reduce Government borrowing and to stabilise and then reduce the growth of the National Debt as a percentage of GNP.</P>
    <P>3. To restore confidence, bring down interest rates and maintain the stability of the Irish pound within the EMS.</P>
    <P>4. To stimulate and encourage economic growth, investment and employment in every possible sector of productive activity.</P>
    <P>5. To reduce the overall burden of taxation and in particular the level of direct personal taxation, and to reform the tax system to make it more equitable.</P>
    <P>6. To improve the cost effectiveness and equity of our social services.</P>
    <P>In essence, those six policy objectives have created the solid foundations on which we have been able to build our economy. We have made much progress since those policy objectives were copperfastened and embroidered into Government policy in 1987. Our rate of economic growth has been remarkable while growth in GDP has averaged approximately 5 per cent per annum compared to an EC average of 2 per cent. Not only have we stronger economic growth but we also have a low inflation rate and our Exchequer borrowing requirement has been greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>While still not satisfactory, our employment performance compares favourably with that of other countries. While we have made good progress, I do not for a moment disagree with the view that the number of jobs created is well short of what is required. Reducing unemployment and improving living standards are two of the most important <Col N="797" /> challenges facing the Government. The strategy on how to respond to these challenges is set out in the Programme for Government and the National Development Plan. The budget endorses this strategy and spells out the Government's desire to address the issue of unemployment and boost enterprise. The budget is also socially caring and will keep the public finances under control.</P>
    <P>It has to be agreed, however reluctantly, by some Opposition Deputies, including some Labour backbenchers, that a great many people will be much better off after the budget. By now most people know the implications of the budget for them and how much better off they will be as a result of the wide-ranging tax reforms and social welfare measures. The budget contains much good news and has opened a lot of doors, so to speak.</P>
    <P>The item in the budget which has given rise to the most debate is the residential property tax. This is probably one of the smaller items in the budget. If my memory serves me right, the residential property tax will bring in an additional £5 million in 1994. In the context of the overall budgetary figure, this is a relatively small amount of money. The rate of residential property tax for property under £100,000 is being reduced from 1.5 per cent to 1 per cent and the rate is being set at 2 per cent for properties in excess of £100,000, with a reduction in the income threshold from £28,000 to £25,000. I do not believe there is much difference between what people would have paid on the £91,000 threshold and what they will pay on the £75,000 threshold.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that this change will affect me both personally and in my capacity as a public representative, and I do not like it. I raised this matter at a parliamentary party meeting, where matters of this nature should be discussed. It is reckless and foolish for any public representative to come into this House, try to score points and get front page media coverage by dissociating themselves from a particular measure in the budget. I want to state categorically that I am concerned at the way some Labour <Col N="798" /> backbenchers have been so hypocritical on some of the issues contained in the budget &mdash; they want to know the good news and want to associate the good news only with their party. One has only to listen to their speeches in the House.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil has had a solid proven record in Government since the first Fianna Fáil Government in 1933 and, in particular, since 1987. If the partners in Government agree a strategy on budgetary matters which entails acceding to the demands of one or both partners for increases in certain items of expenditure, they must realise that one has to look at other ways of raising revenue. If Fianna Fáil was to ignore the overall picture and accede to all the demands of the &ldquo;monkey on your back&rdquo;, for the want of a better description, without considering other ways of raising revenue it would be reckless and would once again place the country in the disastrous position in which it found itself in 1987. To slip back into that position would be unforgivable and downright irresponsible and while it may have been accommodated by Fine Gael just to remain in Government I know my party will not put up with that type of recklessness.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that most of the measures in the budget have been welcomed. It is regrettable that people are jumping on one particular bandwagon and making a major issue out of this. I raised this matter at a meeting of my parliamentary party, the correct place to raise such matters. I am pleased that the Minister and the Taoiseach indicated that they would be prepared to consider various measures to address the concerns of the Fianna Fáil public representatives who brought certain matters to their attention. I think I can say, &ldquo;watch this space&rdquo;, in the Finance Bill and we may see an alteration in relation to the residential property tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxation reform in this budget is welcome and most people will benefit from it but taxation reform which is <Col N="799" /> directed at stimulating genuine enterprise and promoting employment is particularly welcome. The £100 million fund for small businesses to ensure availability of adequate credit facilities from financial institutions at reasonable terms is welcome also. I anxiously await details of the European Union subsidisation loans which are to be administered by the ICC Bank at a time when Irish interest rates are at their lowest for almost 20 years. These measures will encourage and assist the business community to take the necessary risks, develop their businesses, stimulate enterprise and generate employment.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the measures to reduce bureaucratic form-filling and simplify tax compliance with the announcement of a single tax form for registration of all taxes, including VAT, etc. and the provision of a single tax clearance certificate which is renewable on a yearly basis for companies or persons to tender for public service contracts. I raised this issue with the Minister for Finance last year and he brought it to the attention of the Taoiseach. I wish to quote from statistics which indicate the amount of work that goes into the processing of tax clearance certificates, the amount of bureaucratic form-filling and the cost involved. In 1990, a total of 10,318 tax clearance certificates were issued; in 1991, 12,634 certificates were issued; in 1992, 32,480 were issued and up to 23 November 1993, 40,788 tax clearance certificates were issued at a cost of £800,000. That involved a great amount of work by Revenue staff to process and administer all these certificates. Therefore, the measure in the budget is indeed welcome.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be familiar with the submission by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry which contained a seven point survival package, as they referred to it, with three positive constructive measures which the society asked the Government to consider.</P>
    <P>I regret I an unable to refer in more detail to the society's submission but I <Col N="800" /> welcome the alteration in respect of vehicle registration tax and the measures in relation to the value thresholds for calculating capital allowances and some other allowable expenses in respect of motor cars. This should be beneficial to the motor industry. I have requested the Minister for Finance to examine the benefit-in-kind on company cars as I believe a reduction in that could be beneficial also.</P>
    <P>One issue I have raised in the past at budget time was the carer's allowance. Figures from the Departments of Health and Social Welfare highlight the cost of keeping elderly people in care either in health board institutions or in private nursing homes where they avail of subventions compared to the allowance paid to carers who provide 24 hour care seven days a week, 365 days a year for their relatives, thereby enabling the patients to remain in their home environment. This is an issue that we should pursue because the potential that exists with thousands offering an excellent level of care has not been tapped. While I appreciate the Minister on this occasion relaxed some of the considerations for persons applying for carer's allowance, I do not believe we have gone far enough. A large amount of money is being spent by the Departments of Social Welfare and Health and the time is now opportune for the two Departments to introduce a new scheme for carers.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - County Galway Coastal Erosion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of raising the problem of serious coastal erosion in Tawin Island, Maree, Oranmore, County Galway which is situated approximately eight and a half miles from Oranmore and approximately 15 miles from Galway city. Tawin Island is joined to the mainland in Maree by a bridge which was constructed <Col N="801" /> approximately 100 years ago. Previous to that it was connected to the mainland by a causeway. There are ten families living on the island which has a population of approximately 50 people. The island population is made up mainly of farmers and some people engaged in fishing.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of history attached to the island. In the early part of this century, approximately from 1910 to 1912, Jack Yeats and Roger Casement were regular visitors to it. In fact, the former President of Ireland, Eamon de Valera, attended an Irish school on the island in the early 1900s. At that time there were two schools on the island, an Irish speaking and English speaking school. Sadly, the only school on the island was closed in 1992 with the children now having to make their way to Maree school which is approximately four and a half miles away.</P>
      <P>As a result of coastal erosion this island may be washed away. A visit to the area this week in the company of two local people, Tim Holland and Michael John Hardy, highlighted the serious effect of the coastal erosion, particularly on the north side of the island as one enters from the bridge. This is the area which faces towards Galway city and is open to the full rigours of the Atlantic. This problem has become acute in recent years, probably due to the change in the prevailing winds from south, south west to north, north west which is exposing this side of the island to the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of years the local residents have made valiant efforts to stop this erosion by mounting stone and gravel banks in places where the Atlantic was breaching the coastline but because of the change in the prevailing winds, there is now approximately a 200 yard stretch of very vulnerable coastline and this is the problem which must be tackled. The tide is coming in and flooding vast acres of farmland. Due to the extreme flooding and retention of sea water above what used to be the high water mark, the level of the water at the changing of the tide is on two different levels each side of the bridge resulting in extreme pressure being put on the bridge and the causeway <Col N="802" /> with the water seeping through. In fact at various times during high tides, which can occur every two weeks at this time of the year, the island is completely cut off with two to three feet of water on the roadway. Often this can be repeated two to three days in succession, depending on wind conditions. This has changed dramatically in recent years. A few years ago the maximum period for which the island could be cut off was about an hour whereas now it can be cut off for at least two to three hours at a time, the coastline having broken in new areas on the north side. Because of flooding on the island this will place more pressure on the other areas in Maree, like Mweelon and Ballinacourtey, which can be affected by the rising tide and the retention of tidal water because of coastal erosion in Tawin Island. Other areas in Maree are also affected by coastal erosion &mdash; Blackweir and Luggane &mdash; where farm land is being lost through coastal erosion.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with Galway County Council about this matter and have been informed they are not in a position to do anything because of lack of funds. Three years ago funds were allocated to local authorities for the repair of storm damage. It must be remembered that County Galway has 689 kilometres of coast, one of the longest in the country. More importantly, 185 kilometres of that coastline is of soft land composition which means there is a major problem in the county.</P>
    <P>I note in Chapter 9, page 117, of the National Development Plan 1994-99 a very short paragraph under the heading &ldquo;Coastal Protection&rdquo; which reads:</P>
    <P>The primary objective of this sub-programme is the preservation of local infrastructure. It is proposed to address priority coastal erosion problems under a programme of investment amounting to £5.5 million. The main benefits will be the maintenance of local infrastructure, tourism amenities and transport links to isolated communities.</P>
    <P>It appears that Tawin Island would indeed qualify under this heading for a <Col N="803" /> coastal erosion grant. Of course, I understand there will be enormous demand on this very inadequate sum over five years in that it will mean less than £1 million annually to be divided between all coastal counties nationwide. To put this matter into perspective it is equal to the sum allocated in the budget last week to Croke Park. I am sure coastal erosion grants have suffered because of the cutback in the £8 billion we were originally supposed to receive from the Structural Funds, reduced to £7.2 billion. Indeed that £700 million, or whatever we lost at that time in the juggling, would constitute an ideal sum to tackle coastal erosion nationwide.</P>
    <P>I am making the case for Tawin Island because of its historic nature. It is essential that a programme be devised to alleviate coastal erosion there. I assure the House &mdash; and anybody concerned &mdash; that Galway County Council will have no difficulty in drawing up a plan to deal with this problem if the money is provided from Structural Funds for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCormack for raising this matter. I should say that primary responsibility for coastal protection lies with property owners, whether they be private individuals or a coastal local authority. The function of the Department of the Marine is to work in conjunction with coastal local authorities on the management of the coastal zone. Of course the Department will facilitate, where warranted, anyone who wishes to implement an appropriate coastal protection scheme by granting them a foreshore licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specific location referred to by the Deputy, Tawin Island off County Galway, no details of the nature of the erosion involved are available. Officials of the Department of the Marine have been in contact with their own regional engineer in Galway and the engineering department of Galway County Council regarding erosion at <Col N="804" /> Tawin Island. Neither the Department's engineer nor the council's local engineer are aware of an erosion problem at this location. In these circumstances, I suggest the Deputy should raise this matter again with Galway County Council, who can if required seek advice or assistance from the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might be interested in the Department's plans for coast protection over the next number of years. As I am sure the House will agree, coastal erosion is a serious and growing problem. This fact was recognised in the Programme for a Partnership Government which stated that increased emphasis is to be given to the problem of coastal erosion. Following this commitment, the Government, in the context of the National Development Plan 1994-99 provided a sum of £5.5 million to help address the erosion problem. This funding will be subvented for the first time by Structural Funding from the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine is currently drawing up a national coastal protection plan for 1994-99. This plan will rely to a significant extent on the coastal protection priorities identified to the Department by the various coastal local authorities and on the findings of the county and city engineers association's national coastal erosion committee's report on coastal management, published in July 1992.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the Department's plan is the protection, through coast protection works, of key coastal areas, especially those with significant economic infrastructure where, in the absence of such works, there would be a short to medium-term risk of major damage. The prioritisation criteria to be utilised in the selection of projects will include: the economic cost &mdash; lifetime cost of the works including maintenance must be less than the loss that would otherwise be suffered over that period; the livelihood protected &mdash; resultant saving of State unemployment benefits, etc; environmental or ecological premium &mdash; preservation of areas of scientific interest, heritage items, unique flora, fauna or habitats and amenity protection &mdash; tourism, <Col N="805" /> recreational or beauty of coastal stretch preserved. Such preservation works support rural development, tourism, environmental protection and other activities which contribute to increasing the economic potential of coastal areas.</P>
    <P>Finalisation of the list of projects to be included in the plan, indeed the nature of those projects, is subject to further discussion with coastal local authorities. As part of this consultation procedure it is intended to identify a comprehensive management policy for the entire coastal zone, both on the seaward and landward sides. This approach to the coastal resource is essential. I am sure the House will agree that the protection of the coastal resource, with its immense value in economic, environmental, ecological and sociological terms, is something that we, as a society, have both a privilege and duty to protect and preserve for present and future generations.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Department of the Marine's plan will make a significant contribution to the preservation of the Irish coastline.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A report in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> of a study carried out by Dr. Patricia Sheehan of children who attended St. Vincent's Secondary School, Dundalk during the 1950s particularly in 1957, showed an abnormally high number of birth defects among the children of the <Col N="806" /> then school girls. This is the second such study undertaken in the Dundalk area by Dr. Sheehan in recent years. Previously she had carried out a study on the position of children born to former school-girls of St. Louis Secondary School, particularly around 1957.</P>
    <P>There is a disturbing pattern of similarities between the results of both studies. For example, the St. Louis school study of 157 mothers showed eight babies born with Down's Syndrome; 12 other babies born with other defects; two mothers had stillbirths; one baby died within six weeks of birth and two other children died in childhood.</P>
    <P>The study showed that all mothers suffered severe influenza at the same time as a nuclear reactor in Windscale went on fire, sending a cloud of radiation across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The St. Vincent's school study, which has not yet been published, of 319 girls who attended the school in the mid-1950s, particularly in 1957, showed that five mothers gave birth to Down's Syndrome babies; 33 other babies had serious handicaps including spina bifida, heart defects and deafness; five mothers had stillbirths; seven babies died within six weeks and six children died in childhood. The report further added that, of 1,086 pregnancies of the 319 girls surveyed, there were 161 miscarriages and 23 premature births. The report appears to point to a link between the abnormally high number of birth defects and the radioactive cloud from the nuclear fire at Windscale, now known as Sellafield, in 1957.</P>
    <P>These reports are very disturbing. I call on the Minister for Health to initiate immediately a full-scale, thorough investigation. At a time when British Nuclear Fuels are planning to proceed with the THORP development it is vitally important that we establish beyond doubt the position as outlined in these two reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to contribute to this short debate here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The content of the report on links <Col N="807" /> between the Sellafield nuclear energy plant and children born to Irish mothers in the late 1950s is of the utmost concern. More alarming is the fact that this is not the first report to suggest such a link. A report published ten years ago centred around a cluster of over 20 children born with disabilities in the County Louth area. Yesterday's revelation suggests a greater number of children is involved.</P>
    <P>The common link appears to be a form of flu suffered by mothers in the wake of a fire at Sellafield in 1957. It is worth nothing the authorities in Britain took action to protect the community by way of banning the consumption of milk for a while after the fire. No public announcement or acknowledgement was made at the time in Britain. However, so far as the Irish Government is concerned I understand we were not even informed of the incident, much less put on alert.</P>
    <P>It is understood that levels of radiation increased 20-fold at that time. I also understand that Irish weather records for the time are clear that radioactive material crossed the Irish Sea after the fire by means of a heavy rainfall and easterly winds. I seek the intervention of the Department of Health in an effort to establish proof beyond reasonable doubt of a connection between Sellafield and these deaths and deformed births.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the study underway at the Boyne research institute in Drogheda, researching the incidents of miscarriages, stillbirths and birth defects and a higher than average number of complaints of urinary tract infections along the north-east coast for a number of years. The Minister can help by ensuring that his Department provides assistance to further studies in this regard. It must be said that there remains a very high burden of proof and the studies to date remain inconclusive. I urge the Minister to ensure a renewal of effort on the part of this Government on the matter of the current THORP debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy must now be assisted by the Minister for Health in <Col N="808" /> pursuing the British authorities, on behalf of the Irish people. The production of civil plutonium is dangerous and cannot be justified at Sellafield. To date, objections have been received by or on behalf of over 60,000 people, 104 local councils and many non-governmental organisations. The Irish Government must insist on at least a public inquiry into the current proposal. The European Union must be more strenuously lobbied to impress upon the British authorities the dangers inherent in proceeding. Efforts must be redoubled to prevent further expansion of the plant.</P>
    <P>In relation to yesterday's report, I ask the Minister for Health to inquire whether such clusters of disabled children, stillbirths and miscarriages could have occurred without due cause or reason. Medical experts have believed for some time that the higher than average numbers could not be put down to mere chance, while the recent reports have shown, alongside those already published, that Sellafield represents a possible factor in these infant deaths and deformities. The Department of Health must now act in tandem with the researchers to bring the evidence a stage further with a view to forging a connection beyond doubt. No effort in this regard must be spared to establish the truth for the benefit of all those involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Kirk and Flanagan for raising this very important and worrying matter for people in Dundalk and in that general area. My colleague, the Minister for Health, has been very concerned to read media reports concerning a further study which highlights unusual clusters of birth defects in children in the Dundalk area and suggests a link with Sellafield. This issue was first raised in 1983 and a report was published in the British Medical Journal on the incident. However, inquiries initiated by my Department at the time concluded that it was not possible to confirm or deny the hypothesis that a causative factor was the nuclear accident at Sellafield in October 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> It appears from the media reports referred to that this further study has now been prepared but is as yet unpublished. I wish to assure the Deputies that once the study is made available to the Minister I will ensure that it is given careful consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputies are well aware of the Government's position in regard to Sellafield. While it has not been possible to determine from epidemiological studies to date any casual relationship between incidents at Sellafield and unusual clusters of defects in babies, neither has it been possible to discount any such relationship. For this reason it is in my view extremely prudent that we should take all such reports very seriously and continue to carefully examine them.</P>
    <P>As one who has been aware of this situation I share a deep concern for parents in Dundalk and in the general Louth region who have suffered throughout the period.</P>

The school has the following urgent requirements: extensive repairs to parapets and copings for spawling of concrete is causing a serious and potentially dangerous situation; new windows are needed for the assembly hall, basement and other key areas; the installation of heating in the basement and an overhaul of the entire heating system, which at present is inadequate, given the size of the building; an overhaul of the water system, plus installation of wash-hand basins, sinks, etc., in the basement and technology room; an upgrading of the electrical services which are inadequate <Col N="810" /> and in some cases, unsafe, and a restoration of play spaces on the flat roofs.</P>
    <P>In 1980, according to the school records, the school spent over £27,000 on building alterations, plus 20 per cent of the total cost of all furniture fixtures for all specialist rooms, plus professional fees. Given the school's current financial position there is no possibility whatever of this school financing the items listed above.</P>
    <P>The school has an excellent assembly hall, which is used daily for a variety of activities, but it is the coldest area in the school. The windows are the original 1941 models and many of the steel casements are warped, resulting in freezing temperatures. This causes great hardship to pupils, teachers and parents.</P>
    <P>The play space at ground level is totally inadequate for the numbers and the roof play spaces are unsafe. Central heating for the basement is an urgent requirement as this area houses the home school centre, the typing room and changing rooms. The home school teacher is a most enthusiastic member of staff who makes great efforts to welcome parents into the centre. This is not helped by the unsuitability of the area through inadequate heating. Every room in the main building is in use so that there is no other place for a parents' centre. Already, typing classes are held in the basement due to a lack of space in the main building.</P>
    <P>Mount Carmel is the only girls' secondary school serving the north inner city, from where they draw the majority of their pupils. In a disadvantaged area there are no prospects of raising adequate funding to cover costs for items such as those I have listed. The majority of parents are already struggling to exist because of unemployment. Despite this, the school and parents make great efforts at fund raising; I was happy to be present recently at one such event in the school.</P>
    <P>With a pupil enrolment of 308 at September 1993 the capitation grant is not adequate to cover the running costs of the school. The school is struggling continuously to pay day to day bills and for services. This means they are already <Col N="811" /> restricted in what they can offer by way of extra-curricular activities for their pupils. In a disadvantaged area it is necessary to offer incentives to pupils to remain in education for the sake of future job opportunities. The Minister would agree that all our young people deserve equal opportunities where education is concerned. This school will be unable to reach that ideal without the help of the Department of Education. I hope the Minister can respond positively to this school's urgent request.</P>
    <P>I pay particular tribute to this school. Many schools in the inner city of Dublin have similar problems and make similar sacrifices in trying to provide children in that area with the education they deserve, but this school stands out. It is dedicated at second level almost exclusively to children from very disadvantaged communities, from Sherrif Street, Ballybough, Seán MacDermott Street, Dorset Street and Dominick Street. Much of that area includes local authority housing and 80 per cent of the parents are existing on social welfare and enduring massive social problems. Here is a school trying to give some hope for the future to the girls who attend it. They desperately need this assistance and I hope the Minister can respond positively today.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gregory for raising the matter and I endorse the tributes he paid to the school, with which I am familiar. Both Deputy Gregory and I come from the north inner city and I was educated by the Sisters of Charity. I have had a long association with pupils and teachers in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the matters raised by the Deputy relating to the Sisters of Charity, Mount Carmel Secondary School, Kings Inn Street, Dublin 1, the application referred to was received by the Department <Col N="812" /> of Education on 18 January 1994. The Deputy will appreciate that I can only address this matter in general terms.</P>
    <P>The school authorities have requested that a technical assessment of the school facilities be carried out by officials of the Department of Education. This request was accompanied by reports from the school's consultants on the condition of the school facilities. These reports cover a wide range of issues including repairs to the parapets, replacement of windows, modifications to the heating and water systems, upgrading of the electrical services, amongst other matters.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy appreciates that a decision on such wide ranging matters cannot be made without a full and thorough examination of the school facilities, taking into account the precise accommodation needs of the school.</P>
    <P>My colleague has requested the planning and building unit of the Department of Education to carry out such an examination as quickly as possible and is very conscious of the service the Sisters of Charity have over the years rendered to children of this area. She is also aware of the special needs which exist in the area. Bearing these additional factors in mind, I can only assure the Deputy that no effort will be spared to process this application for grant assistance and a decision on the matter will be conveyed to the school authorities as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I will certainly make representations to the Minister. I am aware of the history of the school and its very fine contribution to the education of women in the area. In many ways it was a trail blazing school in the north inner city. It stood out with regard to standards of academic excellence and ambition for girls. I will certainly press the Minister for Education on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 8 February 1994.</P>

      <P>A commitment was given by the Government in the Programme for a Partnership Government to implement a five year corporate strategy for the Garda Síochána to enhance their capacity to fight crime in present day conditions. I am pleased to inform the House that this commitment is being honoured. I announced on 14 December last the details of the package of law and order measures and the various strategies proposed to tackle the present crime situation, including the use of the most modern technology available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An information technology plan has been drawn up for the Garda Síochána <Col N="736" /> with the assistance of outside consultants. The first phase of this plan will be implemented in 1994 at a cost of £2.4 million to cover mainly computer capital and staffing costs. Total expenditure on the plan will be in the region of £26 million. This information technology plan will greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the force in the years ahead. It will lead to a significant reduction in the amount of Garda time taken up on office duties; an increase in the crime detection rate through improved quality of crime intelligence information and computerised fingerprint identification facilities; the provision of faster and better quality information to improve overall Garda responsiveness; a vast improvement in management information to enable more effective deployment and supervision of manpower; the provision of information to enable the Garda to identify people at risk and keep in touch with them; the provision of traffic accident patterns and information essential for the enforcement of road traffic legislation.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in my package of law and order measures for the upgrading of Garda communications equipment. Garda radio hand-sets and car-sets which were purchased in the early to mid-eighties will be replaced with up-to-date equipment. A new modern integrated communications system will be installed in Cork city in the near future.</P>
    <P>The package also provides for the purchase of additional vehicles, including specialist vehicles, for the Garda fleet and will ensure optimum replacement of the fleet over the next four years.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to avail of modern technology through the use of CCTV cameras as an aid to policing and to combat crime in city centre areas of Dublin and for the detection of speeding offences on our roads.</P>
    <P>In line with the non-legal recommendations of the Government's advisory committee on fraud the package also provides for the purchase of specialised equipment to combat this type of crime.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures I have taken will greatly enhance the capacity <Col N="737" /> of the Garda Síochána to tackle crime and will also improve the police service to the public.</P>

      <P>I assume that the term &ldquo;video nasties&rdquo; referred to by the Deputy relates to video works which the official censor is empowered to prohibit under section 7 of the Video Recordings Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>That section of the Act was brought into operation with effect from 26 July 1991 and since then the official censor and assistant censors have prohibited 655 video works. Prohibition orders are due to be promulgated in respect of a further 760 video works, approximately. In the same period, there has been a number of prosecutions by the Garda for offences in relation to possession and/or supply of prohibited video works.</P>

      <P>&mdash;an annual intake of 350 gardaí between 1995 and 1997,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the recruitment of 200 clerical civilian staff between 1994 and 1997,</P>
      <P>&mdash;implementation of an Information Technology Plan for the Force,</P>
      <P>&mdash;up-grading of the Garda Communications network,</P>
      <P>&mdash;establishment of a National Bureau of Fraud Investigation,</P>
      <P>&mdash;optimum replacement of the Garda Fleet,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the provision of an additional 210 prison places,</P>
      <P>&mdash;recruitment of an additional 50 probation and welfare officers and support staff between 1994 and 1997,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" />&mdash;the appointment of three additional judges.</P>
    <P>With regard to rural crime, the Garda authorities, in conjunction with Muintir na Tíre, are continuing to promote the Community Alert Scheme which is the rural equivalent of Neighbourhood Watch and which involves local people maintaining contact with elderly people and bringing any suspicious circumstances to the notice of the Garda. I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are now 528 Community Alert schemes in existence in every Garda division outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area. Another important initiative taken by the Garda is the inclusion in crime prevention literature of information and advice for the elderly on the action to be taken in the event of attack.</P>
    <P>In addition, the successful community policing scheme for rural areas, which was put into place in 100 rural Garda stations in September 1991, has enabled the Garda to spend more time on active operational duties including, in particular, visits to the elderly. The allocation of 24 clerical assistants, 17 sergeants and 55 gardaí to the scheme as well as microcomputers and vannettes together with a reduction in record keeping in smaller Garda stations has increased the time available to gardaí for outdoor contact with the communities in the districts in which the scheme is operating. In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, this scheme will be extended to other stations in the country on a phased basis over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I totally refute the allegation that the incidence of attacks on the elderly and crime in rural areas are as a direct result of the closure of rural Garda stations or the withdrawal of gardaí from them. In fact, no Garda station has been closed in the past two years and I have already outlined above some of the additional resources which have been provided to districts involved in the Rural Policing Scheme.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that they are taking specific measures to deal <Col N="743" /> with attacks against the elderly and to combat crime in rural areas. These include:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;regular analysis of crime trends resulting in the surveillance of areas at risk and the greater use of Garda patrols to meet specific anti-crime needs in particular areas,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the operation of the Divisional Task Forces so as to have maximum personnel on patrol during prime-crime periods and target their activities at travelling and organised criminals,</P>
    <P>&mdash;crime prevention advice given by the Crime Prevention Officer and members assigned to community policing and rural policing duties,</P>
    <P>&mdash;an emphasis on the greater use and closer and co-ordination of foot and mobile patrols and the frequent use of check-points at various locations at unpredictable intervals.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the situation will be kept under review and that no effort will be spared to prevent and deal effectively with incidents of serious crime, in particular, those aimed at sections of the community most at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 65 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner's annual report on crime for 1992 indicated that 95,391 indictable crimes were recorded in 1992 compared to 94,406 in 1991, an increase of 1 per cent. However, the 1992 figure is still nearly 7 per cent lower than the 1983 figure. Recorded crime levels in the DMA in 1992 showed a decrease of 1.9 per cent on the corresponding figure for 1991 while the level of indictable crime in the rest of the country, increased by 4.7 per cent on the corresponding figure for 1991.</P>
      <P>Figures for 1993 are not yet available, however, I am aware that the indications are that these will show some increase on the 1992 figures. I am confident however, that the measures contained in the law and order package which I unveiled last December will make a very significant contribution towards tackling crime. Details are as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;An accelerated recruitment of 407 gardaí in 1994;</P>
      <P>&mdash;An annual intake of 350 recruits for the period 1995 to 1997 to maintain the strength of the force at its present level;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Recruitment of 200 civilian clerical/administrative staff in the period 1994 to 1997 to release an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Implementation of an Information Technology Plan for the Garda;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Upgrading of Garda Communications Network;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Optimum replacement of Garda fleet;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Installation of closed circuit television to combat city crime;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Further development of community-based measures in areas of disadvantage;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;Implementation of certain, non-legal, proposals of the Government's <Col N="745" /> Advisory Committee on Fraud;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Providing an additional 210 prison places;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Recruitment of an additional 50 Probation and Welfare Officers and support staff in the period 1994 to 1997;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The provision of additional Probation and Welfare facilities;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The appointment of three additional judges and support staff.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in the package reflect the fact that crime in modern day society is a very broad and complex area. For this reason the package not only contains measures which some would term &ldquo;traditional&rdquo;, i.e. increased Garda recruitment, more prison places, etc. which are of course of immense importance and which are major factors in the package, but also less obvious measures, e.g. implementation of an information technology plan for the Garda, upgrading of the Garda communications network. The total cost of implementation of this package will be £66 million and as the House will appreciate this represents a major initiative by the Government and is the most concentrated effort to tackle crime in recent decades. I am confident it will have long lasting and significant benefits for the public.</P>
    <P>At operational level, the Garda monitor and constantly review and adapt their strategies to deal with crime. Specific plans of action are drawn up in each district to deal with crime problems in their areas and Garda resources are specifically targeted to meet specific anti-crime needs in particular areas.</P>
    <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed recently in certain quarters that a high level of crime in Ireland is not reported. The compilation of crime statistics is primarily a matter for the Garda authorities. I am informed by the Garda authorities that all crimes reported to them are recorded. Crime is also recorded on the basis of other factors, e.g. when a member of the Garda Síochana witnesses a criminal act or if the perpetrator subsequently admits to having committed a crime. It is a known <Col N="746" /> fact that in virtually every country in the world a certain percentage of crime is not reported and Ireland is no exception to this. I do not believe that it is logical or that there is evidence to set aside the information produced by the Garda Commissioner as to the actual crime situation.</P>

      <P>In the case of Land Commission schedules, the property is deemed to be registered as of date of vesting by the Land Commission. Registration of these schedules is thus, of necessity, afforded a lower priority than the registration of dealings.</P>
      <P>Where a specific need arises which requires that registration of a schedule be completed, e.g. where a further transaction affecting the property in question arises, then the Land Registry will, as far as possible, expedite such cases.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to state the position clearly in relation to the recruitment of the 1,000 gardaí from a competition held in 1991.</P>
      <P>It was originally intended to recruit these gardaí over four years, 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995, at the rate of approximately 250 per year. As it happened 269 recruits were taken on in 1992. In 1993, I increased the intake to 324 in that year and I intend to recruit the balance of 407 from the 1991 competition in 1994. In other words, the 1,000 recruits will have been taken on over 3 years as opposed to 4 years as originally envisaged.</P>
      <P>In planning intake of recruits in phases over each year, it is difficult to be precise with projections, because some trainees may drop out or otherwise leave during the initial training phase. Accordingly, it is necessary to review the position in the light of developments each year. It is possible that the higher number of recruits taken on in the earlier phases of intake in 1993 may have given rise to an expectation that the fourth and final phase in that year would be at the same relatively high level. However, I felt that the increase in the numbers recruited in 1993 from the original 250 to 324, including a final intake of 30 in November, was sufficient and that the balance of 407 remaining should be recruited in 1994 rather than in 1994 and 1995.</P>
      <P>A new recruitment drive for the years 1995 to 1997 involving 350 recruits each year will begin soon.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned at attacks, mainly in the Dublin area, on innocent <Col N="748" /> victims involving the use of blood-filled syringes. So as to avoid creating an unwarranted level of public anxiety, however, I should make the point that the number of these attacks or threats of attack is relatively small in relation to the overall level of drug related crime.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are fully aware of the seriousness of such attacks including the very traumatic effect on the unfortunate victims. I can assure the Deputy that the Garda are taking all possible measures, including patrolling and surveillance to deal with the situation. It is not an easy situation to deal with given the availability of syringes and the fact that victims can be put under threat of attack even where the contents of the syringe &mdash; whether it be blood or otherwise &mdash; are not actually life threatening.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that they would advise that any person unfortunate enough to be the target of such an attack should seek immediate medical care if they have any fear of contamination. For their part, the Garda will render every possible help and assistance.</P>
      <P>I have dealt at length with the drugs situation in this country on several occasions in the past and again today in response to questions put down by a number of Deputies. I have made it clear that the drugs problem is a matter of the highest priority for me and for the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Fuel allowances are payable to persons in receipt of long term social <Col N="751" /> welfare or health board payments provided certain other conditions are fulfilled. The main conditions for receipt of the allowance are that persons must be living alone or with a qualified dependant.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was refused a fuel allowance in July 1992 on the grounds that he did not fulfil the &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; condition because his daughter, who was in employment, was residing with him at the time.</P>
      <P>However, as there may be a change in his circumstances since 1992, a free fuel allowance application form has been issued to him and his entitlement to this allowance will be reconsidered on receipt of the completed application.</P>
      <P>Social welfare recipients who have a special dietary requirement arising from a health condition and whose means are insufficient to meet this need, may qualify for an additional payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Entitlement to payment of a diet supplement is determined by the Eastern Health Board by reference to standard costed diets. The supplement paid is in respect of the additional cost of the special diet over and above the amount the person would be expected to pay for a normal diet. The cost of the diets are reviewed each year to coincide with the budget increases in social welfare payments. The normal diet is calculated as a percentage of the person's income and where social welfare payments are increased at a rate in excess of inflation, the amount of the diet supplement may be reduced.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has established a committee to review the administration of diet supplements. The board expects the recommendations of the committee to be presented shortly.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the two sets of married quarters at Waterville, County Kerry form part of the same building and are under the same roof as the Garda station. It is firm Garda policy not to recommend the disposal of married quarters in such cases, for security and other compelling reasons.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, however, that they would have no objections to both of the properties being leased subject to Garda requirements and the usual Office of Public Works leasing conditions being met.</P>

      <P>Government policy on political asylum is and has been in accordance with our international commitments arising under the 1951 United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees, as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol. In this regard, applications for political asylum are examined in accordance with an administrative procedure agreed in 1985 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR. The arrangements provide a comprehensive framework within which the examination of an application takes place, as well as providing for the participation of the UNHCR and the Department of Foreign Affairs in the consideration of such applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware of the recent publication of the interim report of the interdepartmental committee which was established to examine policy and practices relating to non-nationals who are resident in the State and relating to persons who apply for refugee status. The interim report is concerned specifically with the arrangements for dealing with applications for refugee status. The essential recommendation in the report <Col N="755" /> is that arrangements for examining and deciding on applications for refugee status should be placed on a statutory footing with provision in the statute for an appeals mechanism.</P>
    <P>The report is being examined with a view to introducing legislative proposals as soon as possible. To avoid any delay, I instructed my Department to commence work on a Bill in parallel with the work of the interdepartmental committee. A draft general scheme of a Bill has been prepared and, in accordance with normal practice, has been circulated to other Government Departments for their observations.</P>
    <P>In relation to persons who are unsuccessful in their applications for refugee status, the position is that a significant number of such persons are permitted to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds. I am guided by advice in the consideration of requests to remain in the State on such grounds, in particular that of the UNHCR and of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid his 1991 ewe premium and sheep headage on 25 May 1992. Under the conditions of the 1992 ewe premium scheme applicants were required to keep on their holdings for the 100 day retention period &mdash; 7 March 1992 to 14 June 1992 &mdash; the number of sheep on which they claimed premium. An inspection carried out on foot of the application made by the person named revealed that he did not meet that requirement and consequently he was not entitled to any premium. Furthermore under the 1992 scheme he was deemed to have made a false claim which in accordance with the regulations also excluded him from entitlement to premium under the 1993 scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the 1992 sheep headage scheme some sheep found at the inspection of the flock were not deemed to be part of the normal breeding flock maintained by the person named and under the conditions of the scheme payment of grants was refused.

The indicative drug target scheme which emerged from the agreement has resulted in a significant reduction in the trend increases which <Col N="776" /> had been a feature of GMS drugs expenditure in recent years.</P>
      <P>The criteria adopted by my Department in the negotiations on drug targets were that the overall target agreed should be reasonable and achievable and that there should be an equitable distribution of the target among individual doctors. A total amount of £144 million has been made available in 1994 to fund the cost of drugs in the GMS. This compares to a projected outturn figure of £138.9 million in 1993. The agreement reached with the Irish Medical Organisation in respect of the 1994 drug targets takes account of the views expressed by the health board general practice units arising from experiences gained through the operation of the scheme during 1993.</P>

      <P>The industrial relations dispute is not about the non-filling of vacancies. <Col N="781" /> The industrial action which is being taken by staff who are members of the Civil and Public Services Union in my Department's offices in Athlone concern promotion policy.</P>
      <P>In the case of some recent promotions, staff who were very senior and who were regarded as best qualified for the posts in question were promoted. A few members of staff, while relatively more senior, were not deemed to be as well qualified for promotion when all the relevant factors were taken into account.</P>
      <P>The union sought to have promotions confined to the most senior officers once a minimum level of suitability had been attained and has taken industrial action in support of this position.</P>
      <P>The industrial action involves a complete ban on overtime, a work to rule, not carrying out any new or changed work practices, telephone inquiries not being dealt with, blacking of work proper to vacant posts and a refusal to co-operate with temporary staff recruited each year in Examinations Branch.</P>
      <P>The most immediate impact of the action is that most telephone inquiries are not being dealt with; inquirers must write in. The action is compounding difficulties in getting capitation grants out to schools on time and in the payment of <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> arrears in respect of certain school staff.</P>
      <P>Difficulties will shortly arise on the examinations front in regard to practical and oral examinations due to commence on 28 February 1994.</P>
      <P>My view is that the best qualified person should be promoted on all occasions. The factors taken into account in making promotions include seniority, job performance, potential, and personnel record. Job experience, as reflected by seniority is obviously a very important criterion but it should not outweigh the need to select the most suitable individual for the post. In any modern organisation, factors such as job performance and potential are clearly very important. Due weight is always given to seniority in making promotions in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> There have been meetings and correspondence with union representatives on the issue involved. My Department is prepared to discuss with the union any concerns it may have relating to the equity and transparency of the promotion procedures. My Department has also clarified its viewpoint to the staff concerned. Furthermore, proposals have been put forward to develop and improve the promotion system generally. Agreement on these matters has yet to be reached.</P>
