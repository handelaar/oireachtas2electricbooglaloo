    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The first meeting of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> took place on 21 April 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting received a briefing from the ESRI on their recently published <Col N="446" /> medium-term review and discussed the issues to be addressed in structuring the work of the CRC in monitoring the achievement of the targets and objectives of the programme. In the latter context, the meeting, having regard to the statement on the matter in my introduction to the programme, agreed that the impact of the programme on equality would be monitored by the CRC as an integral part of the committee's ongoing role under the programme. As such, the impact of the programme on equality will be addressed in reports prepared by the CRC from time to time. This monitoring role does not diminish in any way the specific responsibilities of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform for policy on equality matters generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach put some specific questions concerning the monitoring of equality to the Central Review Committee?  Does he agree, for example, that the answer to Question No. 4, without anticipating it, is unlikely to show much of an improvement on the gap between male and female earnings? It has been shown recently that women are on 62 per cent of male earnings. Does he agree that there is a necessity to revamp the whole area of equality legislation, particularly equal pay legislation? Will specific questions such as this be considered by the Central Review Committee and recommendations made for legislation in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Central Review Committee is to monitor the progress of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Some of the issues raised by Deputy Rabbitte certainly can be taken up by the Central Review Committee with all the social partners but I do not wish to take away from the role of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform in legislating for those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to whether any adjustments have been discussed. In view of the fact that the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and <Col N="447" /> Work</i> is inextricably bound up with the National Development Plan &mdash; Chapter 15 states: &ldquo;Action to meet the challenge of work will be pursued through the National Development Plan&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairles An Ceann Comhairles">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairles:</NameTxt>
      <P>I must dissuade the Deputy from quoting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there are other references to this throughout the plan, and in view of the fact that the Structural Funds are considerably less than what the Taoiseach told us following the Edinburgh Summit in December 1992, what adjustments have been made, what projects are being scaled down and what is the new timetable of action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered this question a number of times in this House. The Government is fully committed to the implementation of the National Development Plan. The draft Community Support Framework was received by the Department of Finance late last week and is now being made available to all Government Departments involved in the National Plan to allow them make their comments on it before returning it. Once that is done we can get on with implementing the many projects that are involved in the plan. All of these projects will be implemented; some of them may have a longer timescale than envisaged in the plan but all are there for implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that, whereas in 1980 only three out of every 100 workers were unemployed for over a year or more, at the present time ten out of every 100 workers are unemployed for over a year or more? Will he agree that none of the schemes adopted by the Government nor economic growth is actually having any impact on chronic long term unemployment and that a radical approach is needed if these people are to be assisted in making the contribution of which they are capable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of long <Col N="448" /> term unemployment is serious, not only for this country but for other European countries. Unemployment has been growing at a steady pace over recent years but do not accept that implementation of the national plan and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> will have no effect on the long term unemployed. On the contrary, local development schemes, community development work and many of the developments and initiatives which will be taken under the plan, such as the extension to 32 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> companies which were successful on a pilot basis under the last programme, will have an impact on the long term unemployed. We need to continue to work on this serious problem. Economic growth will also have an effect and we must follow the approach of European countries in retraining people and giving them new skills as the jobs which they left may be obsolete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an obligation to the Deputies who tabled these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to come back to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that for every ten workers there are nine dependants and that this programme will increase the dependency rate? Does he consider it was a mistake to agree to pay unsustainable levels given the level of unemployment and not to include the organisation for the unemployed in the negotiations on this programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard politicians, the Congress of Trade Unions and others as representing the unemployed in any negotiations on the national programme. I am surprised the Deputy is one of the few people not looking forward positively to the economic growth projected in the ESRI report and by many other commentators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="449" />
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that equality is not just a gender issue? Is it part of the remit of the Central Review Committee to look at the more serious inequality in unemployment? Does he accept that even if the most optimistic forecast of the ESRI were realised 200,000 people would be unemployed at the end of the decade and would, indisputably, include the 100,000 people referred to by Deputy Bruton? In so far as the issue relates to gender, will the Central Review Committee consider the complaints of the 7,000 or perhaps more women who were denied their transitional payments by this Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a wide extension of this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an equality issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I must dissuade Members of the notion that they may debate unemployment and so on at Question Time, they may not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of transitional payments is expressly one of equality which stems from a directive introduced in the mid-1980s. More than 7,000 women have not been paid their entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Central Review Committee make a recommendation to Government on this and will it be given serious expression in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that the issue he raised is not appropriate to the Central Review Committee but a matter for the Government and the courts. In the programme on equality there are specific measures in the section on social equality relating to gender equality, equality in employment, training and education, equal status and the job potential of child care services. It has a wider implication than gender as the Deputy rightly said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="450" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the various Government schemes were impacting on unemployment. Is he aware a recent study showed that only one in ten of the long term unemployed in any given year is offered either a FÁS training scheme or work scheme? The other nine are not offered anything. Three-quarters of the unemployed are unskilled males; half have no qualification and two-thirds are classified as heads of households which means their dependent children suffer as a result of their unemployment? In other words, the problem is multiplied. Will he agree that while the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> may have been a success in other areas it was a complete failure as far as the long term unemployed are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has he any evidence to suggest that the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which is based on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has any chance of doing better?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that there are many reasons for long term unemployment which is a serious problem not only in this economy but in other developed economies. In Europe, unemployment is growing and 19 million people are affected. There are many long term unemployed who need new skills. The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> will make a substantial contribution towards making and keeping this economy competitive. For the first time since 1990, there has been a reduction in the number unemployed. The figures for the first three months of this year &mdash; and the monthly figure due out next month &mdash; will confirm this. We look forward to a continuing downward trend in unemployment figures. Our policies are having an effect and we would like to accelerate that but no single policy initiative will solve long term unemployment. The Deputy knows that. We will continue through a variety of programmes <Col N="451" /> and initiatives to try to impact on it and if the Deputy has anything further to add to the number of initiatives we are taking I will be glad to hear from him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that a new inequality has been created under the community employment scheme whereby deserted wives and widows are prevented from taking up this scheme but lone parents are allowed avail of it? Is it not extraordinary that deserted married women are barred from the scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;while unmarried women are able to avail of it? Will the review committee deal with this? The question deals with inequality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 7, 9, 13, 16, 22, 27, 40, 47, 51, 56 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to reducing the overall burden on taxpayers, including householders. Against this background, there are no proposals to introduce any new local tax, to reintroduce rates or a new form of local property tax, or to merge service charges with any other tax. No committee has been established to consider any such arrangement.</P>
      <P>The existing system of local authority funding is based on a range of Exchequer grants, combined with a variety of local income sources. The Exchequer grants comprise both general grants &mdash; notably the rate support grant &mdash; and specific grants, mainly capital in nature, related to particular expenditure programmes. The overall funding situation, and the situation in regard to particular programmes, is kept under review and is, of course, subject to modification and adaptation from time to time in the light of changing local and national needs, prevailing budgetary circumstances and Government policy. There are, however, no proposals for any fundamental changes in existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>As regards service charges, the legal position is that these are levied at the absolute discretion of the individual local authorities. Whether or not a charge is made, and the amount of any charge, is a matter for the local authority itself.</P>

Is the Minister seriously trying to persuade us that he does not know anything about the committee to which he referred? The credibility of the Taoiseach and the Government on this issue is open to serious question.

During the <Col N="460" /> past five or six years successive Governments, in which Fianna Fáil participated as a major partner, have contributed enormously to try to change that system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing fundamentally wrong with service charges and they apply practically throughout the country. I understand from reports submitted to my Department that in over 90 per cent of cases charges are freely paid for the services provided by local authorities. Service charges are not a charge against the total cost of any service, they are merely a part of the maintenance cost not involving any part of the capital contribution. During the past ten or 12 years service charges have been the norm throughout the country and yield close to £50 million, which is vital to local authorities in the discharge of their duties and in the provision and maintenance of services. If Deputy Gregory had some other views as to how that money could be raised for local authorities I would be prepared to listen to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10, 34 and 114 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of drinking and waste water services is extremely costly, and, traditionally, these costs have been borne by the Exchequer and local authorities. It is right that the services should be continually examined with a view to cost-effectiveness and that this examination should extend to conservation options, such as leak detection programmes and use of metering. While some changes have been implemented in the system of <Col N="463" /> capital financing of water services, the Exchequer still provides by far the greatest part of this financing. Some non-Exchequer capital financing has always been a feature of the water services programme. This now arises in connection with group water schemes, small public schemes and certain other public schemes where the proceeds of industrial contributions, development levies or other local contributions may appropriately be applied.</P>
    <P>There is no intention that private sector investment should replace moneys currently provided by the Exchequer for the provision of water services. The National Development Plan does however, envisage the possible augmentation of water services programme through private sector contributions.</P>
    <P>There is a number of possibilities in this regard. One is the more systematic application of existing policies whereby capital contributions are either required from industries to whom a major part of a scheme's capacity is dedicated, or are procured by way of development levies under the planning Acts. A number of important schemes are now proceeding on this basis, and local authorities generally have been advised of the need to seek industrial or developer contributions in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>I have also asked my Department to examine the possibility that private investors might become involved in major water services projects. For example, a company could undertake to design and construct a facility to meet specified performance standards, to finance the facility, to operate it for an agreed period, and subject to agreed arrangements as to payment, hand the plant over to the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>In a statement he made around 13 April, the Minister said that the public cannot expect to get water free for much longer. He told us we had no right to regard the provision of water supplies as something we should get for nothing. He was effectively saying that he was considering privatising water supplies. <Col N="464" /> I remind the Minister that the public is already paying for water through central taxes, water charges and various other payments such as commercial rates. Will the Minister state clearly that he will abandon any suggestion that water, which is in abundance in this country, will be privatised and that the public will not be expected to pay more for the supply of water? Any suggestion that the Government intends to privatise water supplies should be scrapped immediately. I want to hear the Minister say here that there is no question of the privatisation of water supply. I am surprised at the Labour Party going along with that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in giving a commitment to the House that there are no such proposals or intentions and I am not out to privatise water supplies. During the past four or five years, of the order of £400 million was spent in the provision of water and sewerage throughout the country. Over the period of this plan that figure will grow to over £600 million. Notwithstanding that unparalleled investment from EU funds and domestic sources, there is considerable demand for a further extension of those infrastructural projects. I have sought EU funds for group water schemes, which have been privately funded for many years. In relation to dedicating parts of schemes for industry, we have had success with INTEL, Fruit of the Loom, General Instruments and other schemes where industry is being asked, in circumstances where they benefit considerably from the new or augmented scheme, to contribute towards it. It is extraordinary that there should be opposition in circumstances where unparalleled State investment is being made in these services and where the Minister for the Environment is trying to accelerate the provision of services where they are desperately needed in invoking contributions of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 18 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I express sympathy to the families who suffered bereavements in the recent fire tragedies. Very substantial progress has been made in recent years in developing the fire service. There has been heavy investment in new fire stations, in new equipment and communications systems; staffing has been expanded and training has been improved; regulations, guidelines, codes of practice, and so on have been issued; and publicity and promotional work has <Col N="468" /> been stepped up. In spite of all of this investment and effort, it is tragic that some 50 lives are lost in fires each year.</P>
    <P>Recent incidents emphasise the need to review the situation on a continuing basis; to maintain the ongoing investment and training programmes; and to redouble our efforts in the field of education and awareness of fire safety. This latter is particularly important in relation to dwellings because, in the last analysis, fire safety in the home depends on the individual householder.</P>
    <P>I am strongly in favour of smoke alarms being installed in all homes and I have publicly advocated this course on many occasions. I believe that such alarms, which are inexpensive, can contribute in a valuable way to reducing the toll of house fires. However, I do not consider that it should be made compulsory to fit smoke detectors or alarms in existing dwelling houses. A householder who installs an alarm by choice is likely to be far more conscious of the need for fire safety to do so. Besides, there is unlikely to be a serious commitment to maintenance of an alarm (including battery replacement) on the part of a person who has installed one only to comply with the law. I believe, therefore, that it is better to convince householders of the value of smoke alarms through advice and publicity. To this end, I will continue publicly to draw attention to the advantages of having a smoke alarm fitted in the home and the National Safety Council will continue its publicity campaigns on the subject. Last year, the council administered a special scheme in the Dublin area under which 1,000 smoke alarms were installed in the homes of elderly people. The council has since been asked to evaluate the project as a basis for further action.</P>
    <P>The management and maintenance of its rented dwellings is the responsibility of local authorities themselves. In 1989, my Department wrote specially to housing authorities reminding them of the need for adequate fire safety provision in both new and existing local authority dwellings and enclosing a comprehensive schedule of fire safety measures which could assist in achieving <Col N="469" /> this objective. That letter included a recommendation that each housing authority should take steps actively to encourage their tenants to provide, and keep in good working order, suitable domestic smoke detectors.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision of new houses, whether local authority or private, the guidance documents issued by my Department to accompany the building regulations contain comprehensive guidance on matters such as means of escape (including the provision of smoke alarms), internal and external fire spread, and access and facilities for the fire brigade. In effect, in the absence of more effective identified safeguards, it is mandatory to install a smoke alarm in any new or reconstructed house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in extending sympathy to the many families who, tragically, have been bereaved as a result of recent fires in Kerry and in Ashbourne, County Meath. Is the Minister aware that the honorary secretary of the Fire Officers' Association said last night that services are deteriorating and shortly fire engines may well break down due to age, that we need to spend approximately £7 million on capital expenditure each year just to stand still, never mind improving the service, which is far in excess of what the Government has allocated this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are always circumstances where we could increase the allocation to deserving cases. Deputy Harney will appreciate that from the mid-eighties to date investment in fire services has been unprecedented, approximately £72 million in total, that relates to capital refurbishment, the building of approximately 82 new fire stations, the purchase of 248 appliances and an increase in the numbers in the service from approximately 32 to 140 officers. Needless to say we shall continue to review the overall position with a view to improving the services wherever possible. I would urge people, for the sake of the small investment necessary, to purchase smoke alarms and ensure that they are properly <Col N="470" /> maintained. However, such services do not prevent fires, they give a warning and allow people an opportunity to escape which they might not have otherwise. The public generally, local authorities and all of us can contribute to raising awareness of fire hazards, so that the kinds of tragedies to which Deputy Harney referred, and with which all of us sympathise, can be prevented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not respond to the comments of the honorary secretary about which I asked. Would the Minister accept that we have the highest level of deaths from fires in Europe, ours being double the rate in Denmark, which is the second highest, and that this is a cause of grave concern? Would he agree that we need to invest more money in this lifesaving service to ensure that nobody loses their life for want of proper equipment being available to the fire services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement made last evening. I have referred to what has been possible to date, to the levels of capital expenditure, which have been substantial and which will be reviewed in the light of prevailing economic circumstances to ascertain whether they might be increased further. I do not know where the statistics furnished in relation to fire deaths here emanated from because they do not accord with those in my Department; they would appear to be very much out of kilter with the reality. Nonetheless, the loss of, on average, 50 lives each year as a result of fires is 50 too many. Whether we compare favourably or unfavourably with other countries in that respect we must step up our programmes of prevention. Awareness and education are the elementary factors because, in the final analysis, householders themselves must endeavour to protect themselves and their families. Any compulsory assistance would be unlikely to be effective because it could not be policed in all circumstances. The awareness-educational programme will be continued and enhanced to the utmost extent possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the prevention of loss of life through fire and the panic among the public following the recent tragedies, can the Minister give an assurance that all the fire alarms on the market are of a proper standard? With the growth in population in many of our small towns and villages would he consider it appropriate that there be an auxiliary fire service in such areas in the form of trained people with equipment who could enter a house and get people out before there was loss of life and before the regular fire brigade service could reach the scene? Would the Minister agree that that in itself would be a form of prevention and a source of great comfort to many people in that they would know there was such a service readily available rather than having one located some eight to 15 miles away, as happened in one case recently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision and maintenance of fire services primarily are matters for local authorities. As the Deputy will be aware, my Department give capital grants for the reconstruction of older and the building of new fire stations, and for the purchase of appliances, indirectly, through the rates support grant. It is primarily a matter for local authorities to lay down their programmes of fire services within their remit. In relation to the quality and safety of smoke alarm systems, there are companies in this country who produce such products to the highest specifications. I am quite sure they meet any market requirements in terms of quality, safety and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in expressing sympathy to the families of people who lost their lives so tragically in recent fires. Is the Minister concerned at the number of fires occurring in domestic dwellings? Has he carried out, or does he intend to undertake any survey with regard to the levels of fire safety in existing housing stocks, in particular the possibility that some fires may be caused by faulty electrical wiring, poor construction methods or materials? Has he any plans <Col N="472" /> to undertake a national fire safety survey of domestic dwellings to advise householders of potential fire hazards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of reviews at present under way. No doubt Deputy Gilmore will be familiar with the one taking place in Dublin in relation to apartments and flats because of the possible consequences of fire in some such buildings. We have been in contact with local authorities, emphasising the need for a re-examination of their policies in this regard. I will give the House an undertaking that I will ascertain whether there are other measures that could be taken to strengthen such systems in a manner which would enable people to deal with problems because, in certain circumstances, people may be unaware of the potential fire hazards in their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in expressing sincere sympathy to those families who lost loved ones in recent fire accidents. I would endorse Deputy Boylan's excellent suggestion about an auxiliary fire service. Could the Minister begin by having his departmental officials draw up some guidelines whereby local authorities could encourage a fire service within their remit, perhaps to train people in essentials &mdash; first aid etc. Perhaps we could encourage the community at large to be trained in the essentials of what to do in the initial stages of fire and before the fire brigade arrived? Could that be done at central level, through the Minister's Department, and the information circulated to local authorities to encourage them train local communities as appropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fire Officers' Association and the county fire officers conduct certain courses and programmes throughout their jurisdictions, a procedure which perhaps could be intensified. There is a number of voluntary services nationwide, peculiar to different areas, particularly in the case of some outlying ones where it is not always possible to have a full array of services located. I will undertake to ascertain to <Col N="473" /> what extent these types of programmes could be developed so that there would be at least an immediate fallback in most areas while awaiting the arrival of the regular fire service. It is not something I could guarantee the House could be done comprehensively and/or immediately. There are dedicated personnel and new training programmes in the area of the saving of lives. Clearly there are areas where there may be apprehension about certain dangers and where we might perhaps develop pilot schemes on the lines of some already in place in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a new appliance to extinguish chimney fires which is being produced in Abbey, Loughrea, County Galway? Would he have this relatively cheap device installed in all new local authority houses or in existing stocks of local authority houses? I have seen the device demonstrated. It has been verified by engineers as a most effective means of quenching a chimney fire within two minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be my hope that every helpful suggestion could be taken on board. First, there is a number of different solutions to chimney fires, the first of which would not be the provision of a facility to quench them but rather to prevent them by way of householders having chimneys cleaned at least twice yearly. There are opportunities for entrepreneurs in Galway, Clare and other places. I am sure they have the capability to penetrate the market but they cannot seek an endorsement from the Department.</P>

      <P>A new urban renewal scheme will come into operation on 1 August 1994.

      <P>In addition, as indicated in the Government's statement of 27 April on west of Ireland matters, I intend to introduce on a pilot basis an urban renewal incentive scheme in a small number of secondary towns in the west.

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 33, 42, 108 and 109 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full details of each housing authority's <Col N="477" /> assessment of housing needs in March 1993 were published in the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin, 1993 together with details of local authority housing completions, purchases of existing dwellings and lettings during 1993. The housing needs of towns with town commissioners are included in the returns made by the relevant county council. Copies of the bulletin are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>A total of 28,624 households were assessed by the local authorities as being in need of housing &mdash; an increase of 23 per cent on the March 1991 figure of 23,244 households. However, within that overall increase, many of the categories of need remained reasonably stable. The largest increase &mdash; 58 per cent &mdash; occurred in the category &ldquo;unable to afford existing accommodation&rdquo; with the categories of &ldquo;overcrowding&rdquo; and &ldquo;involuntary sharing&rdquo; showing much smaller but still significant increases. Affordability rather than quality is the main reason for the increase.</P>
    <P>A sum of £30.2 million was paid by the health boards to private landlords in rent subsidies. This indicates that people are opting for unaffordable accommodation rather than mobile homes which used to be the practice. There are now few people in that category.</P>
    <P>The Government's plans for responding to housing needs are set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government which states clearly that the aim of the Government's policies will be to reduce pressure on local authority waiting lists to the greatest extent possible. In particular, the Government is committed to speeding up implementation of the plan for social housing and to making a much more substantial provision for local authority housing. These commitments are reiterated in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and are being met in full.</P>
    <P>Almost 4,900 local authority first-time lettings were made by local authorities in 1993 and it is expected that this number will increase substantially in 1994 as a result of the threefold expansion of the programme of starts since 1992. Between <Col N="478" /> the local authority, voluntary and other programmes, together with vacancies arising in the local authority rented housing stock, over 9,000 households in housing need will be accommodated in 1994 and again in 1995, giving a total of 18,000 families, compared to 7,100 in 1993 and 6,100 in 1992. Thus, annual social housing output will have increased by 50 per cent in two years, significantly improving general access to housing and shortening the length of time on waiting lists. A breakdown of actual social housing output in 1992 and 1993 and projected social housing output in 1994 is given in Table 1 which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Some 3,800 local authority houses were &ldquo;started&rdquo; last year and 1,569 were completed by the local authorities. Both of these figures include 369 houses which were acquired by local authorities. In 1994 the vast majority of 1993 starts will be completed and a further 3,500 dwellings will be started which will maintain the greatly expanded programme; in other words, a total of 7,000 houses will be under construction during 1994. This expansion in the local authority housing programme has been achieved without recourse to large scale local authority housing on greenfield sites. The emphasis in the programme remains on the provision of smaller infill sites and on developments which are integrated with existing communities. We are also now seeing a significant degree of purchasing of existing houses by local authorities with, as I said, 369 existing houses purchased last year. Details of individual local authority authorised starts and capital allocations for 1994 are given in Table 2 which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The overall housing capital allocation for 1994 is almost £295 million, an increase of over £105 million or 56 per cent on the 1993 outturn of £189 million. Table 3, which will be circulated in the Official Report, compares the main housing capital outturns for 1993 with the corresponding provisions for 1994.</P>
    <P>The 1994 budget contained the following special capital provisions: an extra <Col N="479" /> £12 million for the local authority house building programme increasing the figure of £92.5 million in 1993 to £166 million in 1994, an increase of 80 per cent, an extra £2.5 million provided for the remedial works scheme, an extra £1.5 million for the installation of bathrooms; an extra £2 million for the task force on housing aid for the elderly; a special new provision of £3 million to supplement the resources of local authorities in meeting the cost of replacement of defective windows in their large flat complexes. This amount has been allocated (£2.425 million to Dublin Corporation, £425,000 to Cork Corporation, £150,000 to Limerick Corporation) on the basis that these authorities will make a matching contribution from their own resources. In other words, for that £3 million we will have £6 million worth of new windows.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme is complemented by the range of measures introduced in the plan for social housing and I will now outline progress in relation to each of these schemes.</P>
    <P>There was continued progress on the shared ownership scheme during 1993. At 31 December 1993, 3,245 approvals had issued and 1,600 transactions had been completed. The number of completions during 1993 was 1,019.</P>
    <P>Over 600 houses have been identified as suitable under the improvement works in lieu of the rehousing scheme to 31 December 1993. Work was completed on 176 houses up to 31 December 1993 and <Col N="480" /> work was in progress on 59 houses at that date.</P>
    <P>Since its inception, authorities have sold 917 sites under the sale of sites scheme up to 31 December 1993; 770 sites were approved for sale in 1993.</P>
    <P>Activity under the mortgage allowance scheme has fallen off in 1993, possibly as a result of the introduction of the 1993 tenant purchase scheme, 161 houses were returned to local authorities under the scheme in 1993 compared to 179 in 1992.</P>
    <P>In 1993 eight projects were completed under the rental subsidy scheme containing 141 units, 17 projects were under construction containing just over 400 units while a further 59 projects were approved or proposed containing just over 1,300 units. Full details of these schemes in relation to each housing authority were published in the Annual Bulletin of Housing Statistics, 1993. The schemes are currently under review to identify any changes that may be needed to increase their effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute is, at the request of my Department, carrying out an independent, in-depth analysis and evaluation of the housing needs as presented in the local authority assessments. The objective is to provide a better insight into the nature of the needs, and the most appropriate solutions to them; to identify the factors influencing trends in the level of needs; and help to develop methods of forecasting future trends. The study will also examine the consistency of approach between housing authorities in the measurement of needs. The results of the study will be published in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the dazzling statistics he has just read to us. However, we are not blinded to the central fact that there are now almost 30,000 families on the housing waiting list, nearly 25 per cent more than three years ago when this Government took office. What will the Minister do to bring the housing provision even to the level promised in 1991 by the former Minister for the Environment, Mr. Flynn, to provide 10,000 dwellings a year under the plan for social housing, a figure not reached in the three years since the publication of that plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>The central fact is that 18,000 homeless families will be provided with homes between 1994 and 1995 and the overwhelming majority of these will come off the housing list, thereby greatly reducing it. We are now housing 9,000 families per year and I am satisfied with that level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>How many new houses are being built in the Dublin area and what is the average cost of each? Is it the Minister's policy that local authorities should purchase houses that become available on the open market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>Five hundred houses are being built in Dublin city. The other figures and the costings requested by the Deputy will be found in the table that is being circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not know the average cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost varies quite an amount, even within Dublin. An average cost does not mean very much because of variations between sites. I do not have the figures but if the Deputy wants the average figure for Dublin, I can get it for her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that it can be cheaper to buy a house on the open market in some areas than to build a new one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is policy to encourage local authorities to buy houses on the open market and that is now meeting with a level of success as 25 per cent of houses provided last year were purchased. I am happy with that level. However, there is the danger that the local authority might distort the market <Col N="491" /> for people who want to avail of council loans to buy their own houses. We must strike a balance between the two, the local authority should not be in competition with people on its housing list who might get a shared ownership loan to come off that list while at the same time encouraging local authorities to acquire house on the open market which are good value for money rather than building new ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is satisfied with his programme for dealing with this serious problem. He must never visit the south part of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is satisfied that 120 houses are being built this year to meet a demand for over 1,300 houses, it will be about 12 or 13 years before the present list is cleared, not to speak of additions to that list each year. When will the Government introduce a proper housing policy to deal with the whole area of housing as distinct from housing used for profitmaking? Further, will the Minister agree it is quite ridiculous that local authorities are now buying back, at market prices, local authority houses sold to tenants for much less than the local authorities are now paying for them? Will the Minister agree that the absence of a housing policy is causing much hardship, particularly to people living in the greater Dublin area and that the statistics quoted here are irrelevent to families on the waiting list for four or five years? Families with four children living in one room are not interested in statistics. When will the Minister produce a proper housing policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are of interest to people on the housing list because they are positive and the figure given by the Deputy is deliberately distorted. He knows that the direct build programme in his area is about one-third of the total <Col N="492" /> provision of homes under the plan for social housing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that with a total of 30,000 people on the housing waiting list people are not putting their names on it because they know they do not have a chance of getting a house? Therefore, the real figure is much higher than 30,000. Will the Minister agree also that the approximate 1,000 houses completed in 1993 is less than one-third of those completed in 1983 when <Col N="493" /> the crisis was not nearly as bad as it is now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that between 1994 and 1995 the Government will provide 18,000 homes for people who do not have homes, a total of 9,000 homes per year. By selectively quoting one aspect of the Programme for Social Housing and saying that only 1,000 houses were provided the Deputy is distorting the facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the figure the Minister quoted, as many young couples and elderly people are living in atrocious conditions, will be encourage local authorities to purchase derelict or vacant houses and renovate them at a reasonable cost? Will he place more emphasis on the provision of rural cottages which the Government does not appear to favour? As many people would like to move from urban to rural areas and sites are available for the provision of such cottages, this would be an ideal opportunity to encourage people to move to rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because people are living in unacceptable conditions that the Government made provision for 9,000 <Col N="494" /> homes to be built per year. On the question of rural cottages, the Deputy's council &mdash; or any other council which receives an allocation from the Department &mdash; can build rural cottages only if that is their policy. That matter is not decided by me or the Government. We encourage policies that ensure small rural communities are maintained. The county manager, in consultation with his councillors, make that decision. Large greenfield sites are no longer available and that presents many difficulties, but in the past two years Dublin city has provided a worthwhile example of the use of infill sites.</P>

      <P>I object to the manner in which it is proposed to deal with those matters. They are a series of Financial Resolutions designed to give the Minister for Finance authority to amend the Finance Bill in order to change tax rules without having those changes debated on Second Stage as is normal practice in the case of tax changes. The Commission on Taxation specifically condemned this practice of the Department of Finance to introduce highly technical tax amendments <Col N="599" /> at a very late stage in the debate of the Finance Bill, thereby denying not only this House but independent tax consultants the opportunity to make representations about the effect of those changes. It is wrong that such tax changes should be made without debate on the floor of the House. This is an attempt to put a budgetary matter through on the nod in committee without debate in the House. I do not wish to divide the House on this matter but I seek an assurance from the Taoiseach that this practice will not be allowed happen next year. The Department of Finance should not be allowed publish late amendments in committee and seek Financial Resolutions to rubber-stamp them in the House thereby evading Second Stage debate.</P>

      <P>I am surprised by Deputy Bruton's intervention as this matter was agreed by the Whips. One would assume Deputy Bruton would know what his Party's Whip agrees to. Some of the matters are being introduced on Committee Stage which has commenced in Select Committee. The idea of dealing with this type of Bill in committee allowing for a free flow of information is a new development and affords Deputies an opportunity to ask questions. Many of the matters about which Deputy Bruton complains were raised on Second Stage and the Minister was asked to introduce them on Committee Stage. Deputy Bruton, as a former Minister for Finance, will be as aware as I am that almost every year on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill such changes are made, although it may not be the most desirable practice. This year is no different to other years.</P>

I am sure most people were also very proud of the display of Irish dancing which was brought to a new level on the night. In a weekend of celebration we should also congratulate the Congress of Trade Unions in celebrating its centenary and <Col N="608" /> in putting on a marvellous weekend of entertainment for our citizens.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Bruton and the Taoiseach in congratulating the singers who won the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday night. I was pleased to be present, the atmosphere was fantastic and we were delighted to be associated with the success. I understand that when the European Parliament was asked by an outgoing Irish MEP to pass on congratulations to the winners he was told to do so himself. We should also congratulate Bill Whelan who devised the special interval entertainment which was equally spectacular. I hope we can also have a spectacular success in the World Cup in June because such events give people a great boost in otherwise gloomy times. Whatever about our political differences, I am sure we are all in agreement in passing on congratulations of this type.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought, with all the congratulations, some of the Deputies might have congratulated Meath on winning the league final. I take the opportunity to do so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, I announced that the Government had approved proposals to provide additional accommodation for the Houses of the Oireachtas within the Leinster House Complex. These proposals <Col N="612" /> have their origin in a study which the Office of Public Works undertook last year at my request. The issue of accommodation for the House is not a new one and the inadequacy remains despite the addition of new office accommodation for Deputies at the back of the former College of Science and the use of Kildare House in Kildare Street. The establishment of the five new Standing Committees has placed an intolerable pressure on existing resources.</P>
    <P>One of the key new facilities identified is a new library and reading room linked to the National Library providing better research facilities and staff accommodation. The physical linking up of both is quite feasible. However, in doing so, it will be necessary to move the Library from its present location in a room which I know Members of both Houses regard as one of the most beautiful in Leinster House. It is simply inadequate for its purpose but I am sure that the Joint Services Committee will suggest an appropriate alternative use.</P>
    <P>The Government has already directed that the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the National Library authorities, the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Joint Services Committee, would initiate consultations, at the earliest possible date, on links between the Houses of the Oireachtas Library and the National Library.</P>
    <P>The report on the Oireachtas Library facilities will provide a major input into these deliberations. The National Library of Ireland has, in fact, gone to a considerable amount of trouble to redefine itself, and has produced a strategic plan, covering the years 1992 to 1997.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Mission Statement&rdquo; in this plan describes the National Library's role as a repository of materials of Irish interest and goes on to state. &ldquo;Its purpose is to exploit fully its resources through research and publications and to encourage co-operation both nationally and internationally in the public and private sector. It aims to respond sympathetically to users' needs and to be open and alert to new media and technology.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Library will in future be a user-driven <Col N="613" /> provider of services and not just a repository of materials. The Houses of the Oireachtas will be one beneficiary of this new approval but it is not just a proper Library and Reading Room which is lacking in Leinster House. At present, all of the Deputies cannot be accommodated within the Leinster House complex. Some Deputies and Senators are &ldquo;outhoused&rdquo; in Kildare House as are certain support facilities. Although the location is close to Leinster House, it nevertheless is a cause of great inconvenience and inefficiency. The provision of a direct link between Kildare House and Leinster House has been mooted on several occasions and, while this would be feasible, it is not the ideal solution. Space within the Leinster House precinct is the answer. As I said, the setting up of the five new Standing Committees has created major accommodation problems which must be tackled if the committee system is to work effectively and efficiently. Deputies will agree that the new system is a major advance in the way the House conduct their business and lack of accommodation must not be allowed to hinder the success of the committees. Five new Committee Rooms equipped to modern standards and offices for the Chairmen and officials, with associated reception/waiting areas, are required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Members' facilities are very much lacking in Leinster House. Rooms are required where Members can consult in confidence with delegations and individuals visiting them. Also, members of the public coming to see the workings of the Oireachtas are entitled to better facilities. I refer in particular to school children. We should do as much as we can to make their visit a better educational experience as well as an <Col N="614" /> enjoyable one. Cloakroom and luggage facilities would also be desirable.</P>
      <P>Other support facilities for Members are also necessary. When I announced the development proposals, I instanced services such as translation and photocopying. Since the announcement, some Deputies have referred to the omission of facilities such as a Members' family room and a créche. It was a deliberate decision on my part not to include specific mention of such facilities or of others such as a gym, which has been raised by Deputies over many years. It was and is my intention that the Joint Services Committee should consider the extent of the support services required in the Houses and decide on how these should be provided and operated. The feasibility of including them in the development would then be examined.</P>
      <P>No less important than the Members, the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas require proper accommodation. With the increasing demand for Members accommodation, staff facilities have suffered. The office space is cramped and unsuitably laid out; there is a shortage of storage space and ancillary facilities, which are the norm in other Government Departments, cannot be provided because of shortage of space. Increasing demands are being placed on the staff of the Houses and it is not fair to expect them to respond without adequate resources. When these problems occur in other Government Departments it is possible to solve them by outhousing sections without interfering with the efficiency of the total operation; Members will agree that such a solution in the case of the Houses of the Oireachtas is not a viable option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, therefore, substantial demands for additional accommodation in order to meet the needs of the Oireachtas for the foreseeable future and virtually all of the accommodation must be within the Leinster House complex. The Broadcasting Unit, for instance, could remain in Kildare House. The proposals which I announced and which the Government has approved provide for the development of two locations; one is <Col N="615" /> the &ldquo;Fisheries Yard&rdquo; site between Agriculture House and the 1932 Annexe, and the other is on the College of Art property. Preliminary study shows that the &ldquo;Fisheries Yard&rdquo; could be developed to provide up to 6,000 square metres of space. This would include a basement area which could be used for storage and/or car parking. Access to this building could be through the 1932 Annexe. Because of its location it is suggested that that particular development would be used mainly for Members and office accommodation. The standard of that building would be approximate to the standard of an ordinary office building.</P>
    <P>Members will agree that the College of Art site requires a sensitive approach. The preliminary proposal envisages the whole of the site being taken into the development. However, the oldest portion of the existing buildings i.e. the original Drawing and Modelling School, merits retention and refurbishment. The rest of the site could be cleared and a new building, single storey at the Leinster Lawn frontage and the remainder two storey, would be erected which would link into the Drawing and Modelling School and Leinster House. The new building would match as closely as possible the facade of the buildings at the opposite side of Leinster House and would, in effect, complete the Leinster Lawn frontage. The resultant building could have up to 5,000 sq. metres of space, including a basement area, under the new construction. Access to that building would be through the main hall in Leinster House. The most appropriate use for the building would be as committee rooms, interview rooms etc., and offices.</P>
    <P>Primarily because development of the College of Art site will involve relocation of existing activities and as there are time constraints, development of the Fisheries Yard site is proposed as the first phase. When completed the new building will act as a clearing house for Oireachtas staff and those at present located in the College of Art. It would also accommodate the most urgent Oireachtas <Col N="616" /> requirements and ensure minimum disruption to Members and functions of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Subject to agreement of the brief of accommodation requirements within the next couple of months, it is proposed to commence work on the Fisheries Yard site early in 1995. Construction work and fitting out will take about a year. At that stage it is hoped to have the design of the College of Art development completed and to have in place arrangements for the vacation of the property. Building work will then begin. The new library arrangements will be put in place when this work is completed and following negotiations and discussions with various interested parties.</P>
    <P>While the accommodation proposed is urgently needed the programme is an ambitious one requiring the co-operation and goodwill of Members of the House, staff, the public and all users of the House. Consultations will take place with all the interests involved. In that context I have written to the chairman of the Joint Services Committee asking that committee to co-ordinate the consultation process with the Members and I have asked the Clerk of the Dáil to co-ordinate the response of the staff and other users of the House. When I have the results I hope to be in a position to consider how best the requirements can be met and to advise the Government on the matter.</P>
    <P>I know all Members and staff will welcome the proposals as outlined. It is important to note and I was very conscious of the fact that decisions should not be made for Members and staff without full consultation and if we are to make the facilities fit into a modern parliament it is necessary to move quickly. I am satisfied that the procedures we have put in place will allow Members and staff to make a major input before any final decisions are taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reservations about certain details announced by the Minister of State, particularly the urgency he attaches to carrying out the work. He should state the total cost of <Col N="617" /> the plan which I believe is in the region of £10 million and think again before spending such a sum on this development when there are other pressing needs.</P>
      <P>I have doubts about the plan. There is no provision for an underground car park. Secretaries cannot park their cars in Leinster House. Because of the traffic they find it impossible to be on time in the mornings and have difficulty returning home in the evenings. There is urgent need for such a car park and the Minister of State should take his time and see what is needed to streamline the day-to-day working procedures.</P>
      <P>Present-day standards are a vast improvement on those under which our predecessors languished. Before I became a Member I visited the House and saw four or five Deputies working in one room. There was one secretary for every three Deputies. Conditions have changed since and this matter should not supersede other urgent problems.</P>
      <P>The College of Art site is designated for committee rooms and the library. There is not much wrong with the present library facilities and if a Member attends to the needs of this constituents he will not have much time to spend there. He would be weighed down with the problems of his constituents and that would keep him busy during the time he spends in Leinster House.</P>
      <P>How can facilities be improved for members of the public who visit the Chamber? The ushers give excellent service and attention and devote much of their time acting as guides to visitors to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the Fishery Yard site development and ask the Minister of State if he is justified in spending £10 million on modernising the Dáil and its precincts while the potholes get bigger by the day. Some of them are visible at the main entrance to Dáil Éireann from Kildare Street. The chickens are coming home to roost. Island people do not have access to ferry services due to the non-provision of proper piers and landing slipways. Fisherman cannot land their catches and depart the fishing grounds due to lack of proper pier and landing facilities. <Col N="618" /> Young married couples and their families are forced to live in dilapidated caravans and shacks while the Minister of State is thinking of spending £10 million on grandiose plans for the refurbishment of this House.</P>
    <P>Elderly people are compelled to live in poky, damp tenements without proper heating or sanitary facilities. Geriatrics are denied proper hospitalisation facilities and housing. Thousands of people are waiting for hip operations for years and many applicants for local improvement grants have been waiting for decades for grants to construct proper road access to their property and eliminate the muddy car and cow tracks leading to their properties.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry cannot expand due to lack of finance to extend proper water supplies and in Schull it is at a standstill due to the failure of the Minister for the Environment to provide finance to carry out stage 3 of the Skibbereen water scheme. I do not see any logic in the expenditure by the Government of £10 million on this grandiose refurbishment plan at a time when the tourism industry in my constituency, vital to so many people, has ground to a halt because of the failure of the Minister for the Environment to give the green light to stage three of the Skibbereen water scheme which would bring a supply to the tourist resort of Schull.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy could solve all those problems with £10 million I would give it to him straightaway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the long delays in the payment of cattle and sheep headage grants, beef premium and other grants, some farmers could be included in <i>Stubbs Gazette</i>&mdash; some of them have to wait for 12 months and longer for payment. In addition, children are being taught in overcrowded classrooms due to a lack of funding for new schools. In Clonakilty, the home town of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, 200 children are taught in five poky classrooms and have to climb over desks on their way in and out of these rooms. It is nonsensical <Col N="619" /> for the Government to propose spending £10 million on the refurbishment of Leinster House when such problems exist in so many areas.</P>
      <P>The time has come for common sense to prevail &mdash; the Government should first solve the litany of problems I outlined before it considers refurbishment of Dáil Éireann. The Government should get its priorities right. There is nothing seriously wrong with the facilities available for Oireachtas Members which warrants the expenditure of this exorbitant amount on a refurbishment plan. I have great reservations about the expenditure of this huge amount of money at a time when so many other problems need to be resolved. The people to whom I have spoken are highly critical of the Government which is so naive as to propose the expenditure of £10 million on the refurbishment of Leinster House at a time when people are crying out for funding which would enable them to make a livelihood in their areas.</P>
      <P>I wish to bring to the Minister's attention the need for an underground car park for Leinster House. Such a development would not be too costly and would be of great benefit to the staff who have to park their cars a quarter of a mile away from Leinster House. The Minister should give consideration to an underground car park instead of building huge conference and committee rooms, which will be used by the chairmen of committees and their secretaries and will merely serve to give a false impression of prosperity, which we do not enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should cut his cloth according to his measure. If he can satisfy me that all the problems to which I referred will be solved I will have no problem about giving the green light to this development plan. However, I have serious reservations about the expenditure of so much money on a refurbishment plan for Leinster House when there is dire poverty in many areas. The time is not right for this refurbishment plan: consideration should be given to it only when the Government has got the £7 billion from the EU between now and <Col N="620" /> the end of the century, a mere six years away, and all the problems to which I referred have been rectified. I wish to give the remainder of my time to Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>

People have not forgotten the expenditure of £17 million on the refurbishment of Government justify spending another Merrion Street a few years ago. How can the Government justify spending another £10 million so soon after that expenditure?</P>
      <P>As Setanta Centre is large enough to accommodate committee meetings, I do not understand the urgent need for extra accommodation for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would find it very hard to sell this plan to my constituents who cannot even get enough funding to improve the piers and landing slips in their areas. In one <Col N="621" /> case a doctor had to wait an hour and a half for the tide to come in before he could land on Whiddy Island, which has no pier, to attend a patient. Even though money for the construction of a pier on the island was allocated years ago under the Whiddy package, for some unknown reason that money was used instead to pave Grafton Street for the Millennium celebrations. When the doctor gained access to the island he experienced difficulty re-embarking on the launch to take him back to the mainland. Instead of spending millions of pounds freely on grandiose, elaborate proposals converting this House into a kind of palace&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we should await the 21st century when the Minister's purse might be larger. I could not sell this proposal to my constituents, to those awaiting the construction of a pier on Whiddy Island, another in Baltimore to facilitate the Naomh Kierán ferry and the big fishing fleet in west Cork operating out of that area. Neither can I condone the delay in extending piers all around our south-west coastline, particularly that at Ahakista, one of our most beautiful holiday resorts.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should rethink before embarking on this spending spree. While I appreciate he is in charge of the Office of Public Works and that there are many demands on the funds available to him, he could spend £10 million upgrading all the facilities falling within his remit rather than allocating it to one project which could wait until the end of the century. Bearing in mind that the Taoiseach offered Northern parliamentarians 30 seats in a new Dáil, on the abolition of the Border, that would be the time to remodel this House. I urge the Minister of State to reconsider this proposal while so much remains to be done for the unfortunate electorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Sheehan that this Government has a <Col N="622" /> voracious appetite for spending other people's money. Nonetheless we are here to debate the improvement of our library facilities in this House. My party is of the view that only what is absolutely necessary in terms of enhancing the facilities in this House should be undertaken, that there should be no profligate use of taxpayers' money on providing resources to facilitate Members and staff.</P>
      <P>As the Progressive Democrats Whip, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. On being elected to this House I was surprised to find how limited our Library resources were. I tend to take my legislative duties quite seriously &mdash; in fact I might even lose my seat on that account &mdash; but it does appear to me that we are badly resourced, particularly in terms of research facilities. Through no fault of theirs, but because of lack of funding and neglect over the years, our Library staff can provide a reactive facility only to Members. There are only nine staff demonstrating how under-resourced they are in personnel terms alone. Indeed our Library staff are heroic in their efforts to provide Members with the services demanded of them. The lack of computerised cataloguing and information technology generally renders it impossible for nine personnel to provide the services required by some 166 Deputies and 60 Senators.</P>
      <P>An adequate library service is particularly important in the context of the growing committee system. As a member of a small party, which experiences difficulty in terms of human resources, in participating properly in that committee system without adequate research facilities, my party would be in favour of the recommendations contained in this report, that our Library facilities would be converted not merely into a reactive service but a research unit for the benefit of Members of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Services Committee compared our services with those provided in other modern democracies, showing clearly that we fall short in providing even the minimum requirements expected of legislators. The report did not blame the staff, but pointed to the need for retraining <Col N="623" /> and additional skilled staff to be employed to accommodate the introduction of a computerised, information technology unit. There should also be an audit of the very valuable archival material stored somewhere in this House of which no proper account is held. If this is not undertaken urgently there is a danger that this valuable archival material will be neglected, if not damaged irreparably. Since I understand we hold these documents as trustees for the State and future generations of parliamentarians we would be failing in our duty if that material were not properly bound and catalogued.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of this report was that the Library research unit provide Members with a briefing service on forthcoming legislation. Huge amounts of information can be stored on small computer discs which would enable Members to access such information rather than drawing on the personal services of Library staff, which would also enormously improve their performance as legislators. If Members are to contribute in a considered, intelligent manner to debates they need this backup facility. There was much talk in the House recently on the demands made of Members in combining their role as legislators with that of local representatives. The abolition of the dual mandate would be one way of enhancing the status of TDs and local councillors. They should be separate roles.</P>
    <P>There should be consultation and open debate on access to library facilities. At present such access is limited to Members of both Houses although an exception is sometimes made at the request of Members. Political correspondents should also have access to an enhanced library service. It is my understanding that they too will prepare a submission to the Minister of State. At the same time it is important that no ground be ceded on the privacy of the Library for Members, which is a beautiful room and provides them with a refuge in their scrutiny of legislation away from the demands of their individual offices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> It must be remembered that we are discussing the Library facilities within the context of the overall development of Leinster House. The glaring omission from the plans in the glossy catalogue was a commitment to provide a créche for the 600-plus who work in this House. After 20 years of the women's movement and many years' meetings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights who lobbied for a créche, the lack of such a facility appears to be the remaining bastion of inequality. Child care in general is an issue of the workforce, children's rights, of integrating work with the political process and family life and, therefore, I was extremely disappointed to hear the Minister of State talk in terms of feasibility. Thousands of pounds have been spent, through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, on the commissioning of reports. As there is now a Minister for Equality and Law Reform, who recently accepted a report prepared on child care which had been delivered four years later&mdash; which he is now carefully considering, as he does every report on women's rights &mdash; some impetus should be given to the provision of child care facilities, not only for Members but for all the men and women who work to support Members of both Houses in this building.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, there is general disappointment that there is a deliberate absence in the document of any indication that there will be the long awaited creche facility for women and men who work in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Strong rumours abound in the blue print of a draft proposal to provide gym facilities for Members of the Oireachtas. If gym facilities are introduced at the expense of child care facilities <Col N="625" /> I will lead a picket outside this House. Should that happen it will be the first time I have ever taken part in a picket.</P>
      <P>The proposals before us relate to two new buildings on seperate sites. I am concerned about the planning implications in relation to the College of Art development, to which the Minister referred, and the implications for that development on the Leinster Lawn frontage. This document provides that the new committee facilities will be created in the space between the retained structure, matching as closely as possible the facade on the opposite side of Leinster House. I refer you, a Cheann Comhairle, to the Local Government Planning and Development Regulations, 1994, published on 19 April 1994 by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith. In his press release the Minister indicated that as and from 15 June most development by Government Departments and the Office of Public Works will, subject to exceptions from minor works, be subject to normal planning requirements. He went on to say that there will be some categories of State developments which, for security reasons, will be excluded from those planning requirements, including Garda stations, Army barracks, prisons, courthouses and some Government offices. Within that category of exempted developments is there anything relating to the Houses of the Oireachtas? This is a very dangerous issue.</P>
      <P>Leinster House comprises buildings of national architectural importance and any dilution of planning regulations would be a cause of concern. The planning and development committee of the city council, of which I am a member, has had cause in the past to be worried about the activities of the Office of Public Works in regard to their stewardship of historic buildings in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that alternative consultation arrangements will be put in place for these developments. If the bottom line is that the planning decision to go ahead should not be made by the State, no amount of consultation or alternative arrangements will satisfy me that <Col N="626" /> there is an objective assessment of the planning implications of any buildings in the vicinity of Leinster House if it is left to the local authority to make that decision. The exclusion of the House of the Oireachtas from the strict and rigorous planning regulations is a mistake and flies in the face of the Supreme Court judgment in relation to interpretative centres.</P>
    <P>I have had reason to discuss conservation and planning in the city with people who are so involved. They have expressed a questioning attitude as to why the word &ldquo;security&rdquo; can absolve the Office of Public Works from planning regulations for the Houses of the Oireachtas. The security implications could be dealt with in a way that does not cede ground on planning regulations.</P>
    <P>Recently I raised with the Minister of State the procedures entered into in relation to the shop at the entrance to Leinster House. The highest standards of care should prevail in relation to the conservation of the facade of Leinster House. Because no change was involved in changing the shop from its previous use, section 84 consultation was not required. As it so happens the shop is sensitive and does not present itself as a blemish on the facade of the House of the Oireachtas. The regulations announced by the Minister concerning planning and conservation, particularly of the facade facing Leinster Lawn and that relating to the Fisheries Yard, are not sufficient. Some of the facade will have to front onto Kildare Street, between Agriculture House and the National Museum and I am worried that the planning regulations will not be strictly adhered to.</P>
    <P>The lack of crèche facilities in the House is a lost opportunity. In public policy terms it would have been an opportunity for this House to take a lead in the provision of child care facilities for workforces throughout the country. What hope is there of giving effect in small and medium sized businesses to the proposals in the childcare report if the Houses of the Oireachtas, where over 600 are employed, cannot take the lead <Col N="627" /> in providing childcare facilities for Members and staff? Let me impress upon the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and other committees with clout, the political importance of how we in this House are perceived and how the public will perceive spending £10 million on improving facilities without making a gesture to public policy by providing childcare facilities which would act as an example to citizens and employers around the country.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the planning implications of the development and I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

Decisions are usually made in substance before they ever come to be debated in this House.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and having worked as an architect I have some understanding of the process involved in coming to determining how a building is planned and constructed. One does not start at the end, one does not start by describing the building but at the beginning of the process, at understanding the needs of the brief and the specification. That is not what we are doing here. Already we have attractive pictures of the plans of the building. That is my approach and it is the democratic one. It is reflected all over Europe where there is a tremendous drive to enable people to get involved in the democratic process, a bottom-up approach enabling local communities to have a say over their own destiny.</P>
      <P>That is not a characteristic of this House. I do not think the Minister would agree that we operate in a modern, open, outward looking progressive way. I believe his inclination is towards that way of thinking and he must understand the limitations that have to be challenged so that we do not end up faced with a <i>fait accompli</i> that we now debate. I do not begrudge him the glossy brochure &mdash; I understand some Deputies voiced their concern &mdash; but I understand the force of advertising. This is advertising. What concerns me is the substance of the Minister's approach. First there is the failure to understand modern developments in communications, which is extremely worrying. There is a failure also to understand the needs of modern democracy. Perhaps being around this place too long blunts one to the deficiencies of it, but I am a relatively new Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe this proposal is the solution. I do not believe the money will be well spent, because at the end of the day it will not serve the people, the general public, and surely that is the purpose to which we are all committed. I do not believe I have to be on campus. I do not understand the term &ldquo;campus&rdquo; as referring to this House. I do not have any worries about crossing the street and meeting a protester. I do not see this as <Col N="629" /> a negative thing in my life, it is a healthy experience. I do not understand the major drive to bring everyone on campus.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare the report of the Joint Services Committee on the Library and this publication. I compared them. The report on the Library facilities deals with important issues, technology, staffing and only at the end of the document does it deal with the issue of space and accommodation. That report does not go far enough but it is certainly a more realistic approach than the Minister's proposal to invest in bricks and mortar rather than looking clinically and coolly at the needs of the Oireachtas and the capability of technology to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sheehan says, the Minister has gone for the grandiose building project. I suppose it will be christened &ldquo;Albert Hall&rdquo;. It has been christened &ldquo;Dempsey's Den&rdquo;, but that sounds cosy. &ldquo;Albert Hall&rdquo; is probably more appropriate. The experience with the interpretative centres is characteristic of the Office of Public Works' policy to build. It can become an obsessive policy. It is a human urge to build, particularly when it fits in neatly with the ministerial desire to spend money and have something concrete to show for it and possibly to stay within the budget, no matter how useless the end product is. I suggest that the Minister remember H.L. Mencken's advice that for every complex problem there is a solution which is simple and neat and wrong. Investment in buildings is immensely satisfying; it is evidence that a person has done something at some time in his career. A building very quickly becomes a monument and a monument often ends up being dedicated to the person who built it rather than to the people for whom it should serve.</P>
    <P>I have argued very strenuously against the Office of Public Works' approach to interpretative centres and I believe the same empire building philosophy lies behind the Minister's proposal. I can give a simple example of what I am talking about. Last weekend, the first day of the bank holiday, I visited Knocksink <Col N="630" /> Woods, Enniskerry, in my constituency. The Minister opened a visitor's centre there over a year ago. Even though I am the local TD I did not know much about it. I was amazed to find people queuing up to visit the centre, a centre dedicated to educating people about conservation located in a woodland suffering the depredations of modern urban society, but it was not open. This is a building solution that does not meet the need. Everybody can acknowledge that the building exists and that the Minister did something, but that does not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>It is important that we challenge what is at issue. I do not argue that there are not space problems &mdash; only a fool would argue that there are not &mdash; but first we must make efficient use of what space we have. For example, the political correspondents have a very small space but I do not see that a full architectural audit has been carried out of the space we have in order to ensure that efficiences have been made. I do not understand the justification for five committee rooms and five offices for the chairman. What justification is there for that? We will decided relatively soon to have a committee week. That will mean that this Chamber and, presumably, the Seanad Chamber will be free. There are already a certain number of committee rooms. With all due respect, there is no lack of space; it is more likely that there will be a problem with attendances at committee meetings. We must move away from the tendency to build each time we face a problem; we need to alter direction to keep pace with changes in technology and the demand for democracy and examine how they can be linked.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we require all this space and have to spend £10 million to £12 million in bricks and mortar. While we may need a certain amount we do not need what is encompassed in the document. This is a waste of funds at a time of high unemployment and poverty. I am not milking this matter for political purposes; what I am trying to do is put the matter in context. There are thousands of households which lack basic facilities such as an indoor toilet.</P>

      <P>Libraries will become repositories for documents; we live in an age of hypermedia, global networks and international data bases. There have been major changes in communications. It seems that we in Dáil Éireann are not of that world; this place is extraordinarily lacking in technology. We now have word processors in our offices &mdash; a tremendous battle was fought to get these and credit is due to the Deputies and Ministers responsible. My secretary informed me today that she has not yet been trained how to use this word processor. This indicates that a primitive approach has been adopted to technology. Every low and middle grade academic has access to electronic mail. We could have access to a large network of information if such technology was put in place. Even as I speak, <Col N="632" /> changes are occurring in technology which cut down on the use of paper and are more environmental friendly. This is light years away from what we are used to in terms of efficiency.</P>
      <P>In Harvard University, for example, there is a highly developed information network which was installed at a much lower cost. That is the kind of system we need here and we need the human resources to use it; it would transform the way we operate. We are operating at a disadvantage; endless information is available, yet we have to respond rapidly to legislation that is presented without having access to this information which is within our grasp through modern technology.</P>
      <P>This may influence Deputies in deciding where to locate. Deputies are being encouraged to locate their offices in their constituencies. This is a good development given that it is important to maintain contact with one's constituency and to keep abreast of changes. It will be difficult to do this unless one has access to modern technology but it is possible. In America 40 million employees work away from their offices for a considerable length of time. Such a move would allow us to be better public representatives and legislators; we are not one or the other.</P>
      <P>This development will take two years to complete and take us into the 21st century. I do not see the 21st century reflected in this development; I see rooms and more rooms. We have to rethink the way we use space and information technology for the benefit of the people we represent.</P>
      <P>We are living in an era of high unemployment; there is an unemployment crisis. The Government has to marry our human resources with technology to make us more efficient. The Government has taken on staff but it is unfortunate that these include the spin doctors and publicity agents instead of staff in the back room who do the hard graft. This should strengthen the argument in favour of increasing staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, am concerned that no reference was made to a family room. As the Minister of State is aware, since the last election <Col N="633" /> a case has been made to the Ceann Comhairle and various Government Ministers by various bodies, including the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights. There have been no concrete proposals; there has been plámás but nothing substantial. The Minister informed me in response to a question that it would be provided in ancillary accommodation. Baggage rooms are mentioned in the document but not children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes a huge difference; its significance escapes me. I do not know what the Minister of State has in mind; we are judging what is on paper. Provision is made for two restaurants and two bars but no family room. There is no place for children in this House which is the most important building in the country apart from Áras an Uachtaráin.</P>
      <P>Recently, a Fianna Fáil backbencher brought his daughter in to visit the House. Did he explain the reason there was no place for children here and the reason the Government is indicating that private employers should provide child care facilities while refusing to provide such facilities for the 600 people who work under this roof? That is the mindset which does not understand that there are now 20 women Members in this Chamber who have family responsibilities and, more importantly, does not understand the change occurring among the electorate who understand that public and private responsibilities are enmeshed. This is the mindset which has blocked out the changes in communication technology and changes both outside and inside the home.</P>

    <P>We need to get back to basics. There are good things about such a step. The devil does not have a right to all the good tunes.

We have nothing except pretty drawings and a very nice picture of the Minister &mdash; I am sure he has a nice holy communion picture as well that belongs with this one. I compliment the <Col N="634" /> Minister on the production but it in no way meets the needs of the public whom we represent &mdash; and they, not the Government, are the client, when it comes to this building project.

      <P>I was struck by what the previous speaker said. The impression was given that in regard to the Oireachtas Library, accommodation and physical space were not a priority. However it is stated in the report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The design of the premises occupied by the Library militates against the provision of an effective library service. The Library's books and publications occupy many separate rooms in the College of Art, Leinster House and Kildare House buildings and consequently researches into various topics can be excessively time consuming <Col N="635" /> as Library staff commute between the different locations to gather material... The committee recommends an urgent review of the present accommodation situation and future needs and this should be a priority for the new Oireachtas Library Research and Information Committee.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the recommendations in that report cannot be accommodated within the existing physical space of our existing Library.</P>
    <P>The report brings home the huge deficit in terms of research and access to information in this House, and access to information is a very powerful weapon for public representatives in a modern democracy. For far too long public representatives have been dependent on official expert advice. The reports that come before public representatives both at Dáil and local level are those of inhouse experts who may have their own political agenda and their own views about how we should proceed in certain areas. There is very little access to independent views and research. It is crucial that Deputies have that facility. I would go further than the report goes and say that every Deputy should have a proactive research officer to assist in dealing with legislation and other issues, such as the question of landfill and incineration. Often we receive documentation from the Department of the Environment officials or from engineers at local level. We may also get information, or propaganda, from Greenpeace and other environmental organisations. Often there is an absence of a proper databank for public representatives on such environmental issues to give a proper, balanced, non-propagandist approach. The same applies to other issues. I have had direct experience of this, having been at a disadvantage in taking on the environmentalists, civil engineers etc. when they were intent on going down one road on the question of landfill, sewerage treatment etc. Often the public representative does not have expertise in a <Col N="636" /> specific area and is up against it when trying to argue the case with the experts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recommendations which deal with improving and enhancing the quality of research facilities available to Members. A central recommendation relates to the establishment of a comprehensive research and information service which, it is felt, is essential for any modern parliament. It is clear that if we are to go down that road &mdash; and I believe we should &mdash; we will require a new building.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that our Library service is not computerised. Libraries are part and parcel of modern living, and they are changing in the context of the technological revolution. They are adapting to that and enhancing their facilities. It is crucial that we apply technology to our own Library services. I understand that as of now we have no computerised cataloguing or indexing system in our Library and no technology to link in to other research institutions. The Members of this committee went to Westminster and the proactive nature of the library staff and facilities there puts our facilities in the shade. What we want is proactive research. I also like the recommendation that there should consequently be greater use of the National Library which is adjacent to this House. I have used it myself in the past. It is primarily a reference library which could be of great use to public representatives. Because of its physical proximity to this House it makes sense that there should be a linkage and greater access to that resource for public representatives and Members of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that Deputies should have their own research officers. Perhaps that is an outlandish proposal because of the cost, but it could come under the heading of funding of political parties which will be coming before the House before the end of the year. At the minimum, political parties should be given resources to provide for adequate research teams in order to develop better researched and informed policies. I agree there should be State funding for political parties, but a substantial portion of it should be targeted <Col N="637" /> so that each political party can set up a research team to assist the party in preparing informed documents and developing new policies.</P>
    <P>Previous Opposition speakers contradicted themselves, as they invariably do when new facilities for Leinster House or the Government are proposed. I recall the furore over the £17 million spent on the renovation of Government Buildings. Members opposite claimed it was a waste of money and a vulgar display of wealth.</P>

      <P>People who pass that building now admire the wonderful, innovative and futuristic project and praise us for taking that step. We talk ourselves down too much in this House. This is a modest proposal. Until recently two or three Deputies and their respective secretaries shared on office here. There was an incredible problem with space. It is unacceptable for Deputy McManus to suggest that we should carry out an audit of the existing space in the House and perhaps use it better. We all know there is not enough physical space within Leinster House to accommodate the growing needs. When the Duke of Leinster built this House it was not his intention that it would be a modern parliament in the 20th or 21st centuries. He had great foresight because his wife bore him 18 children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It served usefully as a big crèche. That gentleman did not have any idea what would become of his grand house. I understand this House is an extension of the old Leinster House building. It was not part of the original plans, but was tastefully built. I wonder what the planners and architects at the time thought of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not undermine the Office of Public Works. There has been far too much sniping at that office. It may have got it wrong in some areas, but it got it <Col N="638" /> right in many others. The Office of Public Works has been to the forefront in many heritage developments and in the preservation of national parks throughout the country. It has been responsible for very tasteful work in the Seanad Chamber. Credit should be given when it is due. It is unfair to present a picture of the Office of Public Works as an architectural terrorist organisation and say that it is out to destroy all public buildings. I am fed up with that type of talk. We need a balanced approach.</P>

      <P>By and large, that office is very sensitive in carrying out its work. Some very derogatory remarks have been made about it, for example, that basically everything it does is contrary to proper aesthetic presentation of buildings. The inference to be drawn from such remarks is that it cannot do a good job. That is unfair as the Office of Public Works has displayed significant expertise in the past in respect of many buildings, heritage parks and so on. Many male Members would also welcome the provision of a crèche or family room.</P>

      <P>Deputy McManus spoke about the 20 women Deputies. A consultative process is built into this proposal. The Minister made it clear that he wants the involvement of all Deputies in drawing up the plans and the final configuration of the extension. People should adopt a more constructive approach in this regard. There is a proposal for a crèche or family room which can be pursued through the consultative process outlined by the Minister. In fairness to him, the sub-committees were <Col N="639" /> established through co-operation between the Whips and have proved successful. There is no reason we cannot proceed in a similar vein in respect of this extension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald):</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we need to spend more money on housing, health and education. The Government has put in place a programme which will eliminate the provision of local authority housing without bathrooms and allocated substantial sums of money to the health and educational services. It is also important that in this House, the centre of our democracy, we have facilities in which our democracy can flourish and do its business.</P>
      <P>This is an 18th and 19th century building enlarged by a very poor quality 1960s extension. It is important we get it right this time and a process whereby all users of the building are consulted is the way forward to ensure nothing is left out. We are building for posterity. It is crucial that we put an end to the position whereby some of the facilities of this House are provided off campus. When crossing over to Setanta House I often wonder how we have avoided the holding of by-elections because of Members being knocked down while crossing the road. On occasions, because of public demonstrations outside the House, Members have not been able to be present for votes. In a closer voting position than we have at present that could cause the fall of a Government. All voting Members of this House should be within the one precinct and should not have to depend on the vagaries of the traffic or public demonstrations to gain access to the building. All facilities of this House should be on site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation process should involve all potential users of the House, for example, Members, their staff, the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the press who have very poor facilities. It is unacceptable that members of the press should have to go out on the plinth in the rain to interview or photograph <Col N="640" /> Members. We need a dedicated press centre. Members of the press who work in this building should be consulted in regard to their requirements.</P>
    <P>It is important that members of the public visit this House. Those of us who bring groups here appreciate the value they place on their visit and the good service provided by the ushers in giving a tour of the building and relating the history of the House. In a modern democracy we need more than that. For example, in the public gallery one cannot tell the public what is taking place. A reception area should be provided for receiving visitors where Members can inform them of the rituals of the House which they may not understand. In that way the public could obtain knowledge of our system and the Stages of Bills taken in the House. If we can provide interpretative centres for the birds, bees, flora and fauna, we should be able to interpret our democracy and explain to our people the way politics works. If we cannot do that we will merely add to the cynicism with which the democratic process is viewed. It is important for Members on all sides that what we do here is respected and valued because this is the heart of our democracy.</P>
    <P>Toilet facilities for the public are not sufficient and it is also difficult to offer people the basic hospitality of a cup of tea if they come here at lunch time when the restaurants are busy. We should open up our democracy to the wider public. It has been opened up through television and the press, but the public should be able to come in here and understand what is going on. That is central to our democratic process.</P>
    <P>Group 84 &mdash; a member of which is present &mdash; emphasised the importance of having a crèche and family room. I recall many years ago, before I was elected to the House, being chastised for bringing in small children, one of whom was on my back in a papoose. Children should be made welcome in this House and it should recognise family responsibilities. Group 84 has emphasised the need to provide sufficient ladies' facilities as the existing facilities cater mainly for men <Col N="641" /> as in the past it was assumed that most Members would be male. Showers should be provided, particularly as Members cannot leave the building on late sitting nights except with the Whips' permission and for those who may be going to an evening function.</P>
    <P>Approximately 1,000 people, the population of a small town, work in this building. I pay tribute to Senator Pat Magner for his work on the Joint Services Committee to introduce facilities, but much more is needed in this area. The banklink facility is welcome, but there should also be facilities to provide women with tights or medical supplies.</P>
    <P>The power of the committee system will grow when the draft Bill on privilege and compellability is enacted. Adequate committee facilities are needed to enable us carry out our work in a manner similar to that of the committee systems of the US Congress, the European Parliament and others. We need to move away from an adversarial Chamber-type debate to examine nitty-gritty policy matters in committee which allows for the participation of all Deputies.</P>
    <P>It is a very good idea to provide a link between the Dáil Library and the National Library. There is a need for more open access to material, similar to the statistical information freely available in the ESRI library, without the necessity to order and queue for it. We should be able to link up with the National Library and call up such information on computer screens.</P>
    <P>I do not have an office here, I carry out my Dáil and ministerial duties from a office located in &ldquo;Charlie's palace&rdquo;. The room is only equipped with two power plugs and one could easily trip over the many cables. When that building was refurbished proper provision for ducts for plugs, to provide for multiple computers, photocopiers, fax and other machines to facilitate the two Departments located there, was not made.</P>
    <P>When new members of the Labour Party took up office they were viewed as squatters as there was a shortage of office space. We need a flexible system to cater for different party strengths. This job <Col N="642" /> must be done right and we should not apologise for doing that. We should proceed in a consultative way. Perhaps we would not be encountering these difficulties if the five storey block had been built to a higher standard and included a crèche, family room, public facilities and so on. We should consult with each other now to achieve something for this democracy of which we can all be proud.</P>

      <P>When debating a motion on the refurbishment of the Houses of the Oireachtas one could decide to devote one's time to questioning the wisdom or prudence of allocating such a vast amount of money to the development when there are so many other needy causes, whether beds for children, homes for the homeless, repairing potholes or providing additional school resources. While I share those concerns I will contribute to this debate in a realistic way. As this is a Government proposal which will be voted through by a majority it would be wiser if I devoted my time to seeking to obtain the facilities I want rather than to other matters.</P>
      <P>This House is an inadequate one for a modern Parliament. Whatever money is spent on this development it will be much better spent than money allocated by the Government to advisers, watchdogs viewing the success and progress of the Programme for Government and PR teams employed to decorate and add style to Government announcements. Money spent on this House will benefit all Members. This is a unique opportunity for Members to ensure that the facilities they consider deserve priority are included in the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like facilities for which I have argued for a long time. The struggle to secure child minding facilities in Leinster House dates back to the third Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights in 1990. When I took the chair of the fourth Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights I, and the other members, decided that the provision of child minding facilities was a priority. Because of the lack of space and the rules governing the provision of a crèche facility, we decided it <Col N="643" /> would be more realistic and that we should have a greater chance of success if we sought a family room. We went through the stages but we were not successful because of the lack of space.</P>
    <P>As additional space is to be provided the Minister should ensure the provision of this facility. At the last committee meeting the Minister was somewhat annoyed that members expressed their anger and frustration about the exclusion of that facility in the impressive brochure, but I make no apologies for arguing for that facility at that meeting and expressing my anger, frustration and disappointment about the lack of it. In that brochure details are given of the provision of facilities that will be given priority. As the Government's launching document for this development includes the provision of photocopying services, a shop, a tea-room, baggage and cloakroom facilities, why were a crèche and family room facilities not included among the new facilities? Surely, they deserve as high a priority as a baggage and cloakroom facility, a tea-room or a shop.</P>
    <P>Despite having brought this matter to the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and having met the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister it is frustrating and disappointing that the Minister did not mention in his proposals for the refurbishment of Leinster House the facilities for which we have argued for 18 months and for which the previous committee argued for four years. There is no justification for the omission of a crèche and a family room when it is possible to provide baggage and cloakroom facilities. Surely a provision for children is more important? The majority of Members and staff have children.</P>
    <P>Our hours are unsociable enough and rural Deputies, in particular, are forced to be away from their families for a long enough period without making matters worse by excluding facilities for children in the House. Leinster House is a no-go area for children. Members do not bring children to the House because children associate the building with not being <Col N="644" /> allowed run, talk or make noise in the corridor and with sitting in an office watching television. Surely the Minister will agree the House is a dismal example to other workplaces in relation to children and family facilities. We expect other workplaces to provide facilities for their staff but Leinster House cannot follow the example of supermarkets and shops which provide children and family facilities. As long as children are barred from Leinster House, this will continue to be an unreal world. Children are part of our world and they should feel wanted here.</P>
    <P>Members and staff will continue to be discriminated against if facilities are not provided for children and families. To work in Leinster House, whether as a Member or staff, you must face the fact that you will be away from your family for a long period. If people from Dublin who work here wish to bring their children in after school to help them with homework, they must take them to an unpleasant office, which is unsuitable for that purpose. Those of us who work in Leinster House have suffered for too long from a lack of facilities and the House has also suffered. If Members and staff know that they can have their families near them they will be much more contented.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give a commitment that these facilities will be provided. What is required is a crèche such as that provided for the Revenue Commissioners' staff in Mount Street. I visited that crèche and was most impressed. I congratulate all those involved in providing that facility. There are some basic facts to be borne in mind when considering the provision of a crèche. The most important is that demand for this facility grows as people become aware of it. We are fortunate to have expert advice available from the Office of Public Works which was involved in the provision of the crèche in Mount Street. While we realise that a crèche would be oriented towards pre-school children, the problem remains of facilitating children of school going age when school is over and during holidays. This House does not go into <Col N="645" /> recess to facilitate shool holidays. The facility in this case would be more modest and would not require the same level of supervision and equipment as that required in a crèche. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights put forward proposals for a family room which would contain a television, modest computer equipment and interactive CD, all of which would help keep children occupied and allow their parents get on with their day's work. A family room is a modest facility and there is no reason it should not be included in the refurbishment programme.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to provide a crèche and it is very important that it be included in the initial stages of development so that we can ensure we keep within the guidelines. Such a provision would be a contribution on the Minister's behalf to the International Year of the Family. I hope the provision of a crèche will become a priority in the refurbishment programme. Until such time as a commitment is given in this regard the question will be raised by the Joint Committee on Women's Rights. Why should there be a question mark over this matter? One Member said this evening that there is still scope for a family room and crèche facilities. Why should this be the last item to be included? Why should it be provided only at the last minute if the space is available? That is not good enough. I am sure the Minister will agree that our families and children deserve better.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a point relating to correspondence from the Minister. On the provision of facilities the Minister's correspondence states that the Joint Committee on Women's Rights should forward detailed and well researched proposals, including such matters as numbers who would use the facility, who would meet the running cost and the size of the facility. The committee will be most co-operative in that regard. However, must proposals be put forward on the use and space of the baggage room? Will a survey be carried out on the number of bags that will be left in the room? Will we have to indicate the size <Col N="646" /> and shape of the bags and who will look after them? Will a survey be carried out as to how many cups of tea will be served per day in the tea room or how many coats will hang in the cloakroom, so that the size will be correct, it will be worthwhile and money will be wisely spent?</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Women's Rights will co-operate with the Minister, but if guidelines are laid down for a crèche and family room they must equally apply to all other facilities. Why should different provisions apply to a family room? As the majority of Members have children and all of us have relatives and friends, nobody could doubt that there would be full and valuable use of a family room and crèche. This matter could be compared to a housing programme in a rural area: sometimes there is no demand until an announcement is made that houses will be provided. The same will apply with a crèche once Members know that a crèche will be provided the demand will grow. We have no problem providing the Minister with the necessary information, but facilities in this area should not be treated differently from other facilities being provided under this programme. Surely it is not too much to ask that the children and families of the staff of this House be provided with facilities equal to those for baggage, cloakrooms, tea rooms and a shop.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, on the lack of parking facilities. It would be unwise to lose this opportunity to provide such facilities for the staff of this House. Since Dublin has not an adequate or satisfactory transport system many of the staff have to travel to work by car, but there are not sufficient car-parking facilities here. That is a daily problem and now is the time to solve it. An effort should be made to ensure that such facilities are provided.</P>
    <P>Other Members spoke about restaurant facilities and I would like to dwell on my experience as a rural Deputy. The restaurant in this House closes down as soon as debate in this Chamber ends. There is an assumption that you eat only while the House is sitting. Many rural Deputies work here late at night and on <Col N="647" /> many occasions it is impossible to get even a cup of tea in Leinster House. During the recess when one comes to Leinster House to work, after 5.30 p.m. it is not possible to get anything to eat or drink except a glass of water. This should not be allowed to continue. Those of us who are rural Deputies, who do not have homes to go to while we are in Leinster House, can find ourselves here without even the facility of a cup of tea. Such a basic requirement is not available in the national Parliament.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this motion. I had intended devoting my time to what I believed should be a priority in the programme rather than debating the wisdom or otherwise of the allocation of funds to this programme. While I have some concerns, I want to reiterate that we are frustrated and angered that in spite of our enormous efforts to have some type of facilities for families and children, there was no mention of this in the Minister of State's opening speech. That is very disappointing and I hope it is not an indication of his commitment in that direction.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at this omission because in discussing this matter with the Minister I found him to be very positive towards our demand for such facilities, and I mentioned this at meetings of the Committee on Women's Rights. For that reason I expected those facilities to be a priority in the programme presented to the House this evening. I would like to believe this was simply an omission on the part of the Minister rather than something intentional. I hope he will assure me that these facilities will be provided in Leinster House. Whatever support or information our committee can furnish to him in this regard will be given. The provision of these facilities is our aspiration and not only would this be a worthwhile contribution from the Minister in this International Year of the Family but it would be worthwhile to all of us. It is only by having succeeded in providing these facilities in Leinster House that we can then demand on a firmer footing, that <Col N="648" /> they be provided in workplaces throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a positive response from the Minister in relation to the issues I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and it is timely that we now focus on the Oireachtas and facilities available to Members. Members will use this occasion to air their grievances about various matters but it should be put firmly on the record of the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, has gone a long way to improve the facilities available to Members of this House and to ensure that much needed reform is discussed and, slowly but surely, introduced in this House. While there was much wrong with the procedures of the Oireachtas in the past, these issues are finally being addressed and this debate is obviously part of that discussion. That should be recognised and also the role the Minister of State has played in bringing about improvements in this House.</P>
      <P>I wish to focus in particular on the role of the Oireachtas in the political system, because it is pertinent to this debate. It has been perceived, traditionally, that the Oireachtas did not play its full role in framing public policy and laws in general for this State. There are many reasons for that; there is little doubt that the strong party discipline in this House over the years has ensured that the Oireachtas does not play the role that it might, particularly when one compares our procedures to those of other Houses of Parliament.</P>
      <P>One could also focus on the perception that TDs have of themselves and of their role. Traditionally, Members of this House perceived a limited role for themselves and this was encouraged for various reasons. The staff and facilities available to Members were meagre and, in addition, Deputies generally took a local view of the many issues that were raised here. Members of this House see themselves as administrators rather than policy makers but that is slowly changing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Constituency work, which dominates the life of a TD, is important and I do <Col N="649" /> not subscribe to the view that TDs should not get involved in constituency work. It is very well coming into this lofty Chamber and debating various issues in an ivory tower-like way but unless TDs are in touch with what is happening on the ground, they will not be effective. TDs play an important role in their constituencies but they must be aided in their work if they are to be effective legislators.</P>
    <P>At present, each Member of this House has one secretarial assistant. I would suggest that is not sufficient. Government business is becoming increasingly complex and Members must be able to do their job effectively and they must have access to research. Researchers should be made available to Members to examine all aspects of public policy. The way we go about that is an issue which must be discussed. Obviously the proposals before us today include the expansion of the library system, and I welcome that, but there should be an individual service for TDs, perhaps through the library system, to avail of research and background information on the various complex issues which are brought before this House. The way people are elected to this House can sometimes leave Members ill-equipped to deal with complex issues.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been an enormous expansion of the role of the Minister and of the Government in bringing legislation before this House and in making policy. Ministers' offices have been expanded to take cognisance of the increasingly complex nature of Government. Advisers and communications experts are available to the Government. I do not want to go down that road but ministerial offices have expanded for various reasons and other people also have a greater input into the system. Traditionally, the proximate policy makers, including Ministers, Ministers of State, Members of the Oireachtas and the public servants, made the laws. That system was influenced by political parties, pressure groups, the public service, the mass media and public opinion but in this age of social consensus and the increasing contribution of the social partners, <Col N="650" /> the role of the effectiveness of the TD is now in question.</P>
    <P>Trade Unions and other vocational groups have direct access to Government and have a much greater role in bringing about changes in public policy and, therefore, the TD must now examine his or her role seriously and the role of the Oireachtas generally. That is what this discussion on Oireachtas reform is all about. Members of this House must become more familiar with aspects of Government policy and facilities and services must now be put in place in the modern Ireland to allow TDs do their job effectively. Traditionally Deputies have been locally orientated &mdash;&ldquo;all politics is local&rdquo; to quote the famous expression of Tipp O'Neill &mdash; but now the electorate demand that the Oireachtas play a greater role in policy making.</P>
    <P>This Government has a huge majority and that causes problems for the backbench Deputy, particularly on the Government side. The allocation of time to the Government is less than half the time allocated to various debates. Backbench Deputies find it very difficult to contribute to a discussion and put forward their views and those of their constituents. The committee system was introduced to deal with that and there are proposals to expand the facilities for committees.</P>
    <P>It is probably the fault of committee members that frontbench spokespersons often predominate at meetings and all the time is allocated for the major party spokespersons. The committee system needs to be examined to ensure that backbench Deputies can put forward their views without difficulty.</P>
    <P>Facilities and services for Deputies have improved. The salary has improved and that benefits the system. Traditionally a Deputy was a part-time member and he or she &mdash; more likely he &mdash; had a business or profession and was unable to make a 100 per cent input to the political system. The improvement in salary means that more Deputies are fulltime public representatives and can devote themselves fully to constituency work and law making. Telephone services, <Col N="651" /> constituency offices and so on leave a Deputy with more time to deal with the complex issues of the day.</P>
    <P>The refurbishment of Government buildings was criticised. I do not have to defend previous expenditure on such buildings. They are a showpiece and have earned the country a reputation which money cannot buy. It is only fitting that a Government have appropriate offices.</P>
    <P>The inquiries office is a hatch and gives a bad image of Leinster House. Some refurbishment and redesign of that office at the front entrance could be undertaken. I welcome the provision in the plan for interview rooms as, if the interview room is occupied, one must go outside the House to a nearby hotel to interview people or meet delegations. There is no reference to electronic voting which would be an effective and major reform. How far advanced is it?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that. By comparison with the House of Commons it is an excellent showpiece. I understand an information officer is to be appointed to the Houses of the Oireachtas and I wish her well in her new post. I wonder how effective that post will be. Politicians the world over have a bad image, although the reputation of Irish politicians is probably better than those in other countries. The media play a role in that regard. Newspapers must sell and if they reflect politicians in a bad light that will benefit their sales. We should not be particularly worried about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no mention in the document of crèche facilities. I wonder what stage that proposal is at? That issue needs to be considered. The participation of women in all aspects of society is very much a real issue. I do not say the provision of a crèche in Leinster House is solely a women's issue &mdash; it is one for all Members. However, if mothers are to play an active role in politics Leinster <Col N="652" /> House is the place to be and if family commitments and the rearing of children hinder that the Oireachtas must deal with it.</P>
    <P>The sitting hours of the Dáil have improved and this benefits the family life of Oireachtas Members. The hours are more sociable and allow Members participate in other work outside the House and spend time with their families in the late evening.</P>
    <P>I welcome the discussion. The role of the Oireachtas needs to be examined carefully and facilities need to be provided. We are making tremendous progress in this area, and I welcome the proposed developments.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, on his announcement &mdash; it arose from a rather innocuous question tabled by Deputy Deasy &mdash; of the Government's proposals in regard to the refurbishment of Leinster House. During my first few years as a Deputy I spent my time wandering around the corridors like a lost child and every time there was an election Deputies had to change offices. We served our constituents from offices in the basement, the top floor and the old Labour Party quarters. I recall rural Deputies who were not, to put it mildly, <i>au fait</i> with the wonders of electronics leaving dictaphone machines on while looking for letters on their desks with the result that tapes came to an end before half the letter was dictated. I also recall elderly <Col N="653" /> benign ladies taking letters in shorthand prior to typing them up on old manual typewriters. I think two secretaries dealt with the queries and correspondence of all members of the Fine Gael Party at that time. I also recall the time when Members could only make two telephone calls to areas outside the precincts of Dublin &mdash; one to their homes and one to their constituencies, for example, to the county council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>Facilities have improved over the past 20 years. The refurbishment of Leinster House should not turn into a quest for a crèche &mdash; it is about a bigger matter. While the provision of a crèche is very important, this plan is about the provision of facilities which will meet requirements during the next 100 years. This plan is not about the provision of facilities for present and future Members of the Oireachtas; rather it is about the provision of facilities which will serve people well into the next century. It is in that context that I congratulate the Minister on providing time for this debate which will give the Government a clear view of Members' requirements and opinions.</P>
      <P>I was not present for all of the Minister's speech and I am not sure if he said that this work will be carried out by way of direct contract or whether it will be done on a lease and buy back basis, as happened in the case of a number of State facilities in the recent past. In the context of a modern, efficient and working parliament and democracy for, of and by the people, the facilities in Leinster House are entirely inadequate and it is time they were improved. I welcome the development plan from which we should work in the interests of not only present and future Members of the Oireachtas but also the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was great hullabaloo a few years ago about the expenditure of £20 million on the refurbishment of Government Buildings by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, whose son so eloquently <Col N="654" /> addressed the Chamber a few minutes ago. There is no reference to the expenditure of that money now and when one considers that we are a member of an expanding EU and members of the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly today to admit four new members to the EU it is only proper that the Taoiseach should have at his disposal facilities becoming to his office from which to conduct business. While many people, including members of my party and other parties, castigated the then Government for the expenditure of that money the facilities provided in Government Buildings will last for the next 100 years. The review of Government to be carried out will obviously identify wastage of money on a huge scale, but great value for money can be achieved in this context if the refurbishment is carried out properly.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the special committees of the Dáil, for which Fine Gael had been calling for many years, was a very important advance. Once legislation giving committees the right to call witnesses has been passed it will be very important for committees to have proper facilities where they can meet with lobby groups and other organisations which want to put forward their ideas on the matters being discussed. Proper debate on legislation and its consequences by these committees will lead to great savings and, hopefully, reduce the necessity for tribunals. In addition, people of doubtful repute will be obliged to come before the elected representatives of the people to answer for their activities.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the Library is located in a very beautiful room, but it is inadequate for the needs of the staff and Members. If Deputy Flanagan wants to make a speech on a health, education or agricultural matter he must carry out the research himself as, with respect, the Library staff cannot, unlike the staff in the Australian Parliament and other parliaments, bring up on screen all the information on the topic under discussion. I had occasion with Minister of State Dempsey to see the facilities in the Australian Parliament, on which a colossal amount of money was spent. <Col N="655" /> Members of that parliament have access almost immediately to all the information published on a particular subject over the past ten years. It makes common sense to expand the Dáil Library in terms of its size and the ability of the staff to purchase materials, periodicals and newspapers. However, the increase in the budget to £250,000 over a period is infinitesimal in comparison to the budget for the libraries in other parliaments. Members should have at their disposal all the information they require to do their job for the people who elected them.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the condition of the soil in Fisheries Yard. Obviously proper consideration will be given to this point so as to ensure that no problems arise with the structure of the building in the future. I note the Minister of State said that the Fisheries Yard will be developed first in 1995 at which stage a detailed design will be ready for the College of Art. In particular I commend the retention of the present facade as far as possible in the completion of the building. When the Office of Public Works undertook similar projects they did a magnificent job.</P>
    <P>Over the years I tabled parliamentary questions about the provision of a facility room for Members of the Oireachtas to keep themselves in reasonable physical shape. There is much hot air generated in this House but the only physical exercise in which Members can indulge is climbing or descending the staircase instead of taking the lift. I was a member of a recent delegation attended by a doctor, not in this country, when it was discovered that the blood pressure of six Members was well over the limit. Whether that was caused by the location or the stress under which they labour I do not know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about a large facility but one on a small scale should be made available to Members. In addition, facilities for staff of the Houses is a matter of concern. In this <Col N="656" /> respect a Bill will be introduced to provide facilities for staff, which I hope will be passed. Over the next 20 years Members elected to this House may wish to have their constituencies served by secretaries located in the area and existing accommodation here may not then be required. However, I have no doubt other uses will be found for it.</P>
      <P>Unless underground car parks are provided it will be very difficult for everybody to park their cars here. I know many secretaries must leave the building to feed parking meters, some park their cars several miles away and travel the remainder of their journey by bus, which is inconvenient.</P>
      <P>It is important that this be seen not alone to be an open, transparent house of Government but that young visitors from primary and secondary schools have a clear understanding of its value and workings, demonstrating that the money spent on these buildings is not wasted but spent in the public interest, enabling Members elected to do the job required of them by the electorate.</P>
      <P>I also support pleas for the provision of a proper interview room. I had occasion recently to interview a man with a serious marital problem. It was not possible to conduct that interview in private in the existing interview room because there was a delegation sitting around the centre table and two or three other Members engaging in telephone calls.</P>
      <P>Our Library staff labour under severe difficulty, necessitating an increase in their numbers if they are to cater for a greater number of periodicals, information and computer back-up systems. In the report commissioned on library facilities I understand that the amount of archival material stored in the basement of this House not catalogued or put into any kind of chronological order is astounding. It is a disgrace that that material, much of it dating back to the foundation of the State, has not been catalogued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposed building extension will not merely be for the benefit of Members but for the electorate and their representatives over the next 50 years. <Col N="657" /> Therefore, we should ensure, before final contracts are signed, that there is value for money in a democratic and political sense so that future representatives will have at their disposal the requisite facilities to do the best they can for the electorate. Indeed if the electorate do not consider they are performing that task adequately, they have the right to voice their objection.</P>
    <P>I place great emphasis on the specialist committees being allowed to perform their task adequately. We do not have suitable facilities for these committees which, in a small parliament, places enormous pressure on Members, particularly those of smaller parties, running from meeting to meeting to be familiar in themselves with the various matters being discussed. If committees are provided with specialist committee rooms, if the legislation on compulsory attendance and rights of privilege is introduced and implemented and their meetings televised, it will make riveting viewing for the electorate. They will see democracy at work and elected representatives performing their task.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on this proposal and I hope it will come to fruition. Additions and recommendations will be advanced but, within the overall context, I hope we will get value for money.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Enda Kenny for affording me an opportunity to make a brief contribution.</P>
      <P>As somebody who occupied, along with the then students of the College of Art, portion of the building concerned in the late 1970s &mdash; against what might be described as fascist oppression and annexation from next door &mdash; it is important that I do a public U-turn this evening and welcome the proposal of the Minister of State to expand the facilities within the confines of this building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amusing that the debate is billed under the heading of &ldquo;statements&rdquo;, the parties having been requested to make statements on a document that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, is pleased <Col N="658" /> to announce the Government has approved. What is the status of the document? For example, why is this House not being asked to approve the proposals? Why are we not being asked to agree &mdash; or disagree &mdash; with a Government proposal to spend £10 million over a given period? I should have thought that the least required at this stage would have been a commitment by the Houses of the Oireachtas to spend the money, or at least a statement of intent. I put it to the Minister of State that he was not prepared to ask the House to approve spending money in case he might not garner the support of the remaining 165 Members. If that is the case, it is particularly regrettable and sad.</P>
    <P>I look forward to approving capital spending and to the statement of intent to proceed with these much needed facilities at the earliest opportunity. We are debating this proposal in a vacuum, we are asked to make statements on it even though we know the Government has approved it. Are there Members within the ranks of the Minister's party who are not prepared to deal with the matter or bite the bullet so far as this issue is concerned? It is this type of behaviour which has largely contributed to a very poor perception on the part of the public at large of public representatives. We get the facilities we deserve.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister of State has not asked the House to approve his programme, to approve the setting aside of moneys at some future date, other than by way of a bland debate which I hope will signal at least the start of this badly needed initiative. God knows, the facilities we have are of a type no other western democracy would tolerate. I compliment the Minister of State on his initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan has confused me by his contribution. I will have no difficulty coming back when there are firm, definite proposals to put before the House in relation to the development of Leinster House and I will do so if that is the wish of <Col N="659" /> Members opposite. I would go so far as to say that if they are not happy and want a unanimous proposal. I would be happy to withdraw the proposal before the House. During the course of the debate I found it difficult to refrain from interrupting some Deputies because some of the speeches were hypocritical in the extreme. Unfortunately one or two of the Members I am referring to are not in the House to hear my reply. It is difficult to deal with people who say they want a particular facility and on the other hand say that money should not be spent. People speak about consultation and democracy and attack me for the fact that I brought the proposals to the House without fleshing them out in any detail.</P>
      <P>I felt Members of this House, through the Joint Services Committee, would fill in the details and state the required facilities. If I came into this House with a document fully fleshed out, without consulting with the Members, without having consultations with the staff, without consulting other users of the House, the same Deputies, as in the case of visitor centres and so on, would be up in arms saying we have another example of the Government brow beating or attempting to brow beat people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McManus, who criticised the Office of Public Works for not consulting with people in relation to other matters, criticised me for not consulting and on the other hand she lacerated the Government precisely because we did not come into the House with a finalised document. Had I come into the House with a final document, I could have written Deputy McManu's speech. She would tell me it was totally undemocratic, that she favoured consultations taking place with Members of the House and that it should be a bottom up approach. She criticised me because I came in with a document that gives a broad outline of where I think the development should take place, but not detailed enough for Members to accuse me of presenting the House with <i>a fait accompli.</i> I do not understand that hyprocritical behaviour but coming from the party she represents it should be easy <Col N="660" /> to understand that they are in favour of nothing and against everything.</P>
    <P>The proposals I put to Government were a broad outline of what Members and staff were saying to me, as Chief Whip, in relation to the needs of Leinster House. The reason I did not mention figures is that the proposals, for which I sought Government approval, are not finally costed. When questioned by journalists I mentioned a figure of £10 million but that figure is not final. Once Government approval was obtained I succeeded in getting the Government to agree to a consultation process so that Members of this House, staff and users of this House would have the opportunity to say: &ldquo;We need a crèche, a gym, showers and so on&rdquo; Yet, some Members accuse me of trying to bulldoze proposals through the House. I have no intention of bulldozing anything through this House, if the Members say we do not need this development then so be it. I ask Deputies not to come crying to me as Government Chief Whip, or whoever will be in my place in years to come, saying it is not right to have six Senators sharing one room or two Senators and a secretary sharing one room or that staff should continue to work in present conditions.</P>

The Library facilities are totally inadequate and would not do justice to an ordinary secondary school. It is not right that Members and staff should have to put up with those kinds of facilities. We have put in place an agreed committee system. I would be the first to acknowledge that the Deputies opposite put proposals before the House in relation to committees, on which the Government acted. Those committees are working in cramped positions which are not suitable <Col N="661" /> to this House. I share Deputy Kenny's view in regard to committees but they cannot make further progress due to a lack of facilities. I defy anybody, whether in this House or in the media, to say that as Members we can do our job properly in present conditions. I defy anybody to say that staff who have been victimised and have accepted the new regime in relation to committees and so on without a word deserve better than the present conditions.</P>
      <P>The proposals I have put forward are not proposals for the current Dáil but for the 21st century. Deputy Kenny referred to the time when there was one secretary to three or four Deputies. Apart from the facilities given to us a few years ago each Deputy has a secretary. If we are to put a new system in place we must have new facilities.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the concern about women's health as recently indicated by the high incidence of breast cancer in this country and the many women who have tested positive in the course of the current Anti D screening process, calls on the Minister for Health:</P>
    <P>(1) to immediately set up a nationwide Breast Cancer Screening Programme under the GMS for women in <Col N="663" /> the high risk age group in the first instance, and</P>

      <P>I exhort the Minister to meet with representatives of the ICA and to agree a comprehensive programme of cancer prevention measures for all women, in particular breast screening combined with clinical examination for women over 50 years of age; clinical examination on a biennial basis for women under 50 years of age; a properly organised compaign of public education on the value of self-examination for all women. I advocate also the setting up of a national register to enumerate each member of the target population. This is essential to facilitate a systematic approach to the problem. Senator Mary Henry advocated this strongly last week in the Seanad. Will the Minister take this practical point on board? I urge him to put aside proper funding to intensify research on the causes of cancer. That is fundamentally important.</P>
      <P>The motion deals also with the predicament of women who have tested positive for hepatitis C. I urge the Minister to direct the VHI to extend cover to their clients who have tested positive. I await the Minister's response. Information indicates that the services are not responding as speedily as they ought. I have been told as late as an hour ago that women have to wait for up to five weeks for a biopsy and a further four weeks for the results. That cannot be tolerated. It is not acceptable that women should have to wait for up to seven weeks for the result of the test. All women want is a straight answer to their question on the extent of their condition. Will the Minister take whatever steps are open to him to speed up the process?</P>
      <P>Women with this condition ought to be issued with long term illness cards. I am aware that chemists have refused to supply other medication that women require in conjunction with interferon. The way to deal with this in a comprehensive way is to issue long term illness cards which would cover all their requirements. It would be a major step to ease the worries that women face.</P>

    <P>The Minister has spoken at length on the importance of a comprehensive health strategy for women. As a former chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women it is very clear that women's health needs have not received the priority they deserve. The Commission on the Status of Women in its report stated this also. We should be very clear about this issue. As the Commission report said, women, especially those with dependent children, bear the major brunt of the effects of unemployment and poverty and responsibility for caring for the disabled and the elderly. Consequently women themselves are more likely to rank among the sick and in general to be more dependent on the health services. It is critical, therefore, that any health service should take into account women's specific needs. Women themselves are inclined to put their health second to that of their partner, spouse or family. There <Col N="666" /> is silence on issues such as hysterectomies, breast cancer, miscarriage, still births, births of disabled children and gynaecological problems. I am delighted the silence has been broken and women are no longer silently coping with the effects of these illnesses. There is now more discussion. The right things are being said about women's health and the focus is on a national strategy for their health. Words and plans are one thing but delivery of the service is another. The delivery of breast cancer treatment is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>This motion calls for treatment and for cancer screening and for mammography to be available to women in a particular age group. I fully support that call. I noted that the Minister did not say he would prioritise the issue when the results of the pilot project become available. If I read it correctly, the Minister said he would see what action needed to be taken. Did the early results from the project indicate clearly that mammography screening services should be developed on a nationwide basis? If that is the case that is what should be delivered. Mammography developed to a high standard with staff appropriately trained and with the appropriate machinery is an essential part of providing appropriate healthcare for women. Breast cancer is a disease striking women out of the blue, and, despite the greater information available on the success of certain treatment arousing upset and fear in individuals and in families. Will the Minister prioritise within the health services any service that can identify the women at risk at an early stage in order to improve their chances of successful treatment. There is a danger that individual problems could get lost in the broadly based national health strategy. There is no doubt that the service for the treatment of breast cancer is disgracefully underfunded and appallingly under developed. Anyone who develops breast cancer needs to be diagnosed quickly with ready access to treatment and the availability of a multi-disciplinary team to treat the condition. The professionals say that the service is far from satisfactory. May I remind the Minister <Col N="667" /> also that St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin operates a breast cancer treatment clinic on Fridays only, at which 120 patients are seen each week and over 1,200 patients annually? The waiting time is far too long and capacity is exceeded. A senior surgeon has said that many women who are operated on receive little support from the services with which they come in contact because of lack of resources. This should not be allowed to continue and I ask the Minister to address it as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It is critical that there should be teams of specially trained staff at a number of centres throughout the country to deal with breast cancer patients. If we are to develop a screening programme it should not be based on the provision of mammograms alone which can miss up to 10 per cent of tumours; high quality clinical services should also be available to women. I have outlined already the preventive measures that must be taken. There is also a need for extensive research into women's health.</P>
    <P>It is worth repeating that this is the most critical disease affecting women in Europe. More than 250,000 European women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year and in the European Union alone more than 52,000 women die from the disease. One out of every 12 European women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. These are startling statistics and there should be an appropriate response. Europa Donna, the European women's movement against breast cancer, states that all health authorities should promote targeted screening programmes for breast cancer, ensure that adequate mammogram facilities are available to minimise waiting time and active breast treatment centres of excellence in areas where facilities do not exist.</P>
    <P>The second part of this motion calls for a comprehensive scheme to identify, counsel and treat all women and their families suffering from the hepatitis C virus and the antibodies arising from the Anti D immunoglobulin treatment from 1970 to 1994. This is probably the most <Col N="668" /> serious health problem to face hundreds of Irish women. It is important that they should have access to information and treatment and receive the response they need for the health service. I call on the Minister to finance the groups which are trying to develop a self-help network for women. My colleagues have highlighted the problems which many of these women are experiencing in obtaining information.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I appeal to the Minister to allay the fears of those women who have tested positive to hepatitis C. Less than 15 minutes ago I spoke to a woman who has a fear of the unknown. While Pelican House is providing a marvellous service there is a lack of counselling services throughout the country. This woman informed me, like the meitheal of long ago, that women are now advising others in groups. This could be dangerous because they are at different stages. I appeal to the Minister to help these women who are living in fear and need advice and counselling. They should not have to come to Dublin to avail of these services.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for tabling an amendment to this motion. He has set the standard for the health service for the foreseeable future by his commitment to provide a comprehensive health service. We in Ireland demand and expect a service that is second to none. It is only when we go abroad that we appreciate what we have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the strategy he launched recently the Minister laid down guidelines, which many members of this House have called for, on important matters such as education, health and infrastructure. It has often been said that if we do not have our health, we have nothing. In many <Col N="669" /> households women have put their own welfare at risk in favour of other members of the family, usually children who are given priority. It is time that these women put their needs to the forefront and the Minister gave them the status they deserve.</P>
    <P>The provision of the new Tallaght hospital will enable us to provide a more comprehensive service in an area in which a large number of young women reside. As the Minister indicated in launching his comprehensive plan, it is far more important to prevent disease. While it is important to provide essential services, we must shift resources to teach people how to remain healthy rather than spend large sums on curing them.</P>
    <P>It is noticeable, unfortunately, that more women are now smoking. Whereas in the past men were the greatest offenders, it is strange to see so many young women smoking knowing the effect that this may have on their health. A no-smoking campaign should form part of a major plan with a screening programme for breast cancer.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the purpose of the strategy he has launched is to ensure that women's health needs are identified and planned for in a comprehensive way; to ensure that women receive the health and welfare services they need at the right time and in a way which respects their dignity and individuality, with ease of access and continuity of care; to promote greater consultation with women about their health and welfare needs at national, regional and local levels. I congratulate the Minister for making provision for further health centres in my constituency which will enable women to gain access to the information and services they need. The Minister also said that there was a need to promote within the health service greater participation by women both in senior positions and at the representative level.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the way he handled the hepatitis C scare. He deserves to be congratulated, especially by Deputies in Dublin and particularly in Dublin South-West in which a large <Col N="670" /> number of young women reside. Anyone I spoke to was extremely complementary about the efficiency with which the Blood Tranfusion Service Board dealt with this matter. Women were faced with great uncertainty and worry, but the manner in which the Minister put the plan into operation ensured the speediest possible response and assurances at an early stage that, in many cases, people had nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the area of preventive medicine. Often information does not filter down to where it is most needed, particularly in poorer communities. What we need is people who are available during the day at as local level as possible, including community centre, to speak to people about their difficulties. Access to information will give people what is their right, the right to information and a decent health service. I am certain the Minister will do this in his comprehensive plans for the health service and I wish him well.</P>

      <P>Shortly after taking office the Minister for Health set himself the task of drawing up a comprehensive health strategy. He assured us that it would have a clearly stated philosophy and unequivocal objectives and targets, including the necessary legislative measures to back these up. The Minister has now produced a health strategy which has been warmly received by all those delivering the health service, by the consumer, the public and commentators.</P>
      <P>This document sets out three clear principles which underpin the strategy. They are equity, quality of service and accountability. The strategy also sets out explicit objective targets, particularly in the areas of health promotion and prevention. The document also has a section dealing specifically with women's health in which the Government undertakes to publish a plan for women's health to be implemented over the next four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present women's health services are not delivered in a co-ordinated way. There are separate maternity and gynaecology services, separate family planning <Col N="671" /> services, mammography, cervical screening and welfare services. There is no framework to provide a unified service to women. What is required is a policy based on a comprehensive view of women and on the issues that affect their health. To this end the Department of Health is preparing a discussion document on women's health and the Minister has undertaken to publish this document during the current year. Comments will be invited from all interested parties and it will take account of the recommendations made by the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>In advance of the plan, some of the major elements underlying Government policy on women's health services have been set out in the health strategy. The objectives will include ensuring that women's health needs are identified and planned in a comprehensive way; ensuring that women receive the health and welfare services they need at the right time and in a way that respects their dignity and individuality; promoting greater consultation with women about their health and welfare needs &mdash; this must be done at national, regional and local levels; and promoting within the health services a greater participation by women both in the more senior positions and at the representatives levels.</P>
    <P>The document also sets out details of the cervical smear testing which is currently taking place. In regard to screening for breast cancer, the Government has undertaken to make a decision on the setting up of a national screening service as soon as the findings from the present study of the Mater Hospital Foundation have been evaluated. Screening for breast cancer has been a much debated and controversial issue in Ireland for some years now. Although there has been pressure to institute a national breast screening programme, there has also been vigorous criticism of mammographic screening in both the medical and lay press. In 1988 the Mater Hospital Foundation, assisted by European funding, set up the first breast screening clinic. During the setting up of this clinic a <Col N="672" /> number of areas were identified as needing specific attention and much valuable experience was gained in different areas. The main organisational problems that had to be tackled before screening could begin were the appointment and training of staff, the construction of a custom-built mobile screening unit, the equipping of both static and mobile units and the compilation of a population register.</P>
    <P>A major question relating to screening for breast cancer is the feasibility of developing a national programme. This is primarily a political issue and I believe the current Minister will not be found wanting in this respect. Such a screening programme cannot proceed without evidence regarding the effectiveness of screening or information about the logistics of mounting such a programme. The Eccles programme has been set up to address both these issues. The definitive answer to the former will only become available after many years of follow up. Meanwhile, valuable information is being gathered on the latter. Overall, the performance of the Eccles breast screening programme has been satisfactory. Technical excellence has been achieved and provides the standard for an extended programme. A higher compliance might have been achieved with a more comprehensive population register. An extension of this programme should, therefore, first address the issue of improved demographic information for the targeted population.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be commended for the speed with which he introduced the Anti D screening programme. Everything possible is being done to ensure that adequate screening, counselling and treatment is made available to all women who received the Anti D product between 1970 and 1994. Arrangements have been made so that women can attend either their own general practitioners, who will send on the blood samples to be tested, or specially designated clinics. Three tests are carried out on all samples of blood. They are the Elisa test done by the Blood Transfusion Service Board Board, the RIBA test which is done by the Virus Reference <Col N="673" /> Laboratory at UCD and the PCR test &mdash; although technology is not available here to carry out the volume of tests involved, these are sent to an accredited laboratory in Edinburgh.</P>
    <P>If diagnosed positive after all three tests the patient is sent to hospital, and there are four named hospitals for them to attend in Dublin, one in Galway and one in Cork, each with special consultant-staffed clinics. The Blood Transfusion Service Board estimate that 60,000 women received the Anti D product. To date 50,000 have been screened. Around 900 have tested positive on the second test but could well be negative on the third test. These results take longer because they re-test to make sure that people get the right result first time. Counselling by medical counsellors is provided by the Blood Transfusion Service Board at a number of centres throughout the country and further counselling is provided if tests are confirmed positive.</P>
    <P>The Minister's commitment to providing an equitable and efficient health service is clearly shown in his health strategy. The issue of breast screening is most certainly being taken seriously and, in regard to the Anti D problem the Minister has behaved in a commendable way. I commend the motion, as amended, to the House.</P>

      <P>As I am sharing my time with Deputy Lawlor I will refer only to the breast screening service and the position in regard to the incidence of hepatitis C. I thank both Labour Party speakers for sharing their time with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure all Deputies received correspondence from ICA guilds throughout the country outlining that organisation's concern for a national screening service for breast cancer. According to that organisation &mdash; members of which have told me its statistics are based on Eurostat information &mdash; a total of 660 women died here last year from breast cancer, more than in any other EU country. While there is much more awareness about the need for early diagnosis of breast cancer and the positive results which can be <Col N="674" /> achieved even following radical surgery, some experts in the medical field in the United States believe that ageism has crept into information programmes and that people could be forgiven for believing that breast cancer is something which is more likely to affect young women. It is chilling to note that the most common form of cancer among women between the ages of 50 and 64 years is breast cancer.</P>
    <P>In a recent speech the EU Commissioner for Social Affairs, Pádraig Flynn, predicted that cancer deaths could rise dramatically &mdash; perhaps up to 15 per cent &mdash; in the next number of years. The Joint Committee on Women's Rights recently devoted an entire meeting &mdash; which was attended by experts in the field, including Professor O'Higgins &mdash; to the high incidence of breast cancer here. I urge the Minister and his Department to capitalise on available medical information by setting up an appropriate health programme for women in this regard. I understand that is the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>While commending the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the Minister for their calm approach in addressing the current Anti D screening process, I must point out that many women in that risk category are extremely concerned. Women in my constituency have voiced their fears which they readily admit are due to a lack of knowledge on the subject and they underline the fact that they are unable to get further information about hepatitis C either from their doctors or counsellors in their areas.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that this virus was identified only in 1989 and that very little is known about the natural history of the condition. I also recognise and accept that the medical profession does not wish to be rushed into giving erroneous information as to what we can expect from the virus. Delays, however, in testing and disseminating information is causing a great deal of psychological distress. Providing a telephone help line is not enough to allay anxiety. I understand from professionals in this area that some women <Col N="675" /> have telephoned up to 20 times each seeking assurances and that out of the number already tested, 893 have either proved positive or indeterminate.</P>
    <P>We are pleased that there are six hospitals dealing specifically with the problem of hepatitis C, four in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway and that in each hospital specialist staff are providing a sensitive service. We also recognise the important role played by GPs in disseminating information and counselling patients in regard to hepatitis C. However, coming from a rural constituency I am aware of the great difficulties facing many women in isolated areas. They believe there is great need for counselling in rural areas and this is reflected in the large numbers who have contacted me. Obviously, the psychological effects of this are very pronounced.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister's comments in regard to the financial aspects of the incidence of hepatitis C. Many women living in rural areas have to travel long distances to be tested. For example, concerned women in County Clare have to travel to Limerick or further afield for medical tests and counselling. I am also aware that in some instances there have been delays in carrying out biopsies which cause great stress not only for the woman involved but her family, especially children who may be at risk. Those at risk believe there is too much emphasis on the year 1977 and that information should be extended to 1994.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis C is an infectious disease. This adds to the psychological concerns and implies a need for confidentiality and privacy. I hope home visits by nurses can be arranged to give the necessary treatment to those who test positive. I will be interested to hear the Minister's remarks in regard to medical insurance and whether he foresees any difficulties in obtaining such insurance in the future. What will be the position for women who prove positive with hepatitis C and wish to take out medical insurance with the VHI in the future?</P>

      <P>The general consensus since the Minister, Deputy Howlin, took office is that he has been competent, effective and efficient in dealing with the complex and sensitive issues that arise in his Department. Many people look to the Minister for Health for reassurance that the health services will improve.</P>
      <P>I wish to address some anomalies in regard to my constituency which is unique in some respects. I represent two new satellite towns on the outskirts of Dublin with a population approaching 100,000. The Tallaght hospital which is under construction will provide health care facilities for a large population and is a welcome step in the right direction. As the project is at the construction stage those services are still out of reach and many young housewives with young children living in north Clondalkin and west Blanchardstown who do not have their own transport must take a tortuous route to reach the services and facilities they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the lack of clarity about the focus or direction of the services. I hope that will be addressed. It is relevant that in his speech he constructively criticised the lack of appropriate links. That matter needs positive and urgent attention from the Minister and the health boards to ensure that a comprehensive range of services is provided in a cost effective and efficient manner. That is a matter of serious concern in unemployment blackspots where there is a high level of crime and associated social problems. The capacity of the medical profession and the Eastern Health Board to support general medical practitioners is lacking because that area is not a lucrative or an attractive one in which to set up facilities. Special consideration should be given to providing facilities for young doctors to set up a comprehensive medical service under the GMS scheme, in areas such as north Clondalkin where the financial capacity of its population of 20,000 to 25,000 has been affected by unemployment, to allow those areas cope with severe growing pains and provide young housewives and mothers-to-be with easy access to <Col N="677" /> regular GP services which most of us take for granted. I have met groups of doctors trying to provide a service in those areas who have highlighted this problem. The Minister referred to the issues of equity, quality, service and accountability but they are not adequately addressed in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to improving screening facilities and preventative medicine to facilitate early diagnosis of breast cancer and other complaints that may lead to serious illnesses or may be fatal. I listened to Senator Henry, an expert in that field, speak in the Seanad and she made positive recommendations for improvements in this area. No issue is more emotive or crucial in a community than the provision of a comprehensive range of health services.</P>
    <P>Staff in the Eastern Health Board centres in parts of my consistuency have a heavy workload and consideration should be given to fine tuning resources. Services and facilities should be provided in areas of greatest need. While we can build a regional hospital in Tallaght to serve a catchment area of south west Dublin with a population of 0.5 million, small can be beautiful in that the local health clinics could provide many routine tests and services and would save young mothers with small children unnecessary journeys to a general hospital. Dublin, with a rapidly growing population, requires additional services. I urge the Minister to proceed with this work and ensure the sentiments he expressed are given practical effect and implemented in policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Wednesday the Minister referred to the national health strategy launched recently with a great fanfare. I am sure he will recall that the proposal for that strategy arose during discussions with Democratic Left before the formation of this Government when Deputy Rabbitte, Mr. Des Geraghty and the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, negotiated on a common platform. We urged that a national health strategy should be put in place underpinned by legislation, and we were pleased that the <Col N="678" /> idea survived later negotiations with Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>We in Democratic Left believed it was so important that we drew up our own national health strategy. At our conference last October a number of eminent speakers debated this topic and reached the conclusion that poverty and unemployment have a major impact on people's health status and that tackling those fundamental issues will bring about an improvement in the population's health status. Not only are the major killer diseases more commonly suffered by poorer people but in recent years the gap between the expectation of life of the rich and the poor has widened further. The most recent issue of the <i>British Medical Times</i> points that out in stark terms. It is not only the relative difference between rich and poor that affects mobidity and mortality. There is a fall in mortality rates among, in particular, poor males in the 40 to 65 age group, independent of factors such as AIDS or drug use, and this is related specifically to poverty and unemployment. That trend is significant. Although research in this area in Ireland is patchy, the trend of a fall in mortality rates among the poor in real rather than relative terms in Britain is reflected here because of the division and disparity of income. That trend is exacerbated here because those people in the greatest need of access to treatment are denied it because they are poor. An inverse care law exists, particularly in the area of hospital care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the key issue facing the Minister for Health. He referred to the central issue of equality in the national health strategy, but the document he produced is a great disappointment as it does not contain the radical shift in health provisions necessary to deal with these major inequities. It includes slavish concessions to private health care which will only serve to bolster the division in the future. It simply does not do the business. It does not deal with the issue of access to treatment in a realistic way or tackle the inequalities inherent in our health service but slides over them. It is full of clichés, aspirations and feel good statements that <Col N="679" /> do not provide a framework for altering the inherently unjust basis of much of our health care provision. Some aspects of the provision address the issue of inequality, particularly at primary care level, but that is not the case throughout the system. The fact that the health strategy document did not upset anybody should sound alarm bells as it is an indication that the real issues have been circumvented rather than tackled head on.</P>
    <P>I carried out a survey of hospitals in regard to an appointment for a child to see an ENT specialist. The earliest an appointment could be secured for a child whose parents were medical card holders from a poor background or unemployed was 12 months unless in the case of an emergency. An appointment can be secured in the Blackrock Clinic in two weeks for a child born to rich parents. That example highlights the disparity which has not been tackled in this strategy. It could be dealt with in a comprehensive strategy.</P>
    <P>There are other issues relating to the strategy that were avoided. For example, no account was taken of the number of consultants, of whom there are too few. The Tierney report investigated this area of health care and put forward sound proposals about maximising the number of consultants so that we would have a consultant-provided service rather than a consultant-driven service. That matter will have to be dealt with. Separate waiting lists must also be considered if people are to have access to the care they need.</P>
    <P>Local accountability is referred to in the strategy, but to whom will there be accountability? If health boards are to be truly reflective of people's needs &mdash; the population at large must have an input into the way we devise our health programme &mdash; they must be directly and locally elected. Changing the name of the Eastern Health Board will not necessarily result in an authority that is open to people's needs. It is not fair to expect that because that board covers such a huge population.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell too long on the strategy because the issues under discussion <Col N="680" /> relate to breast cancer and hepatitis C, but I am putting it in context, as does the Minister in his amendment. I do not agree with the comfortable consensus that the strategy holds the solution or is the way forward in meeting the aspirations outlined. The strategy is full of aspirations. It will certainly ensure that many managers in the health system sleep easier in their beds because it is about managerial reform. I have no problem with that, but it is not really a strategy. The Minister misunderstands the purpose of a health strategy if he thinks managerial reform will make a fundamental difference. I would have expected more from a Minister for Health who would describe himself as a social democrat.</P>
    <P>The impact of poverty and unemployment on health is very severe. At the end of this Government's term of office those issues will be the yardstick by which its record will be judged. The Minister for Health's record will stand or fall on those measures, not on the aspirations set out in the health strategy but on how those aspirations were met, how the mortality rates for the rich and the poor compare and whether the strategy has improved the lives of those at present denied an equal chance.</P>
    <P>A report in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> clearly states that not just in relative terms but in certain categories in the poorest wards the level of mortality in Britain was reduced. The authors of various studies conclude that public health is strongly linked with material conditions rather than individual behaviour. However, those conditions are not centre stage in this strategy. It is all very well to talk about individual behaviour, but we all know that it is the better off who have their children vaccinated, who give up smoking, keep fit and can afford to do all the things to help you live longer and feel better. We must focus on the poor and target resources in their direction to ensure equity. It takes more muscle and nerve to take on that challenge than is evident in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>On cardiovascular disease, the report states that an unemployed middle aged <Col N="681" /> man is twice as likely to get a heart attack than is a middle class middle aged man. There is no point lecturing about improving your diet if you have not the means to pay for better quality food.</P>
    <P>I had to closely examine the strategy to find any mention of suicide. Suicide is directly related to class. Nobody can deny that suicide is on the increase in Ireland. The level of suicide can be reduced and the strategy should set a target in this area. It should also set a target for reducing the number of teenage pregnancies.</P>
    <P>There is a weak response to breast cancer and breast cancer screening. There is no perfect system of treating any disease, but there are measures that make a difference. There is sufficient clinical evidence to confirm that breast cancer screening for women over 50 years and under 69 years is a worthwhile exercise and can save lives. Breast cancer kills more Irish women every year than car accidents. Every year of inaction by the Minister means the deaths of more Irish women which is a great loss to individual families and to communities. In south Wicklow there was a tragic litany of deaths from breast cancer: in one small area eight women died of breast cancer. This has a very damaging effect on a community. That trend is evident across the country where women, many of whose lives could be saved, are dying. We have an option to combat this disease and the Minister is responsible in this regard. The director of the National Breast Cancer Research Institute recently stated that between 200 and 300 lives per year could be saved with a proper national screening programme. A population register would be required, as would high quality technology, but are women's lives not important enough to provide such a system?</P>
    <P>The Minister is dragging out this issue by stating that he is waiting for the Eccles programme. Meanwhile women are dying while the need for services is increasing. One only has to talk to a daffodil nurse to realise the enormity of their task and the increase in their workload. There is a huge demand on the services of St. Vincent's Hospital dedicated <Col N="682" /> breast unit. Perhaps the publicity surrounding breast cancer has resulted in more women coming forward, and if that is so it is a very welcome development. There has been a tendency for Irish women who suspect they have breast cancer to present themselves to their doctors when it is too late.</P>
    <P>I commend the ICA on its national campaign in this regard. Like other Deputies, I received much correspondence from that association. These ordinary women are making breast cancer a political issue. We are not alone in this movement; there is a movement across Europe to make breast cancer a political issue. Too many women have died in the shadows and it is unacceptable for us to simply say that we will wait. A start must be made on the national screening programme for women over 50 years of age. There must also be additional funding and staffing for dedicated units around the country. This will cost money; nobody is saying otherwise but we are talking about a major disease that is spreading. The figures indicate a steady increase in the rate of breast cancer and that is most worrying. We are not even at the stage where the disease has reached a plateau. Professor O'Higgins of St. Vincent's Hospital stated in a newspaper article:</P>
    <P>It is not just about women getting access to mammograms but about any woman who has a breast condition getting access to a clinic where they can have appropriate examination, support and counselling. There should be a proper and respectful service of care for women in this country and we are very short of that at the moment.</P>
    <P>If we can provide what Professor O'Higgins has described we will be taking a major step towards the improvement of women's health.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister had a problem on his hands when the matter of hepatitis C arose. He had to make decisions swiftly and set up a programme that involved major screening around the country. I am not satisfied that his <Col N="683" /> approach was fully correct. Engaging in a media campaign without providing proper notification to doctors around the country added to the anxiety and distress experienced by women. The Minister should have given the representative bodies such as the IMO and the Irish College of General Practitioners a warning about what was going to happen because some doctors were simply not equipped to deal with what was a bombshell landing in their surgeries. They had no details or information on a condition which was very new.</P>
    <P>The second problem that has arisen from the particular strategy adopted by the Minister in relation to hepatitis C is that approximately 11,000 women have not yet come forward for screening. We must find those women although there is no clear indication how many of those women are easily found and how many have gone abroad or, perhaps, have died. A sizeable minority who have not yet come forward for screening should be brought into the net.</P>
    <P>A huge question lies over the expansion of the scheme. I am aware of some men whose cases that have been highlighted by this testing and who never had the Anti D injection. I would like to know what expansion plans the Minister has to bring in those other people who may be at risk from hepatitis C. I appreciate they may be a minority but it is important to note that hepatitis C is more aggressive in men, and men who may have this latent condition should be screened in order to obtain treatment. They should also be advised about the dangers of alcohol intake. Those who had transfusions or other blood products should be easily traced through the Blood transfusion Service Board. This would ensure that everybody with hepatitis C &mdash; and we have already seen that there is quite a number of them &mdash; receives the appropriate treatment free. I have already received complaints from people who had to go to community welfare officers to obtain money to cover these costs. It is not satisfactory for women to have to <Col N="684" /> go through community welfare officers to obtain money for ancillary costs that may arise.</P>
    <P>A full report must be forthcoming as to why there were delays in setting up a screening programme and testing between the period when the Blood Transfusion Service Board first alerted the Minister in 1989 and the commencement of testing in 1991 and, indeed, the final introduction of proper testing procedures in 1994. I appreciate that this problem came out of the blue to some extent but it must be remembered that there were certain signals in this regard.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a debate on the national health strategy. I realise such a debate is due to take place tomorrow in the Seanad but we in this House must seriously examine the optics of the health strategy and ensure that it meets the requirements of those most in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past few weeks we have heard much about the Minister's programme for a healthier future. Much of the Minister's strategy for effective health care involved the clever pulling together of existing programmes with some new elements and, as Deputy McManus described, many aspirations. This is all very fine and I wish the Minister every success with this programme.</P>
      <P>Over the past few weeks also we have had another suggested programme for shaping a healthier future. This came from the Irish Countrywomen's Association guilds in Sligo-Leitrim and around the country. By contrast with what the Minister has to offer this was something immediate and absolutely specific, a programme that would not just produce a healthier future but also save lives. The number of lives that might be saved could almost be quantified from existing statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICA are seeking a national cancer <Col N="685" /> screening programme for all women in the high risk group, namely, 50 to 64 years of age. The motion in the names of my colleagues, Deputy Durkan and Deputy Ahearn, requests that the programme be put into operation. I expected the Minister for Health to come into this House and announce that he would be accepting the demand for national screening of the high risk group that is being made by the ICA. This could be done almost immediately but instead of an undertaking or some sort of promise, all we heard from the Minister was waffle. He covered up the fact that he either could not or would not deliver the funds for this purpose. I accept his waffle was well worded but it contained no substance whatsoever. There was no acceptance of the central demand of this motion or of the demand of the ICA.</P>
    <P>The Minister fobbed us off with the information that pilot schemes are being carried out at present. Pilot schemes are necessary, on occasion, but not in this case. In 1992, 650 women died of breast cancer, many of whom were in the high risk age group. The facts are there and, as Deputy McManus said, we cannot afford to wait. People are dying and we can almost quantify the number of lives that could be saved.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well point out the facilities for screening that already exist but it is not simply a question of availability; there is much more to this problem than that. Leaving aside the question of costs, which is a consideration, the atmosphere must be created to encourage all women in the high risk group to be screened. This can best be done through a national screening programme where women, when they reach a particular age, are routinely screened for breast cancer. That should be the Minister's objective and he should provide the facilities for this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said in response to Dáil questions that studies carried out abroad suggest that well organised screening programmes can reduce death from breast cancer in women aged 50 years and over by 25 per cent to 30 per cent among the screened population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> In the face of such statistics, is it necessary to advance further arguments as to why national screening for breast cancer should be introduced immediately? I welcome the Minister's programme for a healthier future. However, this is something we could do immediately which will save lives and prevent tragedy in many families as well as reduce fear, anxiety and suffering. I find it difficult to understand how he could have a study for effective health care in the 1990s without introducing national screening for breast cancer. The Minister said that studies show deaths in women aged 50 years or over can be reduced by 25 to 30 per cent. There are few other health programmes about which any such claim could be made. Let us have national screening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 100 lives could be saved each year through the introduction of national screening. It is essential that support structures in the form of counselling for women undergoing examination for breast cancer should be provided. Almost every woman who shows symptoms of breast cancer fears she has contracted the disease. There is urgent need for clinics to deal efficiently and sympathetically with women who fear the worst.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer is the most common cause of death in young women aged between 25 and 34 years. It is a killer disease. In the context of the debate on the Minister's strategy, positive steps must be taken to initiative a campaign on the issue. Every year 1,250 new cases are diagnosed and 650 women die annually from the disease. The primary cause is unknown but in view of the high incidence in western countries people look to diet, environment, different child birth patterns and lifestyles as perhaps providing answers. In 1985 one woman in 11 in the Unites States contracted breast cancer. Within two years it was one in ten and in 1991 it was one in nine. The trend in this country is similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had a proper and effective screening programme up to 100 lives could be saved each year. We must at all times act <Col N="687" /> in the belief that the earlier the disease is diagnosed the more likely it is that treatment can be effective. An educational campaign must be undertaken among women's groups and special interest groups as well as involving members of the public. A national programme of seminars, conferences, lectures, courses, booklets, displays and videos should be established with the cooperation and active participation of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that in the course of this debate the Minister for Health, in the week in which his health strategy was related in expensive, glossy, snazzy documentation and distributed throughout the country, refused to sanction the introduction of a national breast screening service. That in the context of what Deputy Nealon stated about a reply to a Parliamentary Question is an indication of an element of hypocrisy that I would not like to attach to the Minister for Health. The Minister of State has an opportunity to rebut what I said. Since we are dealing with a killer disease and the saving of life the Government's response must be a little more positive. Time is not on our side. We are sitting on a time bomb. This matter appertains not only to women but to the nation as a whole and urgent action is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my party colleagues for their constructive support for the motion and I thank all Members for their contributions. I pay tribute to the ICA who focused public attention on the issue of breast cancer in a real, progressive and incisive way. I thank those members of the association in my constituency, those who corresponded with my colleagues and others throughout the country. I acknowledge the assistance and support I received from the women and their spouses in my constituency who are potential hepatitis C patients and also others who contacted my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot describe my disappointment at the Minister's response to this motion last Wednesday. Deputy Nealon referred to it as a load of waffle. That was an <Col N="688" /> understatement. It did not address the motion before the House. It showed scant regard for the concerns of women in relation to breast cancer or hepatitis C. The Minister was more concerned about furthering his health strategy programme which was published a few days beforehand. His reply to the debate was nothing more than what was contained in the document and, in relation to hepatitis C, was nothing more than the longwinded replies to parliamentary questions which he gave over the last month. I expected to hear something new.</P>
    <P>Despite all the protestations, I have come to the conclusion that the Minister is more concerned about his own public image than about how quickly he can react to an emergency. I am worried about the number of times I heard members of the Government parties say tonight that he is the best Minister since the foundation of the State. It is a little too early in the day to hold such notions. I am sure former Ministers, including some from his own party, are not impressed.</P>
    <P>On page 55 of the health strategy document it is stated that the Department of Health is preparing a discussion document on women's health which takes account of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women. This discussion document will be published in 1994 and comments will be invited on it. The Government's plan for women's health will then be put in place. In advance of the plan some major elements underlying Government policy in women's health services are set out. The objectives include the following: to ensure that women's health needs are identified and planned in a comprehensive way; to ensure that women receive the health and welfare services they need at the right time and in a way which respects their dignity and individuality. They must have ease of access to and continuity of care. Another objective is to promote greater consultation with women about their health and welfare needs. This must be done at a national, regional and local level. I suggest that now is as good a time as any <Col N="689" /> to put these proposals into operation. I expected further time to elapse before the Minister hedged on an issue such as this.</P>
    <P>We are talking about two serious issues both of which need immediate attention. We are aware of the divided medical opinion on the mammography issue and have listened with great care and attention to the debate but women are concerned and have suggested a way of doing something about breast cancer. The Minister's response last Wednesday to the plea from the women of Ireland was a disgrace.</P>
    <P>I am sure that all those affected by hepatitis C and those concerned about their future health would have welcomed information on the matter. All Members of this House, the infected women and the thousands of women who are more than a little concerned about their health would have liked the Minister to have given more information on the steps he proposes to take. There has been a veil of silence over the proposals. Responsibility for this problem was hived off into other areas as quickly as possible so that no one could point a finger at the Department or the Minister. This is not the type of response people want. The Minister should reassess the issue and recognise the concerns of women who have been &mdash; or are likely to be &mdash; infected with hepatitis C. The very least he should do is make a realistic response to this issue and get away from the nonsense of hoping that these unfortunate women will have the time and energy to travel to centres in the different areas referred to by him.</P>
    <P>I thought at this stage that the Minister and his advisers, of whom he has plenty, would have copped on and recognised that counselling is an important element of the treatment required. There is no counselling available simply because counsellors do not have any information. Several people concerned about this issue have had to get information from other countries: people in my constituency have done this and I have had access to the information. Why has the same information not been made available <Col N="690" /> here? Why has the Minister not accepted that these women are genuinely concerned about their health and that of their families?</P>
    <P>I thought we might have heard more from the Government benches than a rehash of the contents of this famous yellow book and the points made by the Minister in the House over the past two months. This response does not satisfy Opposition Deputies or reflect the seriousness of the issue. At a time when so much emphasis is placed on health in general and on women's health in particular the Minister should have thought it worthwhile to work out the best way to deal with the problem from the point of view of the patients. One of the flaws is that the problem has been dealt with in the best way from the point of view of the Minister and his Department &mdash;&ldquo;keep it as far away from us for as long as possible, pretend it does not exist and hopefully it will go away&rdquo;. Problems cannot be dealt with in this way.</P>
    <P>I want to contrast the Minister's response to this problem with his record as an Opposition Deputy during the debate on haemophiliacs when he correctly laid responsibility for dealing with the matter at the door of the then Minister. It is amazing the changes a few years can bring. The Minister now seems to be adopting a much more laid back attitude to people's health, that this issue is not as important as he thought it was when in Opposition. The issue is every bit as important now as it was then.</P>
    <P>It is important to re-emphasise that the hepatitis C problem arose because women followed an agreed and approved procedure. The Minister suggested that this procedure gave women an opportunity to have babies and that perhaps in some way this was the result. These women were following a fully approved procedure which went wrong despite repeated assurances.</P>
    <P>Apart from a broad statement that the treatment would initially be paid for by the State, the Minister made little reference to the type of treatment necessary, the method of treatment and who would foot the bill. It is about time, some <Col N="691" /> two and a half months later, that the Department re-examined the problem, ascertained whether the VHI would be willing to offer cover and the way in which patients will be affected if they seek insurance and outlined the extent of its involvement.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McManus said, this matter came to light very suddenly in the media last February but the Department of Health and the Blood Transfusion Service Board had known for some years that a problem of this nature would arise; this was intimated to the Department of Health some years ago. It is not true that the Minister had to suddenly put in place procedures to deal with the problem. The Department had ample time to deal with the problem but no plans were put into operation.</P>
    <P>It was insulting to Members of this House and women for the Minister to spend so much time eulogising his document when he should have been addressing the motion. The same applies to the other members of the Government who spoke. When Opposition Deputies have the tenacity to put down a motion of this kind then the Minister should at least have the courage to respond directly to it.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined some of the measures which should be taken by the Minister. On the question of breast cancer, he should support the motion. Government backbenchers prepared to show initiative might be prepared to support this motion instead of the woolly Government amendment which congratulates the Minister for something he has not done. On the question of the treatment for hepatitis C, the Minister <Col N="692" /> should, as a matter of urgency, put in place procedures which will reassure women about the method of treatment, the costs involved, the way in which insurance is likely to be dealt with in the future and the type of counselling to be made available. Notwithstanding all that has been said by Government Deputies, the level of counselling available at present is deplorable. The Minister should get off the fence, stop pretending that this problem does not exist and deal with it. If he does this he will be doing himself and everyone else a favour.</P>
    <P>This motion was timely in the sense that it gave the Minister an opportunity to respond positively to this problem. The eyes of everyone were focused on the Minister following the publication of his health strategy policy. It is recognised that this is the ideal time for the Minister to take the initiative and reassure women who are concerned about this problem. However, he has failed to grasp this opportunity. Does he not attach sufficient importance to this issue or does he know that he does not have anything to fear from the Opposition because of the large Government majority? That may well be the case but I want to point out that those who sat on the Government benches during the past 75 years ultimately found their way to these benches.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Development of Trustee Savings Bank.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing this matter to be debated twice in one <Col N="695" /> week by way of Adjournment Debate. On the last occasion this matter was raised, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, said they were not aware of any proposal even though it was currently being referred to in the media. On Friday last we were told that the National Irish Bank and the Trustee Savings Bank reached provisional agreement on a merger which was seeking Government approval.</P>
      <P>In the short time available I ask the Minister to respond to a number of my points. It is not conceivable that the Minister or anyone in his Department would not know these discussions were taking place; if he did not know, he should have known. Let us look at it from Trustee Savings Bank's point of view. If they were doing this deal and if it had to be ratified by the Minister surely it would be prudent to alert the Minister. A tacit green light was given to this project and now the Government are in a state of confusion. Can the Minister clarify when he first knew of this proposal, why the Government was not up to date and was taken by surprise by the whole measure? Will the future of the Trustee Savings Bank be reduced to a political football that amounts to a political virility test for the Labour Party because they are not getting their message through with the media? If that is the approach it is no way to run a State financial organisation. We must have a coherent policy, the Government must speak with one voice and must give a clear sense of direction as to the future of the Trustee Savings Bank both for their staff and the banking sector generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said repeatedly that I consider the proposal in the Programme for a partnership Government for a State bank, merging the three banks, to be daft. I have spoken with the management of the three banks and they all said they wanted equity to expand. If you put together three banks which are starved of equity who will put in the equity? The Minister is aware that in the case of Aer Lingus the taxpayer is starved of cash. We must <Col N="696" /> achieve certain criteria in the public interest. First, the sale must be conducted in an open and fair manner, anyone who wishes to bid must be free to do so, as happened with the Dublin Trustee Savings Bank in 1991 when Woodchester, Irish Life, Ulster Bank and the top bidder, National Irish Bank, tendered.</P>
    <P>Why should any interested party be refused the opportunity to bid for the Trustee Savings Bank? The first objective is that the taxpayer should get the maximum price. The second objective is that we must have the maximum level of competition. There is serious disquiet about a hidden cartel in the banking sector that charges become negotiable among top customers and that they have equivalent rates of lending margins, some of which have been increased recently. What we need is aggressive competition. State ownership does not guarantee that, it can only happen through dynamic and vibrant competition for additional market share. In my view that will not be achieved without the involvement of a major building society. That is the key, if we want real competition on a nationwide basis.</P>
    <P>The third objective is to secure in so far as possible the security of tenure of the 1,100 staff in the Trustee Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister come clean and tell us when he knew, and who else in Government knew? It is not credible that this could have gone on for eight months and no one in the Department of Finance knew about it. If that is true, it shows a breathtaking contempt for Government by the Trustee Savings Bank. I do not believe that to be the case. There are rumours to the effect that the Government is insisting that if the deal goes through they must take ICC as well, leaving the Government free to sell off ACC to Crédit Agricole. I would like to see those questions answered. Will the Minister set out clearly the Government's objectives and a unified policy so that our ideological baggage does not hinder us in dealing with this matter in an orderly way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The board of trustees of Trustee Savings Bank has asked me to authorise and effect the reorganisation of Trustee Savings Bank into an independent company pursuant to section 57 of the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989. In summary, the trustees have recommended to me that the assets, liabilities and business of Trustee Savings Bank be transferred into National Irish Bank Limited which is a subsidiary of National Australia Bank Limited. Under the provisions of section 57 (6) (b) of the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989, the proceeds of any sale or other disposal of the assets of Trustee Savings Bank accrue to the Exchequer. Having exercised due diligence, National Australia Bank has made a firm offer for Trustee Savings Bank. However, I am sure that the House will accept that commercial considerations dictate that the offer has to remain confidential for the moment. Also under section 57 of the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989, any proposal to reorganise the Trustee Savings Bank would have to be the subject of a ministerial order, a draft of which must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The recommendation by the board of trustees was made to me following detailed discussions between Trustee Savings Bank and National Australia Bank. I was not involved in these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me answer Deputy Yates's question. I believe I was the first member of Government to be made aware of this matter in a telephone call from Mr. Don Argus of National Australia Bank and Dr. Dermot Whelan of Trustee Savings Bank on Wednesday last. Both requested that they see me in due course. Mr. Whelan contacted me on Thursday night to present some of the documents and he presented more on Friday. That was the first contact with Government. The recommendation of the Board of Trustees was made following these discussions. The proposal we have received puts a very high priority on employment and I have been assured that staff <Col N="698" /> interests are being consulted. Together, National Irish Bank and Trustee Savings Bank would have total assets of £2,300 million and approximately 2,000 employees. On the basis of the detailed discussions that Trustee Savings Bank have had with National Australia Bank, the trustees have assured me that they are confident that together the two banks will provide enhanced employment opportunities for their staff. In recent years both Trustee Savings Bank and NIB have each demonstrated considerable ability to compete effectively in the personal banking sector and the trustees are confident that from this base the proposed merged bank would be well positioned to play a significant part in fostering the development of small and medium sized business in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Trustee savings banks were initially established in Ireland during the 19th century as societies to encourage thrift and to provide a secure means of saving within local communities. A process of consolidation by merger over many years culminated in the amalgamation of Cork and Limerick Savings Bank and Trustee Savings Bank Dublin to form TSB Bank in 1992.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware TSB Bank has no shareholders and therefore does not pay a dividend to the Exchequer or to anyone else. The Government does not appoint the trustees and the trustees have the function of managing TSB Bank on a day-to-day basis. Arising from this they also have a crucial role to play in the future development of their bank. As trustees they have a particular duty to their depositors and staff. In summary, TSB Bank is not a State bank in the same way that ICC and ACC are State banks. In the circumstances the trustees were within their legal rights to investigate the options available to them with a view to making proposals to Government on the future development of their bank. They have done nothing wrong in that regard. I have no problem with that approach, but I now have the task of ensuring that in my examination of these proposals the wider national <Col N="699" /> interest is fully taken into account. I can assure the House that this will be done.</P>
    <P>At today's meeting of the Government the recommendation of the trustees was given preliminary consideration. It was decided that as this is a very complex issue the Minister for Finance should consider the recommendation from the trustees in the context of Government policy on the banking and financial sectors and also in the context of emerging developments in the financial markets generally. When I have completed this examination I will report back to Government. The Government, having considered my report, and taking into account the options available, will then decide on the most appropriate response to the recommendation from the board of TSB Bank.</P>
    <P>At this point my main consideration is that any development that we approve should be consistent with the needs of the financial sector generally and with the development needs of the economy. In particular, I believe that any development we approve must give rise to a genuine increase in competition. We need a competitive banking system to encourage investment and job creation because like every other cost, banking costs have to compare favourably with what is available in competitor countries. We also need a banking system which is responsive to the needs of small and medium sized enterprises because it is only by encouraging these that we can hope to create the jobs that we so badly need.</P>
    <P>In the context of employment, I fully understand the concerns of the trustees regarding the future job security of the employees of TSB Bank and indeed I share these concerns. However, I also have to be concerned about employment in the overall banking and financial sector. In that context it is essential that our banking system becomes competitive enough to cope effectively with competition from banks located outside Ireland. Increasing competition within Europe means that Irish banks and financial institutions have to be <Col N="700" /> at least as competitive as their European counterparts if jobs in Ireland are to be protected. If they are not competitive business will be lost to banks located abroad and employment will be less than it would otherwise be. I intend to take whatever steps are available to me in the review to ensure that we have a competitive banking system.</P>
    <P>There has been much speculation about how the assets, liabilities and business of Trustee Savings Bank should be disposed of. I would say to the House that such speculation is premature. When I have examined the recommendation from the trustees of Trustee Savings Bank and the Government has had an opportunity to consider my report on it and the other options available, then I will be in a position to say what actions we need to take on foot of the Government's decisions. In the meantime speculation about what the Government might or might not decide serves no useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Let me assure Deputy Yates that my discussions with Trustee Savings Bank last week were joint discussions attended by members of the National Australia Bank who were able to answer the financial questions but not the general questions I put to them. Members who could answer strategic questions were not present. I hope to meet shortly with senior personnel from the National Australia Bank. I hope to be able to report back fully to Government on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for permitting me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The giant hogweed is probably the most dangerous plant growing in the country. Over the past six years <Col N="701" /> it has caused serious suffering and each summer literally hundreds of people, particularly children, suffer severe skin burns as a result of coming into contact with the giant hogweed. Many have to be hospitalised and are left with serious and lasting skin injuries.</P>
      <P>The giant hogweed is a tall wild plant resembling somewhat a very tall rhubarb plant. It is found mainly in low lying areas, particularly on the banks of streams and rivers. It leaves a residue which, in sunlight, burns the skin and children in particular are vulnerable. I have seen some appalling burns and many children have had to be hospitalised. In some cases, the child concerned was still suffering and had to undergo treatment three years after the injury.</P>
      <P>I raised the issue on a number of occasions in the House by way of parliamentary question. Initially, I addressed my questions to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry as he is responsible for the control of weeds. Apparently, he does not believe that the matter can be tackled under the Noxious Weeds Act as it does not pose a threat to agriculture. It is strange that the law provides for the protection of animals under that Act and that a weed which poses a danger to humans is not covered.</P>
      <P>When I tabled a question to the Minister for Health last week about the health implications, I was glad he acknowledged there was a serious problem and indicated that he was willing to take steps to deal with it. At this time of the year, as we enter the summer and when there is increased sunlight, most damage is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should co-ordinate their efforts to try to eradicate this weed. Considerable research has been carried out, by the botany department at Trinity College in particular, on which an eradication programme could be based. I understand that this weed has been eradicated in parts of Scotland. This matter should not be left to the local authorities or dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. An effort should <Col N="702" /> be made at national level to eradicate this dangerous weed, which has caused considerable pain and suffering to many people and which has the potential to do more damage. This matter should be dealt with as a matter of urgency and steps taken to eradicate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy and concern for any person who may suffer as a result of coming in contact with this weed. Essentially, it seems that the problem concerns amenities where young children play. The public concern of recent times arose because of abnormal river flooding which spread seeds to a built-up area of south Dublin-Wicklow where they had not been previously known. Unfamiliarity with the plant was largely the cause of some children being affected by handling it. The consequent publicity given to the identity and nature of the plant and the control measures taken by the local authorities dealt with the immediate problem.</P>
      <P>However, in the light of continuing concern, the Taoiseach asked my Department to co-ordinate measures across the different Government Departments concerned to ensure that the problem was comprehensively dealt with. The Departments in question are the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Department of the Environment, the Department of the Marine and the Office of Public Works. These consultations have now been completed and we are now reporting our conclusions and recommendations to the Government.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy was informed in the reply to his question of 26 April, it is intended that a suitable programme will be put in place to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's action in bringing this matter before the House last week and today has served the useful function of again drawing the attention of the public, especially parents, to the need for awareness of the hazard. As also stated in the reply to the parliamentary question, the proposed programme will include further public warning in relation to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter. This agonising issue has been ongoing for the past five to seven years but the problem is now unprecedented. What was initially a problem in Cavan is now a national nightmare and everybody seems to be aware of it except the Minister and his officials. People are in despair; one hears stories about families who were embarrassed because they thought it would not be possible to have a decent removal of the remains of a loved one. The operators of school buses are now refusing to provide a service along many county roads and where operators try to facilitate pupils it is extremely dangerous. I have also been informed on numerous occasions in my own county &mdash; I am sure this is the position nationwide &mdash; that the operators of milk tankers are refusing to collect milk from farms. This is unacceptable. Mushroom producers in my own county are also affected because mushrooms are damaged during transportation because of the condition of the roads.</P>
      <P>Many families are living in isolation and fear notwithstanding the fact that they pay the same taxes, PAYE, motor tax or indirect taxes, as those who live along national primary and secondary roads and in urban areas although I admit that this is now a problem in urban areas. Last week I was surprised to find a very bitter delegation from County Meath outside the gates of this House.</P>
      <P>There is no point in the Minister saying that this is a matter for the local authorities. I am a member of a local authority and it does not have the finance to make the necessary improvements because its hands are tied. There is also no point in quoting the allocations made to the various counties because they are not sufficient to tackle the problem. The Minister must address it by making emergency funding available to give the people some hope and by specifically stating his plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> Over three months ago &mdash; he made this announcement in my own county &mdash; the Minister promised to provide £33.6 million but work on these improvements has not commenced because the local authorities have not been informed how much they will receive. As a member of a local authority, down through the years I was always aware at the end of February or early March how much the local authority would receive when we met the county engineer to decide on the work programme for the year. While the allocations in recent years were not sufficient at least work was started on time. These meetings have not yet taken place in any county this year.</P>
    <P>Earlier today the Minister mentioned that the money collected by way of road tax will be put into the roads. I understand that the Exchequer collects in excess of £1.3 billion annually in car, lorry and registration taxes and excise duties; yet, during the period of the National Development Plan £1.6 billion will be allocated for roads. This is not good enough and I ask the Minister to make all the money collected in road tax and excise duties available during the next five years for the restoration of county roads. If the Minister has another proposal to provide a similar amount, I &mdash; and the people outside the House &mdash; would be delighted to hear it.</P>
    <P>Last night I attended an angry meeting in Cootehill, County Cavan, where people were talking about campaigns involving the non-payment of road tax, the withholding of other taxes and the blocking of roads. These are law-abiding citizens who want to do no more than go about their daily business, work their small farms or run their businesses and provide for their families. They need to get their produce to the marketplace and they are entitled to good road conditions. They have the right to have their children travel to school safely, and elderly people have the right to be able to travel to visit their families. I am aware that doctors, people who are extremely dedicated, <Col N="705" /> have refused to travel certain roads to see patients because they are unsafe. I am pleading with the Minister to give some hope to these people and spell out his plans and the amount of money he intends to spend this year and over the next four years to put an end to this terrible state of affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I am introducing a scheme of specific grants this year to meet 100 per cent of the approved cost to local authorities of individual road improvement projects. The grants will total £33.6 million in 1994 and will be paid in full to local authorities from the Exchequer. The payments are, however, expected to qualify for aid from the EU and the projects selected will therefore have to satisfy EU requirements. In particular, these co-financed projects will have to have a significant and quantifiable economic impact, particularly in regard to employment and on industrial, tourism, fisheries, forestry agricultural and rural development. The programme as a whole will be targeted mainly at those regional and local roads of importance to the generation of economic activity and jobs.</P>
      <P>I have recently raised the importance of this scheme of grants with Commissioner Millan in Brussels and I am delighted that the European Commission has recognised the need to make Structural Funds available on a significant scale towards State investment in our non-national road network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 450 grant applications were received from local authorities for improvement projects, involving estimated expenditure of £70 million in 1994 and a further £65 million over the following two years. Given the large volume of applications it was necessary to devote considerable time and effort to fully assessing their individual merits. In many cases this necessitated visits by Department officials to local authorities for consultation on their proposals. The process <Col N="706" /> of examining applications is now nearing completion and I expect to anounce grant allocations for individual projects in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I have already made it clear to local authorities that grant allocations will depend on the quality of projects put forward and their conformity with guidelines issued by my Department and compliance with EU criteria. As a consequence some county councils can expect to receive higher allocations than others. The grants scheme is scheduled to operate with EU support until 1999 and future years will afford authorities further opportunities to bring forward projects which will make a significant contribution to employment and economic activity so that all can share in the benefits of the new grants scheme as it continues to operate.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the Government's commitment to playing its part in helping local authorities carry out their responsibilities for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads goes far beyond this new scheme of improvement grants. A few points serve to demonstrate the priority that the Government is giving the provision of a proper network of non-national roads. For example, prior to 1988 no State grants were available for the maintenance of county roads. This year's provision for maintenance of all non-national roads is £28.3 million, an increase of £16 million or 130 per cent on 1993; for every pound spent by county councils on non-national roads in 1988, the State paid just over 70 pence. For every pound spent by county councils in 1993 on these roads, the State put up nearly £1.40. In 1994 the State will provide £1,876 for each of the 54,062 miles of road involved &mdash; the corresponding figure in 1988 was £882; in the period 1986-1994 State spending on non-national roads increased from £40 million &mdash; which represented 33 per cent of total State and local authority expenditure on such roads &mdash; to over £101 million, which represents 62.5 per cent of total expenditure. <Col N="707" /> Over the same period local authority investment declined from almost £81 million to £61 million, a drop of 25 per cent, the total State grants provison this year is a record £101.4 million, some £26.1 million more than in 1993 &mdash; an increase of 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government is playing its part in improving the non-national road network and local authorities must also make a realistic contribution in tackling the condition of regional and local roads if all our efforts are to achieve the desired result.</P>
    <P>I will be in a position to make these announcements very soon and I hope that local authorities will be able to respond quickly. It is important to mention, because Opposition Deputies seem to ignore the fact, that weather conditions this spring have been deplorable, with three quarters of our year's normal rainfall falling since 1 December which has interrupted much local authority activity. Farmers who were prevented from ploughing and seeding and people who could not work in the bogs during the spring know what I am talking about. At the same time we are being pilloried for spending money on wet roads with drainage problems which will have to be dealt with as the weather dries up. The amount of activity on our county and regional roads this year has never been paralleled. I look forward to seeing the development of our roads which is urgently and badly needed. However, let us deal seriously with the problem without political bias. In recent times there has been increased State involvement in this area. The Deputy's own party cannot say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I expess my great appreciation to the Chair for allowing this debate on a very important issue. The Minister, like the Chair, often travels through the village of Inchicore on his way to and from Tipperary, and I invite him to stop there one day to meet me and the other public representatives and local organisations and see for himself the severe decay in the streets that radiates from the area of the Black Lion and surrounding streets.</P>
      <P>This debate is timely. Inchicore village is the core of Inchicore, if the Minister will pardon the pun. It is in a very dilapidated condition and is getting worse and this is destroying any sense of pride in the community. The Government will be making decisions relating to designated areas under the Urban Renewal Act some time in the next two months. I make a special plea to the Minister to look at some of the villages of Dublin. There are people who would argue that because this Minister for the Environment is from the country he is not sympathetic to the problems of Dublin. I do not accept that but it is up to the Minister to show that he understands the concerns of communities in Dublin who cannot feel proud of their area because of their dilapidated condition, which is particularly acute in the village of Inchicore. To some extent this problem is the result of compulsory purchase orders from Dublin Corporation hanging over the areas for years and then being lifted, having caused urban blight for years. That is true of one section of Emmet Road between Turvey Avenue and St. Michael's Church on the side opposite. It is also true of that part of James's Street opposite St. James's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than two years ago, in response to a motion which I moved Dublin Corporation passed a proposal for a development plan for Inchicore. Another motion, in the name of Alderman Michael Conaghan, which dealt with conservation <Col N="709" /> in the Inchicore area, was passed by the corporation sometime later. There are many active organisations in the area, including the Inchicore and Kilmainham Development Group and the Inchicore Business Association, who are trying to mobilise opinion and decision-makers in favour of reviving Inchicore. That will happen if the Minister gets the Government to agree to the designation of the village of Inchicore under the proposed adjustments.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Minister to provide funds for the refurbishment of St. Michael's estate was greatly appreciated. The funding was long overdue and I thank the Minister for providing it. Richmond Park was restored recently with the help of lottery funds and the Oblate's church and St. Michael's church in Inchicore have also been restored recently.</P>
    <P>We need this designation if Inchicore is to have any hope of restoring its pride, vitality and elegance. It is an extremely historic area with Kilmainham Jail and the Royal Hospital at one end and a famous grotto at the other. The Inchicore Works is also an historic site. The Goldenbridge cemetery, in which the late W. T. Cosgrave is buried, is also located in the area and the corporation have planned a linear park along the River Camac. If the Minister agrees to this designation he can proudly say he was the Minister who helped restore elegance and vitality to Inchicore. It will be greatly appreciated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Mitchell has confidence in the Minister for the Environment, even if he comes from Tipperary. He correctly said that it has been suggested that because I come from Tipperary I might not have a great interest in Dublin. Dublin is my capital city. Large scale developments have taken place along the quays, in the Temple Bar area, around the docks, in Gardiner Street and, I hope, in Sheriff Street and in villages and towns around <Col N="710" /> the city which should have an opportunity to develop their personalities within the city complex. In initiating those schemes I hope I have demonstrated that one does not have to come from Dublin to be interested in the development of this city.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Mitchell is familiar with the proposition made by the Inchicore and Kilmainham Development Project, the Inchicore and District Business Association, the Bulfin Estate Residents' Association and the submissions regarding the Bow Lane-James's Street area. The new urban renewal scheme is due to commence on 1 August. This is the result of a major review of the present scheme and an examination of the future role of urban renewal policy. Future policy on urban renewal will focus more on remedial works and measures to conserve our existing urban infrastructure. More emphasis will be placed on residential developments in our inner core areas and on greater use of vacant upper floors.</P>
      <P>The areas to be designated under the new scheme will be selected having regard to factors such as extent of urban decay &mdash; need for renewal &mdash; location and general character of the area, potential for redevelopment, the need to promote residential accommodation and the historical or architectural significance of the area.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, consultations have taken place with Dublin Corporation and reports, letters and submissions made in regard to designation, including those for the Inchicore and Bow Lane areas, are being considered before an announcement is made. We are at an advanced stage in the examination of these projects but such has been the interest in designation and urban renewal generally &mdash; the Deputy will appreciate that we included a number of towns around the country &mdash; that the task is greater than we originally anticipated. Nevertheless, it should not take much longer than the period to which the Deputy referred to reach decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> I have also included in the National Development Plan provision for special grants for urban city and village renewal because there are many facial approaches &mdash; in some respects psychological &mdash; which can be adopted to give areas a lift in terms of development. We want to help communities in that regard. I am anxious that the Government should support community development where the community demonstrates its capacity and <Col N="712" /> strength to do things for itself. I will give sympathetic consideration to the Deputy's proposal in the context of other constraints and I look forward to decisions being made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>This matter was one of the recommendations of the Working Group on Childcare for Working Parents which was published on 15 March. The Minister for Equality and Law Reform dealt with the question of a Government response to the report in reply to Dáil questions on 23 March 1994 &mdash; Vol. 440 No. 5, Columns 1159 to 1164).</P>
      <P>Last January I issued a circular to each local authority drawing their attention to the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women. Among the issues highlighted by the commission was the need for adequate childcare facilities generally. While I am sure that most planning authorities already give due consideration to the issues raised in the commission's report, I asked authorities to re-examine their existing practices to ensure that they are in keeping with the findings of the report to the fullest extent possible. I also reminded planning authorities of the importance of the development plan as a mechanism whereby planning authorities can set out a blueprint for the development of residential areas, commercial and industrial centres, and all of the associated infrastructure and servicing, to meet the local community's development needs, including the particular needs of women as identified in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts permit the attachment to planning permissions of conditions requiring the provision of the types of facilities referred to by the commission, including nurseries and children's centres, where considered necessary in the context of the particular development proposal and subject to <Col N="505" /> proper planning and development considerations.</P>

      <P>Section 101A of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, provides that road authorities may provide ramps on roadways for the purpose of restricting the speed of mechanically propelled vehicles. The Road Traffic (Bollards and Ramps) Regulations, 1988 set out the detailed requirements relating to the provision of ramps.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic Act, 1994, which was enacted on 20 April last, provides for the repeal of section 101A and its replacement by a new general power for road authorities to provide such traffic calming measures, including ramps, as they consider desirable on public roads in their charge. I will commence the relevant provisions of the 1994 Act as soon as practicable.</P>

      <P>Dwellings, other than separate and self-contained flats, being sold by a local authority under a tenant purchase scheme in accordance with statutory provisions, must be disposed of in fee simple. There are no proposals to amend this requirement which derives from the provisions of the landlord and tenant code prohibiting, in the case of dwellings other than separate and self-contained flats, their disposal by way of lease and, consequently, the creation of new ground rents. Procedures exist under the landlord and tenant code enabling local authorities to purchase the fee simple of a property where the landlord cannot be traced.</P>

      <P>The cost of providing a serviced caravan site for travellers depends on a range of factors, including the cost of the land, topography of site, the cost of bringing services on to the site, the number of bays and the ancillary buildings being provided. Consequently, the cost per bay can vary appreciably from one halting site to another. The average cost per bay of permanent serviced caravan sites for travellers completed in 1993 was £36,300. However, more recently proposals being received from local authorities show a sharp upward trend in the estimated cost per bay for particular locations. Accurate costings of these proposals will not be available until tenders are received.</P>

      <Col N="510" /> Numbers/Revenue</P>
    <P>A total of 187,200 passports were issued in the 12 months to end-March 1994, resulting in a receipt of £7,289,500 to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Offices outside Dublin city centre</P>
    <P>A Passport Office was opened in Cork in January 1987. This office received 41,378 applications in the 12 months to end-March 1994 which resulted in a revenue receipt of £1,472,190 to the Exchequer. These figures are included in the overall statistics supplied above for passports issued and revenue generated.</P>
    <P>Three temporary offices were opened in Dublin suburban areas &mdash; Blackrock, Coolock and Tallaght &mdash; on 3 May, 1994. These offices will operate during the peak summer period. Like the Cork office, they will provide information, accept applications for passports and transmit them to the main Passport Office in Molesworth Street for processing. When issued, the passports may be dispatched by post from, or collected at, Molesworth Street. The suburban offices will also have the facility to check on the progress of passport applications through a computer link with the central passport data base in Molesworth Street.</P>
    <P>Waiting period</P>
    <P>The waiting period for issuing of passports varies in accordance with a number of factors. The number of passport applications received has increased steadily each year for a number of years past. The demand is highly seasonal, the peak period for applications being late spring and early summer. During the current peak period, approximately 50 per cent of passport applications are being made in person at the public offices. For these personal callers, passports are normally produced in two weeks; in cases of urgency, they are produced in a shorter period. For postal applicants, the processing time can be considerably longer and steps are being taken as a matter of urgency to reduce the waiting period for these applicants.</P>
    <P>No extra time is involved in issuing passports to persons who submit their <Col N="511" /> application through offices outside Dublin city centre.</P>
    <P>Applications by post/in person</P>
    <P>A detailed breakdown of personal and postal applications is available only for applications submitted through the Dublin Passport Office from 21 September 1993 &mdash; the date the new computer system was installed in that office. Between that date and 31 March 1994, a total of 34,263 personal applications and 56,132 postal applications were made to the Dublin office. Pending the installation of full computer facilities in the Cork Passport Office, a breakdown between personal and postal applications there is not available.</P>
    <P>Representations by Members of the Oireachtas</P>
    <P>Since 1 January 1994, a total of 1,672 passports have been issued in response to representations made by Deputies and Senators on behalf of constituents.</P>
    <P>Staff dealing with personal applications</P>
    <P>The number and grades of staff dealing with applications made by personal callers varies throughout the year depending on demand. At present, of the total of 73 permanent and 72 temporary staff working in the passport offices, including the suburban offices, in Dublin and Cork the following are the numbers dealing with personal callers:</P>

No staff are involved in this work in the Cork Passport Office or the suburban offices.</P>
    <P>Steps to decrease waiting time</P>
    <P>I have already taken a number of initiatives, and others are in the course of implementation, with a view to improving the quality of service to the public and reducing the waiting time for passports. These include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;retention of the low-season cost reduction to encourage applications in the off-peak period,</P>
    <P>&mdash;a major upgrading of the computer system enabling more efficient tracking of applications and information retrieval &mdash; see below,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extension of the premises in Molesworth Street to the ground floor in March of this year which has greatly improved and increased the accommodation for the public. The capacity now exists to deal with a greater number of counter applicants and the average waiting time for counter service has been substantially reduced. A new larger capacity telephone system will be installed shortly to further facilitate public contact with the office,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the opening of the temporary suburban passport offices is designed to further reduce congestion in the Moleworth <Col N="513" /> Street office during the peak summer period.</P>
    <P>I also envisage that the Passport Office in Cork will be expanded and upgraded to the status of a full passport issuing office for the Munster area by the end of 1994. The question of establishing a further issuing office for the Connacht-Ulster area will be considered subsequently.</P>
    <P>Computerisation</P>
    <P>A total of £576,000 has been spent to date on computerisation of the Passport Office. No difficulties, other than normal transitional problems, were encountered in the implementation of this project.</P>
    <P>Staffing</P>
    <P>My Department is currently implementing a major restructuring of the staff in the Dublin Passport Office in line with the recommendations of a recent Department of Finance management survey. This involves a substantial increase in the permanent staff from 48 to 82 and the upgrading of a number of posts. Temporary staff will continue to be recruited for peak periods although there will be some reduction in the numbers required.</P>
    <P>The new staffing structure is designed to ensure that the Passport Office has the capacity and flexibility to meet anticipated demand effectively on a year-round basis. Most of the new permanent staff are now in place and the remainder will be assigned as soon as possible. It is expected that the full benefit of these staffing measures will increasingly be felt in the coming months. In the meantime, a number of additional temporary staff have recently been recruited to the office.</P>

      <P>The statutory instrument which determines the level of passport fees provides for the issue of a three year passport for a fee of £10 in respect of persons who are either under 18 years of age or over 65 years of age. The fee for a standard passport for persons outside these categories is £45.</P>
      <P>As far as is practicable the passport fee structure is designed to accommodate potential hardship cases.

This compares to an estimate for that year of £1,114,000,000; 2. The actual figure includes an exceptional advance of IR£36,852,467.62 which was made available to member states from the 1993-94 Budget in respect of SLOM I, SLOM II and Restructuring of Milk Production, <Col N="516" /> which was not paid out during 1993, and 3. the amount advanced in respect of Restructuring of Milk Production &mdash; £1.592 million &mdash; has now been paid and the remainder in respect of SLOM I and SLOM II will be paid out later this year.</P>

      <P>Full driving licences are available for one, three and ten year periods of validity. The charges are £4, £12 and £20, respectively. There are no six-year licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issuing of driving licences to older persons is related to the particular requirements which they must fulfil. Over the age of 70, a medical certificate, <Col N="517" /> stating fitness to drive and valid for a one or three year period at the certifying practitioner's discretion, is required. A one-year licence may be granted in exceptional circumstances where, for medical reasons, a longer term licence cannot be granted. This medically-related criterion also has implications for the issue of licences to persons aged between 60 and 70 years. Persons over 60 but under 67 years of age may apply either for a 10-year licence which will expire when the person reaches 70 years of age or for a three year licence. Persons aged 67 or more may only apply for a three year licence.</P>
    <P>As regards discrimination, I would not accept that older drivers are unduly penalised. The present costs of driving licences were fixed in 1989 and cannot be considered onerous in the context of motoring costs generally. In any event, as the change suggested by the Deputy would further complicate the licensing regime, I have no plans at present to alter the current arrangements.</P>

      <P>The percentage of staff with a disability employed in each Department as at October 1993 is included in Annex A. In view of the extreme sensitivity of the data, particularly in Departments or Offices with a small number of staff where the information could be used for personal identification of disabled staff, I have not published the number of disabled staff employed in each Department. Information regarding the grading of staff with disabilities is not held centrally. Even if it were, I would be reluctant to publish it for the same reason.</P>
      <P>In relation to the accessibility of buildings in each Department to disabled staff, I attach an extract from the recently agreed Code of Practice for the Employment of People with Disabilities in the Civil Service on this subject &mdash; Annex B. With the exception of three offices with a small number of staff, at least one building in each Department or Office is accessible to wheelchair users. However, there is a very wide range of disabilities and physical access is not a problem for all staff with a disability. It is the policy in the Civil Service that all reasonable efforts are made to meet the special requirements of staff with a disability, whether in relation to access or to the provision of specialised or modified equipment, so as to maximise access to employment in the Civil Service for people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the commitment to achieve a quota of 3 per cent for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service, while this figure has not yet been reached in the public service as a whole, the percentage of people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service has steadily risen in recent years and has now reached 3 per cent of the total staff numbers. All Departments are required to play their full part in ensuring that this objective is met and maintained. The achievement of the 3 per cent quota in the wider public service is a matter for <Col N="519" /> my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <P>Extract from the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with Disabilities in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Accommodation and equipment</P>
    <P>14. Most staff with disabilities can operate effectively without requiring modifications to their working environment. However, special facilities are required by some. It is the policy in the <Col N="520" /> Civil Service to ensure that, in so far as is practical, the working environment is such as to minimise problems which face staff with certain disabilities. Particular importance attaches to providing access for people with mobility or sensory problems, both staff and members of the public who may wish to use Government offices. The key to progress in this regard is sensitivity to the obstacles which particular physical environments place in the way of people with certain disabilities and a planned approach to the progressive removal of them. Departments should also acquaint themselves with the range of special aids and equipment available to assist people with certain disabilities. Again, most staff with disabilities will not require special equipment but in some cases mechanical aids can greatly enhance the comfort and efficiency of the staff concerned.</P>
    <P>15. The following guidelines will apply in relation to accommodation and equipment:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Office of Public Works will take the requirements of people with disabilities fully into account in their assessment of buildings for rental purposes.</P>
    <P>&mdash;In undertaking any significant structural alteration to or renovation of an existing building, the Office of Public Works will, in so far as is practicable, include in the works such alterations as are necessary to bring the building concerned up to an acceptable standard of accessibility for people with disabilities (major constraints apply in this regard, however, in the case of certain buildings, for example, listed buildings).</P>
    <P>&mdash;Departments which carry out work on their own buildings should also consider what alterations might reasonably be included in the work to improve accessibility. The Office of Public Works will be available to advise in this regard.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Accommodation Officers in Departments should, in the course of their <Col N="521" /> normal duties, note any access problems or other features of the buildings occupied by their Departments which may cause problems for people with disabilities with a view to the progressive eradication of such problems.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Departments should consult staff with disabilities about special equipment which might enhance their efficiency and effectiveness in performing their duties and adopt a positive approach to reasonable requests for such equipment.</P>

The European Commission's 11th Annual Report on the monitoring of the application of community law lists a total of 1,148 directives applicable to Ireland at 31 December 1993. It would not be possible to say how many of these apply to areas for which I am responsible without devoting a disproportionate amount of time and resources to the task. I would point out to the Deputy that many of the directives adopted in the past are no longer in force because they have been repealed or have been replaced by other forms of legal instrument such as regulations. This is particularly so in the customs area, where practically all directives within the last two years have been repealed and consolidated into a new Community Customs Code (Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 and Commission implementing Regulation (EEC) No. 2454/93 of 2 July 1993).</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance scheme operated by my Department is available only to people who are in receipt of certain social welfare-type payments, who are either living alone or only with children or persons who, because they are so permanently incapacitated, could not get help in an emergency. The main purpose of the scheme is to ensure that people in those circumstances, particularly elderly people, have some way of getting help when it is needed.</P>
      <P>The number of people currently availing of the free telephone rental allowance scheme is about 144,000 at an annual cost of some £20 million. The question of providing further assistance in certain cases would have cost implications which would have to be considered in the light of available resources. I am keeping the scheme under review to see what changes may be necessary. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind I will have it examined in that context.</P>

      <P>One of the statutory contribution conditions for entitlement to treatment (dental and optical) benefits from my Department requires an applicant aged between 21 and 66 years to have at least 39 reckonable PRSI contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year of which at least 13 must be paid contributions. Alternatively, this condition can be satisfied if the applicant has at least 13 contributions paid in either of the two contribution years preceding the governing contribution year, or a subsequent contribution year, including the year in which employment ceases due, for <Col N="527" /> example, to early retirement. People in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, disability benefit for more than 12 months, invalidity pension, or retirement pension are exempt from the condition requiring at least 13 paid contributions.</P>
      <P>In practice, therefore, a person who leaves the workforce can retain entitlement to treatment benefit for up to five years after employment ceases. Where entitlement runs out after that period, it can be restored on receipt of retirement pension at age 65 years. Furthermore, once qualified at 66 years of age, a person remains qualified for the rest of his or her life.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid unemployment benefit from 5 August 1991 to 24 September 1993 when her maximum entitlement to 390 days benefit ceased.</P>
      <P>A new application for unemployment benefit was made on 6 January 1994. To requalify for payment she required an additional 13 contributions paid and to have sustained a substantial loss of employment. On investigation of the case it was found that although she satisfied the contribution condition she had not sustained a substantial loss of employment and the application was disallowed by a deciding officer with effect from the date of the claim.</P>
      <P>To sustain a substantial loss of employment, a person working one, two, three or four days a week must lose at least one day's employment. An applicant's normal level of employment is determined by reference to the 13 calendar weeks prior to the date of the claim. The days of employment in that period are totalled and divided by 13, fractions of a day are rounded up to a day. The person concerned had been employed three days per week in the relevant period and her pattern of employment from 6 January 1994 remained unchanged. It is open to her to apply for unemployment assistance, which is means tested. All applications are decided on their merits. She is currently qualified for dental benefit but there is no trace of any recent application.</P>

      <P>The social welfare legislation provides that a person who has paid less than 260 PRSI contributions since he or she first entered insurable employment is entitled to payment of disability benefit for a maximum period of 52 weeks. To requalify for payment of disability benefit, a person requires a further 13 paid PRSI contributions or such lesser number as would bring to 260 the total number of PRSI contributions paid.</P>
      <P>The person concerned made a claim to disability benefit on 4 July 1992 and was paid to 6 July 1993, which was the maximum period to which she was entitled because, according to my Department's records, she had a total of only 230 contributions paid since she first entered insurable employment.</P>

      <P>The person concerned cannot be considered for an invalidity pension because it is a condition of that scheme that a total of at least 260 insurance contributions must have been paid. If her means are insufficient to meet her needs she should apply to her local health board for payment of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I have received correspondence from Durrus Community Association on this matter.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda manpower to individual areas, that the current manpower at Durrus station is one garda. This has been the position since 1985, when the sergeant retired. Records for the previous ten years show that the strength has been one sergeant and one garda which would seem to be at variance with the figures provided in the question. The crime statistics for the area were 15 in each of the years 1992 and 1993. There has been one crime reported in the subDistrict to date in 1994. The divisional officer is satisfied that the current policing arrangements for the Durrus area are adequate and would not warrant the allocation of additional manpower. Assistance from mobile patrols attached to Bantry and Schull Garda stations is available if and when required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that <Col N="536" /> the living quarters in the station are not in a habitable condition. Work to the value of almost £20,000 was carried out on the station last year. However, no married garda within the division has indicated a willingness to occupy the married quarters at the station, even if the accommodation was further upgraded. The Garda authorities cannot compel a member to reside in the official accommodation attached to a Garda station. In the event of a garda undertaking to occupy the official accommodation at Durrus, consideration will be given to carrying out the necessary renovation work to bring the living quarters up to standard. In the absence of such an undertaking, it is not proposed to expend public finances on renovation works on the married quarters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn):</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the Deputy will be aware that since I took up office as Minister for Justice, I have taken a keen interest in what happens in the premier thoroughfare of our capital city. I pass through O'Connell Street regularly at various times during the day and night and I see at first hand how the gardaí are dealing with the policing situation there. I also have regular contacts with the Commissioner and his senior officers, in particular, the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Dublin Metropolitan Area about policing initiatives in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of these contacts, a Garda Inspector was appointed to Store Street station earlier last year with special responsbility for policing arrangements in O'Connell Street. In addition, Garda strength at that station has increased <Col N="537" /> from 195 in 1992 to 210 at present. Tactical measures which have been taken include the establishment of special beats on O'Connell Street which ensure that there are six gardaí detailed for duty there between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 a.m. each day. The Garda Office in the street is open from 9.15 a.m. to 12 midnight seven days a week.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, O'Connell Street and its environs are regularly patrolled by both foot and mobile patrols from both the detective and crime unit at Store Street station, as well as by the divisional task force and drug units. Some of these officers operate in plain clothes to combat crimes such as assaults, handbag snatches, pickpocketing etc.</P>
    <P>Last year, I delivered on an earlier commitment to bring a video surveillance mobile unit into operation and it has been on continuous duty in O'Connell Street since September 1993 to great effect. The experience gained through the use of this technology will be of assistance in considering the extent of the fixed CCTV system which is planned for the area and which I announced last December as part of my programme to tackle crime.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will also be aware, I piloted the Public Order Bill through the Oireachtas recently and its provisions are now in effect. I would see the provisions of that Act being of immense benefit to the gardaí in areas such as O'Connell Street to deal with incidents of crime of this nature.</P>
    <P>The local divisional officer has regular meetings with the Dublin City Centre Business Association and with individual business people in the area. Action has been taken against night club operators and this has resulted in better management and control of these premises.</P>
    <P>The gardaí are satisfied that there has been a significant improvement in the policing arrangements for O'Connell Street and that the Garda manpower committed to the area is sufficient to ensure that people can go about their lawful business secure in the knowledge that the area is safe. I am concerned to ensure that this improvement is maintained and both I and the Garda Commissioner <Col N="538" /> will be paying particular attention to the city centre in the coming months now that the tourist season is almost upon us.</P>

      <P>Under the Casual Trading Act, 1980, any person is entitled to obtain a casual trading licence from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment unless the person has been convicted of two or more offences under the Act.</P>
      <P>A licence issued under the 1980 Act is valid for a period of 12 months. The Casual Trading Bill, 1994 proposes that the local authorities, to whom the licensing function is being devolved under the Bill, may issue licences to a person authorising that person to trade on specified days and for a period not exceeding 12 months. The Bill does not propose to alter a person's basic entitlement to a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no function in regard to the question of a casual trader being facilitated in passing a trading pitch from one family member to another. This has <Col N="540" /> been, and will continue to be, a matter for the local authorities to determine.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Commercial Agents) Regulations, 1994 give legal effect to the EU Council Directive 85/635/EEC on the co-ordination of the laws of member states relating to self-employed commercial agents. These regulations deal with the relationship between commercial agents and their principals and their respective rights and obligations.</P>
      <P>Agreements between oil companies and their tied service station retailers concerning exclusive purchasing and supply terms of motor fuels are subject to the Competition Act, 1991. In July 1993 the competition authority granted a licence under section 4 (2) of the 1991 Act to a category of exclusive purchasing agreements in respect of motor fuels.</P>
      <P>The authority's motor fuels category licence is the subject of judicial review proceedings in the High Court &mdash; ref. Judicial Review No. 242/1993 &mdash; and I consider that any further comment in the matter would be prejudicial to those proceedings.</P>

Secondly, an official of my Department, in my enforced absence, has also met a deputation from the Casual Traders Association. I am currently considering a submission which has been made to me by the association.</P>

      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993, established a framework for the application of planning permission requirements to development by Government Departments and the Office of Public Works and planning permission will, generally, be required for development commenced by those bodies after 15 June 1994. However, the Act also provded that, for reasons of public safety or order, the administration of justice, or national security or defence, development by State authorities could be excluded from the full requirements of the Planning Acts by ministerial regulations. Under this provision, the recent regulations specify that the Planning Acts will not apply, <i>inter alia,</i> to the provision of new office buildings and other premises used for the business of certain Government Departments, including the Department of the Taoiseach, of the extension beyond their existing boundaries of such buildings and premises. However, such development will, be subject to a procedure, involving public notice, the availability for inspection of outline plans and particulars of the proposals and an opportunity for public comment on them. The regulations also establish an exemption from planning permission requirements for any works carried out within, or bounding, the curtilage of the buildings and premises concerned.</P>

    <P>Overall EU progress towards these targets is monitored by the European Commission and to date is generally satisfactory.</P>
    <P>A further draft regulation is now under consideration at EU level. This incorporates the existing regulations and proposes to extend controls to substances newly covered by the Montreal Protocol: HCFCs, HBFCs and methyl bromide. This proposed regulation envisages phase out dates of 1995 for HBRCs, 2014 for HCFCs and a 25 per cent reduction for methyl bromide by 1998.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently maintained an advanced position on control of ozone depleting substances and strongly supports the early adoption of the current draft regulation.</P>

      <P>A proposal for a Council Directive on the landfill of waste is now before the Environment Council with a view to the adoption of a common position. Ireland, in common with a number of other member states, has expressed the view that the proposal should be modified to provide greater flexibility in relation to the timescale for the upgrading of existing landfill sites and to the regulation of small-scale landfills. Amendments covering these matters have been proposed by the Presidency and are among the matters now under negotiation.</P>

      <P>Direct support and advice to community and residents associations is more appropriate to local authorities than to my Department. The Department does, however, seek to encourage local cleanup activities by nationally co-ordinated publicity campaigns, such as that organised in 1993, and by its environmental awareness activities generally. The latter include both the ENFO service and a scheme of environment awareness awards to non-governmental organisations for demonstration projects in the field of environmental awareness and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the continuation of these ongoing activities in 1994, it is also intended later in the year to distribute a booklet to households setting out how <Col N="550" /> individuals and their families in their daily lives can, by simple choices and changes in behaviour, play a fuller part in protecting the environment.</P>

The principal provisions that are relevant in this respect are: the requirement that a majority of all members, both investing and borrowing, must vote in favour of conversion on the basis of one-person-one-vote; the requirement for a comprehensive conversion statement giving detailed information on a wide range of aspects relevant to members; the extensive powers of supervision and approval given to the Central Bank and the rights of members to petition the High Court.</P>

      <Quest>the history of the installation aid scheme; if he will have arrangements made to have the scheme reviewed, upgraded and rendered more attractive and appropriate as a measure to encourage and facilitate the transfer of farms from older owners to new younger owners and thus make the scheme more complementary to other relevant measures which he has introduced.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh) Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The installation aid scheme has been operated in Ireland since early 1986 with the exception of a 15 month interval in 1987-88 during which the scheme was discontinued. Under the scheme, a premium of £5,600 is payable to eligible young farmers. The scheme has been revised on two occasions since its inception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first revision allowed applicants for the installation premium a period of two years from the date of first installation to achieve the educational qualifications laid down. In addition the maximum labour requirement of 1.5MWU for the farm was increased to 3MWU in the case of intensive horticultural enterprises. This revision <Col N="569" /> applied retrospectively so that applicants who were not accepted under the original scheme could apply to be considered under the revised scheme.</P>
    <P>In 1991 following changes in the regulation, the scheme was again revised retrospective to 1 January, 1990. This revision allowed a person deemed to be a part-time farmer by virtue of having less than 0.5 MWU and/or who was spending less than 50 per cent of their time on the farm and/or was gaining more than 50 per cent of his/her income from non-farming activities to be eligible to apply under the scheme on setting up as a fulltime farmer.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to monitor the operation of the scheme with a view to making it more attractive to young farmers. In this regard I would draw attention to the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work </i> where additional funds have been committed to the scheme. Consultations are now taking place with the farm organisations regarding the most effective use of these additional resources. Following these consultations and subject to the approval of the EU I hope to be able to announce further improvements to the scheme.</P>
    <P>The early retirement scheme for farmers provides for the transfer of land to qualified farmers under 50 years of age who must own or lease 5ha of land or else expand the transferred land by 5 ha or 10 per cent whichever is the greater. This scheme offers attractive premia to retiring farmers and should help progressive young farmers enter farming. This scheme is complementary to the measures under the installation aid scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) is the National Authority with responsibility for undertaking measurements of the naturally occurring radioactive gas, radon. All buildings have some presence of radon. The average radon concentration in Irish houses is about 60 becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m3). Surveys to date indicate that about 4 per cent of houses in Ireland have radon concentrations above the reference level of 200 Bq/m³. This is the radon concentration level above which remedial measures should be considered. While houses with high radon levels are found throughout the country, there is evidence of a greater incidence of such houses in the West of Ireland. A more stringent reference level of 150 Bq/m3 is applied in the case of schools.</P>
      <P>During 1992, a geographically-based national survey, which will run over several years, was initiated by the RPII. Radon measurements will be made in over 6,000 homes nationwide and statistical evaluation of the results will allow the percentage of houses above the 200 Bq3 Reference Level in each national grid square to be predicted. All measurements are for a twelve month period and, once completed, will identify any areas at particular risk from indoor radon and allow planning authorities to consider what actions might be desirable to limit radon accumulation in new buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remedial action to deal with unacceptable levels of radon gas is, in the case of houses, primarily a matter for the householders and property owners concerned. However, guidance on remedial action is provided by the Environmental Research Unit of the Department of the Environment. In the case of schools, in which radon gas levels <Col N="573" /> have been established to be unacceptably high, I understand that the Department of Education in co-operation with the Office of Public Works and the school authorities have undertaken remedial measures.</P>
    <P>Details of the radon measurements in houses and schools in the counties mentioned <Col N="574" /> by the Deputy are set out in Table 1 and 2 respectively. No measurements have been carried out in schools in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim or Roscommon. In the case of counties where the number of completed house surveys is small, the results to date cannot be taken as statistically reliable data until the whole survey is completed.</P>

      <P>Thousands of items have come into the possession of the Museum since 1990 and the total paid out in this period, including purchases or finders rewards, amounted to some £207,000.</P>
      <P>These acquisitions involved about 400 separate transactions, many of which consisted of more than one object. The vast majority were by way of voluntary donation for which finders rewards were paid. Other donations have included large numbers of objects from licensed archaeological excavations which would not involve any payments. A small number of objects were purchased by private treaty.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to assurances given in the past and would seriously damage the institution's capacity to acquire material in the future if the names of those concerned were publicised.

      <P>The provision of speech therapy services is a matter, in the first instance, for the North Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the North-Eastern Health Board provides a limited speech therapy service to the children attending this particular school. £1.5 million has been made available this year for services for people with a physical handicap and I expect that a proportion of this will be <Col N="578" /> devoted to improving and expanding community-based therapy services, including speech therapy. An application has been received from the North-Eastern Health Board for additional staff, including speech therapists, and this application is being considered at present.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the inadequacy of the speech therapy services is the lack of sufficient numbers of trained speech therapists. My Department has taken steps to remedy the situation by arranging for six extra training places to be provided at the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies, Trinity College, Dublin, commencing in the 1992-93 academic year. The total student body will increase in phases from 80 students in 1992 to 104 students in 1995-96. The increased level of graduate output resulting from this important development should ease difficulties in the area of speech and language therapy in the medium to long term.</P>

      <P>The referral of patients abroad for treatment is a matter for the relevant health board, in this case the Southern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are European Union Regulations governing the referral of patients for health services in other member countries. Under the referral of patients abroad scheme, a person may be authorised to go to another member state and obtain treatment which is considered necessary and which is not available in Ireland. The health board must assess an application <Col N="579" /> for referral before the patient goes abroad, except in cases of extreme urgency. Medical evidence must be provided by a hospital consultant certifying among other things, that the treatment is not available in Ireland. I understand from the Southern Health Board that the person in question had been made aware of the terms of the referral abroad scheme two months prior to travelling for surgery.</P>
    <P>In exceptional circumstances the board may consider a case post-treatment if it was deemed to be an emergency. It is open to the person in this case to submit a completed application form to the board for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the concept of a single payment by an insurer to cover both hospital and consultant costs in relation to individual patients has been advanced in a recent discussion paper on health insurance in Australia. The principle of a single payment has a number of obvious attractions, particularly the greater transparency which it would offer to the consumer in terms of overall medical costs. It can also reduce administrative complexities for an insurer. It may also have potential as a cost containment measure but this needs further evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are a number of policy and technical matters of relevance to its implementation. For example, in order to implement such an arrangement, it would be necessary to have in place, throughout the public and private sectors, information systems in regard to costed casemix which would support developments of this type and would be applied on an agreed basis. The changed interaction between hospitals, consultants <Col N="580" /> and patients would also need to be considered carefully. This is an interesting concept, which will be considered further by my Department as part of the general review of health insurance arrangements which is now in progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics collected by the Health Research Board show that in 1991 alcohol-related disorders accounted for approximately 35 per cent of all admissions to psychiatric hospitals in the functional area of the North-Western Health Board and to 23.6 per cent of all admissions nationally.</P>
      <P>In response to this high level of alcohol-related admissions, the North-Western Health Board established a review group to examine this issue. The report of the group was adopted by the board in December 1993 and it now forms its policy in relation to alcohol-related services.</P>
      <P>The main recommendations in the report, which are now being implemented by the board, are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the development of immediate health promotion campaigns at Health Board level to reduce the amount of harm caused by the abuse of alcohol.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the initiation of a screening programme aimed at identifying persons with potential problem drinking levels at a broader range of contact points within the board's service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;that a copy of this screening programme <Col N="581" /> with information and clear advice on harmful and hazardous drinking and on referral to appropriate services be made available.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to shift from the predominant reliance on the psychiatric hospital for detoxification through the development and uptake of alternative service options for example by general practitioners or in general hospitals.</P>
    <P>At national level, alcohol-related problems make a heavy demand on the health services. The strategy for the health services, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, which I published recently, includes targets to promote moderation in the consumption of alcohol and to reduce the risks to physical, mental and family health that arise from alcohol misuse. In particular, the aim is that 75 per cent of people over 15 years of age know and understand the recommended sensible limits for alcohol consumption. In addition, my Department will take steps over the next ten years to reduce substantially the proportion of those who exceed the recommended limits for alcohol consumption.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of a broadly-based policy on alcohol, the formulation of a national alcohol policy is being developed by the Health Promotion Unit of my Department. As indicated in <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, this policy document will be launched in the next twelve months.</P>

      <P>The provision of occupational therapy in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. I have received a report from the Eastern Health Board which states that the person referred to in the <Col N="582" /> Deputy's question has been in contact with the Public Health Nursing Service and has received assistance in organising services for her son as well as securing a medical card for him. Furthermore, the public health nurse has arranged for his attendance at a day centre activation centre which is due to begin shortly.</P>

      <P>The principles and objectives of environmental education are integral elements of curricular provision in the education system. Subjects such as environmental and social studies, geography, science, home economics and history actively promote the development in children of positive and pro-active attitudes and actions regarding <Col N="589" /> environmental issues. Environmental education will also be a part of my Department's ongoing provision for in-career development of teachers. Broader environmental issues affecting industry and local authorities specifically are not a matter for my Department.</P>

      <Quest>if she has received a request from persons (details supplied) in County Clare to have a school bus rerouted in order to facilitate 12 children attending Kilkislen national school, County Clare in the townland of Clonbrick, from Fox's Cross to Kilkislen national school.</Quest>

      <P>My Department has received, and replied to, the request to which the Deputy refers. Regrettably, I am unable to concede to the request since all the children in question are ineligible for free transport to Kilkislen national school. While I would be willing to consider allowing them fare-paying facilities, this is not possible, at present, however, as the current bus service is operating to full capacity. It is not open to my Department to provide additional transport for ineligible children where extra cost to the State would be incurred.</P>

      <P>At present, approximately 17,900 students participate in post leaving certificate courses which are provided in second level schools and colleges outside the third level sector. A means tested grants scheme to cover both fees and maintenance would cost of the order of £10 million per annum.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House will appreciate the need to strike a balance between competing demands for resources in the education sector &mdash; between funding for the different levels of the system, between initial and second chance education, between student supports, investment in quality assurance, and special measures to combat disadvantage and under achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of PLC courses I consider it more important to concentrate on improving the quality of the system, through investment in national certification and assessment arrangements, in programme development, in inservice training, and in ensuring that courses <Col N="591" /> continue to be available in a wide range of disciplines for as many students as possible.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that 1994 third level student support schemes issued to local authorities/VECs on 27 April 1994. The schemes contain changes which will continue to improve <Col N="592" /> access for students entering full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>The main changes are:</P>
      <P>Academic Attainment Conditions: The two honour requirement is effectively superseded and a student who secures a place in an approved third level course will be deemed to satisfy the academic attainments conditions.</P>
      <P>Second Chance Students &mdash; Higher Education Grants Scheme and vocational education committee Scholarships Scheme: Second chance students have been added as a new category of person to whom the scheme applies. Such students who have had a break of studies of five years and return to repeat at the same level in 1994-95 may receive grants aid.</P>
      <P>Increased Income Eligibility Criteria-Maintenance Grants-Fee Grants: Income eligibility limits have been increased by 5.4 per cent and maintenance grants by 1.7 per cent. These increases are in line with movements in the average industrial wage and the consumer price index respectively.</P>
      <P>Post-Graduate Students: Mature students commencing a post-graduate course without already holding a primary degree may now qualify for grant-aid.</P>
      <P>Application Form: The layout of the application form has been further simplified to make it more user-friendly.</P>

      <P>Kingswood and Killinarden are two distinct areas in Tallaght, County Dublin. Killinarden has a community school which can cater for all children leaving the primary schools in Killinarden. Children from the Kingswood area attend post-primary schools mainly in Greenhills, Drimnagh and Crumlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 the then Minister, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, decided that a school should be provided at Castleview, Tallaght, to cater for the Castleview-Kingswood-Kilnamanagh areas. The provision of this school has not been progressed to date by my Department for two main reasons: the continued availability <Col N="595" /> of post-primary places in schools within a reasonable distance; the considerable capital expenditure involved set against the many urgent demands on the limited capital available to my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department carries out a periodical review of the situation to ensure that adequate post-primary places are available to children from the Castleview-Kingswood &mdash; Kilnamanagh areas. The latest Department review, carried out in the current school year, confirms this to be the case. In that light, therefore, it is not proposed to proceed <Col N="596" /> with the planning of the proposed school for Castleview at present.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that families are leaving the Kingswood area specifically for the reason that parents cannot find places for their children in second level schools convenient to the area or on a convenient bus route from the area.</P>
    <P>On the attached statement, which I propose to circulate in the Official Report, are set out up-to-date statistics of children leaving primary schools in the Kingswood, Castleview and Kilnamanagh areas who will be entering the post-primary sector over the next six years.</P>
    <P>Projected Numbers of Children who will be leaving Primary Schools in the Kingswood, Castleview and Kilnamanagh Areas of Tallaght, Co. Dublin and entering the Post-Primary Sector in September 1994 and the following Five Years</P>
