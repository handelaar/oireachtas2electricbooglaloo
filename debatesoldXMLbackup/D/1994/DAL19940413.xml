      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister about matters relating to the 1986 Act <Col N="291" /> and the transitional period.  The Bill has been warmly welcomed by people who have been awaiting conferral of Irish citizenship. I have sought the amendment of this legislation for many years and I welcome the Minister's initiative in introducing this legislation.  The transitional period covers children who may be three to five years old whose parents should have registered by 31 December 1986. During that period people living in countries with Embassy and Consul General representation, who were eligible to apply for citizenship would have had access to information about it because of publicity in local newspapers.  However, people eligible to apply who were living in countries with no representation and where no information was available were not able to exercise their rights and avail of the transitional period.  I know of a diplomat who lived in Cameroon who was not informed about this Bill and could not apply on the basis of his grandmother's citizenship.  If people could prove they were not informed about this provision would they now be eligible under the legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise some points about the section, which ostensibly ties up the loose ends of the Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986. Those two Acts, together with this Bill, form a neat but deceptive package of identity inasmuch as the Minister for Justice informed the House on 9 March it is for sale to anyone prepared to invest £1 million in this country.  That infamous <Col N="292" /> statement summed up more than this Bill ever could our approach to basic civil liberties.  By putting out to tender citizenship and the rights and privileges associated with it the Minister effectively sidelined the thousands of economically and politically dispossessed would-be refugees and potential immigrants fleeing persecution and want.</P>
      <P>In the House on 9 March the Minister, in the context of the wider international community, effectively informed us that there is a price tag on Irish citizenship. This is welcome news to the South African millionaire seeking a safe haven for the assets of his Swiss bank account or the wealthy Hong Kong industrialist casting a wary eye on 1997 and beyond.  However, the Minister's statement offers little comfort to the Albanians landing at Shannon with the few possessions they can carry, nor does it offer assurances to those who have lived here for years and who, while not the proud possessors of millions of pounds, may have made a substantial social, cultural and economic contribution to the life of their communities. Their only hope of gaining an Irish passport is to take their place in the Minister's arbitrary queues.</P>
      <P>Irish citizenship as defined by the 1956 and 1986 Acts and this Bill is primarily a matter of genetics or blood.  This limited view of nationality means that those of Irish descent who may never have set foot in this country and have few if any cultural or social links can acquire citizenship merely by descent.  The 1986 Act restricted this provision to a limited extent but the genetic principle remains. This is the first problem with the Irish concept of citizenship and identity.  It harks back to an age dominated by memories of the emigrant boat, in which a newly independent Government sought to make amends by granting citizenship to those emigrants' descendants for the tribulations of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's age demands rather more imaginative concepts of identity, concepts which go beyond the narrow confines of blood and soil and which take into account factors such as increased mobility, new ways of working and the <Col N="293" /> unhindered flow of media information. Citizenship is not only about identity, even in the broadest sense; it is primarily about civil, political, economic and social rights.  It is ironic that while we grant citizenship to third or fourth generation Irish descent, we fail to grant the most elementary right of citizenship, the right to vote, to the first generation of Irish emigrants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Rabbitte, and I am sorry he was not here yesterday evening because his comments are more relevant to a Second Stage debate when we may talk about our nationality laws.  We are discussing section 1, the definition section, which is not designed to deal with all the problems of emigration and nationality but with a specific problem that arose during a transitional period after the 1986 Act was passed.</P>
      <P>Yesterday evening Deputy Mitchell and Deputy O'Donnell raised the point of refugees and asylum and we had a reasonably good debate on that issue.  I gave a commitment then, as I did the last time I took Question Time, on a Refugee and Asylum Bill which is in the final stages of drafting in the Attorney General's Office and which I hope, will be through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer.  That is a matter to which Deputies Mitchell and O'Donnell, and I am sure Deputy Rabbitte, give high priority, as I do.  It is important to have a system on refugees and asylum seekers that is open, at arm's length from the Minister and not just independent but seen to be so.  It is important to have an appeals system in place and that is what I have set out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I talked last night about the interdepartmental committee set up in this area.  While I could not go into great detail on the provisions of the proposed Bill in advance of it being cleared by the Government, it follows very closely the lines of the recommendations of the indepartmental committee.  We are dealing here with a very specific question, the transitional period and the difficulties that arose for almost 4,000 people of Irish <Col N="294" /> ancestry and we are trying to right a great wrong.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of nationality and citizenship is tied in with the question of passports.  There is a strong incentive for people in, for example, the United States &mdash; this also applies to people in Hong Kong, South Africa and elsewhere &mdash; to have an Irish passport. Many people want Irish citizenship out of a sense of pride but the value of the passport is relevant because it gives the holder the right to travel freely within the European Union and to settle there.  The phenomenon of the passport arose in the early part of this century.  Up to that time people travelled freely from place to place and there was no big deal about a passport.  An indication of the way government has developed in the control of people's lives is that for each State there is now a very valuable document called a passport.</P>
      <P>What progress has been made in terms of a single European Union passport and, if introduced, will it affect nationality and citizenship?  Is European Union citizenship under discussion or what is the current status of that proposal?  Can we look forward to having an Irish passport with &ldquo;European Union&rdquo; stamped on it or is the original idea of a European Union passport still being considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister chiding me for not being here yesterday evening, I did not envisage the collapse of the debate so early.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on a European Union passport.  I was contacted last week by a businessman who was aware that the Bill was due to be taken this session and who claimed that on one visit last week to Brussels on business, on three separate occasions, including admision to the Commission building, he was <Col N="295" /> required to show his passport.  The man was under the impression that having passed the Single Act, that requirement had been abolished.  Is this document a security pass as distinct from a passport? Will this practice continue indefinitely for people who have regular business in Brussels?  On the point raised by Deputy Mitchell about a European passport, what does the Minister envisage in that context?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The maroon coloured passport now issued is a European Union passport.  Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, we are moving closer to European Union citizenship.  At a number of Council of Ministers meetings which dealt with emigration and nationality issues, we dealt with the changes which need to be introduced.  I am not sure we are as close to achieving this at European level as Deputies might expect.</P>
      <P>On the question of the free movement of people, we have come up with a compromise known as the &ldquo;Bangemann wave&rdquo;, a blue channel at points of entry for EU citizens who only have to wave their passports and they go into the country. As Deputy Rabbitte said, a number of our EU partners have different ways of enforcing this decision by the Council of Ministers.  My predecessors and successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs have been at pains to point out at Council of Ministers meetings, particularly at the General Affairs Council, the need to enforce this decision in a uniform way throughout the EU.  Even though Ireland and a number of other countries have a blue channel, other countries strictly adhere to the requirement that passengers show their passports.  They say they have internal reasons for doing this. However, this creates difficulties for Irish and other EU citizens to move about as freely as we said they would be able to.  I will continue to raise this issue &mdash; I know the Tánaiste will do likewise &mdash; at Council of Minister's meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot comment on the specific point raised by Deputy Rabbitte about people <Col N="296" /> who are asked to show their passports when entering one of the European institutions. All I can say is that sometimes one can be asked for a form of identification &mdash; for example, a driver's licence, passport, credit card etc.  I am not sure if the person to whom Deputy Rabbitte referred was specifically asked for his passport, but if the Deputy gives me the details, I will raise the matter at the Council of Ministers' meeting.  It is not necessary for people to show their passports when entering an EU institution as most people who travel to Brussels, for example, civil servants, Ministers and business people, do so on a regular basis to do business with the institutions, etc. There is much confusion about this issue because the requirements differ in every country.  Ireland is more advanced than some other EU countries in that we have a special channel at points of entry for EU passport holders.  This channel is not available in all other EU countries and even in countries which have such a channel, passengers may still be asked for their passports from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Passengers travelling between Britain and Ireland can pass through the blue channel and there is no difficulty.  However, given that we are now calling the European Community the European Union, it is absurd that passengers travelling to, say, Amsterdam or Paris are asked at the ticket desk in Dublin Airport if they have their passport with them.  I cannot envisage this happening in the case of passengers flying from Texas to Massachusetts; it does not apply.  Such a requirement runs contrary to the concept of a Union.  Regardless of the reasons for it, this requirement should be done away with and Ireland should be to the forefront in doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will hold the Presidency of the EU in 1996.  We should set this date as a deadline for the removal of this requirement. If this requirement has not been removed by 1996 we should put it on the agenda of the Irish Presidency.  It is absurd that citizens of the EU should have to produce their passports before travelling to another EU country. I <Col N="297" /> cannot imagine this requirement being imposed in the case of passengers travelling between the Netherlands and Belgium or between Germany and France.</P>
    <P>Passengers at Dublin Airport have to show their passports before getting on a plane.  There is a very good arrangement in operation between Ireland and Britain.  Passengers may be required to show their passports for security reasons. However, one has only to look at the security arrangements between Ireland and Britain to see that there is no need to require passengers to show their passports. This requirement is a burden on the citizens of the European Union and should be discontinued.  I hope the Minister will pursue vigorously the removal of this requirement by 1996.  If it has not been removed before then we should put it on the agenda of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legal requirement on an Irish citizen travelling to any European capital city to show their passport at Dublin Airport. This requirement has been put in place by Aer Lingus, and not by the Government. I cannot say for definite but I imagine the reason Aer Lingus does this is to ensure that it does not carry a passenger to Amsterdam or Brussels who will not be allowed enter that country. Aer Lingus is probably doing us a favour by asking people if they have their passports with them.</P>
      <P>Members of the Government or civil servants who travel on the Government jet to Brussels to attend EU Council of Ministers meetings are not asked to produce their passports.  However, if something happens and these people have to travel back to Ireland on a regular flight they will not be able to get through customs without their passports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel as strongly as the Deputies opposite about the need for uniformity in this area.  Since the Treaty was passed successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice have been pointing out the need for uniformity.  The kind of uniformity introduced was the famous &ldquo;Bangemann wave&rdquo; where passengers held <Col N="298" /> their passports in their hands and walked through a blue channel.  It would not be so bad if a similar system was introduced in all member states, but the internal structures within a number of countries have prevented this from happening.  I am prepared to take on board Deputy Mitchell's suggestion that Ireland should push very strongly for uniformity in this matter and perhaps set 1996 for the introduction of a uniform system in the twelve EU member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishing industry is a valuable contributor to the Irish economy and it is well worth protecting.  The purpose of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill is to increase that protection and to help create an environment in which the industry can develop and grow.  Before getting into the details of the Bill, however, I would like to comment briefly on the outcome of yesterday's Fisheries Council meeting as the aims of this Bill and the outcome of the Council, in the nature of things are interlinked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council yesterday adopted a framework regulation &mdash; and I am using these words advisedly because we must know the meaning of the words we are using.  I pay tribute to <i>The Irish Times</i> for its leading article this morning in which it makes the point that we are looking for information, explanation and communication and I agree thoroughly with the point of view set out therein.  When I use the words &ldquo;the Council yesterday adopted a framework regulation under which detailed measures will be implemented&rdquo;, I am telling the House that this is a draft framework regulation and nothing has been settled.  There is <Col N="301" /> much in it and it is worth studying.  The draft framework regulation will be completed by the end of the year and, in the meantime, much of what we sought yesterday is in that draft framework.  We sought to have some matters included in the draft framework which have not been included but between now and the end of the year we would hope to negotiate on those matters we could not have included yesterday.</P>
    <P>The Council yesterday adopted a framework regulation under which detailed measures will be implemented to follow those currently applicable to Spanish and Portuguese vessels under the Iberian Act of Accession.  The Iberian Act of Accession was negotiated in 1986 and it is important to keep that in mind. If we are to go down the road of politics &mdash; which I do not want to do &mdash; that date should be kept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The adoption of this framework regulation does not prejudice the content of the detailed measures to be applied later this year.  On the contrary, the regulation contains a whole range of criteria, such as the avoidance of the risk to current balances, curtailment of fishing effort, the necessity to preserve the balance in the Irish Box and the socio-economic requirements of local populations which will be to Ireland's benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This regulation, taking into account the important declarations on sensitive areas and the Spanish fleet, is fully capable of ensuring that Ireland's needs are met if the final measures to be adopted are adequate.  What happened yesterday is as follows.  Sensitive areas are addressed within this framework regulation; that is what we wanted.  We wanted the size of the Spanish fleet cut back, we <Col N="302" /> got that and that is in the framework regulation.  What we did not get was agreement on the question of coastal State control over sensitive zones or boxes, but we hope to negotiate that between now and Christmas in the context of this draft framework regulation of which I am speaking.  All is not lost. These measures will be brought forward later this year and we will continue to fight every inch of the way to obtain a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>The deal adopted yesterday is better and significantly so for Ireland than that on offer last December.  Any fair minded person will agree that when we entered into negotiation last December, Spain and Portugal had a free run; it was open season effectively, full access to Irish waters.  We prevented that happening. Credit must be given where it is due.  I appreciate the comments of some of the leaders of the fishing organisations yesterday who recognise the reality of what we sought to achieve.  Indeed from Spain's perspective, it accepted and voted for a deal yesterday which it could not accept or vote for last December. This deal does not give free rein to the Spanish fleet and there is no question that the final measures will do so either.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I voted against yesterday's outcome for three reasons, first, to preserve the possibility of mounting a legal challenge against the regulation; second, because the Council did not agree advance guarantees on controls I felt to be essential and, third, to signal the political importance we attach to this issue in the interests of our fishing industry. Yesterday a journalist stated that this was the first time in years that Ireland was beaten by 11 to one.  I asked what was wrong with Ireland standing up for itself; what was wrong with Ireland being at the wrong end of a boat in this regard? It is not about time we showed our independence, that we are different, that we are looking for different things in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>

    <Col N="303" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We were not in the wilderness; that is the point I am making.  It is about time we stood up for ourselves instead of giving things away in a spirit of <i>communitaire</i>, which is what has been wrong with this country over the years.  I stand over my action and tactics and feel totally vindicated by the outcome. Indeed, it will stand to us in the continuing negotiations in that we have achieved maximum advantage from the negotiations and have not conceded anything which would be prejudicial to the next stage.  On the contrary, we have set the agenda for that stage by tabling a clear statement of Ireland's precise requirements on specific control arrangements. I feel neither defeated nor embarrassed by an eleven to one verdict because our stand is a principled one, wholly justifiable, and we will continue to pursue it.</P>
      <P>I am not in the least worried about voting against something which does not meet our interests.  Not to have done so would have weakened our position and options considerably.  The results of my action yesterday will not become evident for some months to come.  I think Spain will regret the decision it took in coming months; I think the action I took will redound to the advantage of our fishermen. That is my interpretation of it; I have no doubt other people may have other interpretations but that is what democracy is all about.  Time will tell.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of pursuing soft options at European level or of being drawn into cosy consensus for cosmetic purposes if our strategic interests are at stake.  I intend to stand up for Ireland's fishing interests at every opportunity, on a principled basis, in pursuit of a fair deal for a decent industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the main business of this debate, I will now outline the primary objectives of this Bill which are, first, to provide for tougher penalties for serious fisheries offences, including the possible confiscation of vessels in the case of serious or persistent offenders; second, to amend the law in respect of the licensing and registration of fishing vessels to take account of considerations of economic <Col N="304" /> links in the granting or refusal of licences; third, to strengthen procedures for the detention of fishing boats and the seizure of fish and gear where an offence is suspected; fourth, to impose certain controls on the fishing, sale and possession of eels.  I think one Member on the Fine Gael benches &mdash; I think it is Deputy McGrath &mdash; will be particularly interested in the section of the legislation dealing with eels because he has been pressing for it for some considerable time; and fifth, to increase the protection afforded to fisheries officers through substantially tougher penalties for assault &mdash; that arises out of the Ballycotton tragedy.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the House previously my serious concern about illegal fishing in Irish waters.  As Minister with responsibility for both the Marine and Defence I have taken steps to bring about maximum co-operation between the services involved in fisheries protection so as to achieve the best possible results.  I am very pleased to say that, when I became Minister for the Marine and Defence I brought together the two Departments in the common interest of the objective we seek to achieve, namely, the protection of Irish waters.  That small group of people are working very effectively and efficiently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am glad we remained afloat.  We were on a very nice boat, in the hands of a very good fisherman, a decent captain who, if I may say so, gave us a very good meal at about midnight in very rough waters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been Barry's Tea; I did not take a note of the box but I am sure it was.  Experience in recent years has shown that, despite the considerable fines imposed by the courts, certain categories of vessels have continued to flout and ignore the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of the 1983 Act provided <Col N="305" /> that, on a second conviction on indictment for illegal fishing or other offences, at its discretion the court could order a boat to be confiscated.  However, in practice, following a first conviction, vessel owners systematically contrive to eliminate the possibility of confiscation by transferring the ownership of vessels to new companies.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed in section 14 of the Bill will remedy this by permitting the court to order the forfeiture of a vessel, first, where the offence, or a combination of offences, is considered by the court to constitute a serious abuse of conservation measures and, second, where the conviction is a second or subsequent conviction for an offence committed on board the same ship within three years of the date of the commission of the previous offence.  Where it is suspected that a change of ownership was effected in order to evade the risk of forfeiture in the event of a further conviction, the onus of proving, to the satisfaction of the court, that the change of ownership was bona fide will rest with the defendant.  In the nature of things, as I understand it, that means that the burden of proof shifts, or perhaps it does not.</P>
    <P>Some Members might feel that confiscation of fishing boats should be mandatory.  Consideration was given to the introduction of mandatory penalties but, having reflected on the matter, I have concluded that, notwithstanding the serious nature of certain offences, the imposition of penalties should be left to the discretion of our courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would be afraid of a diplomatic upheaval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No, our courts are able to manage our judical system.  In the circumstances, penalties should be left to the discretion of our courts.  Inevitably, if somebody else, in a political context, tries to impose penalties all sorts of charges will be made.  Our courts are independent and constitute the proper route through which these penalties should be channelled and handed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> In the course of preparation of this Bill I gave serious consideration also to the level of fines that may be imposed by the courts.  In particular I became concerned about the considerable amount of evidence that has come to light regarding the number of vessels using hidden holds for the storage of illegal fish or undersized nets.  Accordingly, I should like to take this opportunity to indicate that, on Committee Stage, I propose to increase the penalties for having a concealed fish hold or undersized nets from £10,000 to £50,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy feels aggrieved at my softness or whatever, would he please table an amendment and I will be glad to address it.  I might not accept it but I will take a very serious look at it.</P>
      <P>The Bill will also give the Minister powers to ensure that people who are granted sea fishing boat licences have a real economic link with this country.  In 1991 the European Court of Justice gave its support to the principle that member states have the right to set requirements which ensure that such a link exists between boats fishing off quotas and the coastal communities and regions which the quotas were designed to benefit.  The Bill will allow the Minister to take account of the economic benefit that the operation of a boat will have for Ireland when considering an application for a fishing licence.  This requirement will prevent the practice of quota hopping whereby boats from one State are registered under the flag of another solely for the purpose of gaining access to the latter's quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Court of Justice expressed its view on the concept of economic link in the context of its ruling that the provisions in Irish law which restricted the right to <Col N="307" /> licence and register fishing boats in Ireland to Irish nationals and bodies corporate were contrary to the terms of the Treaty of Rome which prohibit discrimination on grounds of nationality and protect the right of establishment.</P>
    <P>Those restrictions are removed in this Bill and the right to license and register fishing boats is extended to nationals and bodies corporate of member states. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that, by requiring that applicants establish a real economic link, the Bill will ensure that Irish quotas are used and will continue to be used for the benefit of this country.</P>
    <P>The Ballycotton inquiry into the tragic deaths of four fisheries officers highlighted the need for increased protection for fisheries officers against assault and the penalties proposed reflect that view. In bringing forward these proposals I am taking account of the recommendations of the tribunal.  Under the new provisions those convicted on indictment of having assaulted a fishery officer will face up to five years imprisonment and such fine as the court may deem appropriate having regard to the seriousness of the offence.</P>
    <P>It is important that we recognise the essential work carried out by our fisheries officers, often in difficult and dangerous circumstances and that we provide adequate protection for them in our laws. To this end I have considered this matter further and propose to introduce an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage which will provide for penalties for those who obstruct an officer in the course of his duties.  By introducing these measures I want to clearly indicate our support for fisheries officers in their important work.  They do a very difficult job in dangerous circumstances and I pay tribute to them for their courage.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes provisions to tighten controls on the catching, possession and export of eels.  Increasingly in recent years licensed eel fishermen operating on lakes in the midlands have suffered assault and have had their gear and catch stolen by armed gangs of poachers.  Existing provisions have not been found to be sufficient in dealing <Col N="308" /> with this problem and it is, therefore, proposed to tighten controls on fishing for, dealing in and the possession of eels, including eels which are intended for export.</P>
    <P>The Bill also addresses a number of administrative weaknesses and regulatory deficiencies in the existing law.  It is proposed in particular to amend section 373 of the Merchant Shipping Act, which relates to the registration of fishing vessels, so as to update penalties for registration offences.  It is also proposed to give the Minister the power to make and amend regulations governing the operation of the Fishing Boat Register and to provide an appropriate statutory basis for the Minister, in certain circumstances to remove a vessel from the sea fishing boat register so as to deal with certain anomalies that have arisen.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of this Bill address many of the major issues facing the fishing industry and strikes a fair balance between the need to comply with EU Treaty obligations and the valid objective of securing a fair share of fishery resources for our economy.</P>
    <P>The Bill clearly underlines our resolve to protect the rights of the communities who depend on fishing and to make sure that anyone seeking to abuse their access to our waters will think twice before engaging in illegal fishing or committing other fisheries offences.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister back from Luxembourg.  I am sure he finds the waters of Dáil Éireann a little calmer than those he faced yesterday. I will respond briefly to the Minister's comments on yesterday's negotiations.  I agree that everything is not lost, that there is still a big battle ahead but we have to recognise that yesterday's results were disappointing and the Minister will have much work to do to redress the balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear for Ireland's standing at EU negotiations.  As a result of recent controversies on EU funding has our standing and the ability of Irish Ministers to fight the good fight been diminished?  Has sympathy for Ireland which was always <Col N="309" /> apparent been diminished?  If so, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, and the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, will find negotiations more difficult in the months ahead, as a result of which all of us will suffer.  I hope that the damage caused in recent months by wild statements from Ministers, including the Taoiseach, can be repaired and we can win back our good name in Brussels.  That is important from all our points of view.</P>

      <P>Perhaps our good name has not been lost but the Minister will concede that the attitude of the EU towards our country in the past number of months is different.  Senior officials in the EU were insulted by a Government Minister and that did not go down well. It makes the Minister's job more difficult as I am sure he found yesterday.  It also makes the job of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, more difficult.  I hope that any difficulties caused by the Taoiseach and other Ministers can be resolved.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister well <Col N="310" /> in his negotiations during the next few months as they are of vital economic importance for the country, for our fishermen and the fishing industry.  The Minister stated that he opposed the package because first, he needed an opportunity to make a legal challenge and questions on this subject have been tabled for this afternoon.  I will be interested to tease out what type of legal challenge it may be possible to mount and its chances of success.  Second, the Minister was concerned about the lack of a guaranteed control bearing in mind the admission of Spanish boats and, third he had to have regard for the political importance of the debate.  For those three sound reasons the Minister had no choice but to oppose the package.  The Minister was right to say that he was not embarrassed by the 11:1 defeat.  If the Minister can turn an 11:1 defeat into a victory he should be appointed to manage a soccer team at the bottom of division 4 because they would appreciate the turning of such a loss into victory.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation in that it is comprehensive and will benefit the fishing industry.  The new penalties including the power to seize boats, are welcome and must be implemented.  I am satisfied with the Minister's willingness to table amendments on Committee Stage to increase some of the penalties provided for in the Bill.  I look forward to hearing what my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, has to say on the size of the penalties.  In most cases a fine of £50,000 or £100,000 will not be sufficient for big fishing boats from Spain fishing illegally in our waters.  It is a drop in the ocean compared with the economic return which their illegal operations generate. I hope the Minister will be willing to accept further amendments on that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main purposes <Col N="311" /> of the Bill is to allow for the registration and licensing of EU boats.  The EU has given us no choice but to bring this legislation forward.  There is the danger that we will see a large increase in the number of foreign boats licensed to fish in our waters.  It is difficult for the fishing industry to respond to such a threat when it does not have the same level of State support or quality of boat as its competitors.  It will now be possible for foreign trawlers to register and obtain a licence to fish and we must ensure our fishing industry has the capacity to develop, through State aid, to meet this challenge.  We must ensure fishermen are enabled to buy bigger and better boats.  I hope the Minister will be successful in obtaining grant aid for them.</P>
      <P>Section 5 is designed to prevent abuse of sections 3 and 6 which allow for the registration and licensing of foreign boats.  It gives the Minister power to consider disallowing registrations or licences on the grounds that the trawler owners would not make a genuine or generous economic return to this country.  The section is well intentioned and designed to protect the Irish fleet, but how effective would it be if challenged through the European Court?  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Court of Justice expressed its view on the concept of economic link in the context of its ruling that the provisions in Irish law which restricted the right to licence and register fishing boats in Ireland to Irish nationals and bodies corporate were contrary to the terms of the Treaty of Rome....</P>
      <P>Is the Minister confident that section 5 is not in breach of the Treaty?  If as a result of the court's ruling they have a general right to a licence and to register here, are we allowed lay down regulations which would prevent them so doing on economic grounds?  What legal advice has the Minister obtained on this question?  It would be disastrous if section 5 were found to be contrary to European law.</P>

    <P>In a number of sections the Minister <Col N="312" /> delegates powers to others, for example, the power to register and license.  Who will be given these powers?  I presume there would not be hundreds of applications for registration and licensing and it would not be a matter which would take up an undue amount of the Minister's time.  Why does he think it necessary to delegate these powers and at what level will these important decisions be taken?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>We can deal with it in greater detail on Committee Stage.  The Ballycotton tragedy led to the insertion of section 15.  The Minister said he is stating loudly and clearly the Government's intention to offer full support to fishery protection officers.  We all agree with that.  They are doing a good job on behalf of the State.  However, in some areas there are strong feelings of ill will and major problems.  These need to be addressed.  There is need for these officers but they can only work efficiently if they receive the full co-operation of everyone involved in the industry.  That will not be forthcoming unless people feel that they are doing their job fairly.  From time to time I have heard complaints about the qualifications necessary to become a fishery protection officer and about the recruitment procedure generally. Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position.  Not only should the job description be tightened but we should have a clearer view of the type of person who should be recruited and the qualifications necessary for these important posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister addresses eel fishing, an issue often raised by Deputy McGrath who highlighted the severe problems faced by eel fishermen following physical atacks and assaults on them by individuals and groups, sometimes, it was suspected, of a subversive nature.  The Minister's proposal is a step in the right direction in regularising the industry.  The Bill proposes to bring it in under the same regulations as govern <Col N="313" /> salmon fishing.  While we will never have perfect legislation, the proposals for eel fishing are a vast improvement on the existing regulations.  We can go through this in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider introducing a fisheries consolidation Bill. Going through the Bill and particularly section 14 there are numerous provisions where it is necessary to refer to different legislation.  That would certainly make the jobs of those who regulate the industry straightforward and make things easier for everybody.  Will the Minister respond to this point?</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because the new penalties and controls will be necessary when the Spanish fleet, in particular, has greater access to our waters.  I hope these new measures will help to protect the livelihoods of Irish fishermen and those involved in the industry.  We are unable to offer full protection to our fisheries because of insufficient fishery protection vessels.  I accept that this is a question of finance but the Minister will have to fight at Cabinet for additional funding to ensure that moneys are made available for fishery protection vessels.  The Department of the Marine and the Naval Service are fighting an uphill battle against huge trawlers and it will become more difficult in the months and years ahead unless extra resources are made available either through the budget of the Department of the Marine or the Department of Defence.  If the provisions of this Bill are to succeed and the industry to develop in a regulated fashion, more resources are needed to enforce the law.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the more detailed examination of the Bill on Committee Stage.  Suggestions will be put forward in a non-political fashion &mdash; the fishing industry was never a highly politicised area.  Perhaps one of the reasons for its underdevelopment is that it has never had the full political attention it deserves. I hope the Minister will respond in a reasonable way to our amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to hear suggestions and amendments and take <Col N="314" /> a very positive view of some of the Deputy's suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I too was saddened to learn about the incident in Europe when the Minister was let down at the eleventh hour.  We must ensure he is aware that we are fully behind him in these negotiations. We hope he will not be discouraged and will fight the battle to the bitter end.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill on behalf of my party and pay tribute to the Minister for moving to amend the law to protect our national resources.  The provisions are long overdue and I am sure the new measures proposed will help to consolidate our approach to the development of the fishing industry.  For too long our fishing industry has been exposed to exploitation.  We must now act in a determined way to ensure that the foundations are laid for the protection of our fisheries, both inland and in the waters around our coasts.</P>
      <P>There can be no denying that fisheries has been a Cinderella industry, always promised State assistance and encouragement to develop but seldom given the means to embark on a programme of enlightened investment and conservation. The rich harvest of the sea has provided food and jobs, our fishing fleet has been upgraded but that is largely due to individuals of vision with the will to see their dreams come to fruition.</P>
      <P>The European fishing industry is in crisis and even the European Union Fisheries Commissioner, Mr. Paleokrassas, admitted this.  He said that the overall fishery sector in the European Union is going through a tough time and we have seen the recent problems in the French market when the European Union reintroduced minimum prices for certain white fish and Atlantic salmon.  The crisis goes deeper than the problems of one market and the situation is rapidly going out of control.  Only last month the crisis in the fishing industry was debated in the European Paraliament and the MEPs roundly condemned the inaction of the Commission and its clear lack of political will to resolve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> The fact that Norway is engaged in talks with a view to joining the European Union is another cause for concern for the future of the European Union fishing fleet and has direct implications for Ireland's fisherman who land their quota of salmon from the north Atlantic.  The proposed enlargement of the European Union poses many vital questions for the Irish fishing industry.  Norwegian salmon production costs are subsidised to the tune of 20 per cent and facts and figures to support this claim were put forward in the European Parliament.  With its salmon production set to grow by 50 per cent by 1995 Norway could fill the entire demand of the European Union.  These are important matters for our representatives in the European Parliament and have even greater significance for Government Ministers who have the power to amend proposals and ensure that the European Union fishing fleet is protected.  The current crisis in the European fishing industry is best illustrated by the fact that an Irish skipper had to accept £23 for a box of hake instead of around £54 which he had expected.  While the low price of fish is the main problem there are the broader questions of policy such as dumping and compensation which we must address in the short term.</P>
    <P>The Bill must be welcomed because it tackles some of the traditional abuses which have retarded the proper development of the Irish fishing industry.  I am pleased that it strengthens the legal procedures for the detention of fishing boats and the seizure of fish and boat engines where an offence is suspected.  For too long we have been the &ldquo;soft touch&rdquo; of Europe with foreign trawlers plundering our rich fishing grounds at will and doing untold harm to irreplaceable fish stocks. This plunder and rape of the seas around our coast must be tackled.</P>
    <P>The influx of foreign trawlers to the fishing grounds off the west coast is beyond a national or Euro joke.  We do not have the resources to deal with the problem.  Huge Russian factory ships dwarf the protection vessels of the Naval Service.  Whereas our fishery protection <Col N="316" /> fleet acts in a most courageous and dedicated manner, the simple fact remains that it does not have the sophisticated, modern high-tech equipment to track down and apprehend these offenders who are plundering our seabed.  Deputy Bradford and I agree &mdash; I have raised this matter at Question Time &mdash; that we need to look for financial assistance to provide bigger patrol boats around our coast.  I was pleased to hear that the Minister for Justice had received encouraging information from the European Union that something would be forthcoming. Deputy Bradford made the remark that we must police fishing activities around our coasts.</P>
    <P>The encroachment of non-EU trawlers and fishing boats into our fishing waters is a problem for the European Commission but it seems to tolerate the current crisis in the fishing industry.  While I am aware of the controversial proposal from the Commission to introduce satellite monitoring, the debate on the funding of pilot projects is ongoing.  Irish Members of the European Parliament have welcomed the provision of 100 per cent finance for pilot projects but the tracking of offending ships is a matter of concern.  The fact remains that many of the fishing vessels engaged in illegal fishing are registered outside the European Union and escape sanction.  I am pleased that this Bill will tighten the law on licensing and the registration of fishing boats according equal treatment to nationals and bodies corporate of member states of the European Union under Irish legislation.</P>
    <P>The power to implement the provisions of the Bill must be delegated to the duly appointed officers designated by the Minister and the Department.  I pay tribute to our fishery protection officers for providing a sterling service ensuring that our natural resources are protected from illegal exploitation.  It is no secret that they have come under threat in the line of duty; they have been attacked and injured as they go about their lawful duty on behalf of the State.  They must be protected with the full force of the law.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to impose heavy fines and terms of imprisonment on <Col N="317" /> people convicted of assaulting officers. Some people seem to have adopted an ambivalent attitude to the protection of fishery officers.  Incidents at sea involving illegal fishing have resulted in assaults and injuries, yet some elements in society treat the matter in a light hearted way as if their sympathy lies with the poacher and those who engage in a game of cat and mouse with the fishery protection officers.  Our history has tended to glamorise the poacher but today there are shadowy and secretive elements linked to subversives who muscle in on illegal fishing activities.  We must be conscious of this trend and take firm action to prevent the men of violence controlling any segment of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Increased protection of fishery officers was one of the recommendations in the report on the Ballycotton Tribunal but questions such as safety and training could usefully be explored by the Minister and his Department to ensure that the fishery protection service is fully equipped to meet the threat posed by illegal and subversive activities.</P>
    <P>While I give a general welcome to the provisions of the Bill, section 21 causes a degree of confusion.  This section deals with the penalties to be imposed in cases involving the purchase, sale or possession of unseasonable or unlawfully captured salmon, trout or eel.  There seems to be a contradiction; if a person charged with an offence can prove that the salmon was lawfully captured the charge shall be dismissed.  If the person can prove that the salmon was lawfully captured there would be no need for a court appearance.</P>
    <P>The reason I refer to this section is that our inland waterways and fisheries have the potential to be developed to boost angling tourism in some of the most scenic areas of the country.  In the midwest, on the lakes of Clare and the Shannon Estuary, angling has considerable potential to be developed as a tourism activity.  The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board &mdash; in particular Eamon Cusack and Jim Robinson &mdash; is doing tremendous work marketing the area nationally and abroad to attract anglers and fishermen to the region.  During the next six months <Col N="318" /> up to 1,000 foreign anglers will visit the Shannon Estuary.  Most of the fish caught will be returned live to the water.  The local economy will be boosted by the presence of so many anglers fishing in local competitions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister in deciding an application for a fishing boat licence, will take into account criteria such as landings at Irish ports, the creation of employment and local expenditure. Ireland offers wild, fighting freshwater fish and a range of warm and cold water fish.  We offer quality angling in the most unpolluted rivers, lakes and seas in Europe.  We must not destroy these natural advantages by unplanned developments which prove damaging to the environment.</P>
    <P>There are six million registered anglers in Britain and, this market has been targeted by bodies such as Bord Fáilte. Angling tourism will only be developed if there is easy access to our lakes, rivers and sea fishing.  Ireland benefits from the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and the seafood rich western European continental shelf.  Because of these geographic advantages we can offer the sea angler a range of excellent opportunities. Quality angling is available from rocks, piers, beaches or small boats in bays and inlets.  We can also offer deep sea fishing. We are right to be concerned about the long term future of the fishing industry, be it the deep sea commercial harvesting of fish or the sporting activities of local and foreign anglers.</P>
    <P>While we have a commercial interest in this area we must also act from a conservation viewpoint.  We must not over-fish the seas; we must have an enlightened policy on capture and conservation. As some of our European partners do not share our views &mdash; there has been evidence of this during the past few days &mdash; we face an uphill battle.  While there is a need for increased conservation measures there is also a definite demand for the restructuring of the European fishing sector.  Senior European Commission officials admit that support for such a move may not be forthcoming from all member states.  Herein lies the <Col N="319" /> problem; if all member states cannot agree to abide by the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy what chance have we, a small nation on the edge of Europe, of protecting our valuable fishing waters?</P>
    <P>This question goes to the heart of European Union policy.  I urge the Minister to act now in a bid to resolve the crisis in the fishing industry.  We wish him every success in this task.  I also ask him to examine ways of improving maritime safety.  It is distressing that in the first six weeks of 1994 more than 100 seafarers died at sea.  These deaths can be attributed to substandard ships and to the fact that operators put profit before safety. Many countries have failed to implement the rules of the International Maritime Organisation and this trend is disturbing. I urge the Minister to take these points into consideration in future legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, limited though it is, is welcome and should be considered in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy which since its inception, has been beset by a variety of problems. These include the inability of all sectors of the industry to conserve certain stocks, to protect fishermen and fish processors against cheap imports from non-European Union sources and the difficulty of progressively modernising fishing fleets without unnecessarily threatening fish stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against this background of recurring problems that the policy makers have adopted a strategy to try to ensure that the industry can face the future with some possibility of survival, if not revival. The strategy can be summed up in one phrase: balancing fishing effort with existing or projected fish stocks.  In simple terms this means that fishing capacity, that is, the number and types of fishing vessels, should only be deployed to the extent to which a given quantity of fish stocks is available.  Matching fishing capacity to available resources means further regulation of the industry both by Ireland and Brussels.  This has already started with the Department of the <Col N="320" /> Marine proposals issued before Christmas on decommissioning, fleet categorisation and licensing.  Indeed, a voluntary decommissioning scheme which is expected to be fully operational later this year &mdash; although I understand it may not come into effect here until the middle of next year &mdash; will have immediate and long term consequences for fishermen in Ireland and specifically for Howth fishermen and fishermen on the east coast.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the multi-annual guidance plan for the Irish fishing fleet, agreed between the Irish Government and the European Commission in December 1992, Ireland will have to make specific reductions in a number of segments of its national fleet between 1993 and 1996.  That will seriously affect the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>This Bill is also being debated under the shadow of one of the most serious developments for our fishing industry since we joined the European Community. It is hard to overstate the implications of the decision of the Council of Marine Ministers to allow virtually unfettered access to the Irish Box by fishing vessels from Spain and Portugal.  The decision will make the development of our fishing industry all the more difficult. Despite what the Minister may argue, last night's decision is a defeat.  It has been suggested that the Minister sounds like the managers of the Irish football teams of old who constantly tried to convert an 11:1 defeat into a moral victory. I can understand why the Minister would want to do that but it is a futile exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very tolerant of Ministers who interrupt.  The decision to allow the Spanish and Portuguese access to the Irish Box may have been legal but it is not just.  When the appalling record of the Spanish is taken into account the reality is that piracy has been rewarded, flouting of international law has paid dividends and ignoring conservation rules has reaped rewards.</P>
      <P>The record of the Spanish so far, with their limited access to Irish waters, has been appalling.  We can only wonder what they will do now that the Council of Ministers has granted them the freedom of Irish waters.  One out of every two Spanish vessels boarded is detained for serious fishery offences, nearly three-quarters of these vessels were in breach of the terms of the Iberian Act of Accession and, apart from these breaches, there were also serious infringements relating to logbooks and undersized fish.  Since accession, 40 per cent of the vessels on the basic list have been arrested for serious offences.  There has been a recent and serious development in the discovery of many Spanish vessels with secret holds and compartments.  If this has been their record with limited access, what can we expect now that they have virtually full access?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Spanish fishing fleet is huge.  It accounts for more than half of the European Union's registered fishing tonnage and its population of 38 million provides a huge market and rich reward for Spanish vessels.  The official estimate of the value <Col N="322" /> of fish taken legally from our waters by Spanish boats is around £70 million.  Who knows what the real value is when illegal catches are taken into account.  It is huge business in Spain with the best part of 60,000 jobs at sea and on land created by this limited access to Irish waters.  Our 1,400 vessels, mainly small craft, cannot expect to compete on an equal footing with this huge business and are entitled to special consideration.</P>
    <P>Ireland accounts for just over 3 per cent of the Community catch, but we have 16 per cent of the Community's waters. Apart from any other consideration we now face the virtually impossible task of policing this huge area to ensure that quotas are honoured and conservation measures respected.  With the exception of Luxembourg, Ireland's naval fleet is probably the smallest in the Community, yet it is expected to police 16 per cent of Community waters.  The Naval Service is already overstretched.  It is expected to play a crucial role in the war against drugs, smuggling and provide backup in the battle against terrorism. We have only a handful of vessels and, as often as not, a number of these are tied up in port for maintenance.  It is fair to assume that the numbers of Spanish vessels arrested and detained by the Naval Service represent only the tip of the iceberg.  The real fear must now be that Spanish pirates will run riot and clear out our fishing waters.</P>
    <P>The additional powers and penalties in this Bill are welcome, but how are they to be enforced?  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill tells us that there are no direct costs or staffing implications. It seems that the Government does not intend to provide any additional resources, extra staff or new vessels to take on the additional responsibilities. The cost of existing fishery protection measures are already substantial, amounting to around £60 million a year or almost one third of the value of our fish catch.  What contribution is the European Union going to make in these circumstances?</P>
    <P>We are now paying a heavy price for years of mismanagement and neglect by <Col N="323" /> successive Governments.  There have been few areas where we have consistently got such a poor deal from the European Union as in fisheries.  When we joined the Community little attention was paid to fisheries by our negotiators; we put all our energies into ensuring that the farmers were looked after.  Irish protests about fisheries policy are regarded as something of a joke in the corridors in Brussels.  Too often in the past Irish Marine Ministers have been seen to beat their chests, jump up and down and threaten all sorts of vetoes and court actions only to meekly walk away when the crunch comes.  In 1992 the then Minister Deputy Woods, threatened to go to the European Court to block changes proposed under the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, and he backed down.  This Minister made the same threatening noises about proposed access to the Irish Box by the Spanish and Portuguese vessels only to perform a similarly spectacular retreat.  We have failed to learn the lesson of the boy who cried wolf once too often.</P>

      <P>The policy seems to have been to give good copy to the headline writers at home and keep the head down when it comes to decision time.  Perhaps our Minister should have taken a leaf out of the book of the Norwegian Minister for Fisheries, Mr. Jan Henri Olsen who, when negotiations on Norwegian accession had reached a crucial point over the fisheries issue, said &ldquo;I will stand tall and firm and say no&rdquo;.

      <P>Despite being an island nation our fishing industry has not been developed to the maximum.  Our job creation record in fishing and fish processing is disappointing.  Our record is particularly poor compared with other island countries, such as Iceland, where almost one-fifth of the population is engaged in fishing or fish processing. The fishing industry here has made only a limited contribution to our economic development and the latest decision will not only further restrict the potential for development but may also threaten existing jobs.  With just 16 per cent of Community waters and taking only 3 per <Col N="325" /> cent of the catch, Ireland is clearly not responsible for overcapacity or a threat to fish stocks.  We should not be made a scapegoat for the difficulties of the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about carrying the can and said there is little point complaining about yesterday's defeat but it would be more constructive if we concentrated on the conditions which would make the abolition of the box acceptable to Irish fishing interests.  It should be abolished on the basis that new entrants would be rigorously controlled.  The Minister should take a stand on this issue. Obviously, that would imply resources being made available to implement the regulations which would mean insisting on greater assistance from the European Union.  Infringements should result in withdrawal of licences for at least one year from vessels seized by the authorities in breach of European or Irish law.  More important, the abolition of the box should not mean that the European Union will hand over the valuable resources in those waters for exclusive use by Spain and Portugal.  Irish fishermen should be in an equal position to exploit those waters.  One of the main arguments in favour of abolition is the failure of Government and the sector to use the period since 1983 to maximise fishing opportunities and to construct a viable and well integrated sector.  It is argued that, if we do not exploit the box, refusal smacks of a dog in the manger attitude.  A serious commitment to developing the fishing sector is the only realistic way forward for its survival.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy from County Donegal, where the majority of my constituency is bordered by the sea, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1994. Since entering politics I have been deafened by people shouting about the plundering of our waters and, in particular, about the failure of our laws to address the many problems pertaining to such plundering.  There is concern also that people have been able to hide catches in secret holds and so on and that <Col N="326" /> when our Naval Service instigate prosecutions it is discovered there are many loopholes in our laws.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing this long-awaited comprehensive legislation.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, in this House the fishing industry does not get the attention it deserves, it is not on the same level as agriculture in respect of the contribution it makes to our economy.  If it was not for the fishing industry in Killybegs unemployment in County Donegal would be much greater.  Since November the position in Burtonport, Rathmullen and Killybegs is untenable as our boats have not gone out since then because of bad weather.  We welcome the introduction by the Minister of an aid package to assist owners of white fish boats in particular. We are all aware that boat owners need assistance in making loan repayments to banks and other institutions; they are the entrepreneurs in the fishing industry.  I hope the Minister, in discussion with his officials and officials of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and fishing organisations, will place great emphasis on helping those in most need, namely, small fishermen.</P>
      <P>On the recent Social Welfare Bill we debated the problems of share fishermen which still need to be addressed.  I hope the Minister's package will help to alleviate the many problems faced by fishermen in my constituency which I am sure are shared by fishermen nationwide.  I commend him for his initiative on introducing the first ever aid package for the fishing industry and look forward to hearing from him in relation to its administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishing industry here employs approximately 15,000 people, not a large number, but important in a minority industry.  Unlike some Deputies, I see tremendous potential for the fishing industry here and am glad the Minister took such a strong stance at the European Union level to protect our fisheries and the fishing industry.  I do not know if many people would take the courageous step of becoming fishermen nowadays because not only would they have to deal with the dangers associated with fishing and the high seas, but also with bureaucracy and unfair competition from our <Col N="327" /> partners in the European Union.  Contrary to belief, the management and conservation of our fishing stocks is uppermost in the minds of fishermen and elected representatives.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had not taken a strong standpoint in December we would not have anything to say about what happened yesterday in respect of the Irish box.  We lost the vote by 11 to one, but not enough has been done to inform people about what really happened at that Council meeting.  I commend the Minister on his stance and hope we have a united front here in supporting him to get the best deal possible, given that the inevitable happened.  We knew the Spaniards would win one way or another in respect of the Irish Box in 1996.  As far as I am aware, this is the first time the Spaniards conceded in any way what has been sought for many years by successive Ministers for the Marine and Irish fishing organisations.  I welcome the fact that the Spaniards will have to bring their fleet size into line with their quotas.  We have done so for many years and it is regrettable that other countries did not do likewise. It is difficult to sell a concept to the fishing industry if it is not addressed by every member state.</P>
    <P>However, I agree with the Minister that all is not lost.  Hopefully, the new sensitive provisions will allow us fish our native waters and gain access to other waters. The Minister should vigorously pursue the control of those sensitive areas.  It has been suggested that fishermen should give notification on entry to box areas of the length of time they will fish in those areas.  This proposal should be addressed and strict controls imposed in respect of those sensitive areas.  Fishermen should not be allowed to leave a Spanish port to fish in a sensitive area for a week without notifying the relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on a number of sections in the Bill.  Section 7 deals with the confiscation of a vessel and the arrest of its crew.  In the past a vessel was not confiscated for a first offence and ownership of many vessels was changed to avoid confiscation when a second <Col N="328" /> offence was committed.  That position was farcical.  Fishermen could come into port, be arrested and prosecuted and not be penalised.  I commend the Minister for tightening that loophole and hope the provisions in that section will resolve the problem.  I welcome the imposition of stricter penalties for illegal fishing which hopefully will deter such practice in our waters.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned about section 8 which gives additional powers to fishery officers to collect statistics, gain access to premises and so on.  I am aware a document dealing with control in this area has been agreed by the European Union and regulations will be introduced in that regard.  The system of using log sheets which has been used here for a number of years has worked well and the Minister should reconsider the providing of additional statistics.  That would result in many fishermen being pressurised to produce more paperwork and lead to greater bureaucracy.  I am aware the gathering of statistics has been advantageous in respect of the package the Minister has introduced but I question the necessity to amend the Principal Act in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is welcome.  I assume when people apply for licences the present tonnage requirements will apply.  I am pleased the matter of &ldquo;quota hopping&rdquo; will be addressed.  Large corporations that had no economic link with this country could fly flags of convenience and it is time that matter was addressed.  Many of our fishermen find it difficult to obtain licences when they have to buy tonnage, replacement tonnage and so on, and it is frustrating that other fishermen can plunder our waters and deplete our stock but make no return to our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has performed well in his portfolio but I hope there will not be despair after yesterday's talks.  I hope all Members of the House will support his efforts on behalf of the fishing industry. There is potential to develop our industry. Unfortunately, when we joined the EC we did not get our act together in respect of the fishing industry.  That is the fault of everybody, not this Minister or <Col N="329" /> former Ministers.  We did not realise the potential for fishing and have been plagued by reductions in quotas and an old fleet.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from a maritime constituency I see young people who would like to invest in the fishing industry deterred because they cannot afford to buy tonnage and replacement tonnage. There has been much criticism of the lending institutions who have not facilitated young people who wish to invest in the industry.  Perhaps at a later stage when the matters of the Irish Box and aid have been dealt with the Minister might consider the plight of young people who wish to invest in the industry.  Financial aid should be available for small fishermen to upgrade their boats.</P>
    <P>There is concern about the seaworthiness of vessels in our fleet and we all want to avoid further tragedies at sea. The Minister's Department has been excellent in promoting safety at sea and ensuring vessels are seaworthy but soon many vessels will be unseaworthy. However, fishermen, skippers and boat owners find it difficult to secure loans to replace vessels.  In Killybegs the super trawlers and entrepreneurship of some of the fishermen in the town have led to prosperity for some, but small fishermen, who are not publicity seekers or owners of big flagships, have lost out and require consideration.  While I am not very <i>au fait</i> with yields in my constituency I am pleased the Minister will address this area also.</P>
    <P>I welcome the granting of increased powers to sea fishery officers and measures to guarantee their protection. They do trojan work but have been attacked on numerous occasions.  Much work is needed in this area and I am sure the Minister will make every effort and use his contacts in the European Union to develop the industry.  I await the outcome of further discussions in respect of the former Irish Box and sensitive areas.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister back from Luxembourg, even though he did not bring with him the world wrestling <Col N="330" /> belt.  However, he is still in the ring, or at least he gives that impression.  I must question the decision of EC Ministers to allow Spanish and Portuguese fishing vessels access to the Irish 50 miles zone from 1 January 1996.  It is a deplorable decision that will have serious effects on the survival of the Irish fishing industry. The Minister, Deputy Andrews, should have adopted a more aggressive stance when he discovered he was going to be outvoted.  He should have used his powers of veto to protect this valuable industry for the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Great Britain succeeded in restricting access to the North Sea by Spanish and Portuguese trawlers, but our Minister was left high and dry as regards preserving the Irish 50 mile box.  To add insult to injury, there will be a further threat from the Norwegian and Faroe Island fishing trawlers from 1 January 1996.  The Minister should spell out the details of the Norwegian accession which was agreed about a month ago in the European Parliament. I cannot understand how such a decision was arrived at yesterday at the EC Fisheries Summit in Luxembourg when there was ample evidence of the restrictions imposed under the 1986 agreement.</P>
      <P>EC nations such as Spain which allow secret holds to be constructed in their fishing fleet to conceal illegal catches should be automatically debarred from the Irish fishing box for at least a decade. This would allow an already depleted fisheries stock to be built up to the maximum capacity.  I am amazed at the way some EC nations are allowed flagrantly and blatantly to flout EC laws and still be afforded preferential treatment from 1 January 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was the Minister, Deputy Andrews, left high and dry by the Government?  Why did the Taoiseach not give him a helping hand by going to meet the leaders of EU countries?  Surely this is a matter of such paramount importance the Taoiseach and even the Tánaiste should have travelled to meet the leaders <Col N="331" /> of EU countries before yesterday's meeting in Luxembourg?  They should have canvassed support to ensure that Ireland got its rightful share of the cake in terms of the North Atlantic fishing zones. However, the Taoiseach sat idly by.

The then Minister for Fisheries who is still a Member of the House, Deputy Brian Lenihan, did not give a damn if the Spaniards came up to the bridge of Athlone as long as he got his point across appertaining to agriculture and other matters. That is when the Irish fishing industry was sold down the drain.

      <P>The Bill seems to imply that proper surveillance will be carried out in future.  Will the Minister say if this surveillance will be carried out on Irish salmon fishermen or on the huge marauding Spanish fleet?  The Minister must ensure that all the regulations under this legislation are implemented to the letter of the law and that all European countries abide by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the Minister has closed the door after the horse has bolted.  I admire his courage and determination to raise this matter again at European level, <Col N="336" /> but before he takes on these European heavyweights I hope the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will help him by making direct contact with their European counterparts.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that a draft framework will be completed by the end of the year.  What will it entail?  The Minister's speech today needs to be digested fully, so to speak.  He stated:</P>
    <P>To return to the main business of this debate, I will outline the primary objectives of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1994, which are: to provide for tougher penalties for serious fisheries offences, including the possible confiscation of vessels in the case of serious or persistent offenders...</P>
    <P>This provision will not be sufficient to deter Spanish trawlers.  In my first 30 years I saw marauding Spanish trawlers tearing the bottom off the fishing beds off the South-West coast while at night huge convoys of foreign vessels fished <i>ad lib</i> inside our territorial waters.  Spanish trawlers have a notorious record for ravaging fish stocks throughout the world, particularly in the North Atlantic Ocean. If Spanish fishing trawlers gain access to our 50 mile box from 1 January 1996, I can guarantee that they will not only desecrate our entire fishing stocks but will take the limpets off rocks.</P>
    <P>No matter which way we deal with this matter, it is evident that Spanish trawlers will have access to our 50 mile box from 1 January 1996.  Will the Minister say why Ireland, which will be the only island nation in the EU after the Channel tunnel is officially opened, was not given preferential treatment?  We must be given some preferential treatment.  Surely the Minister cannot sit idly by without taking some further action to ensure that our rightful share of the fishing stocks is preserved for our fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Minister will bring those people who deliberately flout the law to justice under this legislation. Fines of between £10,000 to £50,000 are only peanuts.  I want to impress upon the Minister the necessity of making it mandatory for Spanish or <Col N="337" /> other EC fishing trawlers with illegal holds to be automatically seized and not returned to their owner.  This may give rise to ruffled feathers at diplomatic level, but what about it.  There is no point enacting legislation if we do not implement it. The only way to deal with this problem is to introduce legislation which will make it mandatory to confiscate vessels with illegal holds.</P>
    <P>In the past two years all the trawlers brought into Castletownbere by Irish fishery protection vessels had illegal holds.  Once they had paid the meagre fine they took to sea again.  While these trawlers were tied up at the pier in Castletownbere their sister ships were marauding the fishing grounds off the South-West coast.  The Irish fishery protection vessel had to stand guard over the captive trawlers and could not leave the harbour.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to tighten up the numerous loopholes in the legislation. On Committee Stage we will outline how this can be done.  The Minister should not be misled into thinking he scored a victory yesterday &mdash; he has merely postponed the evil day.  How can he redress the situation?  The Minister was completely outvoted yesterday.  Why did he not exercise the veto?</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to do his best to fight off this threat and to ensure that Ireland obtains some preferential treatment so that we can conserve our fish stocks and protect our fishing industry.  We are faced with the problem of a fleet that is almost 30 years old and, at the next council meeting, the Minister will have to put all the facts on the table and take off the kid gloves.  If he puts drive into his efforts, I have no doubt he will achieve results on behalf of Irish fishermen.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Sheehan, made a very interesting contribution. Like myself, Deputy Sheehan lives among fishermen and has a reasonable knowledge of the industry.  The Deputy, however, missed a great opportunity to show support for the Minister in his efforts and instead made an attack on some of the Members of this House. I was particularly upset by the attack on the Taoiseach when Deputy Sheehan suggested he was gallivanting in the United States and that he was not doing good work for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the good fortune to be in the United States at that time promoting a project for New Ross which will create much employment.  The Taoiseach, during his busy schedule there, found the time to attend and was very supportive of the project.  I am sure, as a result <Col N="339" /> of his visit, the project will get off the ground.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the Council yesterday adopted a framework regulation under which detailed measures will be implemented to follow those currently applicable to Spanish and Portuguese vessels under the Iberian Act of Accession.  While carrying out some research recently I discovered that the Iberian Accession negotiations took place in 1986 and I was curious to know who were the Ministers involved at that time.  One was Deputy Peter Barry, then Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs was one of the most respected Deputies of this House, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  It was very unfair of Deputy Sheehan, as a constituency colleague, to attack Deputy O'Keeffe today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone living along the coast and in fishing communities will know that what took place yesterday was the regularisation of what is already happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with much that Deputy Sheehan has said but many Members and many fishermen would agree that without the stout defence of the Minister yesterday, we might be in a far worse position today.  I am quite happy that the <Col N="340" /> Minister led the defence of the Irish fishing industry and I wish him continued success.  What took place yesterday was successful to a certain degree.  Fishermen, of course, will not be happy but we must remember what happened when we joined the EU.  Perhaps a barter took place and agriculture may have received a little more for the sale of some of our fishing interests.</P>
    <P>I am asking for all party support for the Minister so that people will know that the Irish Parliament is united in its efforts to uphold the rights of fishermen.  We must not be devided on this issue and we must not use the tactic of blaming the other members of the Government.  The Government supports the Minister, Deputy Andrews, in his actions and I am asking for a united front.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Sheehan's appeal to the Minister, now that he has achieved some additional time for the Government and the fishing industry, to visit his European counterparts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would encourage Deputy Sheehan in particular to do that in the knowledge that he has some experience of the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know how the Spaniards behave.  I totally accept what the Deputy said about the Spaniards and their secret holds and the penalties imposed on such <Col N="341" /> boats.  As the Deputy said, it is like the Spanish Armada.  The pirating culture is still very much part of the activities of the Spanish fishermen and they never seem to be particularly worried about policing. The number of boats in our Naval Service is too small and if we are to patrol the Irish Box and the activities of the Spanish fishermen, we will need many more naval vessels.  Obviously, the cost of this cannot be borne by the Irish Government only. I would suggest that the Minister seek to obtain as much funding as possible from Europe, as this is a European issue.  If the Irish Box is to be policed, and if the Spanish fishermen are to be dealt with, we must have faster and bigger ships.  It is an advantage that Deputy Andrews is Minister for the Marine as well as Minister for Defence.  I ask him to use both Ministries to ensure that the Spanish fleet is policed in the knowledge that they have never yet behaved in the fashion that should be expected of them.</P>
    <P>As a person who lives in a fishing community I compliment the Minister.  We all know that fishermen are never shy to make a case for themselves.  The Minister performed extremely well and I understand he has attained a profile in Europe that will help him in the coming years.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force, established by the Government for the purpose of studying and making recommendations on the report <i>A Crusade for Survival</i>, has met on four occasions.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the task force are first, to assess the recommendations of the report and bring forward proposals to Government as to actions that might be taken and second, to make recommendations to Government on the most appropriate permanent institutional response.</P>
      <P>The Government asked the task force to complete its work and report back to Government within two months from 15 February 1994.  I understand the task force report is now being finalised and I expect it to be available for consideration by Government in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that there are 140 recommendations contained in the report entitled <i>A Crusade for Survival</i>, a central one being the appointment of a Minister for western development as well as suitable regional institutional structures, would the Taoiseach say whether that is one of the recommendations that has been discussed and if any interim report on the matter has been presented to Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I already dealt with a similar question in the House some time ago when I was questioned as to my views on that.  I said what was important for the development of the west was fairly speedy action.  I said I did not view the appointment of a Minister for western development as contributing to that objective in the very near future for the simple reason that so many functions that would have to be vested in one Minister would have to be taken from a large number of Departments and that the amount of legislative and other time that would be taken up with that would stall <Col N="343" /> any action being taken.  My personal view on that is well known.  There have been a large number of recommendations put forward and they are being studied by the task force.  The Deputy can be assured that the report is receiving the fullest attention at Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is possible to co-ordinate all the various functions under the aegis of one Ministry, or one agency, which has occurred very effectively under the aegis of the Minister and Department of the Gaeltacht and yet again under the broadened powers of SFADCo?  Would he agree that there would appear to be a certain amount of lethargy in relation to the overall devastation of the west; that there appears to be a certain amount of casualness in relation to the Bishops' approach, particularly in view of the fact that they are looking at parishes shrinking, communities unable to field football teams?  I remind the Taoiseach that 1,000 townlands that survived the pillage of Cromwell and the ravages of the Famine of 1847 have gone to the wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is no lethargy.  I am well aware of the views of the western Bishops in this regard.  Two months is a very short period in Government terms within which to request a task force to consider a report of that size, bearing in mind the number of recommendations.  I should stress that it is not a question of passing the buck to a task force, forgetting about it for 12 months or anything like that. The task force is finalising its report despite the fact that it has not yet been established for two months and the Government will have an opportunity of looking at their report in the near future. I am not going to anticipate what decisions the Government may take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out also that the European Union has a role to play in this regard; indeed all the communities in the west want to see the report presented to Brussels at the earliest opportunity to ascertain the response of the Commission. <Col N="344" /> I can appreciate Deputy Jim Higgins's commitment here.  If he is successful in the European elections I am sure he will plead the case of &ldquo;save the west&rdquo; very strongly in the European Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Without wishing to anticipate Government response can the Taoiseach say whether he will be in a position &mdash; once the report has been received by Cabinet &mdash; to place a finite date by which Government will take decisions in relation to the recommendations of the task force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not anticipate what the Government will do.  All I am saying is that the report of the task force will be presented to Government at the earliest possible date.  In the meantime that does not prevent continuous action being taken.  As will have been evident in recent times, a very strong case was made to me in Castlebar by some of the Bishops that that whole area bordering on Castlerea/Mayo is comprised of a community in serious decline from a population point of view.  I was asked by some of the Bishops to endeavour to influence the Government decision to locate a new prison in Castlerea; that the Government did.  The IDA is also in the final stages of negotiating an industry for Castlerea to the tune of 100 jobs plus.  I was in Glenamaddy recently and I commend the community spirit of the people of that small town on a number of projects I had the pleasure of opening on that occasion.</P>
      <P>It will be seen that there is a great spirit of self-help in the west at present.  What they need is support not alone from Government but from Europe also and they are prepared to improve their position if they receive reasonable recognition and support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to a reply to a question from Deputy O'Keeffe which I gave in the House on 10 February last in which I stated that the Department of the Marine has no responsibility for the provision of funding for ferries to the islands off the Irish coast.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee on island development, which is chaired by the Department of the Marine, is currently examining all aspects of island development, including the important question of access transport and the possibility of obtaining EU funding to improve access.  I am awaiting the report of the committee which is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>Safety of ferries is of paramount importance especially in the context of the most recently tragedy in Castletownbere and in that context it is my policy that statutory requirements in relation to vessel safety be rigorously enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister has no official responsibility for the funding of ferries.  From the point of view of responsibility for safety the quality of the ferry service is of vital importance if safety measures are to be implemented.  In that regard, is the Minister making representations to those people who have responsibility for funding to ensure the same level of funding to ferries serving non-Gaeltacht islands as to those serving Gaeltacht islands? There should be no difference in the grants available to the various ferries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am making representations. The issue of funding for <Col N="346" /> ferries is being examined by the interdepartmental committee on islands development, whose terms of reference include the recommendation on actions to ensure a co-ordinated approach by the Government.  The committee's report is expected in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>I would like to impart information to the Deputy which puts into perspective the disparate nature of the number of Departments involved.  The interdepartmental committee on island development was set up on the initiative of the Taoiseach who appointed the Department of the Marine to co-ordinate the efforts of many other Departments. I would have thought one of the reasons islands have not been properly serviced in the past is that so many Departments are involved.  For example, grant aid is available from a number of sources.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications provides £0.5 million per annum for the Galway Aran service; the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht subsidise the ferry service to Oileain Cléire, County Cork.  The Department owns the boat and provides an annual subsidy.  Údarás na Gaeltachta provides a ferry service for Tory and Aranmore islands, County Donegal, and subsidises a helicopter service to Tory during the winter and air services to the Aran Islands.  There is a need to co-ordinate the various efforts in relation to the islands.  As a general principle, rather like the fishing industry, the islands were seen as a second class citizen category and were disregarded for many years.  I hope the interdepartmental committee on island development will report quickly and that action will be taken shortly thereafter to ease the lot of people living off the coast.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 15, 17, 24 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>In the recent competition a total of 9,518 individuals applied for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force and 8,280 attended for interview; 1,200 applicants have been shortlisted and 500 of these will shortly be recruited.  The criteria used by the recruit selection boards in assessing candidates were general suitability in terms of motivation, communication skills and aptitude for group work; physical suitability as evidenced by sporting interests and hobbies; and general intelligence as indicated by educational attainments or otherwise.  Under general suitability favourable consideration was given to the voluntary service of members of the FCA.</P>
      <P>322 &mdash; 64.4 per cent of the first 500 candidates shortlisted by the selection boards are members of the FCA.  This represents a relatively high success rate for members of the FCA and I do not, therefore, see the need to reserve a set percentage of places for FCA members. Details of the units, corps and commands of the successful FCA applicants are not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the representative structures established for the Permanent Defence Force, PDFORRA was consulted in relation to the proposed recruitment. I extended the length of the term <Col N="349" /> of engagement for the new recruits from three to five years on foot of the association's representations.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the current age profile of non-commissioned personnel of the Permanent Defence Force and the need for young, fit and active personnel for operational duties, I consider that it would not be appropriate at the present time to enlist persons who are over 27 years of age.</P>
    <P>The question of further recruitment will be kept under review in the light of operational requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted with interest that approximately 6 per cent of those people who have been interviewed will be recruited during the next few months. In view of the fact that the average age of soldiers in the Army is one of the oldest in Europe will the Minister agree that the way to solve this problem is not through retirements at one end of the scale but through a major programme of recruitment?  The fact that 9,518 individuals applied for enlistment indicated a tremendous interest among people in a career in the Army.  Is not the solution to the problem one of recruitment rather than cost cutting exercises?</P>

      <P>I agree it would be marvellous if we could have an annual recruitment campaign for the Army and to induct many individuals not only into the Army but the Air Corps and our exceptional Naval Service, despite criticisms I heard this morning about the latter which I totally reject.  The reason for the upper age limit of 27 was to reduce the age profile.  As the Deputy is aware there is a number of categories of enlisted men over the preferred age profile.  In those circumstances we considered it appropriate that the conditions as set out in the reply to the question should apply.</P>

Until we can offer careers in the Army things are not as they should be.  Is it the Minister's intention that people will be able to seek recruitment to the Army as a career rather than simply a three, four or five year contract?  These people are not offered an Army career, they are offered a short term job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 39, 40, 53 and 70 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I announced recently, following discussions with the Minister for Finance, I have secured agreement in principle, for the introduction of an emergency aid scheme for the fishing industry.  The scheme is intended to alleviate the exceptional and unique difficulties which have been experienced by the catching sector over recent months and especially by fishing vessel crew members many of <Col N="353" /> whom have not had any employment during this period.</P>
    <P>The aims of the scheme, which will be administered by BIM, are to deal with genuine hardships and to secure the ongoing viability of the industry through ensuring that crews continue to be available to work in the industry.</P>
    <P>The precise details of the scheme are at present being finalised in consultation with other relevant Departments.  I expect, however, to be in a position to make a more detailed announcement on the matter shortly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of Community aid to help address the hardship experienced by fishermen, I regret to say that the initial response from the Commission has not been encouraging.  The Commission took the view that current Community regulations do not provide for the kind of financial assistance required in this instance.</P>
    <P>I have, nevertheless, continued to pursue the matter of Community aid, both in bilateral discussions with the Commissioner for Fisheries, Mr. Paleokrassas, and at the Council of Ministers where I raised the matter yesterday. While there are no funds earmarked for aid of this nature, the Commission will consider further in discussions with the Department of the Marine if any basis for Union aid can be found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not stipulate the amount of the package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>That falls far short of the £13 million envisaged by the IFO. Following the decision in Luxembourg yesterday would the Minister not consider increasing this to £10 million to ensure compensation is paid to fishermen who cannot make ends meet and are threatened with repossession for defaulting on loan repayments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be offering £10 million.  The money on offer is reasonable. This is a scheme which I suggested <Col N="354" /> and on which I was pursued by Deputy Deasy.  The figure of £5 million on offer from the Minister for Finance is generous and substantial.  The figure of £13 million was a negotiating one which was plucked out of the air; it could just as well have been £130 million.  In the circumstances £5 million is a substantial achievement. It is a recognition of the hardship suffered by the industry from October-November to January-February.  I appreciate that in some cases boats did not put to sea at all and in other cases they could only fish for four days.  We should not look a gift horse in the mouth.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>the criteria for the permitting of dumping at sea following an application to his Department by the developers of the Malahide Marina, County Dublin.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My statutory powers in such cases derive from the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, under which permits may be granted for the disposal at sea of substances or materials.  This Act gives effect to the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships and Aircraft, 1972.  In accordance with Ireland's commitments under this convention, the dumping of industrial waste ceased last year and the dumping of sewage sludge will be phased out by 31 December 1998.  The only other substance of any significance being disposed of at sea is dredge spoil from harbour development and maintenance operations. The Oslo Commission guidelines for the management of dredged material are taken into consideration in such cases.</P>
      <P>Applications are examined by the Marine Licence Vetting Committee which is a multi-disciplinary committee composed of Department of the Marine and Central Fisheries Board officials with expertise in biology, oceanography, chemistry, navigation and engineering. The committee assesses each application to ensure that the proposed disposal site is suitable from a fisheries and navigational point of view; the quantity and constituents of the waste are such that it will not have an adverse impact on the marine environment; there are no suitable land-based alternatives and the disposal vessel is properly licensed and certificated.</P>
      <P>Malahide Marina Village Limited has applied for a permit to dispose of dredge spoil from dredging operations in connection with the marina development.  A detailed technical survey of the disposal site, which is some seven kilometres east of Malahide, was carried out as part of the assessment process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> Further assessment of the proposal is currently under way in light of concerns expressed by fishermen in recent weeks. A definitive decision in the matter will depend on the outcome of this assessment which is being undertaken in full consultation with all relevant parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from his strenuous efforts in Europe to protect the fishing industry I am sure the Minister is keen to protect the breeding grounds of shellfish. If this is the case, how can he entertain an application from the Malahide Marina to dump material at sea in an area that is a shellfish bed?</P>
      <P>The question also relates to the continued practice, albeit restricted, of using the marine environment as a dumping ground for matter that may not seem to be of risk, but there are downstream effects from dumping at sea that are not altogether understood and which give fishermen due cause to be worried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from dredged spoil from harbour developments and maintenance operations, it is horrifying that industrial or other types of waste should be dumped at sea but there are conventions where man decides that this can happen and the Oslo Commission guidelines for the management of dredged material are taken into consideration, as in the case of the Malahide Marine village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the Malahide application first lodged in 1992 the Marine Licence Vetting Committee concluded that (1) the site was suitable, subject to further examination of possible impact on fisheries; (2) pre and post dumping surveys of the site should be undertaken in line with Oslo Commission guidelines on the management of dredged material.  In regard to (1), the local sea fishery officer advised that he was not aware of any major fishing activity in the area, apart from some potting for crab and a small amount of plaice.  The Fisheries Research Centre indicated that while there were important spawning nursery grounds for flat fish all along the east coast, the disposal <Col N="357" /> site proposed was unlikely to have a significant impact on the fisheries resource in the area.</P>
    <P>With regard to No. (2), Aquafact of Galway carried out a technical survey of the proposed site at a cost to the developer of £3,500 and the survey showed that (i)  materials to be dumped was relatively uncontaminated; and (ii)  the site was dispersive rather than depositional, meaning that the material would not accumulate in one area.  Based on all the technical advice available at the time, the committee approved the site in principle. In accordance with normal practice the permit would not issue until two or three weeks before the operation was due to commence.  No permit has been issued to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to contaminants but the question is about silt spreading over a wide area which the fishermen have pointed out is a delicate spawning area.  Whelks and shellfish in general are found in this area.</P>
      <P>Is the fact that the application was made by the son of a former Taoiseach relevant to doubts about its merit?  It is impossible to be conclusive about its effect on the marine environment. Should the principle of precaution not operate?  It is impossible after the event to withdraw the material from the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally reject the imputation that sons of former Taoisigh would get preferential treatment.  I think they would require me to say that on behalf of their offspring.  It is a rather mean observation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were recent objections from fishery sources and on 24 March 1994, an objection to the proposed disposal was received from the Irish Fishermen's Organisation.  They considered that the disposal area was a very important shellfish ground.  Since then a further complaint has been received from a local fisherman and from Deputy Trevor Sargent. Following receipt of these complaints the fishery officers were asked for a further view on the matter and they <Col N="358" /> stated that the proposed area was not suitable as a disposal site due to the presence of a valuable whelk fishery on the site.  Fishing for whelk has become more important in the past 12 months.  The argument in relation to the presence of whelk does not accord with the results of the pre dump survey which did not indicate any significant potential for shellfish cultivation at the site.  The Fisheries Research Centre is now to assess available data on the whelk resource in the area and consult with the local fishermen with a view to reaching a solution.</P>
    <P>It might all come right in the end.  I agree with the Deputy that it is a shame.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Members may have felt that I was particularly anxious to dispose of priority Question No. 10. That is because I could not in the present circumstances treat that last priority question as an ordinary question.  The resolution of the Dáil of 2 February 1994 allowing for the last priority question to be treated as an ordinary question, if it was not reached during priority time, was in operation on an experimental basis up to the Easter recess but it was not extended.  Therefore, the last priority question, if not reached, cannot be treated as an ordinary question until this resolution is re-enacted.</P>

      <P>This question arises from a report in the <i>Irish Defender</i> which stated that 41 members of the Defence Forces from the Curragh Camp, with military equipment, were used in stewarding and monitoring the progress of horses at the Heineken Punchestown Horse Trials.  Is the Minister aware of this and has he come to any conclusions on the reason it was agreed Army personnel would be used in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. In 1993 the director of the Punchestown Horse Trials applied to the Department for the provision of a number of Signal Corps personnel to provide communications at the event on 22-23 May.  This request was acceded to on the basis that any additional costs would be borne by the organisers.  The organisers paid subsistence at the appropriate military rates to the personnel involved.  In addition, time off in lieu was given to each of the personnel involved.  PDFORRA submitted a claim for payment of an allowance equivalent to the maintenance of essential service allowance for Saturday of £33.35, with no working day as a rest day, and on Sunday £44.46 for personnel engaged in duties at the Punchestown Horse Trials.  The Department rejected the claim on the grounds that the personnel involved were not engaged in the maintenance of an essential service.  A report recording disagreement was adopted on 24 February 1994 and PDFORRA is now free to take the issue to arbitration in the context of the <i>Programme for <Col N="360" /> Competitiveness and Work</i> if it wishes. As it is open to PDFORRA to take this issue to arbitration under the conciliation and arbitration scheme it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the issue.</P>

      <P>The purpose in raising this question is not to highlight any specific complaints PDFORRA may have about the way in which the soldiers were treated, although it appears that this left something to be desired.  Does the Minister agree that it was in breach of the regulations to allow Army personnel and equipment to be used in this way and that neither the Department of Defence nor military personnel were entitled to detail personnel to participate in what is essentially a commercial event using arms equipment in the process?</P>

      <P>No one in this House is implying that the Army does not portray itself in the best possible light; we are dealing with an abuse of Army regulations which specify clearly when Army personnel and equipment may be used.  Their use at the Heineken Punchestown Horse Trials is not covered. Until the Minister changes the regulations it is in order to raise questions in the House on how they are used.  Where a commercial organisation is involved the Department should be wary or reluctant to allow Army personnel to be used in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 19, 25 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of my recent trip to Somalia was to visit Irish personnel serving with UNOSOM II &mdash; whom I found to be in excellent spirits.  I was greatly impressed by their sense of commitment to the important work which they are undertaking in the cause of international peace.</P>
      <P>I had meetings in Nairobi with General Aidid, interim president Ali Mahdi and Ambassador Kouyate, Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General. I also had meetings in Mogadishu with the UNOSOM Force Commander, General Aboo and Mr. Abdul Touray, Political Official with UNOSOM.</P>
      <P>My meeting with General Aidid was most cordial.  The General expressed deep interest in doing everything possible to ensure the safety of Irish troops and assured me that the Irish are most welcome in Somalia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current mandate of UNOSOM II is as follows: encouraging and assisting the Somali parties in implementing the &ldquo;Addis Ababa Agreements&rdquo;, in particular in their co-operative efforts to achieve disarmament and to respect the cease-fire; protecting major ports and airports and essential infrastructure and safeguarding the lines of communications vital to the provision of humanitarian relief and reconstruction assistance; continuing its efforts to provide humanitarian relief to all in need throughout the country; assisting in the reorganisation of <Col N="364" /> the Somali police and judicial system; helping with the repatriation and resettlement of refugees and displaced persons; assisting in the ongoing political process in Somalia which should culminate in the installation of a democratically elected government and providing protection for the personnel, installations and equipment of the United Nations and its agencies, as well as of non-governmental organisations providing humanitarian relief and reconstruction assistance.</P>
    <P>The Irish contribution to UNOSOM II consists mainly of an 80 strong transport company.  It has the capacity to defend itself and has sufficient trained personnel and weapons for this purpose.  The contingent is based in a secure camp in Baidoa and is escorted on the move by the units of the Indian Brigade.  Arrangements which are currently being made to provide two SISU armoured personnel carriers to the unit will add greatly to troop security, providing enhanced communications and the ability to evacuate personnel should they come under fire.</P>
    <P>It has been established that the attack on the UN convoy which was returning from Mogadishu to Baidoa on 15 March last was almost certainly unpremeditated. As far as can be ascertained, the convoy got caught up in an armed confrontation between rival sub-clans. Personnel from the Indian Brigade who were on escort duty with the convoy fired on the attackers.  The Irish and Indian personnel did not suffer any casualties.</P>
    <P>The latest peace agreement between the main rival factions, recently signed in Nairobi, gives some grounds for hope that the levels of conflict in Somalia may decrease.  Since the US military withdrawal the Irish contingent has not experienced any increased hostility.</P>
    <P>When the tour of duty of the contingent at present in Somalia ends in September next, the Defence Forces will have given 12 months' service in Somalia. That will represent a substantial contribution by the Defence Forces in Somalia and consideration as to whether the Irish presence there should be further extended is now timely.  I am initiating a <Col N="365" /> full scale review of the situation, including a fundamental assessment by the military authorities.</P>
    <P>The question of a third rotation is a matter for the Government.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it was entirely inappropriate of the Government to send Irish troops in pursuit of the peace enforcement mandate in Somalia when the Minister for Defence says that he never believed it was right to do so in the first place?  Can <Col N="366" /> I take it that he is expressing the view of the Government that Irish troops will not in future be sent on peace enforcement missions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot anticipate what the Government may or may not do but, as Minister for Defence, I would like to hope that I will not be sending our troops on peace enforcement missions.  As to my views on peace enforcement and peace-keeping, despite introducing legislation setting out the need to provide a contingent in Somalia for peace-keeping and peace enforcement purposes, my views have never changed.  I had an obligation to introduce legislation to give effect to the views of the Government.  That was part of my collective responsibility as a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>In regard to my good friend General Aidid, I had an hour-long meeting in Nairobi, my third with him.  I met him in difficult circumstances on two other occasions in Mogadishu, once with our esteemed President and, on the first occasion, on my own.  When I met General Aidid in Nairobi he addressed the need to enter into a peace dialogue with his sworn enemy, interim President Ali Mahdi.  Five or six days later both General Aidid and Ali Mahdi signed a peace accord which still holds.  Although there is some banditry taking place in Somalia, it is not as bad as it was.  That may be attributable to the existence of the peace accord and Ali Mahdi and General Aidid not being at war with each other.  I hope peace will break out across Somalia and infrastructural development will take place to include the improvement of schools, hospitals, roads and, particularly the restructuring of the police force. There is a 7,000-strong police force and although it will be difficult, it is hoped to create a full-time police force of 10,000 personnel.</P>
      <P>On the question of rotating the transport company for the third time, that is a matter for decision by the Government. At this stage, I would not be inclined to rotate for a third time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to inform Deputies of the progress of the ongoing review of the restrictions which apply to Spanish and Portuguese vessels under the terms of the Iberian Act of Accession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, this matter was discussed at yesterday's meeting of the Fisheries Council and a new framework <Col N="368" /> regulation was adopted.  As I indicated to the House earlier, this deal does not give free rein to the Spanish fleet and there is no question that the final package to be adopted later this year will do so either.</P>
    <P>We have achieved the maximum advantage from the negotiations to date and we have not conceded anything which could be prejudicial in the next stage of the review.</P>
    <P>By way of background, I should point out that special rules have been applied to Spanish and Portuguese vessels fishing in Community waters since the accession of Spain and Portugal in 1986.  These restrictions include, in particular, the prohibition of Spanish and Portuguese vessels from fishing within the Irish Box which, under the Treaty of Accession, expires at the end of 1995.  Thus, these vessels will have access like the vessels of all other member states within the present Irish Box from 1 January 1996. This matter was settled ten years ago and as a Treaty provision was not open for renegotiation.  Our aim in the review has been to negotiate a new framework which would ensure that the activities of these fleets could be properly tracked and controlled.</P>
    <P>Discussions on the review have been in progress for some time.  The initial proposals tabled would have involved giving free rein to these vessels but these proposals were effectively withdrawn through strong opposition from a number of countries, including Ireland.  I also succeeded at the December meeting of the Council of Ministers in blocking the proposals then on the table because they did not fully meet out concerns.</P>
    <P>What the Council adopted yesterday was a framework regulation under which detailed measures will be implemented to follow those currently applicable to Spanish and Portuguese vessels under the Iberian Act of Accession.</P>
    <P>The adoption of this framework regulation does not prejudice in any unfavourable way the content of the measures to be applied later this year. On the contrary the regulation contains a whole range of criteria which will be to <Col N="369" /> Ireland's benefit in the ongoing negotiations.</P>
    <P>I would highlight, in particular, the following elements: recognition that the Irish box is a highly sensitive zone which will require special measures and close monitoring of fishing effort and resources to preserve balance; recognition that account must be taken on a case by case basis of the individual requirements of regions where socio-economic development of the local populations is particularly dependent upon fishing and related industries, there must be compliance with the principle that there can be no increase in the levels of fishing effort set down in the Iberian Act of Accession the bringing of the Spanish fleet within the framework of the reductions which apply to the member state fleets generally.  This reduction could be up to 20 per cent; and recognition of the need to establish sensitive zones, or boxes, where restrictions will apply.  The question of boxes and sensitive zones is still under negotiation. The negotiation of these principles and provisions represents a considerable achievement and a considerable advance on what was on offer last December.</P>
    <P>I also sought &mdash; but did not get agreement yesterday &mdash; on strong guarantees on the type of specific controls that should now be introduced.  In particular, I sought assurances on real-time &mdash; immediate &mdash; monitoring and reporting to the coastal State.  Therefore, and to give the strongest possible signal of the importance of what Ireland attaches to this matter, Ireland voted against the regulation.  I also placed a legal reserve on the regulation and put on the formal record a clear statement of Ireland's requirements in regard to the detailed measures to be adopted later this year. Our declaration, which I converted into a unilateral declaration, may still be negotiated into the framework regulation. All is not lost.</P>
    <P>It is clear that tough negotiation lies ahead of us in ensuring that the detailed implementing legislation which must be introduced later this year will best meet our objectives.  I assure Deputies that we <Col N="370" /> will continue to stand up for Ireland's interests as these negotiations progress. We have set the agenda in these discussions to date.  We will continue to do so.  We will not be overawed by the odds and we will not pull our punches because of the risk of being outvoted.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 1994, which was discussed in this House earlier today provides for the strengthening of controls and penalties for illegal fishing and I see the imposition of these new measures as an important element in the ongoing effort to properly protect the fish stocks around our coast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and particularly for his comments about what happened in Luxembourg yesterday.  I am sure he is aware that the eyes of the country, particularly those of the fishing communities, were on the negotiations in Luxembourg.  The Minister cannot conceal the fact that the vote of 11 to one yesterday against our interests will make a fundamental change in the status of the Irish box which protected the interests of our struggling fishing industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that as a result of yesterday's negotiations the Spanish fishing fleet and others will have equal access to the area known as the Irish Box?  In other words, will the Jóses and the Miguels have similar access to that box as the Pádraigs and the Tomáses have had so far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Iberian Act of Accession was negotiated in 1986 and that the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, and his assistant Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, were among the principal negotiators.  A former Fine Gael Minister for Fisheries, Paddy O'Toole, was also involved in negotiations. Since then the problem has deteriorated.  Notwithstanding the Iberian Act of Accession, under the Common <Col N="371" /> Fisheries Policy the Irish box will be abolished on 1 January 1996.  At the Council meeting in December last I sought to stop full access or a free run for the Spaniards, and I achieved that.  I can make available to the Deputy the framework regulation which contains much of what we sought to achieve.</P>
      <P>What I was voting against last evening was that a part of what we sought to put into the framework regulation was not allowed.  I sought to achieve that the coastal State &mdash; ourselves &mdash; would have complete control on a non-discriminatory basis over exit and entry of boats from other nations into a box or zone under our control and that we would note their catches and times of entries and exists, but I did not achieve that.  On the basis that this is a framework regulation to be implemented before the end of this year, what I sought to include in that framework regulation is still achievable and negotiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past ten years I have asked questions about arrests made in the Irish Box and around our coast by our fishery protection vessels. The Spaniards represent more than 60 per cent of those who regularly breach fishing regulations.  Those statistics apply to a period when they did not have the access to the Irish Box.  They will have from 1 January 1996.  The position will become intolerable and we will not be able adequately to patrol our coast.  At present, they are fined for breaches of regulations but they come back to fish in our waters under a new name.  Has the Minister any plans to ensure that they will abide by the regulations in 1996? They are fishing the smallest species. They have secret holds in their boats and they are violating regulations.  Did the Minister's report of their consistent and flagrant breach of regulations make any impression in Luxembourg yesterday?</P>

      <P>At the November Council meeting I made one of the strongest speeches on behalf of our fishing industry. I set out <i>seriatim</i> the information <Col N="372" /> about over-fishing, quota hopping, secret holds on boats and so on.  I exposed the Spaniards and I pursued a strong policy to ensure regulation and control of the Spanish fishing fleet when they have access from 1 January 1996.  I intend to achieve control and regulation of the Spanish fishing fleet and those of other European Union nations who transgress fishery laws.  The stand I took was a strong, vehement aggressive one on behalf of our sea fishing industry and I identified the serious transgressions of the Spanish fishing fleet.  Yesterday, while the Spanish Minister gave a lecture on the ethics of fishing I almost became physically ill with the hypocritical nature of his comments in relation to the Spanish record and that of another nation, not Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Minister has my support. I have supported him since I became a Member of this House and since he became Minister for the Marine. How can the Minister prohibit a marauding fleet of Spanish trawlers from raping the fishing grounds in the Irish box from 1 January 1996 when for the past ten years those trawlers, which were banned from fishing there, have succeeded in splitting every plank in the box and fishing every metre of that zone?  I am amazed the Minister stood alone in Luxembourg yesterday because at a meeting of the northern European fishermen's association, held in Aberdeen on 26 March, attended by fishing organisations from Holland, Germany, Denmark, Great Britain and Ireland, it was stated that while the principle of no increase in fishing efforts underpinned the proposals, there was no detail to satisfy the group that this would be the case.  The Minister stated it was necessary to take account of the needs of highly sensitive zones but the proposals provide no protection for those zones.  The Minister <Col N="373" /> has stated repeatedly that he has won the initiative but he has lost the match and is playing in injury time.  Unless he lobbies the Taoiseach to visit the heads of the European Union member states before the next Council meeting, the deathknell of our fishing industry will be sounded.</P>

      <P>I ask the Deputy to bear with me until the end of the year.  Much of what we have sought and achieved is contained in the draft framework regulation on sensitive areas, albeit on a biologically scientific measured basis. Another important point is that regulation stipulating a 20 per cent reduction in the size of the Spanish fleet which will be under the aegis and jurisdiction of the MAGP.  The remaining achievement which I am confident we can negotiate, and the reason I voted against the draft regulation, is agreement on the need for a coastal state to control its fishery waters. The game is not over, it may be in injury <Col N="374" /> time but that time extends to 31 December 1994.</P>

      <P>I admire the Minister for his valiant efforts to turn defeat into victory and I hope they will be successful, but when the result is 11:1 that represents a defeat from any viewpoint.  Will the Minister or the Taoiseach be able to exercise a power of veto to address the difficulties that have arisen?  Will the Minister agree that we have no guarantee that the proposed sensitive areas will be to our advantage or that the minor reduction of the Spanish fleet, which is already large and has capacity to fish four times its quota, will greatly benefit us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the size of the Spanish fleet and its unacceptable behaviour give rise to concern.  Those matters will be observed in further negotiations before the draft regulation is finalised in 1994.  The system of majority voting and not vetoes applies to Fishery Council meetings.  A proposal may be blocked by a majority vote.  To secure such a vote a country would need the support of one or two of the larger member states.  We have a vote of three while the larger nations have a vote of ten.  A blocking majority vote would require a vote of 23 and that is difficult to achieve.  The national interests of large member states often do not coincide with ours.</P>

Would he agree that the worst fears of the Irish fishing industry were realised in Luxembourg yesterday and that a vital national resource will be under threat from 1 January 1996?  Will the Minister give a commitment that yesterday's events will not be the last word on this and that he will continue his campaign to salvage some benefits for the struggling fishing industry, for future generations of Irish fishermen?</P>

I will continue on the basis of my proven record to be consistent and to fight as hard as I can for the fishing industry. Despite events in Luxembourg last evening, we are not looking at the death of an industry; the contrary is the case. For the first time I have given a standing to the fishing industry, which has been neglected by successive Governments since the foundation of the State.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with a very important subject.  It is significant that we are enacting decisions taken at the meeting of Fisheries Ministers in Luxembourg yesterday afternoon.  Fishing has always been a lucrative activity in the west, particularly in County Donegal. It has provided a livelihood for thousands of families where unemployment is high and there are few natural resources.  It is important that everything possible is done to promote and protect that industry which has provided an income for many people down the years.  At present the industry is experiencing difficulties due to weather conditions and restrictions imposed in recent years.</P>
      <P>The fishing industry has been the sacrificial lamb on the table of the EU, whether in Brussels, Luxembourg or Strasbourg, since our accession to Europe in 1973.  Fishing has always taken a back seat when compared to other industries.  Fishing interests have been sold short and were not properly promoted. Perhaps we traded our fishery rights for rights in agriculture and so on. Instead of the industry employing several hundreds of thousands of people in an island nation, it employs about 20,000, inclusive of fishermen and those engaged in onshore activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After yesterday's meeting it will be very difficult to develop this natural <Col N="427" /> resource to its full potential.  From 1 January 1996 the Spaniards and others will have unimpeded access to our lucrative fishing waters, namely the area known as the Irish Box, which was protected to enable the Irish fishing industry to develop.  We started from a low base in 1973 and we have been handicapped ever since.  It was recognised at the Hague Convention in 1976 and when the Iberian countries joined the EU in the 1980s that we needed time to develop this natural resource to its full potential, but now we only have another year or two to do so. Considering the illegal fishing activities of other countries in recent years, one shudders to think what will happen when there is unimpeded access to our waters. We all heard of the Spanish Armada &mdash; this was mentioned earlier by my colleague, Deputy Sheehan &mdash; who arrived in 1588, but did not stay very long.  The likelihood is that after 1996 Spanish trawlers will be in permanent residence off our coast.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the restrictions on our fishing industry.  A young man or group of people who want to take up fishing as a livelihood will find it almost impossible to do so as they will have to buy a fishing boat, get a licence and purchase tonnage.  People will not be able to automatically take up fishing as a livelihood in the future.  Under EU regulations fishermen cannot increase the size of their boats to enable them to go to the lucrative fishing grounds unless they purchase extra tonnage at great cost.  Instead of witnessing the development of this important industry which would provide employment in areas of high unemployment, we are witnessing its demise in the face of greater competition from Europe.</P>
    <P>When discussing these matters reference is always made to fishery protection. What steps can we take to protect our existing rights after 1996?  On a news bulletin last night the Minister said some concessions were available for the Irish fishing industry and that more would be made between now and the end of the <Col N="428" /> year.  How can we ensure that the concessions given to us on paper will be delivered?  Fishery protection seems to be exclusively confined to the south west and south east coasts.  Apart from the salmon fishing season, when fishery protection officers seem to take up permanent residence off the Donegal coast, there is very little protection along the north west coast.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that there is a crisis in the fishing industry, particularly the white fish sector.  Since last October-November many fishermen have been unable to go to sea mainly due to the inclement weather.  How will the aid package of £5 million announced last week be distributed?  Who will get this money?  Who can apply for this money and will application forms be issued? These questions may not be relevant to the Bill but they are to the fishermen who are looking for direction and an indication of what will happen.  Having regard to what happened yesterday, I cannot help but think that this aid package was designed to lessen the blow and sweeten the bitter pill delivered at Luxembourg.  I hope this is not the case, but one cannot blame people for thinking that this is what happened.  Some of the fishermen I was in contact with last night and today suggested that this could be the position.</P>
    <P>Is it proposed to introduce a scheme of compensation for fishermen who are put out of business after 1996?  Fishermen who do not have the same boats or equipment as Spanish boats will be put out of business as they will not be able to compete.  Can those who will be forced out of this economic activity as a result of what happened in Luxembourg yesterday expect to be compensated by the Government or the EU?  That question requires an answer soon.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to implement the decision reached in Luxembourg yesterday. Section 5 deals with licences, an issue which has been the subject of much controversy for many years.  Very few of those involved in the fishing industry or those who intend to become involved in it know how to get a licence.  Up to now <Col N="429" /> only the Minister had the power to grant a licence.  Two or three years ago approximately 20 licences were granted on Christmas Eve, of which, I think, half a dozen went to Donegal, while the majority of the remainder went to Dingle and a few to Cork and other places.  We never found out the basis on which these licences were granted or the criteria used. They seemed to have been given at the discretion of the Minister.  This gave rise to the impression that all was not well and that these very valuable licences were issued more on the basis of who one knew and who one's friends were rather than on one's commitment to the fishing industry. The Minister of State who represents a midland constituency originally came from the west and I am sure he knows what fishing is all about.  When we were young fishermen did not need a licence to fish.  However, it is now as necessary to have a licence to fish as it is to have a licence to drive a car.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken a small step forward to defuse this problem.  He said that in future the Minister of the day, or an authorised officer appointed by him, would have the power to dispense licences if the applications were accepted.  However, I do not think the Minister is going far enough in merely giving an authorised officer the power to dispense licences.  I am sure that like me the people engaged in the fishing industry would not like to see this happening. Why has the Minister decided not to give this power to an authority?  Will he agree that it would be better to give this power to an authority made up of reputable people who would decide whether a licence should be issued to an applicant and who would give the reasons for a decision not to grant a licence?</P>
    <P>Apart from the High Court &mdash; one would need more resources than those available to the average fisherman to take a case to that court &mdash; up to now those who wanted to take up fishing as a livelihood but who were refused a licence could not appeal the decision to a court. The Minister should on Committee Stage replace the words &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; and include a <Col N="430" /> provision under which an applicant could appeal to the Minister or some other person if their application is unsuccessful. The Minister must do this if he wants to improve people's perception of the licensing system and the basis on which licences are granted.</P>
    <P>Licences are a tradable asset.  I may be wrong but I think fishermen can sell their licences.  It should not be left to the political head of a Department to decide who is issued with a licence.</P>
    <P>Before many of us were elected to this House there was a similar procedure in the local authorities.  One could apply for planning permission to the Department of Local Government or the Department of the Environment and if that was not granted at local authority level one could always appeal to the Minister.  We were all brought up on stories about how planning permissions were eventually obtained through ministerial intervention. We do not want that to happen to the fishing industry.  This activity gives a bad name to politicians and politics in general and it is not right.  I would like this matter cleared up.</P>
    <P>Another section deals with the protection afforded to fishery protection officers.  Coming from an area where sea and inshore fishing play an important part in the community, I would support any additional powers or protection for these officers who are merely implementing the legislation for which we are responsible for enacting.  I admit that for many years there has been an impression that the fishing rights of this country belonged &mdash; to put it as simply as I can &mdash; to the landed gentry but times have changed.  We have been looking after our own affairs since 1922 and I fully support any additional powers that would be given to these officers.  I am glad this matter has been addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Fishery protection officers should not be simply chosen from a list.  They must have certain qualities and indeed should be given training.  They will now be given the same status and protection as that afforded to members of the Garda, who are allowed a training period of two years.  What training period is granted to <Col N="431" /> fishery protection officers?  If they are to be granted additional powers they should at least be trained professionally for the sensitive job they do.  I ask the Minister to take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the provision relating to eels in which my colleague, Deputy McGrath, is interested.  I was always of the opinion that the most lucrative eel area in this country was Lough Neagh and I know it is an important industry there.  It seems that the eel industry will have the same status as the salmon industry and, coming from Donegal, I am acquainted with the rules and regulations governing catching, transporting and selling salmon.  Eels appear to be a lucrative part of the fishing industry and if the trade is to be properly developed I would be in favour of affording it the same status.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary, particularly in view of what took place yesterday.  I hope, however, that it will not sound the death knell of the Irish fishing industry as we have known it up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Many of my colleagues have spoken on various aspects of it and I intend to contain my remarks to Part III.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his kind comments about me when he introduced the Bill.  I would like also to thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, who is at present on sick leave and to whom I send my good wishes.  The Minister and the Minister of State were very approachable when we discussed the eel fishing problems in the midlands area and were courteous and helpful.  I also met officials from the Department and, through the Minister, I pass on my thanks to them for their help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two or three years ago my interest in eels was limited.  I regarded them as repulsive creatures that lived in the lakes in our area.  However, in May last year it was brought to my attention that a fishery protection officer living in the town of Mullingar, who worked for the ESB and whose responsibility was fishery protection <Col N="432" /> in the midlands area, had been intimidated and beaten.  His wife had also been intimidated and they were forced to move to an area where they were not known.</P>
    <P>That case highlighted the activities of a group of criminals operating in the midlands. The eel business is lucrative &mdash; live eels fetch £1.90 per pound on the market. When I began to research the eel business I became aware of various incidents reported in the newspapers &mdash; and others not reported &mdash; of legal fishermen who had been beaten up and whose catches and nets had been stolen on a regular basis.  Unfortunately, very few prosecutions resulted.</P>
    <P>When I spoke to the local Garda and other people about this problem I was informed that the law was not sufficiently strong to deal with it.  At that stage I decided to become involved and to do something about this problem.  With the assistance of the departmental officials and further research the Bill reflects accurately my sentiments in relation to what should be done.  Elevating the status of eels to that of salmon is a worthwhile measure.</P>
    <P>I will be proposing two or three amendments on Committee Stage which I hope will be accepted.  The Minister mentioned earlier that he was building in improved protection measures for fishery officers in the Bill.  I welcome that because fishery protection officers put their lives at risk on a regular basis patrolling the lakes and rivers of the midlands area and around the country in the dead of night to protect fishermen who have been issued with legitimate licences.  They put themselves at risk with little support.  The ESB has employed one officer to protect the lakes and rivers of the midlands north of Portumna Bridge and on Monday last recruited another employee on a temporary basis &mdash; two people to protect Westmeath alone, the lake county of Ireland.  How can they possibly do so as it simply is not sufficient staff.  I would ask the ESB to do something about it since the rivers and lakes are owned by it.</P>
    <P>In May last I connected the activities <Col N="433" /> of these illegal fishermen with many other activities in which I understood they had been involved.  For example, a car used in the shooting of three RUC constables was stolen in the vicinity of Multyfarnham in County Westmeath; a lorry stolen in the Mullingar area was used to ram a British Army Border checkpoint and a tractor stolen in that area was found subsequently in County Monaghan where it was being adapted as a mortar bomb assault vehicle.  I mentioned the fishery protection officer and his family who had to leave their home.  There have been numerous bank and post office raids, all linked to this small group operating out of Multyfarnham area in County Westmeath.  They have helpers coming in from countries Meath and Cavan and operate regularly to terrorise and rob.</P>
    <P>They have very clear connections with subversives, demonstrated by the fact that in October last they terrorised two fishermen on the shores of Lough Ennell in County Westmeath.  As the House will be aware, eel fishing is done at night. Those two men were going about their business when a group of something in the region of 25 men swept in off the lake in boats, tied them up, put them lying on the ground, beat them severely and fired shots beside them.  I brought it to the attention of the House at that time. Indeed in certain quarters I may have been seen to be exaggerating for not putting across the correct story.  However, the activities in my area over the past three months have demonstrated very clearly &mdash; and the Minister has said so to me &mdash; that what I said then was very accurate because in the Multyfarnham area the security forces have found a massive supply of guns, ammunition and Semtex after an intensive search which had lasted approximately one month. Not only one cache of arms was found. The ammunition, guns and so on were found in ten locations within that area after a tremendous effort to locate them.</P>
    <P>I believe there is more ammunition, guns and Semtex in that area, that further searches are needed, and further support from the local community to ascertain the location of these arms dumps.  During <Col N="434" /> the last search of the area there was a certain amount of support from the local community in establishing their location &mdash; but we need to move more Army officers into the area to clean it out and remove the items of death and destruction stored in those localities.</P>
    <P>How in a rural area could so much deadly merchandise be stored without people's knowledge?  It is because many people in that locality are afraid for their lives; they are afraid to talk about the activities they see; they are afraid to point the finger at the people they know to be involved.  A very good friend living in that locality, a decent, upright, honourable individual, saw goods being dumped by these people but he was afraid to disclose their whereabouts because they saw him. They know that he knows so the information will go to the grave with him.  Is it not a terribly frightening scenario, that we in the midlands, or anywhere in Ireland, can be controlled by these terrorists? These people do not engage in that activity for any ideological reason but because of the money involved and because they are thugs at heart.  These people are aligned with subversives, because it gives them a certain amount of status and the wherewithal to terrorise anybody who crosses their path.  We must remember that it is a very lucrative business. For example, I am aware that four of these people each amassed £10,000 over a four-month period last summer, yet those same people are drawing the dole.  Is it not remarkable?  Are we not a great little country that we can afford such tremendous luxuries?</P>
    <P>There is a very good livelihood to be made from eel fishing.  It is a very lucrative business on the midland lakes, the vegetation in the lakes there being so rich apparently eels can grow to a substantial size.  We must take control so that people can obtain licences and fish, knowing they will not be assaulted, intimidated, or have their catch stolen.  I spoke to two fishermen in the last couple of weeks who, since their nets were stolen, have been unable to fish because they have not the wherewithal to purchase more nets. The situation must be taken in hand. <Col N="435" /> That brings me to the provisions of this Bill.  I welcome the provision whereby one must account for the origin of eels in one's possession.  It will be the key to success.  The other provisions of the Bill are good also.  Nonetheless there are a couple of other proposals dealing with the possession of eel fishing nets which should be included.  Many people, known to be illegal fishermen, have sheds full of nets suitable for catching eels, yet there is nothing in this Bill to control their activities.  For example, if one were found to be in possession of housebreaking tools one could be prosecuted on that basis.  Surely we could devise some provision within this Bill which would render it illegal to have eel nets in one's possession without being able to acount for them.  Perhaps the Minister could request his officials to examine this matter and perhaps table some amendments on Committee Stage or, when summing up, give me a legitimate reason for not doing so.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned that somebody can hold a licence which entitles him to possess eels in other areas.  For example, if I hold a licence in County Mayo does that afford me the right to possess eels in Mullingar or <i>vice versa?</i> I ask that knowing what happened in a court case which arose in Mullingar on Friday last when a number of people before the court were charged with possession of eels, the Garda and fishery officers have done their homework very efficiently.  They had observed how these eels had been caught, and from the time they had been taken out of the lake and so on.  However, on Friday last in that courtroom, a man stood before the court, holding a legitimate licence from County Cavan, and told the judge that those eels belonged to him, were merely in transit and were put into the lake so that they could drink fresh water while in transit. The remarkable thing was that that man had a licence to fish with a line and hooks. There are two ways of catching eels, one is in a net when they are kept alive and the other is by means of a long line with several hooks hanging from it.  Frequently <Col N="436" /> when eels are caught on the hooks they die and have to be cut off the hooks.  This man had a licence to catch eels on this line and hook, yet he said that all these kilos, hundredweights, of live eels were his.  Thankfully the judge had a tremendous amount of wisdom and rejected that evidence.  A heavy and substantial fine was imposed on those people, and rightly so.  The measures contained in this Bill will help the Garda.  I ask the Minister to consider whether a licence should restrict a person to catch eels in the locality in which the licence applies.  It is a legitimate point which perhaps the Minister will address later.</P>
    <P>Legislation is only as good as its enforcement.  I welcome this legislation and I think it will be a great help but unless we have the resources to enforce it, it is merely more paper being stacked on shelves.</P>
    <P>The Garda do a tremendous job in my constituency watching out for the subversives who are also involved in eel fishing. They co-operate with and give protection to the fishery protection officers; unfortunately, the fishery protection officers have to be protected because there have been so many incidents. Unless the Garda and the fishery protection officers are given more resources and manpower, this legislation will be wasted and the subversive organisations will continue to collect huge sums of money and use it for illegal purposes on the backs of legitimate fishermen.  We must provide the necessary resources to enforce this legislation.  With that in mind I ask the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, to ensure there are sufficient resources in the midlands during the limited period the eels are running so that we can catch those people in possession, when they are in breach of the law, and bring them to justice.  Only by doing that can we say that this legislation is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from the reply to Question No. 56 which I put down to the Minister for the Marine on 21 October 1993 &mdash; Official Report column 2182:</P>
    <P>In the case to which I think you <Col N="437" /> refer in the Lough Ennell area, the eel fishery there is the property of the ESB and again their protection staff are working closely with the gardaí in controlling this illegal activity.</P>
    <P>I agree that they are working very closely with the gardaí but with limited resources.  We must have more manpower and resources.  It is crazy that the Garda who are involved, some on a full-time basis, in this work do not even have access to a boat to go out on the lakes to see what is happening.  They have to rely on the fishery protection officers. Recently a high powered boat was given to the Civil Defence in that area for rescue missions and so on.  Could the Minister initiate co-operation between those groups so that this boat could be used occasionally by the Garda to bring the illegal fishermen to book?  In that way they could help wipe out a terrorist gang which is operating in the area and perpetuating the terror campaign that exists in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few brief comments on this Bill.  We are all aware of illegal fishing at sea, the Minister fought a battle this week to try to rectify a situation he had inherited but that battle did not end as we wished.  Nonetheless where it is within our power to protect our fisheries we have a duty to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGrath spoke about the illegal fishing in his constituency.  It is well known that this has been going on for a number of years.  Perhaps it goes back to the original system of licensing and disposal of the fish caught.  It might be no harm to find out where a home is being found for those illegal fish and what price is being paid for them <i>vis-à-vis</i> those caught and sold legitimately.  There are rumours that the prices being paid to the legitimate fishermen <i>vis-à-vis</i> those paid to illegal poachers for eels have a discrepancy of from 50p to 70p per pound. The question is where are these eels finishing up?  Who is the receiver of these illegally caught eels?  Who are the fish dealers who deal with them?  A salmon <Col N="438" /> dealer must show where the salmon came from.  It is important from here on that that should be done so far as eel fishing is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a new trend, which I hope will not be with us for long, that is poaching of coarse fish by continentals who come here on alleged holidays.  I know of lakes in my own constituency where all the pike, bar those less than 1lb weight, have been cleaned out during the number of years by illegal foreign fishermen.  They come here on alleged holidays with their campervans and return with large quantities of pike and perch especially in their freezers.  This annoys me.  This is a resource which has enormous tourist potential if properly used.  What is being done to enforce the regulations regarding the number of fish that may be killed by any fisherman on a day's fishing or on a holiday trip?</P>
    <P>I must give credit to the British anglers who are more than careful that they return the maximum number &mdash; in many cases 100 per cent of their catch &mdash; to the waters from which they have taken them at the end of the day.  I appeal to the Minister to ask customs officials and the Garda to carry out regular checks at our ferry ports to see the quantity of fish these returning holidaymakers have in their feezers.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGrath said, the enforcing agencies have no resources or manpower. Are we going to allow our resources to be cleared out for want of manpower when we remember the number of people we have unemployed? Under existing schemes can we not use these people to maintain a presence on some of our coarse fishing lakes?  If we do not do this, we will have water and no fish and no tourism potential.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome and I hope it will strengthen the hand of the law in dealing with those who are caught.  We must see where the benefit is lost to the economy. Criminal justice legislation contains provisions relating to those handling stolen goods.  Are there similar provisions in this Bill covering those in possession of illegally caught fish?</P>
    <P>If a greater number of eel fishing <Col N="439" /> licences were made available and proper marketing structures were put in place we might not have the problems mentioned by Deputy McGrath.  How many families in Northern Ireland make a good living from the resources of Lough Neagh?  There are a number of lakes in my county, as there are in Deputy McGrath's county, but do we benefit from them?  If our coarse fishing lakes were commercially fished we would not have the protection problem mentioned by the Deputy.  If we have local support, existing fisheries will be protected.  We must ensure this is the case in the future. We all know cases of illegal fishing and netting but since we do not have sufficient resources or manpower to provide full protection we should issue more licences. Some people earned £10,000 in four months last year; how much could have been earned if the fishing had been legal and above board?  This activity would benefit local communities.</P>
    <P>Being an angler the Minister understands the problems.  There must be local involvement.  If locals were granted licences for eel fishing there would be greater co-operation and fewer problems. However, we will not be in a position to deal with the matter while there are people prepared to handle illegally caught fish.  So long as a two tier price system exists between legally and illegally caught fish, there will be problems.  I hope as a result of the legislation that there will be a greater availability of licences and greater controls over people who deal with the product.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions which were much appreciated. This is a complex Bill.  Deputy Bradford indicated it would help a great deal if we had a fisheries consolidation Act for ease of reference.  He pointed out there are many cross-references in the Bill, and I agree with him.  I will take note of what Deputies said and they will have an opportunity to improve the Bill on Committee Stage.  I will pay close attention to any amendments submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> The provisions of the Bill are tough and I am confident that owners of vessels who engage in illegal fishing, which effectively amounts to industralised poaching, will think twice before doing so in future. The severity of the penalties is fitting because of the potentially disastrous results which over-fishing and the catching of immature fish wreaks upon the industry.  It is not only the jobs of fishermen which could be put at risk but those of the many thousands who work in the processing and ancillary areas. Deputy Sheehan said 15,000 people were involved in the fishing industry, and that forms 1.4 per cent of the workforce.</P>
    <P>The dedication of the Naval Service which is responsible for fisheries protection is not in question.  Up to now, however, there have been times when the penalties did not sufficiently reflect the serious nature of the offences.  Penalties ranging from £10,0000 to £50,0000 are proposed in the Bill.  Some Deputies, particularly Deputy Sheehan, thought these derisory and suggested penalties in the region of £500,000.  I will look carefully at any amendments proposed in this regard.</P>
    <P>With the enactment of this Bill I feel confident that the powers it provides and the sanctions the court may impose will be availed of in full.  I disagree with Deputy Sheehan that the fishery protection service is inadequate and underfunded. The last few years have seen a greatly increased investment in the service and chief among that has been the provision of a CASA maritime patrol aircraft in June 1991.  It is my intention to try to hold on to it.  As the House may be aware there is an option to either retain or return it.  I hope to retain it to add to two new CASA aircraft which will come on stream between June and September this year.  They are an extraordinary aircraft.  I went to Spain to see how they were built.  By any standards they contain the most modern technology and equipment.  These interesting planes are effectively flying laboratories.  The CASA aircraft can stay in the air for some eight hours.  One can appreciate the extent of the area it can cover in the <Col N="441" /> context of fisheries protection.  In addition to the existing CASA two new CASA aircraft costing in the region of £30 million and aided by the European Union are due for delivery later this year. I am pleased to inform Deputy Sheehan that this aircraft has been a major success in its maritime operations.  Its capability of staying airborne for up to eight hours has greatly increased the operational proficiency of the Air Corps in its fisheries protection role and allows it to cover a large area of the European economic zone within a short period.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the main Opposition spokesperson for the Marine, Deputy Bradford and I assure him that I will give him as much assistance as I hope he will give me in terms of co-operation.  It is not all about confrontation as more can be achieved in this House by consensus.</P>
    <P>The capability of the CASA aircraft compared with the previous maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Air Corps on fisheries protection duties means that the Air Corps spends a higher proportion of flying time on fisheries protection patrol missions.  During the period 1983-92, investment in buildings, computers and software, inspection vehicles, surveillance vessels and aircraft has amounted to £45.2 million.  In November 1992 annual operating costs were estimated to be in the order of £31 million.  Planned expenditure for the period 1993-97 amounts to approximately £103 million. Deputy Bradford wondered whether the provisions relating to the economic link might be challenged in the High Court. That possibility cannot be ruled out but I doubt if the courts would find the requirements set out in this Bill in conflict with its previous ruling in this regard. The considerations which were identified give substance to the principles contained and the finding of the court on the subject of economic links.  The rigorous application of these principles would help ensure that the operation of vessels on a register will benefit the coastal communities that our quotas are meant to benefit.  I am confident this will ensure that convenience registration will no longer be the soft option it once was. <Col N="442" /> Deputy Bradford also raised the question of delegation of authority by the Minister in the matter of sea fishing licence.  If the Deputy reads the section further he will see that the decision delegated will be based on guidelines which the Minister will decide.  This will ensure that applicants are given consistent and fair treatment. However, I am still open to views the Deputy might wish to express on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the need for improving the safety of fishing vessels and there is a number of important measures in the pipeline.  Ireland has acceded to the Torremolinos Convention on fishing vessels safety which sets the safety standards for larger vessels.  The Commission has issued a directive on fishing vessels safety which caters for the immediate classes of vessels and national regulations are proposed in respect of smaller inshore craft.  These measures will be put in place during the next year or so under the 1992 Merchant Shipping Act.</P>
    <P>We face difficult negotiations on the question of sensitive areas and new conservation criteria to be applied under the terms of the framework regulation on the accession of Spain and Portugal to the fisheries resources off our coast.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath made a valuable contribution on eel fishing, an area in which he has had a consistent interest.  He very bravely confronted the bully boys who tried to intimidate genuine and legitimate eel fishermen.  That was a gusty performance. It is in the best traditions of this House that we are not intimidated by anti-democratic people.</P>
    <P>This Bill sends out a clear signal of our concern about the serious damage that offences of this nature can inflict on stocks and will empower the courts to effectively convey that concern to those convicted of violations.  The message being sent out to those who cynically abuse our fisheries and see the occasional prosecution as an occupational hazard is clear: &ldquo;we mean business&rdquo;.  As I said earlier, a number of additional provisions will be introduced on Committee Stage which will further strengthen the deterrent <Col N="443" /> effect of the Bill.  This will mean, for example, that a boat convicted of having a hidden hold containing undersized nets will face fines of up to £100,000 for those offences alone plus the confiscation of gear and catch.  However lucrative their illegal activities may have been, fines of this order will be a financially painful experience, not soon forgotten.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions and I will certainly take them on board during the Committee Stage deliberations of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to introduce the Health (Amendment) Bill.  It is part of the legislative programme under the Programme for a Partnership Government and is an integral component of a <Col N="444" /> comprehensive plan to develop the dental services in this country.  While progress has been made in recent years in improving the services, this has taken place in a piecemeal fashion and regrettably, deficiencies still exist in the services. These relate both to individual components of the dental services and to specific areas around the country.  For example, in some areas the children's services are being provided in an unsystematic way; secondary care orthodontic services still do not meet the needs of local populations despite significant investment; oral surgery services are limited and in many areas there is effectively only an emergency dental service available for eligible adults.  I am determined to address these factors.  These shortcomings and deficiencies have been of concern to Deputies on all sides of the House and have been raised through parliamentary questions and Adjournment debates on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that dental services are provided throughout the country on an equitable, efficient and consistent basis and have undertaken a comprehensive evaluation of the situation towards developing and implementing a co-ordinated and integrated dental plan in the medium-term. As a result of this evaluation, the Government has agreed to proposals submitted by me as the basis for this plan which will be implemented in coming years.</P>
    <P>I propose to elaborate on the details of the dental plan in the national health strategy due to be published next week but it is intended that enhanced dental service will be provided under the following headings: primary prevention, including fluoridation and health education; primary care for children; services for the handicapped and persons in institutions; secondary care orthodontics; oral surgery services and a structured approach to dental health care for adult medical card holders and their adult dependants, including an accident and emergency scheme for the eligible adult population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> This area of health care requires investment to enable it to respond to the dental needs of the population and towards that end I propose to allocate an additional £4.4 million to the services this year.  It is clear that this further impetus is necessary so that the progress to date can be accelerated in a way that the dental services throughout the country are provided in an equitable, efficient and consistent manner and that variations between health boards which can adversely affect access to and the quality of the services locally are removed.</P>
    <P>This is particularly relevant in the case of adults who are eligible for dental services under the Health Act, 1970.  There are about 915,000 adult persons eligible for dental services under the Act but, regrettably, the services available for such persons have declined in recent years to the point where, in many health board areas only an accident and emergency dental service is being provided through the health board dental personnel.</P>
    <P>My Department is having discussions with the Irish Dental Association about the introduction on a phased basis of a new dental treatment scheme for eligible adults.  It is envisaged that this scheme will involve both dentists in private practice and health board dentists, the latter working in the scheme under new, restructured arrangements.  The services to be provided will include routine items of treatment, an accident and emergency service and the provision of dentures for the elderly and those in need.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the current limited and unsatisfactory dental service arrangements for eligible adults, a dental scheme along the lines of that being discussed with the Irish Dental Association would be a major public health benefit to this group of the population.  A satisfactory adults dental scheme is central to the successful provision of dental services to other groups and the services to those groups are delivered by dental personnel designated to individual areas.  In this regard, the overlap between the children's and adults' services have restricted the development of both areas.  Considerable <Col N="446" /> progress has been made to date in the discussions with the association which have been constructive and positive. There are, however, a number of issues yet to be resolved and I am hopeful that these will be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the dental services in the coming years will require inputs of dental personnel and capital.  My Department is addressing the detailed resource requirements for implementing the plan in conjunction with the health boards and is having discussions with the Irish Dental Association about the adult dental treatment services.</P>
    <P>While I acknowledge that there are many deficiencies in the dental services, especially in the adult services, there have been major improvements in the levels of oral health in the population. This is especially true for children.  These improvements have been achieved mainly as a result of a decision to implement community water fluoridation as a public health measure 30 years ago. One of the fundamental objectives of the dental plan is to facilitate further improvements in the oral health of children and to sustain these improvements into adulthood.</P>
    <P>I now propose to outline the intent and the provisions of the Health (Amendment) Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Health Act, 1970, to enable health boards to make dental services available without charge to children who have attended national or certain other schools.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a short one.  Section 1 contains the necessary provision to enable the health boards to provide the services. It also contains a provision to enable the Minister for Health to specify the nature of the service to be made available and the age of the children to be provided with the service.  This will enable me to extend services to children up to age 16 on a phased basis in accordance with the provisions contained in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The extension of entitlement to dental services to children up to age 16 will be a significant development in the primary care dental services for children.  When <Col N="447" /> the provisions of this Bill are fully implemented, persons will be eligible for dental services under the Bill from pre-school level to adulthood.  This will involve a reorganisation of the health board dental services which has also been discussed with the Irish Dental Asociation.</P>
    <P>The Health Act, 1970, provides that health boards shall provide a dental examination and treatment service for pupils attending national school or certain other schools as may be specified by order under the Act.  The purpose of this extension is to achieve continuity of dental care by bridging the gap between national school primary care dental services and the provision of adult services. Accordingly, emphasis will be placed on those adolescents who have had a previous involvement in the national school dental services.</P>
    <P>For many years health boards have been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand led system.  This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
    <P>The school based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention.  Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools.  Children in specific classes, usually second, fourth and sixth classes, are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach.  The children in these clases are screened and referred for treatment as necessary.  The provision of fissure sealants for vulnerable teeth is an important element of the preventive programme. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.</P>
    <P>The small number of children who require more frequent attention are identified and the required level of advice, check-ups, treatment, etc. is provided as necessary.  An emergency service for the <Col N="448" /> relief of pain and infection is available on demand.</P>
    <P>Under existing programmes about 275,000 children are screened annually for the provision of dental treatment. About 260,000 children receive dental treatment annually.  Eligibility for free dental care to children after they leave national school is limited to the dependants of medical card holders.  This means that two-thirds of all adolescents lose their eligibity for free dental services before the full eruption of their permanent teeth.  However, the children of non-medical card holders remain eligible for any unprovided secondary care, e.g. orthodontics in respect of defects which were diagnosed while they were still at national school.</P>
    <P>Children often experience an increase in dental decay after they leave national school.  The presence of untreated decay in the teeth of these children very often causes further complications and problems extending into adulthood and can make necessary treatment in adulthood more difficult and more expensive.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to phase in eligibility for children up to age 16 &mdash; i.e. up to the 16th birthday &mdash; during the course of the Programme for a Partnership Government. The extension of eligibility up to age 16 &mdash; i.e. up to the 16th birthday &mdash; will give entitlement to an additional 190,000 children.</P>
    <P>The strategic approach adopted for delivering care to national school children will be continued when extending eligibility.  The extension of existing preventive programmes including health education and fissure sealing where necessary to those up to age 16 will further reduce disease levels.</P>
    <P>Each health board will evaluate the situation in its area to determine how best to implement the screening and treatment programmes for those to whom eligibility is being extended.  As over 95 per cent of these children will be living in the catchment area of their national school, it is envisaged that most health boards will do so by a follow-up on the existing national school programmes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> Section 2 of the Bill provides for title, citation and construction.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a short but important one. It is part of a major expansion of the dental services and its implementation is being backed up by the provision of the necessary resources as are the other elements of the dental plan, which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am always prepared to offer encouragement to the Government when they propose to implement some of the promises incorporated in numerous documents.  A Minister who comes into the House to deliver on one of those promises should be welcomed and it is incumbent on me to do so.</P>
      <P>The principles in the Bill are excellent. The proposals set out are necessary, as we have all recognised for a long time. The theory is all very well but in practice we are a long way short of target and, in his heart of hearts, the Minister must know what the real situation is, particularly in relation to orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>I do not like to disillusion the Minister, but if he thinks the £4.4 million will be enough to make the improvements that are necessary, he is mistaken.  It is not enough by a long shot.  The Minister says that the health boards will implement his proposals.  However, as a member of a health board I know what they are capable of doing and why they are incapable of doing the things they want to do.  The financial constraints on the health boards limit their ability to deliver in this important area.</P>
      <P>Let me dwell for a moment on what is happening.  Like many Acts of the Oireachtas, the 1970 Act is limited by the extent of the funding provided.  The Minister cannot provide money for everything, but lest there be any doubt, if there is one subject on which public representatives have received much correspondence, it is the subject of dental care and orthodontics in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the principle of preventive medicine in this area because prevention <Col N="450" /> is always better than cure, but let use examine the involved process of screening that takes place to identify people in need of treatment.  There are category 1, category 2 and category 3 patients.  If the parent of the category 1 patient are prepared to allow their son or daughter to suffer pain for some time, he or she will be attended to within reason.  Unless there is extreme pain or discomfort, the category 2 patient is not likely to be attended to for 18 months to two years, by which time that patient may be outside the school system.  At that stage the parents may have given up hope, have taken out a loan of approximately £2,500 from a credit union, and gone to a private orthodontist to have emergency work carried out.  Under the present system, category 3 patients have no chance whatever. They might as well not be on a list because the reality is that they will never get treatment.  The Minister's proposals are welcome but they will not help those people except, perhaps, through prevention or earlier identification of problems. That remains to be seen.  The £4.4 million will not turn around a problem that has existed for a long time and which is getting worse.</P>
    <P>Most alarming is that, despite improvements introduced by the Minister in the last year and previously, the problem has got worse.  One of the problems is that the health boards are not in a position to pay orthodontists a remunerative rate that is attractive enough to draw people to work within the system.  Why should they work within the system if the conditions and the rates of pay are not comparable to what is available in the market place?  That shortsighted policy causes serious problems further down the line.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the things that happen.  A classical case, which I referred to the Minister about a year ago, is that of a patient identified as being in need of treatment five years ago and put on a list.  After three or four years the patients got worried because by then the child was approaching 21 years of age and nothing had been done other than that she was checked once or twice and, on the second occasion, deemed not to <Col N="451" /> be in immediate danger and put on a further waiting list.  I then took the initiative of asking the parents to refer the child to a private orthodontist for a second opinion and not to mention that the child had already been screened and identified as in need of treatment.  The private orthodontist was of the opinion that the child was in need of urgent treatment if irreparable damage was to be avoided. The system did not respond favourably on receiving this information.  Much shuffling about took place before the patient was eventually seen again.  After much hassle, including representations, and accusations that the patient was attempting to jump the queue, attention was received.  That patient was identified by a private orthodontist as being in urgent need of treatment and had that private orthodontist not seen that patient she would not have got treatment under the present system.</P>
    <P>What happens where the parents are medical card holders or do not have an income that would bring them within reach of a private orthodontist?  Absolutely nothing.  I know of another case where a young girl who was sitting her leaving certificate examination was in severe pain during the examination and was offered no medication.  This girl was a category 1 patient and had been put on a waiting list but her case was not reached for one reason or another.  That unfortunate child had to sit the leaving certificate examination suffering from that pain and agony with no more than a prescribed mouthwash to alleviate the immediate infection problems.  Those are two examples of the hundreds of cases I have come across over the years and I am sure the same applies to most Deputies, whether members of the medical profession or not.  Those of us who are not members of that profession frequently have faster remedies than those who are.</P>
    <P>Unless a fundamental overhaul of the entire orthodontic system is undertaken under the provisions of this Bill, it will be a failure.  The additional funds provided will be a case of throwing good money after bad and will not solve the <Col N="452" /> problem.  It will only create further anomalies in the system.  To clear the waiting lists, would it not be possible to refer to private orthodontists many more patients deemed in need of urgent treatment, for example, category one patients?  Otherwise, we will have an ongoing waiting list of up to 4,000 people in each health board area.  That is not feasible.  Though they cannot afford to, many parents are borrowing money from moneylenders and legitimate institutions to provide treatment for their children.  Even medical cardholders are borrowing money for this treatment because they cannot gain access to the service.  In theory, the service is provided, but that is not the case in reality.  It is only when one of us is in that position that we will fully recognise the frustrations which parents have to put up with.  It is pointless the Minister saying to parents he has provided a categorised system and that in time all patients will be dealt with.  Parents are well aware that only a minority will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>My welcome for the Bill must be weighed against the problems that exist and the possibility that the Minister or officials of his Department may believe this cosmetic measure will solve the problem. It will not.  Mention of cosmetics brings to mind the fact that when a health board comes under pressure to provide services it frequently responds by saying that much of the work is cosmetic and unnecessary.  If that is the case those patients should not be placed in any of the categories.  The first thing is to remove those who should not be on the waiting list.  However, that creates a problem between private and public orthodontists.  In order to shorten waiting lists public orthodontists will be encouraged to eliminate where possible, but of course private orthodontists will not operate under similar restrictions.  I hope we do not have a repetition of the claim that most of the work required by parents for their children is of a cosmetic nature and should not be cluttering up the system.  The treatment is either necessary or not and if it is deemed by a consultant to be necessary it should be carried out. Those on the waiting list whose treatment <Col N="453" /> is deemed unnecessary should be removed from it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions for primary prevention, including fluoridation and health education, which will not require large scale financing.  I also welcome the provisions in respect of primary care for children.  I hope the Minister is sincere in his proposals for the handicapped as there should be no question of the handicapped having to wait for services.  They have enough difficulties without placing them on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated, &ldquo;There are about 915,000 adult persons eligible for dental services under the Act but, regrettably, the services available for such persons have declined in recent years to the point where, in many health board areas, only an accident and emergency dental service is being provided....&rdquo;  I would go further and say there is no service at all. Even in urgent cases it is almost impossible to get a desirable response.</P>
    <P>Many other countries place a great deal more emphasis on dental care.  We are supposed to be a sophisticated developed country and part of the European Union, but compared with other countries we fare badly in respect of dental care.  This is evident when people from foreign countries are interviewed on television. When they smile it is immediately obvious whether their country provides a good dental care service.  The same is true here, especially in rural Ireland, although I am not advocating that people should cease to smile.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with his proposal, but I do not know to what extent the services can be extended on the basis of the moneys available.  Giving the impression that all will be well is one thing but carrying it out is another.  If we have a repetition of more of the same, the Minister will probably be back here in six months' time or less to answer questions.</P>
    <P>The public has been concerned about this issue for some time and whatever is done now should be done in a progressive fashion which will achieve something in the next 12 to 18 months.  If that is not the case the public will give their verdict <Col N="454" /> and it will not be positive.  They will call for extraction and I would not like that to happen to any Minister, but if the anaesthetic is applied in sufficient time and quantity it might give some assistance.</P>
    <P>I wish the scheme well.  If it fails it will not be for want of keeping the Minister on his toes or for want of bringing matters to his attention through the health boards.  That good will exist because members of health boards and Members of this House, who meet their constituents on a regular basis must keep in mind the problems in this area and try to ensure that if they do not achieve the ultimate goal they will discover some light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>The Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides that a health board shall make available without charge a dental service for children who have attended a national or certain other schools and that the Minister for Health may specify, by regulations, the nature of the service to be made available and the age of the children to be provided with the service.</P>
    <P>I presume the proposed regulations will be in accordance with the Minister's speech and will not be restrictive so that what may appear to be a useful though short Bill becomes a retrograde step.  We would not support the Minister in such a measure.  I am sure that is not his intention and he would know that it would not suffice to come up with a measure like that which would give rise to cynicism.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Bill purports to do.  In the past 12 to 13 years many Bills incorporating great ideals, ideology and theory have passed through this House but they failed in practice.  I hope this is not one of them.  If it is, there will be many red faces in this House and maybe one or two extractions without an anaesthetic.</P>

      <P>I too welcome the Bill.  I am not loath to criticise when necessary, but where praise is due it should be given. The Bill has been aptly introduced a little earlier than I anticipated on a day when <Col N="455" /> details of the Irish Heart Foundation's national survey on health behaviour are published.  One newspaper's headline stated that we are lazy, toothless and smoke too much.  Whatever about being lazy and smoking too much, I thought the position in respect of teeth was somewhat better than it is.</P>

      <P>I know I can.  I have cared for my teeth over the years.  There is an angle to this survey with regard to women who have problems with teeth.  The old adage that a woman lost a tooth for every pregnancy is significant in the area of preventative medicine, oral hygiene awareness and issues addressed in the Bill.  The survey in referring to oral health states that 45 per cent of people visited their dentists in the year preceding the survey, 19 per cent had dental treatment one to three years earlier and 36 per cent had not visited their dentists for three or more years.  From a preventative medicine viewpoint, I am pleased that women and men were equally likely to have visited their dentists in the previous year. Younger men and women were more likely to have had recent dental treatment, perhaps because older people were more likely to have dentures.  I am concerned that the age gradient and the social class differential for treatment was greater for women than men.  More than half of those surveyed had most of their own teeth and no dentures, nearly a quarter had some dentures and a quarter had mostly dentures.  Women were more likely to have dentures than men probably resulting from childbirth as much as anything else.  It is sad that 57 per cent of older women had mostly dentures.  It is obviously too late for some people to avail of the preventative services proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has reached agreement with the Irish Dental Association on a great number of issues and agrees that a dental scheme along the lines of that currently under discussion <Col N="456" /> with the association would greatly benefit public health.  He also said that a number of issues have yet to be resolved and hopes they will be finalised shortly.  I would like to tease out those matters.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Minister in implementing the Bill will start at the beginning. We all agree that schoolchildren should be annually screened and treated and should receive necessary preventative and restorative care.  I know there are difficulties and while I receive many complaints from constituents about available treatment, including orthodontic services, I am aware that colleagues receive many more complaints.  The gaps in dental care are distressing for parents and urgent attention is necessary.  Screening should be available for pre-school children from the age of 3 &mdash; it would minimise children's fear of dentists and later pain and discomfort.  Adequate dental care and treatment should be available to all children up to the age of 16 and school based programmes are welcome.  As with education, early identification of a problem facilitates treatment.  The service should also be available to dependants of medical card holders who are entitled to it but sadly do not receive treatment.  I am pleased the Minister introduced the Bill and will provide moneys to address problems in this area.  It is difficult to bridge the gap between primary school dental treatment and adult services.</P>
    <P>There are issues to be teased out, particularly those which the Minister discussed with the Irish Dental Association.</P>
    <P>The Irish Heart Foundation includes oral health as an important part of its health survey.  Standards have dropped and this should be addressed as a matter of urgency.  It is very distressing to see so many Irish people wearing dentures at a young age.  Many suffer needlessly because preventative measures were not taken in time.  I hope that we see the results of this Bill soon.  I welcome the Minister's statement that more than £4 million will be provided in this area and I hope this money will be spent wisely.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Department of Health report stated that health boards were failing in <Col N="457" /> their statutory obligation to provide dental treatment for eligible adults and that the curtailment of routine services for adults and the consequent large increase in demand for emergency services was hampering the development and, in some areas, maintenance of dental services for children.  I hope that as a result of this Bill that trend will be reversed.  There is a high level of professionalism in this area and the Minister, in his dealings with the Irish Dental Association, should seek the use of that professionalism to the best effect for our children and adults who are in need of dental treatment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for introducing it.  I am glad it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister well.  I do so in the full realisation that to bring in a Bill to deal with this matter is not sufficient.  The history of dental care provision is littered with regulations that give people entitlements, but when they try to avail of them the facilities are not there.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is to have any meaning a capital injection must be made into the dental service.  I welcome the Minister's announcement of the allocation of £4.4 million for this purpose.  I doubt if that amount will be sufficient but it is an indication of the Minister's seriousness of intent to provide a proper dental service. There are thousands of children on waiting lists for orthodontic treatment &mdash; some have been waiting for up to four years without satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considerable experience of trying, often in vain, to help parents who are distressed that their children who are not top priority will not receive treatment. In the past the dental service has been inadequate and facilities have been very poor, out of date and unsuitable. However, improvements have been made in general dental care.  There are more than 20,000 people on the Eastern Health Board waiting list.  The idea of breaking down lists into categories is a <Col N="458" /> good one which will enable health boards to clearly assess priority cases.  We should get away from the nonsense that people who are down the line will be treated because the reality is they will not receive treatment.  It is poor comfort to a person in category 5 to know that only those in categories 1 to 4, if they are lucky, will be treated.</P>
    <P>For a very long time the dental profession has been driven by financial considerations. This has led to the provision of a service at a cost well beyond our means and has meant that those who most need treatment are unable to avail of it.  The concentration has been on treatment rather than prevention.  The widening of the scheme to include more children is welcome, but we must recognise that this is an uneasy compromise between the demands of the dental profession and the political will to provide a good service for our people.</P>
    <P>The cost of orthodontic treatment in the private sector is prohibitive.  The irony is that the taxpayer subvents these exorbitant costs as full tax relief is granted to people who avail of such treatment. This has increased the cost of treatment and constitutes bad value for money.  Under the present system pressure is put on parents to provide orthodontic treatment for their children, treatment which sometimes is not necessary. To put too much emphasis on aesthetics will make money for dentists but it may not make the slightest difference to the dental health of a patient.  This distorts the system because it creates a demand led service.  Those who are better at demanding will avail of the service while those who are poorer or who may not be aware of the necessity of seeking treatment will not avail of it. Often those most in need do not get the attention they require.</P>
    <P>It is time to put the dental patient at the centre of the service.  For too long the service has been driven by the dental profession, its requirements and agenda rather than by the needs of patients. There is clear evidence that the poor and unemployed do not avail of treatment to the same extent as do the better off.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> The system of school check-ups which is availed of by many children should be extended, not just for examinations but also in the provision of primary care. There are many dental hygienists who are not employed within the system.  Yet it is such auxiliary staffing that offers the best opportunity for value for money.  If we promote primary care, whether in fissure sealing, advice on health care or whatever, and target attention to those most in need we will improve the general level of dental care.  This has been the subject of debate and consideration in the past, but sadly the rhetoric is better than the practice.</P>
    <P>What we need is a dental service that is based on need rather than on demand. We do not need a dental service that is based on the demands of the profession. The current service is dependent primarily on intervention rather than prevention. As a result those who experience social disadvantage and live on low incomes lose out.</P>
    <P>Although it is not directly related to the dental plan, I wish to pay tribute to the Dublin Dental Hospital which continues to provide a very valuable service in training and the provision of care.  It was originally proposed to relocate the Dental Hospital in the St. James's Hospital complex, but I understand it is now intended to build an extension to the existing facility.  I welcome the £8 million allocated for this purpose.  It is a better idea to leave the Dental Hospital where it is.  The present tendency to move medical facilities to the suburbs will lead to a loss of neccesary facilities in the city centre. It is important that the Dental Hospital maintains its independence and retains its facility in the city centre from which it can provide its services.  It is also important that this hospital continues to contribute to the debate on dental services. Sometimes its views have not always been popular, but they have been helpful in defining the real needs in the service.  I think the call for an extension to the Dental Hospital began 30 years ago.  I welcome the funding provided for the extension to the hospital and look forward <Col N="460" /> to seeing the improvements carried out.</P>
    <P>On the question of extended primary care, dental hygientists have a greater role to play in this area.  We are inclined to think that dental work can be carried out only by dentists, in the same way as we think doctors are the only ones who can provide medical care.  We have to move away from this traditional way of thinking.  There is no reason prevention work cannot be carried out by hygienists or denturists who have a particular role to play in the provision of dental treatment for people who are terminally ill, patients in oncology units and those infected with the HIV virus.  Auxiliaries can deal with these people in a sensitive way and devote more time to them.</P>
    <P>We do not have a great record in terms of dental health but there has been a steady improvement in recent years.  The survey carried out by the Oral Health Services Research Centre in UCC shows that there has been a noticeable improvement in the level of oral health among Irish adults.  However, as in so many other areas of health, the survey found evidence of a lower level of oral health among medical card holders and women. It is vital that we concentrate our efforts and resources on targeting those groups who do not enjoy improved standards of health.</P>
    <P>One obvious way of improving dental health is through the fluoridation of the water supply.  The use of fluoride in toothpaste has been another weapon in the fight against tooth decay.  However, it should be remembered that less than two-thirds of our water supply is fluoridated and it is the urban rather than the rural dweller who benefits.  I am very interested in hearing the Minister's plans for additional fluoridation of our water supply.  One could not argue that there should be no extension of fluoridation.  I accept the argument that the fluoridation of water and the use of fluoride in toothpaste benefit people.  However, the reality is that people in certain areas have more protection than others.  In my county a man contested elections on the platform of &ldquo;no fluoridated water&rdquo;.  I <Col N="461" /> would be concerned if the philosophical argument about private liberty versus public good exacerbated the problem and became a live issue.  The arguments against the use of fluoride in water do not stand up when one looks at the benefits of fluoridation.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read the survey on health behaviour in Ireland which produced important documentary evidence in this area.  The Irish Heart Foundation's report highlighted the continuing prevalence of smoking and alcohol drinking and the low level of physical activity among adults.  However, one fundamental question was not addressed in this survey but should be addressed if health care, dental of otherwise, is to meet the needs of the population.  The Irish Heart Foundation in this survey pinpointed factors such as diet, smoking, drink and a lack of exercise as the causes of coronary artery disease.  However, the reality is that an unemployed middle aged male is twice as likely to suffer a heart attack as an employed middle aged male.</P>
    <P>Any survey on health behaviour must take into account the class nature of our society, the fact that almost one-third of our children live in poverty and our endemic unemployment problem.  These issues must be tackled and addressed if we are to improve the general health care of the nation.  The promotion of healthy but expensive diets to reduce cardiovascular disease does not address the problem for those who cannot afford the diets.  Yet these are the very people whose needs must be addressed if overall improvements are to be obtained.  The dietary habits of our population have an impact on our dental health.  There is a general recognition that sugar is a cheap source of energy but it is also a cause of tooth decay.  Our level of sugar consumption is very high &mdash; I think it is double the level of some developed countries. Evidence is available to show that poorer children are more at risk because of the amount of cheaper foodstuffs they consume.  The question of diet is dealt with in this major national survey but the implications of poverty are not.  While there has been an improvement in terms <Col N="462" /> of the amount of fruit, vegetables and fish consumed, the reality is that the biggest restriction on diet is poverty, an issue which has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that only one out of three of those surveyed had not visited their dentists in three or more years.  Reference is made in the report to the early age at which people have dentures fitted.  I have no doubt that the number of women who have dentures fitted has more to do with their background than whether they have had children. It is not so much childbirth as the class into which one is born which causes this phenomenon.  When talking about dental or any other form of health we must take the class factors into account and research the matter fully.  Not enough research has been carried out into how unemployment and poverty affect health, both dental and otherwise.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in seeking the Minister's national health strategy.  I welcome the dental plan outlined by him. This element has to form part of any health strategy.  However, the strategy must be tailored towards those individuals and groups among whom the greatest improvement can be expected. As in the case of all major diseases, dental or otherwise, this means directing prevention treatment towards those living in poverty.  This point has to be repeatedly made because this is the context in which we are talking when we refer to any health measure or improvement in the health status of the nation.  If we concentrate on those groups who suffer most from disease and are most in need of dental treatment we will have a better chance of raising the general level of the nation's health.</P>
    <P>This comes back to my original point about the dental service &mdash; it is time to put the needs of patients at the centre of the service. There has been this domination of the interests of the dental profession. I would support the Minister if he put the patient at the centre of the service in a way that will improve the standards that exist at present.  That will require resourcing.  The professional contractual <Col N="463" /> issues necessary will have to be tackled and there will have to be a shift. That is necessary and I hope with the allocation of money there will be a greater concentration on the needs of those most at risk and also a concentration on primary care, on prevention rather than treatment, because that is the key.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  In my experience in County Wicklow, in my local health centre dentists operate in dilapidated prefabricated buildings.  There are specific accommodation needs of which the Minister is well aware.  I accept he made a statement on health centres, including the welcome one that the health centre in Bray is to go ahead, and he is due to open the Roundwood health centre next week.  The Minister will be very welcome to County Wicklow and I ask him to keep up the good work.</P>
    <P>I wish to underline the point, however, that there are good people working in the service at present but the facilities with which they are provided are totally inadequate to meet their needs.  We have to use whatever resources that are made available to service patients in the most effective way possible and to target those most in need, the poor, families who suffer as a result of high unemployment and need to be encouraged into the system.  They should have an equal opportunity to care for their teeth.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this timely Bill.  I am glad its provisions will be implemented on a phased basis and will result in a full national dental programme for all our people in due course.  I hope this will not be done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and that improvements will be made to it in time.</P>
      <P>The increase in the age limit from 14 to 16 years is to be welcomed because many of the dental problems diagnosed while children are at national school, particularly orthodontic problems, are not fully dealt with before they leave national school.  This welcome measure will obviate many of the present problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> I hope parents will have an opportunity to choose their own dentist.  If there is an inadequate response from dentists in the private sector the Minister might consider employing dentists on a contract basis as is the case with regard to orthodontists. I have no doubt that if the Minister deals with the dentists in a fair manner those operating in the private sector will support him.</P>
    <P>We do not have adequate orthodontic services in the west of Ireland and there is only one orthodontist for Galway and Mayo.  While this represents an improvement as no service existed previously, it is not sufficient.  I ask the Minister to consider engaging dentists to undertake much of the preliminary orthodontic work in conjunction with the orthodontists in the different health board areas.  Approximately 60 to 70 per cent of orthodontic work could be carried out by regular dentists and the special cases could be referred to the orthodontist.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the matter of young children requiring anaesthetics.  We have a major problem in the west, particularly in Ballina, in that parents are sometimes required to travel 70 miles or more with young children fasting to have dental extractions and other dental work carried out under anaesthetic.  I hope the Minister will introduce a programme using district or county hospitals for anaesthetic services, thereby eliminating the need for people to travel long distances.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a welcome start to a new programme.  I look forward to the implementation of its provisions, but not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  I hope it will lead to a full programme being introduced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult not to welcome this Bill because it sets out to do what we would all like to see happen.  Without wishing to sound like a doubting Thomas, the theory of a Bill is one thing but the implementation of its provisions is <Col N="465" /> another.  In theory, up to now school children at primary level were entitled to a free dental service but, unfortunately, the service was simply not available. Many of their parents, if they could afford it, paid for private treatment.  I hope that the £4 million to which the Minister referred, in addition to the negotiations the Minister is involved in, will result in the provisions of the Bill being implemented in practice.</P>
    <P>One of the telephone calls that I do not like receiving from my constituents is from a parent whose child left primary school last year and is now in secondary school, and is in need of orthodontic treatment before it is to late.  Many Members have had similar representations, depending, of course, on what area they represent.  Some areas appear to have a good orthodontic service. The Minister represents my health board region and Carlow and Kilkenny are two of the counties that did not have an orthodontist.  I realise strenuous efforts are being made to train people by way of special weekend training sessions &mdash; that is to be lauded &mdash; but it is no consolation to the parents who telephone me with this problem.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a health board and I had a special interest in the appointment of orthodontists.  During my term of office we appointed three orthodontists, none of whom took up the positions because they could earn more money in private practice.  At that time I suggested an increase in the rate of payment to encourage orthodontists to take up these positions because we cannot expect them to leave a private practice that is providing them with a large income to join the public service which is suffering from cutbacks etc.  This has been a difficult problem over the years.</P>
    <P>I am glad free dental care will be made available to the children of those with medical cards.  It would have been unfair to have excluded them but, unfortunately, there is inequality in all walks of life.  I am referring to those whose income is just above the medical card limit.  I feel very sorry for those people because they cannot afford to obtain <Col N="466" /> these services privately.  Deputy McManus referred to five lists &mdash; I am only familiar with &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; and if a person's name is not on the &ldquo;A&rdquo; list he or she is excluded.  Certainly if one's name is not on the &ldquo;A&rdquo; list with which I am familiar, one could do without because, on the &ldquo;B&rdquo; list, one is regarded as a cosmetic case.  Very often the people whose treatment is regarded as cosmetic have crooked teeth, or teeth growing out of the side of their gums but still are not eligible for inclusion in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; list due to pressure on the system.  I hope the Minister, in his forward-looking fashion, will contact the health boards and endeavour to ensure that orthodontic treatment is available to people in need of it, especially children who have been told in primary school that they need such treatment who, if they do not receive it, correctly feel they are deprived of something they need.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister and other Members talk about this treatment being made available for children up to 16 years of age but I find that it is applicable up to the 16th birthday, so that it is really children up to and including 15-year-olds who are covered.  However, it sounds much better to say up to 16 and I suppose technically it is correct.  It is a good stroke; well done to whoever thought of it.</P>

      <P>Like his initiative on the orthopaedic services which I defended in my home base in the Southern Health Board area and, again last week against some of the misleading statements by the President of the Irish Hospitals Consultants Association, here again the Minister is dealing with an issue involving a certain level of vested interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is being introduced against a background of services for one million insured adults having virtually collapsed. <Col N="467" /> I welcome any attempt by the Minister to deal with this.  I can speak from my experience only in the Cork/Kerry region where, unless one is in deep pain and trauma as a result of dental problems, one will not be treated; it is an emergency service only.  We have a two-tier system in that, if one is a public patient, one must wait but, if one can afford to pay, one receives immediate treatment.  I hope the Minister's discussions with the Irish Dental Association will result in some solution for that problem.</P>
    <P>Referring to the Minister's discussions with the Irish Dental Association, I am somewhat worried about the provision of denturists.  Some years ago I thought one of the Minister's predecessors had almost completed an agreement with the Irish Dental Association regarding the status of denturists here.  Indeed it would greatly relieve consumers' finances if there was direct access to denturists.  I am not convinced by some of the arguments put forward by the Irish Dental Association on recognition of denturists. Will the Minister, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, reach an agreement at some future date on the provision of dentures for insured persons by allowing insured persons direct access to denturists, when there would be a substantial saving for the consumer and Exchequer alike.</P>
    <P>A very serious position obtains for orthodontists.  In the Southern Health Board area approximately 2,000 persons wait orthodontic treatment with approximately 800 being treated annually.  The parameters for eligibility for orthodontic treatment were changed some years ago resulting in the exclusion of many of the children on the waiting list, which meant there was an effective reduction in the waiting list.  However, that did not change the public's overall perception of a very expensive service where if one has the requisite moneys, treatment is available on demand whereas, if one does not one has to wait.  We should remember that children between the ages of 12 and 14 are very sensitive about this problem <Col N="468" /> and orthodontic treatment cannot be classified as a cosmetic exercise.</P>
    <P>At some stage, perhaps not this evening, will the Minister address the position in the Southern Health Board area where six orthodontic units at St. Finbarr's Hospital are set up and ready to go but the health board do not have the requisite finances or resources to staff those units?  While the provisions of this Bill are laudable, unless adequate resources are made available for the delivery of the service, it will be so much pie in the sky only.</P>
    <P>Additional funds were provided by the Department in 1992 for the capital development of orthodontic services in the Southern Health Board area, which allowed for the provision of an orthodontic unit comprised of six dental surgery units.  In a letter dated 23 June, 1993 the Department provided £55,000 funding for those orthodontic services and indicated that under no circumstances should the health board commit itself to expenditure above that sum unless approved.  If the Southern Health Board in consultation with its consultant orthodontic surgeon, takes five dentists from the rooting services, must it provide resources to fill the five vacant units in order to deliver an orthodontic service?  Within the context of this Bill &mdash; since £4 million is being made available &mdash; will the Minister say whether part of that funding will be set aside for the appointment of the five dentists required to fill the five vacant positions there? There are six units to be manned; we have a consultant orthodontic surgeon and we need five more orthodontic surgeons. Will the Minister release funds from the £4 million to fill those five vacancies to allow us continue to deliver the primary services to the people of the Cork and Kerry area?  This additional funding is required to staff the orthodontic unit with five dental surgeons and six dental surgery assistants, who would be trained under the consultant orthodontist and who would serve each community care area.</P>
    <P>The statistics available are quite frightening. Certainly in national schools in <Col N="469" /> Cork city, rather than two examinations being made, one early in a child's national school career and another just prior to leaving national school, there is only one examination now, normally in the fifth or sixth year of primary school, and the children will have moved on to secondary school before receiving any treatment.  In many cases treatment is not delivered at all.  To say that the service is in a &ldquo;shambles&rdquo; is perhaps overstating the position but certainly it is very disturbing and upsetting for parents, in that some schoolchildren are being treated and others ignored because of the pressures and inadequate resources.</P>
    <P>I welcome any improvement in the services. One must set aside political differences and support this Bill.  Will the Minister, not alone in relation to dental services but in the delivery of medical services generally at some future date address the issue of professional fees?</P>
    <P>I read in a newspaper today that the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association and its President, Mr. Healy, are adopting a militant attitude, threatening to have their members withdraw from the VHI scheme.  On professional fees, the bullet must be bitten at some stage and consumers interests must be protected. At present unreasonable, at times outrageous, fees can be demanded and if one does not pay one must do without the service.  Indeed I know of people who have been forced to pay over and above the VHI limit before a medical service was delivered.  That must be taken on board by the Minister.  When a person is in poor health the last thing they want is a demand for moneys over and above what they expected to pay.  I wish the Minister well in his dealings on this whole issue.  A recent survey showed that the level of professional fees for dental services in Northern Ireland contrasted starkly with the fees charged in the Republic for similar services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my gratitude for the welcome the Bill has received from speakers on all sides of the House.  Although it is a short Bill it deals with an area all practising <Col N="470" /> politicians are aware of.  One of my first ordeals as Minister for Health was to attend an open forum with the members of the Health Boards Association.  That was a daunting prospect because it involved an open question time, without an agenda, for the real practitioners who know what is going on on the ground and are familiar with all the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I said then I was aware that there are good parts and bad parts of health service delivery and the dental services came into the bad parts.  I said I was not satisfied that the public dental services were all that they could be.  They are deficient in a number of ways.  They are deficient in the overall but they are also deficient on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>Although the Bill does not deal specifically with orthodontics, virtually every Deputy who contributed referred to that issue.  While welcoming the Bill, Deputy Durkan referred to the amount of money being made available this year. I am glad I have Government approval in 1994 for the expenditure of £4.4 million additional moneys.  When we consider that the total spend on dental services is approximately £25 million in percentage terms it is a significant start.  What I have embarked upon is a plan dramatically to improve dental services.  I will not pretend that will be achieved in one year or that it will be achieved with £4 million additional moneys.  It is a phased plan over three years.  Before I leave office as Minister for Health I hope we will have a dental service of which we can all be proud and that as practitioners in public life we will not have the same number of calls at our clinics and our offices from people who are entitled, under the Act, to services which they are not receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1992 there was only one consultant orthodontist employed in the health board system.  Now there are consultant orthodontists in the Southern, Western, South-Eastern, North-Western, Mid-Western and Eastern Health Board areas, as well as consultant orthodontists <Col N="471" /> operating in the Dublin Dental Hospital and St. James's Hospital who are treating public patients.  The two health boards who do not have consultant orthodontists have authorisations for them and have arrangements for cover. The North-Eastern Health Board is covered by Northern Ireland while the Midland Health Board is covered by the Mid-Western Health Board.  I am not suggesting that that is adequate cover but we have made a dramatic improvement during the past two years.</P>
    <P>The staff required to provide a proper orthodontic service will not be entirely consultant.  We also require specialists and sub-specialists to deal with the different categories of orthodontic deformity, some of which will be relatively minor and can be dealt with by sub-specialists who have training in orthodontics.  That is all programmed into the plan which will be underpinned by resources.  When sitting on the Opposition benches nobody repeated more often than I that grandiose plans were useless without money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have refused to bring plans to the floor of this House unless they are realistic and can be achieved. During the next four years we can bring orthodontic treatment levels up to the European-norm.  No more than any other country, we will not be able to treat every person who presents for orthodontic treatment.  A debate is taking place within orthodontics, as Deputy McManus stated, concerning the number of people seeking treatment.  Not everybody can present themselves to a public health system and demand to have a nose straightened or some facial deformity cleared up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is almost an expectation that if one has a crooked tooth it must be dealt with.  We will not be able <Col N="472" /> to deal with every single case.  Nevertheless I am confident that the programme I am negotiating and resourcing will bring treatment levels in Ireland up to the European norm.  That would be a desirable objective and one I would be proud to achieve.</P>
      <P>Adult services, referred to by Deputy Durkan, are those which cause me the greatest worry.  The dental teams focus on children, they carry out the assessments and provide the treatment. Throughout the country generally we have a good children's dental treatment service but not a good adult treatment service.  That is the reason I have embarked on discussions with the Irish Dental Association with a mix of both private and public to provide adequately for adults who have an entitlement.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the development plan are as follows: a phased extension of the new fluoridation plants and maintenance of the existing plants, some of which need further capital investment; the extension of eligibility to children up to 16 years for free dental and orthodontic services, as will be enabled by the legislation before us; the restructuring of the schools dental service to provide for the systematic screening of a minimum of two to three designated classes in each national school and follow up screening and treatment, up to the age of 16, on a phased basis; improvements in both primary and secondary orthodontic services; improvements in oral surgery and new structured arrangements for dealing with adults, which I have outlined.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keogh who welcomed the Bill said it had arrived in the House earlier than expected, due to the expedition of the House in dealing with other legislation. I confess I would be happier had I finalised a deal with the Irish Dental Association before bringing the Bill to the House.  My contribution would be even more up beat had that been the case.  We are in the hands of the legislative process and we have to deal with the realities as they unfold.  I hope within days, or at most within weeks, to have the agreement with the Irish Dental Association in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> Deputy Keogh spoke at some length about the happy heart national health survey, carried out by the Irish Heart Foundation, which I launched yesterday. Some of the facts that emerged from the snapshot of our health statistics leave much to be desired, not only in the area of dental care.  I am concerned that we have good data.  It is important to know the system and then set about improving it.  The measurement of the health vital signs and the development of a programme to substantially improve them is the framework which will guide the health strategy which I hope to publish next week.  I hope we will have an opportunity in the House to debate it at some length.  It will be an important framework for the evolution of the health services during the next four or five years and well into the next century.  As a people we will have to make choices.  Every health system in the world is under pressure for resources.  We can spend an infinite amount of money and we have to make health choices about what is proper.  We must make choices in a democratic way through discussion with all parties. Deputy Keogh sought further information on the discussions with the Irish Dental Association.  Over the last six weeks positive, encouraging and amicable discussions have taken place between the Department and the Irish Dental Association.  Both parties have the same broad objective to provide dental care to all eligible adults.  The scheme will involve private dental practitioners and health board dentists, the latter working under new arrangements. Discussion so far has centred on a number of issues &mdash; treatments both routine and emergency, the provision of dentures, fees to be paid to dentists participating in the scheme, the role of health boards in the context of their statutory responsibilities under the health Acts to provide dental treatment and the contractual arrangements to be worked out for participating dentists in the new scheme.  Hopefully the discussions will be concluded shortly.  A broad consensus has been reached on a number of these issues.  Another meeting will be held on <Col N="474" /> Friday next.  The Deputy will appreciate the Irish Dental Association will put whatever proposals emerge to a ballot of its members.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh mentioned the disparity between dental services.  I am aware of the differences in the dental service available to insured workers and that available to meet medical card holders.  The social welfare scheme is a good one and I am determined medical card holders will not have a scheme which is less good than that available to insured workers.  They are both entitled to the best possible service.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus welcomed the Bill. She spoke about legislation which is hopeful, positive and idealistic but fails to deliver.  I am determined this legislation will not be passed and forgotten about.  The framework for its implementation is well advanced.  I agree with her comment regarding real need as opposed to perceived need.  She said, in essence, that the meek do not inherit the earth because those who are meek do not get the best services.  Those who are pushy and vocal often get a service not because they need it but because they have clout. We must address that.  She spoke of the need for dental hygienists.  Negotiations with the staff are well advanced and it is my intention to employ dental hygienists in the public dental system before the end of this year.  I support her views on the role of dental auxiliaries in the provision of dental care.</P>
    <P>She raised the issue of the dental hospital.  There has been much debate about who should be responsible for it.  I was determined to do something about it and my concern was shared by the Minister for Education.  The Dublin Dental Hospital was covered by her capital vote. For many years it fell between two stools It was covered by the Education Vote but perceived to be a health facility.  This year an interdepartmental group chaired by my Department and involving the Departments of Finance and Education was set up.  There is agreement that the school should be rebuilt on its current site at Trinity.  It provides a valuable service for inner city Dublin and it would <Col N="475" /> cost a vast sum of money if it were located elsewhere.  I concur with the views expressed by the Deputy that the training and treatments provided by the hospital form a vital component of the dental services.  I am delighted that £8 million was approved by Government and that construction will commence, hopefully, this year and be completed within three years.</P>

      <P>Deputy McManus raised the issue of fluoridation.  It is 30 years ago since the scheme commenced and it is something we now take for granted.  It has contributed to the huge improvement in the oral health status of people.  Overall 74 per cent of the population is serviced by fluoridated water varying from 99 per cent in the Eastern Health Board to 50 per cent in the Western Health Board.  It is difficult to extend it to individual water schemes.  However, it has led to a dramatic reduction in dental disease and in the requirement for treatment.  A significant amount of the plant is now 20 years old and needs to be upgraded.  Part of the scheme will be the installation of new plant and the upgrading of existing plant.  Where fluoridated water is not available the use of fluoride toothpaste and fluoridated mouth washes are recommended.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moffatt welcomed both the proposals and the plan which he hoped would be a structured one.  Rather than saying we have a sum of money for this year and working on that, we worked on having a system we could all be proud of which will be phased in over four years in a structured way.  It will not impact to the degree we would like everywhere this year but in the next two or three years we will see a significant improvement in the dental services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about the choice of dentist and that formed part of our discussions with the IDA.  I hope to be more specific when the discussions have concluded.  He said there was only one orthodontist in the west.  He is very busy and is currently training three dentists. Hopefully there will be an improved service available in the west in the future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne mentioned orthodontics. It will be the duty of the consultants who are appointed to train dentists in orthodontics and ensure there is an adequate service available.  It is one area I am nervous about because the demand is so enormous.  When staff are recruited a dramatic improvement will take place because a large number of cases will be taken off the list but the treatment lasts for a year and so there will not be another dramatic improvement for a long time.</P>

To deal adequately with children we will recruit 110 additional dental teams in the next four years to add to the 300 in place across the country to deal primarily with children.  We will have a screening process in place for all primary schools, we intend to have a better primary system of fluoridation and to have auxiliaries, including dental hygienists, employed in the system.  We hope to have the new adult treatment scheme in place to deal on a phased basis with the different cohorts of eligible people.  It is an ambitious plan but one that will bring dramatic improvements in the next four years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen welcomed the Bill.  He need not be concerned that he agrees with the development plan because I know that the minute I do something wrong he will be the first to point it out forcefully.  I am sure it will not be too long before he will have ample cause to disagree with me.</P>

There is a number of options to achieve this, they are being discussed and I hope we will come to a solution that can be supported by the Deputy opposite.</P>

    <P>Deputy Allen raised the specific needs of the Southern Health Board and I commend him for making an immediate bid for a slice of the £4.4 million.

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 states:</P>
      <P>(1)  A health board shall make available without charge, for children who have attended a national school or a school standing specified in an order under section 66 (3) of the Health Act, 1970, and are of or under such age as may be specified by the Minister by regulations, such dental health services as may be so specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has specified that the person must be under 16 years of age.  Will he be more specific and outline the service likely to be available?  A reasonable screening service is offered through the schools but problems arise in the provision of orthodontic treatment.  The Minister spent some time agreeing with my colleague on the Opposition benches who agrees with the people who tell me that a great many problems are merely cosmetic.  There is a danger that people will seek cosmetic treatment at the expense of the taxpayer.  Will he be specific on how it is proposed to categorise the people who need treatment?  Category 1 patients should get the treatment as quickly as possible and although it will take up to a year that is not sufficient excuse for not attempting to tackle the problem.  There is no sense in enacting this legislation unless it attempts to do something about the problem.  I am sure the Minister shares my view that we do not want to find ourselves in a year's <Col N="479" /> time in the same position having failed to identify the categories of people who need urgent attention.  I am worried about the availability of finance and I accept the Minister's assertion that all the problems cannot be solved at once. Unless there is a commitment that those in need of urgent care will get it as and from a specific date, we are wasting our time.</P>
    <P>A 15 year old may have an orthodontic problem that is not deemed sufficiently urgent to deal with it immediately.  If the problem is not dealt with before his or her sixteenth birthday what will happen? If treatment is started before a person's sixteenth birthday will it be continued when the person is 17, 18 or 19, as the case may be?  Everybody is aware of the age limit so that if it is wished to offload a category at any time, one has only to wait until the person is no longer eligible. Will the person who should have had treatment before becoming ineligible on age grounds be treated under the scheme?  If category 1 patients do not get orthodontic treatment we are wasting our time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister informed the House that some £8 million will be made available for the construction on site in Trinity of a new Dublin dental school-hospital. I am sure the Minister is aware that in 1985 the then Committee on Public Expenditure examined the proposals before Government on the dental school-hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on manpower requirements in the dental service produced by Coopers &amp; Lybrand showed that the number of personnel required would reduce substantially between 1985 and 1990.  The throughput at the Dublin dental school will be 40 approximately. Thirty-five dentists approximately are being trained at the Cork dental school, although it can train up to 50.  Some years ago it trained about 45 until it was ordered by the Department of Education to reduce this number.  It appears therefore, having regard to the Coopers &amp; Lybrand report, that there is a surplus of <Col N="480" /> dentists.  It was implied at the time that we were educating dentists for export.</P>
    <P>As Ministers come and go as attitudes change, can the Minister give us a cast iron guarantee about the future of the Cork dental school?  There was grave disquiet that the construction of a new dental school in Dublin would eventually lead to the closure of one dental school. Is the Minister happy that the construction of a new unit in the middle of Dublin represents the best way forward? Would the population of Dublin be better served if a number of dental units were provided throughout the city?  On what basis was the decision made?  Was it taken on educational grounds or on the grounds of providing an efficient and effective dental service to the public?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 will enable me to extend the legal entitlement to dental services to children who have reached the age of 16.  A number of specific points have been raised.  In relation to the provision of orthodontic treatment there are three categories which have been agreed with the orthodontic associations.  The position is that if a patient is included in category A which covers the most serious cases there is no waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have checked the position with every health board and there is no waiting list.  For patients included in category B there is a long waiting list, while patients included in category C which covers cosmetic treatment will not be reached.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan mentioned that patients awaiting orthodontic treatment suffer pain.  In general patients awaiting such treatment do not suffer pain but those in pain can avail of an emergency service and are given priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also expressed concern about the age limit.  If the problem is noted during the period a patient is eligible it will be treated and under the current guidelines the patient will retain entitlement.  In the case of orthodontic treatment it may not be possible to provide <Col N="481" /> treatment for a patient until their teeth develop.  Some of those on the waiting list are in this category.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen referred to the Dublin dental hospital and voiced concerns about the future of the Cork dental school.  I can give a cast iron guarantee that there is a need for two schools.  The Dublin dental school will train dentists and provide a service in Dublin.  This will include secondary and tertiary care.  The Cork dental school will provide a similar service in the south.  The report to which the Deputy referred is dated.  The interdepartmental group which is chaired by my Department and comprises the Department of Finance and the Department of Education suggested that there was a need for a Dublin dental school, that it provided invaluable services and training and that it should be retained at its present location on the grounds of the cost involved.  It would be more expensive to provide this facility at the other location considered, St. James's Hospital.  That was a wise decision and it was approved by the Government.  There is no question of downgrading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister said that all patients included in category A are treated immediately but this is not the case.  The problem is that all of the patients who should be included in category A are not included.  I made the point on Second Stage that consultants are being pressurised to deal with the most serious cases.  The Minister's attention was drawn to a particular case on several occasions by way of parliamentary question.  Although the patient concerned was in extreme pain they were not included in category A.  This was not an isolated case.  The patient was told repeatedly to take medication, which did not relieve the pain.  I hope the Minister <Col N="482" /> will ensure that when patients are being screened they will be checked to ensure that they have not reached the stage where they require urgent treatment. Parents are paying to have this treatment carried out by private orthodontists. As a result they are subsidising the system.</P>

      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Keogh, on the amount of time and thought she put into drafting this Bill and on the support she has gained for the Bill both in this House and outside.  I also thank the Opposition speakers who, to date, have spoken warmly and cogently in support of the Bill.  In anticipation, I thank Deputy Frances Fitzgerald who will be speaking in support of this Bill later this evening.  The contributions of all the Members who spoke in favour of this Bill are much appreciated by the Progressive Democrats.  The amount of research and preparation they put into their contributions stands to the credit of the Members who have subscribed to date and is a mark of the importance they attach to this Bill.  It is particularly encouraging for women who will be the main beneficiaries of this Bill if passed into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also acknowledge the support given to this Bill by the Council for the Status of Women.  In a supportive statement sent to our party, the Chairwoman of the Council for the Status of Women, Ms <Col N="483" /> Ann Taylor, said the Bill &ldquo;was a laudable attempt to give statutory recognition to the unpaid work of women in the home&rdquo;. She goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Following the Supreme Court decision which found the Government's Bill on joint ownership of the matrimonial home unconstitutional, women feel that their rights are not being adequately protected.  This Bill is a valuable attempt to put this issue back on the agenda.</P>
    <P>She goes on &mdash; and I am glad the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is here to take note&mdash;</P>
    <P>The principle of this Bill is what matters and it is vital that the Government does not underestimate its importance to Irish women.  Any attempt to recognise in law the contribution made by women in the home through their unpaid work must be welcomed and it is critical that this issue is dealt with before the Government's proposed referendum on divorce later this year.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of sound common sense in that statement.  It is important that that be noted by the Government as it frames a response to this Bill and shapes up to voting on it in an hour and a half &mdash; I am still optimistic that the outcome will be positive.</P>
    <P>This basic reform is long overdue.  The objective of the Bill is simple, and its simplicity is its strength.  It is simple without being simplistic.  It was very clever and far seeing of Deputy Keogh to be able to frame a Bill that is set out in short and general terms and that lacks the complexity that often ends up with a Bill of this nature being in conflict with our Constitution.  There would have been no need for this Bill if the Government's Matrimonial Homes Bill had been drafted with the same forethought as this Bill.  After all the time discussing it, it is extremely disappointing that this Bill finished up being rejected.  It is a severe setback to women's rights and to this Dáil.  This suggests that the requisite amount of preparation and forethought <Col N="484" /> was not put into it.  It ought to be possible to frame legislation which, when referred to the Supreme Court, would not fall.  If that had not happened the present Bill would not be before the House tonight.</P>
    <P>What we are seeking is recognition in law of the non-financial contribution of a spouse towards the family home.  What is the contribution of the spouse who does not make a financial contribution to the home?  It is well known to most people, and certainly to women.  It can be summed up simply as raising the children, the next generation on whom we pin our hopes, running the home and keeping house.  However, to put it in those terms is a gross over-simplification.  The tasks involved are those on which we, in the Progressive Democrats seek to put a value and to have recognised in law.  The contribution made in the home is far more than raising a family.  The spouse, in most cases the woman, who stays at home and makes the unpaid contribution to society and to the home is, among other things the person who does the shopping and the cooking.  She is the source of consolation and encouragement to the whole family and, sometimes, to the whole community.  She is the tutor who overseas the children's homework, the arbiter in childhood disputes, the imparter of a great deal of basic education, often the enforcer of the family's code of behaviour and of sanctions when there is a breach of that code, the monitor of the children's whereabouts, the promoter of the families religious or ethical standards, the purchaser of clothing, the counsellor, the willing listener, the career adviser, the manager of the children's social life and so on.  Who could fail to put a value on that contribution to the well being of society and of our country?  Who are the people who would benefit if this Bill were to be accepted by the Government?  For the most part they are the women of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In an extraordinarily patchy contribution Deputy Ferris, in a feeble attempt to denigrate this Bill, said: &ldquo;only small categories of people would be involved&rdquo;.  I would make two points in <Col N="485" /> that regard.  It has been quoted in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women that almost half of all women aged 15 and over do unpaid work in the home.  It was also pointed out in that report that there has been no substantial increase in the number of women working outside the home in the last 20 years.  It is, therefore, incorrect to say that we are talking about a small category of people.  There is statistical evidence to prove that.</P>
    <P>Even if we were talking about small categories of people, as legislators in this so-called Republic are we not concerned about small or minority groups?  Surely the hallmark of a healthy society is the manner in which it provides for its minority groups.  Women in this position have been overlooked for a long time.  If that statement was quoted what signal would it give to minority groups in the North?  What signal will go out from this House if legislation deemed by a particular Deputy to cater for a small group of people is rendered invalid and becomes the hallmark of the approach by Government to legislation?  I am appalled that anybody should use that argument to denigrate this Bill.</P>
    <P>The manner in which we deal with equality issues as opposed to the way we make speeches or put on paper our aspirations about such issues is a major concern.  This legislation also relates to equality.  The out-of-court settlement yesterday in respect of equality payments long overdue to married women &mdash; many in the category for whom we seek to make provision in this Bill &mdash; must make Ministers blush.  It must be a matter of grave embarrassment, after years of fudging and denying those women their entitlements, that in total capitulation in an out-of-court settlement it was finally acknowledged the moneys claimed were due.</P>
    <P>This morning I asked the Taoiseach if it was his intention to honour the settlement and to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to enable the long overdue payments to be made without delay.  The women involved have shown incredible patience waiting so long, but their patience <Col N="486" /> has run out.  I appeal to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to request Cabinet to introduce such an Estimate without delay so that the payments can be made.  Payments should also be made to the many hundreds of women who were not included in yesterday's settlement, but who have an equally valid claim to payment.  If that is done at least some kind of reparation will have been made for the long delay.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this relatively new Government should, with a few exceptions, vote against Private Members' Bills, regardless of their merit.  This Government claimed it would be an open one.  To what is it open?  Is it open to good ideas because at the heart of this Bill is a series of good ideas?  If it is not open to good ideas and constructive creative thinking, from whatever source, it can hardly claim to be any better or different from the type of Governments the Labour Party denigrated with such energy when in Opposition.  In that regard I pay tribute to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on whose part I detect a strong and exceptional degree of openness to taking on board good ideas from whatever source. She listens to people and takes good ideas on board.  It will be disappointing if the Government votes down this Bill and refuses to acknowledge its excellence and urgency.  This legislation would not have been introduced if the Government's Bill, which was so badly bungled, had not faltered at the hurdle of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a direct response to the vacuum created by the collapse of that Bill.  It is also a response to two factors that stand to be overlooked in the &ldquo;retreat from Moscow&rdquo; by the Government; its members are putting their heads in the sand and pretending the urgency we placed on that Bill is no longer a factor in society.  The Bill is a response to the overwhelming need, in equity and natural justice, to give practical recognition in law to the unpaid work of the spouse in the home.  It is also a clear response to the judgment handed down by the Chief Justice in the L. <i>v.</i> L. case.  In summary, <Col N="487" /> that judgment stressed the objective we seek is a desirable and social one.  It was suggested by the Judiciary that legislation should be put in place to acknowledge its verdict and that the obligation was on the legislators to do so.  It is regrettable that the House, in this as well as many other respects, lags behind court decisions.  It is embarrassing that the Judiciary, as it has been forced to do from time to time, has had to draw attention to our failure to put in place the type of legislation that responds to modern conditions, hopes and aspirations.  This is another case in point and it is disappointing it has not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to this Bill was upsetting.  When he was on the Opposition benches he was to the fore in seeking reforming legislation and in castigating the previous Government and its leaders day after day for their failure to bring our law up to date, to introduce essential reforms and to bring our law into line with that of other countries. He was particularly scathing about the failure of successive Fianna Fáil Governments in respect of social legislation. However, when he spoke in the House a week ago he was more conservative, obstructionist and destructive than any Member I heard speak in this House, and I have been here for seven years, two and a half months.</P>
    <P>In the history of botany or whatever the relevant science is, it has seldom happened that the butterfly turned into a caterpillar with such speed.  The great red winged admiral, the champion of reform, who stood on this side of the House suddenly turned out to be the green slithery caterpillar.  It upsets me that that should happen.  Although I can be as vociferous as any Deputy in Opposition, when a Government is doing well, whatever the label of that Government, I am the first to praise it.  When a Minister is doing well I am one of the first TDs to admit it.  As the Minister knows when the stillbirths Bill was introduced I was fulsome in my praise, but when the second in command in this Government, makes the kind of <Col N="488" /> speech he made here a week ago, it makes the hair stand on my head.  I am sorry that had to happen: and I am very sorry for the signals it sent to women.  I predict that that speech will haunt him.  I read his speech again this evening and it was only my sense of decency which prevented me from stitching quotations into my contribution and flinging them back at him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted from that already. There is a number of other issues I could mention in this context.  I call on the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to immediately allocate the £750,000 promised in the 1984 budget to marriage counselling services provided by voluntary and community associations.  This is the Year of the Family.  In this Bill we are seeking to strengthen the family and the family home.  In that spirit I am calling on the Minister to ensure that the promised allocation is made.  The amount of good work done in these marriage counselling services is known only to those who seek their services, but unquestionably it is one of the most valuable voluntary, social services here.  The small amount of money promised to those agencies would yield a thousand-fold return.  That is the key point I wanted to raise this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to address my remarks particularly to the women Members of the House.  There was an extraordinary surge of optimism and pride when, following the last general election, the electorate returned 20 women Members to this Dáil.  At that time there was an expectation, and it still exists, that such a large number of women Deputies would make a difference, they would be better positioned to influence their parties, the course of events and legislation which would be promoted and supported and would get priority.  The women Members of the Government parties have a great opportunity this evening to respond to that expectation to assure those who invested such optimism and confidence <Col N="489" /> in them and to demonstrate to society, particularly married women in the home, many of whom spend their lives doing unpaid work, keeping the house, rearing children and making a home, that they recognise the validity and value of this Bill, that they recognise what it is aiming to do, that they see it as a small but crucially important step in the area of law reform, equal rights and making a good contribution to a healthy society.  I invite the women Members of the Government, who I hope are listening to the debate in their offices, to show their mettle and judgment this evening and vote in support of this Bill.  I now call on Ministers Geoghegan-Quinn, O'Rourke, Breathnach, Eithne Fitzgerald, and Burton and Deputies Shorthall, Coughlan, de Valera, Wallace and Moynihan-Cronin to demonstrate they are prepared to follow their better judgment by following Deputy Keogh, the Progressive Democrats and all the other Members of the Opposition who strongly and cogently supported the Bill, and other Members who because of time constriction did not have an opportunity to speak, through the lobbies this evening.  Government Deputies should follow those Opposition Members and support the Bill.  It may not be necessary for the women to identify themselves as a group.  It may be that the Minister has had a change of heart and has been able to talk sense into the Leader of his party and the Leader and Members of the other party with whom they are in partnership.  The Government might be prepared to demonstrate at 8.30 p.m. this evening that in some respects at least it is different.  I continue to be optimistic until 8.30 p.m. and hope the Minister will be able to gather his troops to support the Bill and that it will not be necessary for the women to isolate themselves, but if that appeal fails, I am sure we can count on the support of the women in the Government parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier in the debate in my absence, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs set out in detail the Government's position on this Bill.  He <Col N="490" /> explained why the Government cannot accept the Bill as being in any way an adequate or a practical response to the desire we all have to give further legislative recognition to the contribution made to the family home by spouses who work in the home and look after the family, and I fully agree with all his observations on the Bill before the House.  I do not propose, therefore, to go over the same ground except in so far as it may be necessary to do so when dealing with some of the points made by those Deputies who have spoken in the meantime.</P>
      <P>In general, Opposition speakers have followed the pattern set by Deputy Helen Keogh when she introduced the Bill, that is, they have combined praise for the Bill with criticism of the alleged failings of the Government in progressing the legislative and administrative measures that need to be in place before the divorce referendum is held.</P>
      <P>I will deal first with the Bill itself. Deputy Browne suggested that it was being rejected simply because it was an Opposition Bill and that we were belittling Bills brought in by the Opposition. This Government's record in accepting Opposition measures will stand comparison with that of any previous Administration. For my part, I have no hang-up about accepting any Bill from whatever source if it constitutes a significant and practical improvement in the law.  I assure the House that my opposition to the Bill is based solely on objective grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully understand the motivation behind the promotion of this Bill.  Every Deputy and every Senator accepted the principle of co-ownership enshrined in the Matrimonial Home Bill and in this they were reflecting the feelings of the great majority of their constituents.  It was a huge disappointment to us all when the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional.  I had hoped that it would be possible to produce an alternative measure that would give practical effect to that principle and that would give adequate recognition to the contribution to the family home made by a <Col N="491" /> spouse working in the home in a harmonious marriage.  I stress &ldquo;harmonious&rdquo; because that contribution is already fully recognised by the law when a marriage has broken down and property adjustments are made between the spouses in the course of separation proceedings.  In the Family Law Bill, now before a Select Committee of the House, similar provision is being made for such contributions in the context of nullity proceedings and in cases where foreign decrees of divorce, nullity and legal separation are entitled to recognition in this State.</P>
    <P>The Government gave the most careful consideration to the situation in the wake of the Supreme Court decision but, as the House will know, the terms of judgment were of a most far reaching character and no revision of the Bill's provisions could be regarded as free from the risk of a successful constitutional challenge.  That conclusion was reached with regret but reality had to be faced.  Indeed, the Government would have been severely criticised if another attempt to give both spouses a share in the ownership of the family home were to fail on constitutional grounds.</P>
    <P>I now come to the Bill before the House.  My fundamental ojection to it is that, as far as disputes between spouses are concerned, it does nothing for a spouse who has made a non-financial contribution to the home, unless she &mdash; it will usually be she &mdash; takes the other spouse to court, involving that spouse in substantial expense and giving rise to the uncertainty and disharmony, if not bitterness, that that can involve.  I cannot see such a provision as being appropriate where partners are in a harmonious relationship.  It would be more likely to create trouble between otherwise happy couples.  It is shadow, not substance.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell denied that the Bill would lead families into litigation, but it seems that is its main feature.  The right it proposes to confer can only be asserted in an action between the spouses.  If there is disagreement between them about the amount of the share that should go to a <Col N="492" /> spouse on foot of non-financial contributions &mdash; undoubtedly there would be many such cases &mdash; the dispute would have to be resolved by the courts in an adversarial atmosphere.  One spouse would see himself or herself as having lost and that would certainly affect the relationship.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the argument that a provision for non-financial contributions to be recognised in litigation between spouses will have the result that spouses who make such contributions will be able to persuade their partners to convey formally a share in the ownership of the family home to them.  If a spouse is unwilling to do this now, I doubt very much if the threat of court proceedings will make any difference.  Indeed in that kind of relationship it could well make the spouse concerned more determined not to do so.</P>
    <P>I am firmly of the view that any litigation between spouses on such a sensitive matter as the ownership of the family home would only arise where the relationship between the spouses had reached a very low point and where, therefore, the litigation envisaged by the Bill would be likely to exacerabate matters further.  It could do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not focus on the concerns of the vast majority of women within the home who do not wish to engage in litigation with their spouses but who do want some recognition of the contribution which they are making to this society and to this economy.</P>
    <P>What it is saying is that, in the light of the Supreme Court decision on the Matrimonial Home Bill, this is as far as we can go and no further.  I am not fully convinced of that and that is why I have not rushed to bring forward a substitute measure for the Matrimonial Home Bill which could only offer a very inadequate solution to the problem which now confronts us.  I want to bring forward measures which will encourage joint ownership to the greatest extent possible and I am determined that a suitable package of proposals will be devised to this end.  This Bill offers false hope to many <Col N="493" /> spouses who may be deceived into thinking that if it were accepted by the Government they would have a share, as of right, in the family home.  Clearly, this is not the case.  This Government is, contrary to what Deputy Harney said recently, &ldquo;really interested in giving homemakers a fairer and better deal&rdquo;.  It is precisely for this reason that I hope to be able to bring forward proposals which are more substantial and practical than those now before this House, but this process will take time and care, elements which seem to have been lacking in the preparation of the Bill now before this House.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House are at one in endeavouring to give practical, meaningful recognition to the contribution to the family home made by spouses who work in the home and who are living in harmony and whom we want to continue to live in harmony &mdash; that is, the great majority of our married couples.  What deters many such couples from putting the family home into joint names is the formality and expense of doing so.</P>
    <P>The Matrimonial Home Bill contained provisions for enabling the statutory joint ownership sought to be created by it to be registered in the Land Registry or Registry of Deeds without any formal conveyance and without payment of stamp duty or registration fees.  I have under examination in my Department at present proposals for facilitating the conveyance of family homes from the owner-spouse to the joint ownership of both spouses.  As many homes in sole ownership are mortgaged, consultations will be necessary with banks and other lending institutions and these consultations are being arranged.</P>
    <P>Should these proposals be found to be feasible I will have the necessary legislation drafted as soon as possible.  That would be a practical step to facilitate happily married couples in giving full and formal effect to the equality inherent in the marriage partnership and to the contribution made by the spouse who works in the home.</P>
    <P>The present Bill, in contrast, deals only with a situation where spouses are in dispute about the ownership of the family <Col N="494" /> home and where they are involved in litigation with all the expense, delay and uncertainty that would entail.  I do not exaggerate when I refer to expense and uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Unlike financial contributions, which give rise to an entitlement to a share in property, non-financial contributions are not capable of precise determination. Also, the Bill makes no practical contribution to the problem of couples who would wish to share ownership but are deterred by the legal formalities and expense involved.  For these reasons, and those mentioned by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs in his speech, regretfully the Government cannot accept this Bill.</P>
    <P>In her introduction Deputy Keogh dealt with the Bill with such brevity that I suspect she is somewhat uncomfortable with the topic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than deal in any depth with the Bill she preferred to concentrate her efforts on the issue of divorce.  Unfortunately, much of her contribution in that regard served more to confuse and misinform than to enlighten. For example, she suggested that &ldquo;for many women contemplating divorce this Bill will come as an assurance as to their equal status&rdquo;.  Such comment is entirely misconceived and wrong.  Neither this Bill nor for that matter the Matrimonial Home Bill has any such bearing on divorce and I would have expected the Deputy to be only too well aware of that.  The plain fact, which Deputy Keogh chooses to ignore, is that the question of the division of property, including the family home, is one for the courts to decide in accordance with the comprehensive property adjustment order provisions in the 1989 Judicial Separation Act.  There are special provisions in the 1989 Act dealing with the family home <Col N="495" /> which are repeated in the Family Law Bill and those provisions would form part of any divorce legislation.  Neither this Private Members Bill nor the Matrimonial Home Bill would affect those provisions in any way.  It is unfortunate that the Deputy should get it so wrong on that important point.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme of family law reform is comprehensive, is proceeding steadily and will result in the holding of a divorce referendum.  The Family Law Bill, 1994, has recently passed Second Stage in this House and is currently with the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  That Bill is a central part of the overall programme of family law reform.  It extends and strengthens the powers of the court to deal with the financial consequences of marital breakdown, raises the age of marriage from 16 years to 18 years and requires persons to give three months' notice of intention to marry.  It empowers the court to order social reports on spouses and children in family law proceedings and puts the role of welfare officers and social workers in this area on a statutory footing. The Bill provides for important changes in the jurisdiction of the courts so as to improve access to justice.  Jurisdiction in nullity cases, heretofore confined to the High Court, is being given to the Circuit Court, which is also being empowered to deal with the questions of the recognition of foreign decrees of divorce, nullity and legal separation and the making of orders in support of parties to those cases.  For the first time jurisdiction to deal with proceedings relating to the family home under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, is being given to the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Access to justice is also being improved very significantly by development and expansion of the services provided by the Legal Aid Board.  On taking office at the beginning of last year I did not ignore the lengthy waiting lists in law centres.  I did something about them.  I immediately secured extra funding and staff and in order to bring an early turn-around in waiting lists I initiated a pilot project <Col N="496" /> involving private solicitors on family law cases in the District Courts.</P>
    <P>I have secured unprecedented increases in funding for legal aid for 1994. At present there are 16 full-time law centres and by the end of this year we will have a total of 26 full-time centres located strategically throughout the country.  All of these new centres will be in place and fully operational this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to opening new law centres the staffing of the centres is being increased from 39 solicitors and 40 support staff to 75 solicitors and 103 support staff.  These increases mean that in the short time since coming into office the Government will have more than doubled the number of staff employed by the Legal Aid Board.  More than £1 million has been provided for mediation and counselling services this year and it is my intention to facilitate their continuing development.</P>
    <P>The question of changes to the taxation and social welfare codes necessary in the context of the divorce referendum were also referred to by Deputy Keogh.  As already indicated to the House, the Government has decided that property transfers between spouses whose marriages are dissolved following divorce or are annulled should be dealt with on the same basis for tax purposes as transfers between spouses.  The Government has also decided that the necessary changes in social welfare should be made to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being charged from married, separated or deserted to divorced or annulled.  The provisions necessary to give effect to these measures in the context of divorce will be published for the information of the public in advance of the divorce referendum.</P>
    <P>In the light of these and other measures, how can Deputy Keogh accuse me and the Government of being inactive and lacking in leadership on family law issues?  Deputy Keogh made the extraordinary statement that in bringing her Bill before the House &ldquo;the Progressive Democrats Party is conscious that it is <Col N="497" /> oddly archaic that after 20 years of waiting for joint ownership in the family home to be secured for women it was bestowed to wives by the Matrimonial Home Bill in the mouth of a divorce referendum&rdquo;.  Like, I think, most reasonable people, I regard that statement as odd when the party of which she is a member made promises in Government to bring forward legislation on joint ownership of the family home but failed to deliver on that promise.  Within six months of coming to office the Government provided the necessary legislative proposals.  That fact speaks for itself and demonstrates the priority which was given to the legislation.  The Progressive Democrats clearly did not give the legislation any such priority when in Government. Neither for that matter did it give any significant priority to the development and expansion of the Legal Aid Board's services or to mediation and counselling services.  I will let those facts also speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh suggested that the Government ship was low in the water and that it was time to man the water pumps.  I can assure the Deputy that the ship is well on course and will not be diverted by cheap political shots across its bow.  I would suggest, however, that her party might invest in a water pump as it seems in need of being bailed out of this Bill if it is the best they can offer on issues concerning the family home.</P>
    <P>It is entirely inappropriate and wrong for Deputy Harney to link rejection of this Bill with the success of a divorce referendum, and I must admit to being somewhat surprised since I know she has a strong personal commitment to change in this area.  The cause of reform is not helped by such wild comments which may be seized upon and used by those who are not interested in seeing the referendum carried.  In divorce proceedings, the arrangements for any division of property between the spouses, including the family home, will be determined along lines not dissimilar to those already applied by the courts under judicial separation proceedings, so that full regard will be had to the value of any non-financial contributions <Col N="498" /> made through the work of a spouse in the family home.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the Government's view that this Bill should be rejected as being not only impractical but also inadequate to deal with the problem it purports to address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister has not supported this Bill but rather has supported the comments made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am very surprised that he has not dissociated himself from the remarks and attitude taken by the Tánaiste to this Bill.  I will refer to this point later.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs should read the report issued by the Committee on Women's Rights on women's unwaged work.  It is very clear from the tone of his speech that he has not read this report and does not understand the need to recognise the value of this unwaged work in law.  It is clear from international research and thinking in this area that recognition of this work in law is the way forward.  This Bill is a building block towards developing and recognising in our law the contribution of women through work in the home and through child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech is somewhat contradictory and, perhaps for the first time, he is now acknowledging the need to bring forward proposals while dismissing the Progressive Democrat Bill. The Minister states: &ldquo;It is precisely for this reason that I would hope to be able to bring forward proposals which are more substantial and practical than those now before this House&rdquo;.  Why can the Minister not accept this Bill as moving the issue forward rather than dismissing it completely as he has in his contribution this evening?  This is the first time the Minister has acknowledged that the rejection by the Supreme Court of the Matrimonial Home Bill means that the issue must be examined again by Government and action taken.  I remember the Taoiseach saying on more than one occasion that the matter was at rest and he gave no indication that the Government intended <Col N="499" /> to bring forward proposals.  I welcome the Minister's statement, therefore, that he intends to put forward proposals and I ask him what is the timescale for that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate Deputy Keogh and the Progressive Democrats on bringing it forward.  The basic principle here is one that has generated much discussion in a whole range of arenas, including the Women's Rights Committee of the European Parliament, the First and Second Commission on the Status of Women and, obviously in the recent Matrimonial Home Bill which has been rejected by the Supreme Court.  The Bill addresses broad questions about the role of women and unwaged work in the home, particularly in relation in home-making and childcare.</P>
    <P>I welcome the discussion of these issues.  The report of the Committee on Women's Rights of the European Parliament referred to the importance of this matter.  Let us examine it from the point of view of economics.  The report states that the economic contribution to the community's GDP of women who work full time in the home and the 9 million women who work with their husbands in varying professional activities, is estimated as between 30 and 75 per cent. The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that work in the home is very important to the welfare of individuals and society.  Calculations put the output of private households as between 30 and 50 per cent of GNP. These are figures on a scale which can no longer be ignored.  Nonetheless, the complex area of work in the home is regarded as a set of marginal activities which must not get in the way and are, moreover, private.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a change in that situation.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the Tánaiste's very negative reaction to this Bill.  His response was more than negative &mdash; it was belligerent, dismissive and contemptuous. We must ask why a Government with such an overwhelming majority would need to stamp so strongly <Col N="500" /> and so venemously on a Private Members' Bill that is simply setting out to solve a problem that the Government is showing no signs of solving, despite the fact that it has set up a separate Ministry to ensure equality.  The Government is safe in the short term, so why will it not give consideration to a Bill such as the one under discussion and examine its real possibilities as an instrument for equality?</P>
    <P>It says much about the Government, and even more about the Tánaiste, that the response articulated by him in the House on 29 March was neither open nor innovative, but harshly hostile.  There is scope for a much more positive approach to the thinking behind this Bill, and a more inclusive recognition by the Tánaiste of the principles involved in shaping it and the events that led to it being put forward.  As Deputy Quill said so eloquently earlier this evening, this legislation would have been welcomed by many women in Ireland rather than the approach adopted by the Tánaiste to the principle outlined in it.</P>
    <P>It is important to outline the background to this Bill and why it is important. Figures emerging recently show that 64 per cent of women are dependent and have no independent income.  These figures are a clear reason why it is important for us in this House to take note of this Bill and help progress the issues which it addresses.</P>
    <P>We have one of the lowest participation rates in the labour force by women in the European Union.  The dependency rate of women is, therefore, very high and, of course, it is also linked to the role which women in Ireland have undertaken in relation to caring for the family and as carers generally.  Many women working full time in the home would welcome the opportunity to take part in further education and training or, indeed, to become part of the paid workforce, but many women are not even recognised as unemployed because they do not qualify for inclusion on the live register.</P>
    <P>Let us be blunt about it.  We have discussed and read a great deal over the <Col N="501" /> past two decades about the wonderful progress made by women and we should be proud of every individual and collective achievement in that regard.  Six out of every ten women, however, are financially dependent on somebody else, usually their husband or partner.  They may not be made to feel dependent, it may be a passing phase while they rear their children, but they are dependent and for many of them it was not a free choice happily opted for from a myriad of other choices.  Real equality means choices and safeguards.  Too frequently in the 1990s, mná na hÉireann have neither choices nor safeguards.  That is why the principles outlined in this Bill are so serious and deserve a much better hearing than that given by the Tánaiste on 29 March and by the Minister this evening.</P>
    <P>What we want &mdash; and what we should be committed to on all sides of this House &mdash;is that women should have real choice, for example, in relation to working full time in the home or working outside the home, either part-time or full time.  Job creation for women is particularly critical given the feminization of poverty.  The whole question of flexibility in the workplace is connected to this issue.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill concerns the difficulty for women wishing to gain access to the law and to obtain justice. Our laws should reflect the real situations in which women find themselves such as those addressed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Women's Rights Committee of the European Parliament stated that the activities involved in unpaid work can be divided into five categories.  The first is unwaged professional work performed by women in the context of the profession/activity of their partner, husband, father, family etc. in, for example, agriculture, the retail trade and so on. The second is unwaged professional work by the wives of men in certain professional groups.  It refers also to unwaged work of value to society such as the unpaid care and nursing of children, the sick, the handicapped and the elderly. Housework is another category and, of course, voluntary work.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the United Nations General <Col N="502" /> Assembly decided that statistics should be drawn up concerning women's unremunerated contributions to all aspects and sectors of development and that they should be calculated for economical and statical purposes and for the purposes of GNP.  I asked the Taoiseach a question about that in the House some months ago and I was not re-assured by his answer.  I urge that we consider that matter again.</P>
    <P>A number of serious recommendations have been made by the committee of the European Parliament as well on taking this issue further. For example, the committee regrets that the law on matrimonial property is based primarily on property and earnings but, for assessment purposes, ignores the recognition of tasks performed by partners.  That committee suggests that the law here should be brought up to date.  It acknowledges that partners are entitled to decide not to divide the house work or to opt for an arrangement in which one undertakes the unwaged work and the other the remunerative work, but takes the view that this arrangement must be assessed as part of the property and earnings of the partners and may not serve as the basis for agreements concerning social security, for example, in a company.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said this Bill had no implications not already covered in legislation. I disagree as there are a number of areas in which this legislation further extends the law, for instance circumstances in which a partner goes bankrupt. In the 1988 Bankruptcy Act Deputy Shatter ensured that wive's interests should be taken into account.  The provisions of this Bill would further protect women's interests.  It appears that the Labour Party in Government has very strong commitments to concepts but is not so hot when it comes to commitment to real people in real life circumstances.</P>

      <P>When talking and thinking about concepts it is easy to be contemptuous about a Private Members' Bill such as this as being an intellectual <Col N="503" /> exercise but the provisions of this Bill could make a difference.  Let us take the example of a husband and wife married for, say, 30 years, the husband working outside the home full time, the wife working in the home.  The husband dies and, when his will is probated, it is discovered that he has left his property to someone other than his wife who, knows that without her contribution to home-making, child care, budgeting, maintenance and so on it would not be half, one quarter or even one-eighth its value at the moment of his death and that she has made more than a one-third contribution, which is her current entitlement. If this Bill is welcomed, as it should be, by an open, responsive Government then that woman will have protection under the law, the protection to which she is entitled, if we claim to believe in equality at all.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and the Minister, at the very least, should have suggested that the Government would consider looking at the issues raised by this Bill in an amendment to the Family Law Act, 1988 if they are rejecting the Progressive Democrats' Bill.  It is extraordinary that it was never suggested that the original Bill was an essential legislative mechanism that should be put in place before the holding of a referendum on divorce.  In fact it was made very clear by the Minister, on 7 July, 1993, when discussing Second Stage of the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993 at column 1552 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The Bill is one of the measures included in the major programme of family law reform to which the Government is committed and which will culminate in the referendum on divorce to be held next year.  However, the fact that it is one of the milestones on the way to the attainment of that objective does not mean that it is not fully justified on its own merits.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that in this House.  Many of the issues related to the adjustment of property have been dealt with under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  It appears the Minister does not like to be reminded of that but he said so in this House.  The provisions of this Bill are important because it brings thinking forward in the two areas I have mentioned and also in terms of managing the vacuum created by the Supreme Court decision.  the Minister was allowing further doubt to develop &mdash; I agree with the points made by Deputy Keogh in this respect &mdash; among the public, particularly among women on these serious property issues.  It smacks of <i>déjà vu</i>; we know what happened before on this issue.  It is extremely important that it be well handled and that further law be written and passed by this House in this area. Many women are anxious that they do not have automatic joint ownership of the family home in the event of marriage breakdown and that it is left to the court to decide on property adjustment.  Given the circumstances I have outlined, the economic dependency of Irish women, the difficulty of access to work and training, the lack of provision of child care &mdash; the second lowest within the European Union &mdash; this means that any effort that can be made to give women greater rights and recognise their non-financial contributions must take centre stage in our legislation.  That is why I support this Bill here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from the Supreme Court decision that there are complex constitutional issues involved highlighting the need for constitutional change.  I regret that on a number of occasions the Taoiseach said that constitutional change is not on the agenda.  It is very clear that the Constitution does not meet the needs of this generation of women; a thirties Constitution does not reflect the needs of <Col N="505" /> modern Ireland and certainly does not reflect the needs of Irish women.  An equality clause is essential.</P>
    <P>I welcome the more general discussion on this overall area of unwaged work, and that we are beginning to address it in law, which is important.  I hope we can take steps to ensure it receives greater recognition.  We should undertake a survey to determine standards that would permit a statistical study and assessment of the various aspects of unwaged work. It has been suggested that the member states of the European Union should establish a uniform method of assessing the economic and social value of work in the home and its contribution to GNP. We should do so and should also include the value of the various types of unpaid activities undertaken by women to the GNP and take up the many other recommendations of the European report to which I have referred already.</P>
    <P>Another matter that clearly warrants examination is the promotion of individual social security entitlements and not derived rights.  We must devise policies that encourage men to be more involved in home life and support women who want to work outside the home.  It is very clear that we need greater flexibility between the public and private worlds, with men and women having real choices about their participation in one or the other.  This Bill, if enacted would constitute a further step in that direction.  I regret that the Minister has seen fit to reject it this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Progressive Democrats and Deputy Helen Keogh on having introduced this Bill.  As Deputy Frances Fitzgerald has said we are struggling to come to terms with the idea of equality in our laws and society generally.  There is a very strong case for an equality clause being inserted in our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disappointed at the reaction of Government to this proposal which stands very much in the tradition of a number of measures put forward, some by the Minister, such as the Bill currently being considered in Committee, on <Col N="506" /> attachment of earnings and on different aspects of equality.  The arguments the Minister adduces to throw out what is a fundamental pillar of establishing equality are very threadbare.  For example, in the course of his contribution he said:</P>
    <P>Unlike financial contributions, which give rise to an entitlement to a share in property, non-financial contributions are not capable of precise determination.</P>
    <P>If we are to cling to that type of argument we will never establish equality here because it has been the tradition, and is unlikely to change, that women are most likely to remain in the home and care for the children.  If we decide not to attempt to get to grips with giving people equality in that position &mdash; because it is more imprecise and difficult to calculate &mdash; then we are stepping backwards, not taking the sort of innovative and novel approaches needed to our law if we are to achieve equality.</P>
    <P>The Minister also argued in the course of his contribution:</P>
    <P>I had hoped that it would be possible to produce an alternative measure that would give practical effect to that principle and that would give adequate recognition to the contribution to the family home made by a spouse working in the home in a harmonious marriage situation.</P>
    <P>That was an alternative to the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993 but it did not prove possible.  Yet he dismisses this Bill on the grounds that its provisions suggested that this is as far as we could go and no further.  The Progressive Democrats' proposal is at least a good deal better than the deafening silence emanating from the Government circles on this issue.  If the Minister had better proposals to ensure it could go further, let him accept this Bill on Second Reading and then come forward with the further proposals for improvement.</P>
    <P>He also suggests that this would put some new stress on harmonious marriage relationships, that the idea of giving <Col N="507" /> recognition to the non-working spouse would be inappropriate and would be more likely to create trouble between otherwise happy couples; it is a shadow and not a substance.  His basis for that argument is that it appears that such rights could only be ultimately established if they were not concealed by litigation. Most law provides for situations where the exercise of rights may ultimately have to be operated through the courts and by litigation.  That is no defence for saying it is better to leave matters as they are when, on his admission, the situation is far from equal in relation to the family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is good at the rhetoric of equality but when it boils down to actually recognising cases for equality it is much more reticent.  In the area of social welfare, under European law women are entitled to equality of treatment.  It has been established that in regard to transitional and other payments to which women were entitled since 1986 they did not get a fair shake out.  The Government's reaction to the pursuit by women of their rights under European law is to insist on litigation. So much for the harmony we want in a litigation free society.  The Government is insisting that people go to litigation and will only concede the payments which women are rightfully due on the steps of the court when substantial costs have been incurred particularly by those most deprived and who have to depend on social welfare for long periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must respond more creatively, must recognise that equality will not be achieved in a painless way <Col N="508" /> and that sometimes decisions have to be taken.  We are coming to a stage where those decisions are necessary.  The fact that dependent relatives allowance is paid at less than two-thirds of the rate for the breadwinner is a carry over from the idea that the woman who remained at home and was the dependent spouse was in some way a second class citizen.  That idea pervades throughout our social welfare system, our tax code and so on.</P>
    <P>This Bill presented an opportunity for the Government to respond and we could have built on it.  The Minister's arguments in rejecting the Bill come close to throwing out the basis of the Matrimonial Home Bill.  In regard to litigation the Minister said:</P>
    <P>One spouse would see himself or herself as having lost and that would certainly affect the relationship.</P>
    <P>It is clear that under the Matrimonial Home Bill he envisaged situations where cases of dispute about behaviour would have to go to court to be resolved.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for the excellent manner in which they contributed to the debate and acknowledging the necessity for such a Bill.  I thank also Fine Gael and Democratic Left Members for their contributions which were well thought through and constructive.  In contrast, with the exception of one female Member on the Government side, <Col N="509" /> the contributions from that side ranged from being disjointed to uncommitted and ill-informed and, in the case of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, contradictory.</P>
      <P>My first task in summing up is to remind the House what the Bill is about. The Bill, sponsored by the Progressive Democrats and supported by all the Opposition parties, is about families, civil rights especially for women, change and how we value non-financial contributions to the creation of a home.  Therefore, the Bill is about justice and equality.  Given that it is about all those things and that both parties in the Government claim to care about families and civil rights, especially for women, change, justice and equality some Members on this side of the House, perhaps with the affliction of some chronic optimism, assumed that the Government contribution would be positive and significant.  That in the main has not been the case.</P>
      <P>In my case it may be an advantage to be a new arrival in this House.  As a newcomer I have not lost contact with real life and I know what people are saying and thinking and I have contact with reality and with what women are saying.  I recall the pre-election promises of the Labour Party and its commitment to civil rights.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins made an international stance on the commitment to change, justice and equality while the Programme for a Partnership Government made a commitment to openness.  We thought we would have something to look forward to in the debate on this Bill and I was making positive predictions.  I thought the Labour Party, with its large number of women, would have at least one woman speaker on this issue who could see the benefits to women of this Bill or, at the very least, admit to the value of the principle behind the Bill.  I thought that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who is publicly committed to holding and winning a divorce referendum, as we are, would be only too delighted to have a solution to one of the precursor problems handed to him on a plate.</P>

      <P>The problem is that the Minister was being handed something on a Progressive Democrats' plate.  I thought the leader of the Labour Party with his personification of change and sensitivity and statesmanship would have a thoughtful or a thought provoking response, not old cliché ridden ritual attacks or whinges about lack of notice.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious matter.  Whether or not the people vote or whether they are directly affected by the issue this Bill seeks to address they are entitled to expect an attitude of civilised openness from a Government with such a huge majority.  The Government was given an opportunity to show the courage of its majority.  The singular failure of the Labour Party in particular, as part of this Government, to live up to its claims is sad.  What is important is the contempt for democracy shown by the Government who tried to make the debate collapse and would not contribute on an issue of profound importance, especially to women.  It is regrettable and contemptible. I could not believe that a member of the Government parties would sit on his hands and hope that the debate on the Bill would collapse.</P>
      <P>Worse still, in his contribution, Deputy Ferris said the Bill would apply to a limited number of married women.  Does he realise how many women are home makers, work in the home and feel that contribution should have a value?  I was delighted Deputy Quill made such an eloquent speech and paid fulsome tribute to the work of women in the home.  That is the type of debate which should be on record, not the rejection out of hand we heard from the few spokespersons on the opposite side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> The Progressive Democrats are endeavouring to add to the corpus of legislation which the Minister for Justice said should be in the social interest and achieve social good.  Those were the criteria she addressed.  If, as she said, this Bill does not sufficiently meet those criteria I would be happy to debate a way to improve the Bill but surely its principle should be acknowledged?  I will deal with the various objections raised by Ministers while acknowledging that at least the Minister for Justice upholds our good intentions.</P>
    <P>Would this Bill conflict with the test laid down by the Supreme Court on the Matrimonial Home Bill regarding disproportionate interference with the rights of families to make decisions having regard to Article 41 of the Constitution? This Bill cannot amount to disproportionate interference since all it allows is for a spouse to agree before a court that, as a matter of equity, the non-financial contribution to the family home gives rise to an entitlement to beneficial ownership therein.  That was described as a desirable objective by the Chief Justice in the case of L. <i>v</i> L. supported by the judgment delivered on the recent Matrimonial Home Bill by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and the Government's Family Law Bill contain provisions in respect of property adjustment orders.  However, as is obvious from these measures, one is talking of cases where marriage has broken down.  Many speakers made the point that there are circumstances in which a spouse could wish to establish a right in equity based on non-financial contributions to the family home other than in cases of marital breakdown.  The statement that this Bill would only be relevant where spouses could not agree on ownership is incorrect.  It may well be that a spouse had died, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, there may be a dispute between one of the spouses and a third party or a spouse may be suffering from disability due to mental illness and so on.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste criticised section 4 and <Col N="512" /> said it was vague.  The section is not vague, it has general application and is flexible.  Deputy Harney dealt with other objections raised.  We stated our case in a clear and objective manner in marked contrast to the remarks of the Tánaiste.  I was very disappointed with the Minister's remarks as they were a rehash of what the Tánaiste said.  His fundamental objection to the Bill is that in the case of disputes between spouses it does nothing for the spouse who made a non-financial contribution to the home unless she takes her spouse to court.  We dealt with that specious argument.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Tánaiste who speaks well, has the legal training to improve his considerable talent and script writers for every sentence will deduct money from their pay packets because they stuffed his sentences full of contradictory clichés as well as legal inaccuracies.  They ignored the wholehearted support of such bodies as the Council for the Status of Women who said that any attempt to recognise in law the contribution made by women in the home through their unpaid work must be welcomed.  They also said it was crucial that this issue be dealt with before the Government's proposed referendum on divorce later this year.  The Tánaiste said the Bill was half baked and had seen the light of day on the back of an envelope.  Perhaps my domestic skills are not as well developed as the Tánaiste's but the next time he plans to bake something that starts out on the back of an envelope I would like to be there to watch.</P>
    <P>An analysis of the touchy and negative contributions to this debate by the Tánaiste and Minister for Law Reform shows one thing clearly about the Tánaiste &mdash; he is defending his Minister's procrastination.  He quoted the Minister as saying on 22 February that he was sympathetic to the idea of legislation which would place a value on work in the home by a spouse but that the matter required the most careful consideration. Translated it means it is on the back burner.  The Tánaiste not only indicated that it was on the back burner, carefully watched by the Minister but that the <Col N="513" /> matter &ldquo;will continue to receive careful and sympathetic consideration by the Minister&rdquo;.  What a relief that was to us all.</P>

      <P>Procrastination is not a value and postponement is not a virtue. Neither is indicative of maturity or good Government.  Neither entitles the Leader of the Labour Party to adopt a destructive attitude to this Bill exemplified by his generalised attack on it.  This is a clear, functional, thoughtful, legislative solution to a Government problem.  The irrational aspects of its rejection indicate a deep contempt for this House, the urgency of the problem and the real concerns of women.  This Government has delayed allocating the necessary resources to marriage counselling services. It led 1,800 women to the steps of the High Court before agreeing to make social welfare payments which the European Court of Justice repeatedly held to be their entitlement.  It has got it wrong on so many issues we should not be suprised to find that the role and contribution of the non-working spouse, which is not recognised by our system and is insufficiently protected by our laws, is not a matter for urgent attention.</P>
      <P>This Bill is proposed by the Progressive Democrats in the interests of justice, equity and, above all, equality for women.  I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud the fact that at long last the free legal aid centres have won justice for 1,800 women nationwide from the Minister and Department of Social Welfare but I deplore the fact that these centres had to threaten High Court action to win legitimate entitlements for these women.  I allege that the Minister for Social Welfare misled the Dáil and the public over many months through his statements that all outstanding claims had been settled.  The Minister only conceded to FLAC in the face of overwhelming legal evidence against his Department and I am prepared to stand over the allegation that the Minister misled the Dáil.</P>
      <P>In response to questions put by me at the Select Committee on Social Affairs on 9 March 1994 in relation to equality payments, the Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Retrospective legislation was introduced in 1992 which in general terms <Col N="517" /> entitled married women to the payments which they would otherwise have received if the directive had been implemented on time.  Deputies made reference to this legislation, especially regarding cases which were taken before the legislation was enacted.  The cases which the Department is defending are cases taken after the legislation was introduced.  These provisions addressed the problems arising from the delay in implementing the directive and they addressed it in a reasonable and equitable manner.  All entitlements due under the retrospective payments have now been paid.</P>
    <P>In making that statement the Minister attempted to seriously mislead the Members of Dáil Éireann because the case in the High Court yesterday involved 1,800 women who submitted cases prior to the introduction of retrospective legislation in 1992.  The Minister conceded these cases yesterday in the face of overwhelming legal evidence against his Department.  He has not conceded the cases submitted after 1992.  The statements I have made about the Minister misleading the House can be verified by the records of the Select Committee on Social Affairs.</P>

      <P>The decision of the Department of Social Welfare to agree an out-of-court settlement in the cases taken by FLAC on behalf of 1,800 women who were claiming social welfare equality arrears represents a tremendous victory for Irish women and the Government should now sanction payment for tens of thousands of other women who have been similarly discriminated against.  The settlement represents a humiliating climb down by Minister Woods and his junior Minister, Deputy Joan Burton who has consistently claimed that the women had no case.  It is shocking that despite the settlement of this case Ministers are still denying that other women are also entitled to arrears and are threatening to contest any other cases.</P>
      <P>Once again Irish women have had to resort to the threat of legal action to secure their entitlements.  The manner in which the claims were resisted by the Department and the Ministers, and the way in which Minister Woods and Minister Burton have engaged in a virtual conspiracy of silence aimed at depriving women of their social welfare payments, to which the European Court has ruled they were entitled, is one of the most shameful episodes of our recent political history.</P>
      <P>Clearly, by settling out of court, the Department was aiming to avoid a binding court judgment which would have created a legal precedent.  However, I believe that the principle has now been clearly established and I urge all women who are in similar circumstances to claim without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FLAC is to be commended for pursuing these cases and forcing the Department <Col N="521" /> to concede.  Credit is also due to people like Democratic Left Councillor Kathleen Lynch who was the first public representative to raise this issue and who has played a crucial role in helping women to organise to pursue their case. No more women should now have to resort to the courts and the potentially expensive legal actions necessary to secure justice.  The Government must, even at this late stage, do the decent thing and pay up for all women who were discriminated against.</P>

In three instances the Irish courts made references to the European Court of Justice.  In the light of the clarification of the legal issues provided by the European Court, the Government introduced retrospective legislation in 1992 which provided for equal treatment during the period of delay.  This legislation was provided for by way of statutory instrument under the European Communities Act, 1972, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in June 1992.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Please listen and let me answer the question: have some manners. Subject to certain provisions designed to avoid double payments, the measures brought into force in 1992 entitled married women to the payments they would otherwise have received if the directive had been implemented in December 1984.  These provisions <Col N="524" /> addressed the problem arising from the delay in a fair, reasonable and equitable manner.  All the entitlements due under the retrospective legislation were paid to over 70,000 women by the end of last year.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare agreed the settlement yesterday in three cases before the courts involving about 1,800 married women who had initiated legal proceedings in relation to the delay beyond the 1984 deadline for implementing the EC Directive on equal treatment. The women involved in these cases had initiated court proceedings before the Government introduced implementing measures in 1992&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Those married women affected by the delay have already been paid the amounts which they otherwise would have received if the directive had been implemented on time.  There appears to be an expectation in some quarters that those involved should have their entitlements in the period of delay determined on the basis of the rules previously in force.

      <P>For example, where both of a couple were in receipt of a social welfare payment in the period of delay, it would mean paying each of the couple an increase for their spouse as an adult dependant in addition to the personal rate of payment and paying each of the couple the full rate of increases for children. In effect, it would be necessary to make double payments to such couples. It would also mean paying people compensation for a loss they did not suffer. The payments made to those involved were increased on the implementation of the equal treatment provisions in 1986. They received a higher personal rate of payment and qualified for payment of dependency increases.</P>
      <P>The legal position in the proceedings initiated after the law was amended in 1992 is different from cases in settlements which have been made by my Department. Since essentially what is involved in these proceedings is making payments, including double payments to the same families which cannot be justified and the cost to the taxpayer could be in the region of £300 million to £400 million &mdash; all proceedings initiated since the legislation was amended are being contested by my Department and the matter will, therefore, be determined by the courts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is mid-April 1994 <Col N="529" /> and we are referring to grant payments for 1993, the livelihoods of thousands of farmers and their families and millions of pounds of outstanding payments.  What action would the Minister of State or his senior colleague take if their TDs or Ministers' salary for January 1993 had not arrived on 13 April 1994 and the bank manager was knocking on the door?</P>
      <P>Thousands of farmers whose forms were completed in January, March and May 1993 still have not received a penny. In the majority of cases &mdash; and I can testify to this on a personal basis &mdash; the forms were completed correctly.  A woman telephoned me in tears last Monday.  She told me they had borrowed £5,000 to feed their livestock, the bank had told them &ldquo;thus far and no further&rdquo;, their car insurance had expired, four animals had died from lack of feeding and they have been waiting 12 months for their cheque.  Another housewife telephoned me two weeks ago and told me her husband, a farmer, was on the brink of suicide because of their impossible position.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister confirmed that of the 123,315 cattle headage payments paid to date, 74,479 were part payments. What is the logic in making two or four payments, doubling or quadrupling the amount of Civil Service time and work when the entire payment could have been made on a specified date in 1993?  The Minister told me yesterday that payment of the balance of cattle headage and beef cow premiums commenced on the 18 February 1994 and is continuing; the balance of payments is a 1993 scheme is commencing on 18 February 1994.  The Minister went on to tell me that payments under the ewe premium scheme represent first and second instalments which were paid in July 1993 and the final instalments commenced on 30 March 1994. This is another 1993 scheme which took from July 1993 to March 1994 to pay the fourth instalment and payment of the final instalment began less then two weeks ago.  Worst of all is the Minister's admission in relation to the special beef and suckler cow premium scheme.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> Payment cannot be made to a particular applicant until all applications received from him or her in the course of 1993, including those submitted last November, have been processed.  This is necessary to ensure compliance with EU regulations covering in particular the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density.</P>
    <P>The Minister presides over one of the best Departments in terms of staffing levels and his Department is highly computerised. The thresholds are known and everything is in place well in advance. Five or six years ago, a former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, in one of the wettest winters ever paid double headage payments, and paid them on time.  The following year not alone did he pay the headage payments on time but he allocated grain vouchers to alleviate hardship.  The Minister should consider his position, within seven days he should have the payments made or look for his P60 because the situation is intolerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This winter has been deemed the wettest and coldest for years and has been very stressful for livestock herds.  Lamb losses are double the annual average.  The normal mortality rate for new born lambs is about 8 per cent but this year the figure was approximately 16 per cent.  Approximately 990,000 cows were entered for the suckler cow scheme this year and most of them, which are due to calve shortly, are in poor condition because of the bad winter.  One does not like to prophesise, but as thousands of sheep and lambs have died from malnutrition, the same may apply to cows and their calves because farmers do not have enough money to buy additional feed.  Many farmers have received 60 per cent of the suckler cow grants, but 40 per cent, or £30 of the payment remains unpaid.  The outstanding amount would probably be sufficient to enable a farmer purchase sufficient silage to provide for most of those animals for the remainder of the year.  The Minister may say that there are many technical reasons why those payments cannot be made within <Col N="531" /> one week, I do not believe that is the case.  In November 1992 when a general election was sprung on the Members of this House with less than one week's notice the then Minister for Agriculture, organised the payment of 70 per cent of headage payments to all farmers due that payment.  If those payments could be made then at such short notice surely they can be made now.  I appeal to the Minister that these payments be made on the basis of compassion for the animals to help save their lives if for no other reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>The current crisis in agriculture, particularly in sheep farming, is almost without precedent due to severe winter weather conditions ranging from gales and rain storms to sleet and snow which caused havoc for farmers throughout Donegal and the west resulting in lamb losses of up to 20 per cent, compared to an average of 5 per cent to 6 per cent in previous years.  Spring work is four to six weeks behind schedule. Fields are untouched and hundreds of tonnes of potatoes cannot be picked from waterlogged locations.  Banks and other lending institutions are demanding repayment of loans and overdrafts by way of court orders.  Those demands are made at a time when farmers are owed millions of pounds in headage payments and other subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are reduced to tabling Dáil Questions only to be told that outstanding balances will be paid in the near future or as soon as possible.  I ask the Minister of State to deploy the resources in his Department to expedite outstanding payments within the next seven days.  That should not be an impossible task.  He should also arrange a special rescue package in the form of increased payments or foodstuff vouchers to assist farmers who are on the edge of destruction. <Col N="532" /> Such a measure was taken in the 1980s by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy.  Emergency action is now required to avoid more serious problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that livestock farmers and indeed farmers in general have been faced with difficulty arising from the most severe weather conditions over recent months.  However, the evidence of the past few days suggests that the worst is over.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the growing importance of direct payments to the formation of farmers' incomes in the light of the CAP reform changes, the need to ensure that payments reach farmers as quickly as possible and that premium schemes are operated with the minimum of red tape.</P>
      <P>Under the various headage and premium schemes over 500,000 payments amounting to £377 million were made in direct payments to farmers in 1993.  Some £237 million related to 1993 schemes. Further payments of close to £100 million have issued since the beginning of this year.  Those payments are continuing and I expect payments of the order of £40 million to be made over the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The high level of payments made to farmers to date under 1993 schemes has been achieved against a background of EU regulations which precluded any payments under the special beef and suckler cow premium schemes before 1 November last and even then limited payments to 60 per cent advances.  Payment of the balances under both of these schemes is covered by EU requirements relating to integrated administration and control.  This obliges member states to process all applications received from a particular applicant during the course of 1993 before paying out the 40 per cent balances.  The processing of November 1993 applications is, therefore, a factor in the payment of these balances.  Payments under the November 1993 special beef premium scheme commenced recently and I expect that payment of 40 per cent <Col N="533" /> balances for all 1993 applications will commence within the next week.  Payment of extensification premium is also linked to the integrated control requirement and I expect payments to commence by the end of the month.</P>
    <P>The premium payments situation in Ireland compares more than favourably with that in other member states.  No advance payments of special beef and suckler cow premia were made in several member states in 1993.  Our timeframe for paying the 40 per cent balances is in line with that in other member states and fits in with the requirements of the EU regulations which provide for payment, other than in exceptional cases, of special beef and suckler cow premia not later than 30 June of the year following the year of application.</P>
    <P>I recognise the complexity of the schemes both from the points of view of farmers and of the administration.  It is my Department's experience that incorrect and incomplete application forms are leading to delays in payments under a number of schemes.  For example, in the case of the June 1993 special beef premium scheme, up to 40,000 applicants, almost 50 per cent of the totals had to be written to concerning problems with their applications.  Given the overall value of payments under the CAP reform arrangements, however, it is not unreasonable that the EU Commission lays down very strict guidelines on proper completion of application forms.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that administrative arrangements are kept as simple as possible and my Department is continually monitoring all aspects of the various schemes with this in mind.  The Department has, in conjunction with Teagasc, held a series of countrywide information seminars for farmers to assist them in complying with the various requirements. Additional resources were put in place in my Department in 1993 and a new unit for dealing with the special beef premium scheme was set up in Portlaoise with over 100 staff.  Looking to the future, an additional allocation of some £4.8 million has been made available to my Department this year to provide extra <Col N="534" /> staffing and computer resources to expedite the processing of payments under the various direct payment schemes in 1994.</P>
    <P>Given the very substantial increase in the volume of applications in 1993 and the new integrated control system introduced under the EU regulations, the record level of payment achieved speaks for itself.  The additional resources which have been obtained from the Government will result in an even higher level of payment being achieved in 1994 and should enable the payment of all eligible premium claims within three months of application in 1995, where this is allowed under EU rules.</P>
    <P>Our objective is to achieve a streamlined system for the delivery of all direct payment schemes, one which is as simple as possible, while remaining consistent with the EU regulations, and at the same time enables payments to be made at the earliest date.  Considerable progess has already been achieved and I expect that the additional resources being put in place will allow our objective to be fully realised.  Close to £340 million has already been paid out to farmers under 1993 schemes.  These payments are continuing and considerable further payments will issue over the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  The news that the German Government, on the recommendation of its Ministry for Agriculture, was going to ban Irish beef is alarming because of the effect of any such move on our vital food sector which employs 25 per cent of all those engaged in manufacturing jobs and accounts for 40 per cent of our net export earnings.</P>
      <P>A total ban would be in contravention of Article 30 of the EU Treaty.  That is probably why the German Embassy tells us there will not be a complete ban but restrictions, which would amount to a ban in the Irish case.  The German Embassy tells us that a regulation would be introduced that beef from Ireland should come from animals not older than three years or that the herd should have been free from BSE for four years.</P>
      <P>The matter that will go before the German Government is surprising from an Irish point of view, I wonder if it is because the Germans want to introduce a barrier to trade.  Is it because a recent survey showed that of the German people who were asked to choose between Irish beef and locally produced beef, 65 per cent opted for Irish beef as against 27 per cent for that locally produced?  Germany is our second biggest meat market in Europe.  This year it is expected to account for £100 million of meat sales, 70 per cent of which is beef and 85 per cent of that, or almost £60 million worth, is added value vacuum packed prime cuts sold in German supermarkets and which are extremely popular.</P>
      <P>The damage is already done in this case.  When consumers are concerned about a product in terms of health they dramatically change to a different product. The damage done in Germany will not just affect beef but other meat and food products.  Ireland will be seen as a country that does not produce high quality food.  Damage will also be done in other markets that are very difficult to win.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised this matter has arisen because we do not have an indigenous beef problem.  We have what has been <Col N="536" /> described as the most stringent BSE eradication programme in Europe.  In all we have had only 80 cases of BSE, 16 of them last year, as against 100,000 cases in the United Kingdom, 36,000 in last year.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should talk to his counterpart in the German Government and contact the President of the Commission and the Taoiseach should raise the matter with the German Ambassador.  The Government should, if necessary, provide additional resources for CBF to continue its promotion of the good name of Irish beef, Irish meat generally and high quality food products.  This is very important in view of the enormous damage that will be done by this scare.</P>
    <P>In 1982 in what became known as the Newcastle case, when the British banned the importation of French turkeys, the European Court ruled against the British decision and they had to pay £12 million in compensation to French turkey farmers. A similar decision would be made in the Irish case, but Irish farmers and the Irish economy cannot wait for a long drawn out court decision.  The damage that would be done through that process is unthinkable.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  I heard the Minister speak on it on radio today and I know he is concerned about it. There is a general concern, particularly among farmers, but we must not simply express our concern and opposition; we need to go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the damage done does not have a permanent effect, as could be the case if we do not organise a vigorous campaign against this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks I made are addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, with no disrespect to the Minister of State whom I hope will convey my concerns to the Minister.  With confirmation today that the German Health Minister is pressing ahead with plans to restrict Irish beef imports, immediate and determined action from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is required to defend <Col N="537" /> our multi-million pound beef industry from further libellous comment and commercial sabotage.</P>
      <P>With only 80 cases of BSE in our national herd of seven million compared to more than 100,000 cases in the United Kingdom which has a national herd of 12 million, there is no justification for concern here or abroad about the health status and certification of Irish beef. There is complete depopulation of herds in which a case of BSE arises and the containment of the disease here, despite the virulent outbreak in the UK, is a valid testimony to the strict procedures in place.  The innuendo and totally unwarranted scare about health risks from Irish beef comprise a profoundly unfriendly act towards Ireland by the Germany authorities which surprises me. This disgraceful act of commercial sabotage is related to the dynamics of internal Germany politics not to the health status of our herd.  The Germany Minister for Health urgently needs to restore his political credibility with Federal elections in the offing, since the scandal of blood products arose there.</P>
      <P>Germany farm incomes decreased by 19 per cent in the last three years and at the time Irish beef penetration of the German market increased by more than 50 per cent.  This scaremongering could decrease Irish beef consumption in Germany, increase the sourcing of beef there domestically and restore the Brownie points of a Health Minister who is obviously prepared to stoop to any depths to ingratiate himself with the German electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement today by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that &ldquo;the measures are totally unjustified&rdquo; is not strong enough.  We agree with him, but he will have to stop being so nice and gentlemanly about this matter.  The Government was the laughing stock in Europe in its bungled negotiation of our national plan funds&mdash;the £8 million saga, the Minister for the Marine is trying to represent his 11-1 defeat last night in Brussels as a victory and now our vital beef industry is being slandered by the German authorities.  The Minister for <Col N="538" /> Agriculture, Food and Forestry has known about this problem for some time but failed to act.</P>
    <P>The words of Herr Borchert, the German Federal Agriculture Minister, in Dublin Castle on 30 March last are worth looking at.  In his lengthy address to a major agricultural conference, Agrivision 2000, he indicated the difference in trade between Ireland and Germany and said that in 1992 Ireland exported 17 times more agricultural goods to Germany than it imported from Germany, and the export surplus was approximately DM 1.2 billion.  He said that &ldquo;it is above all Ireland's economic advantages which cause great difficulties for German agriculture.&rdquo; He also stated:</P>
    <P>To reduce production is proving to be much more difficult for beef than for cereals and milk.  It would be impossible, for administrative reasons, to close down production capacity, and a quota regulation cannot be considered because of the lack of controls at the point of sale.</P>
    <P>Maybe another way has been discovered to control the point of sale.  He went on to say that the measures taken in this very delicate situation must be again examined.  He further stated it has been established that &ldquo;competition within European agriculture will increase&rdquo;.  I hope that will be done fairly, honourably and with no dirty tricks.</P>
    <P>Restrictions are unacceptable, although we would have no difficulty in complying with them.  The commercial facts are that suppliers will source beef elsewhere if extra red tape and bureaucracy is introduced.  Evidence of this lies in our failure to penetrate the Turkish and Jordanian markets where there has been a huge increase in beef sourced in Europe.  In Turkey 22,000 tonnes of beef were sourced in Europe in 1991 and 30,000 tonnes in 1993, but there was no Irish beef.  In Jordan 16,500 tonnes of beef were sourced in Europe in 1991 and 46,000 tonnes in 1993, but there was no Irish beef.  The reason this beef was sourced in Europe is that while there is no ban, there are restrictions on Irish beef <Col N="539" /> due to a false BSE scare, and restrictions have the same effect as a ban.</P>
    <P>What action does the Minister propose to take in this regard?  Is it true that other countries &mdash; for example, the Dutch &mdash; are concerned about reports emanating from Germany?  Is it true that German officials are asking supermarkets to delist Irish beef?  How long has the Minister known the intentions of the German authorities and failed to act to counter the libel and slander of this major industry? Will he vigorously lobby the Council of Agriculture Ministers and the European Commission, to force the Germans to withdraw their proposed restrictions and to apologise for their act of commercial sabotage which has inflicted international damage on our reputation as quality beef and food producers?</P>
    <P>If all else fails, is the Minister prepared to go to the German courts and, if necessary, the European Court of Justice to redress this damage and to indicate our earnestness in protecting this major quality Irish industry?  We await evidence of the Minister's intention to redress the damage that has been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to clarify the position as to the possibility of measures being introduced by Germany regarding imports of beef from several countries, including Ireland. There is no question of a ban being imposed on Irish beef by the German authorities.</P>
      <P>At present, all that exists is a proposal by the German health ministry to impose additional requirements on imports of beef from certain countries, including Ireland, over and above the conditions laid down by the relevant EU Council Directives.  I would stress that no decision has yet been taken on the matter in Germany and that there are simply proposals emanating from one ministry on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I am satisfied that Irish beef exports could meet any additional conditions regarding BSE similar to those being proposed by the German health ministry, our view is that these additional <Col N="540" /> measures are totally unnecessary and that there is absolutely no health risk of any kind attached to the consumption of Irish beef.  In particular, there is no evidence at all of any epidemiological or causal link between BSE and human transmissable encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease.</P>
    <P>I am glad to assure Deputies that the views which I have expressed regarding the proposed German measures have been made known to the German ambassador in Dublin as well as to the authorities in Germany through the Irish Embassy in Bonn.  Our objective is to ensure that, in the event of any of the proposed measures being taken in Germany, they will not be applied to imports of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>Great care has been taken to make the German authorities aware of the control measures applicable in Ireland regarding BSE.  Those measures go far beyond what is required on scientific grounds.  They include a comprehensive surveillance system, including ante-mortem examination at abattoirs for signs of disease including BSE and the compulsory notification of the disease; the destruction of animals in which BSE is confirmed and the depopulation of herds in which BSE occurs with full market value being paid by way of compensation to the herdowner and prohibition on feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminants and, in line with EU legislation, a ban on imports of cattle from the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The continued low sporadic level of the disease in Ireland &mdash; the average number of cases per annum in this country is 16 in a cattle population of 7 million animals &mdash; is testimony of the efficacy of the control measures which we have in place.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Deputies that, in view of the importance of the beef sector to Ireland's economy, the matter is being treated with the utmost concern and that no effort will be spared in making our case known to the German authorities.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 April 1994.</P>

      <P>A total of about £13.5 million is currently due to this Department by the United Nations.  Of this amount, £12.4 million relates to involvement in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  Of the remaining shortfall of £1.1 million, <Col N="380" /> £0.9 million arises out of participation in the United Nations Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus and £0.2 million from participation in the United Nations Operation in Somalia.</P>
      <P>The amount outstanding in respect of Irish involvement in UN peace-keeping operations is the subject of ongoing representations to the United Nations by the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs made both bilaterally and in conjunction with our partners in the European Community.  I met the United Nations Under-Secretary General for Peace-Keeping Operations in New York recently and availed of the opportunity to press for early reimbursement of arrears due to this country in respect of peace-keeping missions. Since then a payment of more than £1 million has been received in respect of UNIFIL arrears.  I will continue to pursue this matter vigorously.</P>

      <P>Since Irish participation in UNIFIL commenced in May 1978, Irish personnel serving with that Force have been subjected to ten deliberate attacks.  They have also been subjected to harassment of varying degrees over the years.  During the year ended 31 December 1993 there was a total of 373 firings at or close to Irish UNIFIL positions and other incidents such as serious confrontations at check-points totalled 207.</P>
      <P>Since May 1978 the number of Irish fatalities in this mission is 37, of which 14 have been the result of deliberate attacks. Approximately 200 Irish troops have been injured in Lebanon due to hostile action including deliberate attacks.  The majority of these injuries were of a minor nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> While representing a radical change for the better, the new relationship between Israel and the PLO does not in any way lessen the need for the UNIFIL presence in South Lebanon.  Renewed tension in the entire region following the Hebron massacre serves to underline the need for the UN force to bolster the fragile peace process.</P>
    <P>Continued Irish participation in UNIFIL is fully consistent with Ireland's firm commitment to the United Nations and to our tradition of support for the principles and practices of UN peace-keeping. The Irish contingent, by virtue of its long service and its reputation of professionalism, is a key element in the entire UNIFIL operation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1994, part of which deals with eel fishing, was circulated last week.  I would hope that with the Houses' approval it can be speedily enacted.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill in so far as eels are concerned is to enhance the management, development and control of this country's eel fisheries.  The principal thrust of the amendments is to give the same level of control and protection to eels as are afforded to salmon and trout.</P>
      <P>The new, measures proposed will establish control on the</P>
      <P>&mdash;sales, or export for sale, of eels;</P>
      <P>&mdash;carriage of eels;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" />&mdash;possession of eels;</P>
    <P>&mdash;penalties for breaches of conditions attaching to eel fishing authorisations.</P>
    <P>Any breach of these controls will be an offence subject to a fine or imprisonment.</P>
    <P>With regard to supporting existing eel fishing licence holders I would like to point out that there is excellent co-operation between the staff of the Fisheries Boards, E.S.B. protection staff and the Garda Síochána in the management and control of eel fishing.  The new Bill, however, will enable these bodies deal more effectively with illegal eel fishing activities thus facilitating the continued development of this increasingly important natural resource.</P>
    <P>While some limited eel fishing may be taking place at present, the season for netting for eels in the country's primary eel fisheries, (the Shannon and Corrib systems), will not commence until 1 July next and I would hope that the new legislation will be in effect by that date.</P>

      <P>On 7 July 1990 in the course of a patrol off Ballycotton, County Cork, a launch manned by fishery officers of the Southern and South-Western Regional Fisheries Boards foundered with the loss of four lives.</P>
      <P>On 12 November, 1990 the then Minister for the Marine appointed a marine surveyor of the Department of the Marine under section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 to hold a preliminary inquiry into the shipping casualty and subsequently the District Court granted the surveyor's application under section 466 (1) of the Act, for the holding of a formal investigation into the matter.</P>
      <P>The investigation was conducted by District Judge Michael C. Reilly and sat for a total of 17 days in the period 4-26 February, 1991 at a cost of £840,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the formal investigation <Col N="387" /> was completed on 10 July 1991.  Advance copies of the report were made available to the relatives of the deceased and the Minister presented the report to the Government on 17 July 1991.  The report was published and is available from the Government Publications Sales Office.</P>
    <P>The findings of the court are set out in great detail in the report.  Briefly, the court found that the patrol vessel sank by the stern after a wave broke over the after end of the vessel while the crew were in the process of hauling an illegal monofilament net.  The court found that the reason for the sinking was due to the failure of the bond between the wood decking and the side shell of the vessel which allowed loose water to accumulate in the void space below deck thus allowing the water to run aft and causing the boat to founder by the stern.  The court was satisfied that no outside agency had any involvement in the foundering of the launch.</P>
    <P>All the key recommendations of the report in relation to matters of operational safety for fisheries boards' staff have been implemented, full details of which were given to the House on 24 February and 24 June last year.  I can also inform the House that I authorised the appointment of a deputy manager in each of the regional fisheries boards which was specifically recommended in the report and that these appointments have now been made.  The penalties for assaulting fishery officers are being increased under the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1994, thus extending to fishery officers the same protection which is afforded to members of the Garda Síochána as recommended in the Ballycotton report.</P>

      <P>Work is under way in the Department preparing for the continuation of EU aid for development works at the commercial seaports, including Dublin Port.  The aim of our overall strategy will be to ensure that our seaports have the capacity and quality of infrastructure to meet the trading conditions of the 21st century.  To achieve this a comprehensive port development programme, in respect of the years 1994 to 1999, is included in the national Development Plan.</P>
      <P>The provision of a freight Ro-Ro facility at the North Quay extension, Dublin Port, at a total estimated cost of £5.5 million, has just been approved by the EU for Cohesion Fund aid at the rate of 65 per cent of project cost.  A Lo-Lo terminal enhancement project at a total estimated cost of £9 million has been submitted to the EU for consideration for Cohesion Fund aid.  The EU's decision on this is expected during the second quarter of 1994.  This investment is in addition to an EU-assisted investment of £22 million in the provision of bulk and unitised facilities at Dublin Port under the Operational Programme on Peripherality, 1989-1993, which programme is now virtually complete.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should mention that Dublin Port and Docks Board has submitted a comprehensive port development programme, at a toal cost of £54 million, for consideration for EU aid under the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999.</i> The Department's consideration of the submission will be completed as speedily as possible and Dublin Port and Docks Board will then be notified of its proposed Structural Fund allocation.</P>

      <P>In 1993 there were 31 fish kills <Col N="389" /> reported to the Department of the Marine.  It is not possible to calculate the financial loss associated with these fish kills.  The Water Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1990, provides, however, that the courts may require convicted polluters to meet the costs incurred in investigating, mitigating or remedying the effects of the pollution caused.  The number of prosecutions instituted to date as a result of these fish kills is four.</P>
      <P>I should point out that due to increased monitoring and public awareness in recent years there has been a considerable reduction in the number of reported incidents of fish kills.  In fact, the number reported in 1993 was the lowest since systematic recording began in 1983 and compared with a high of 122 in 1987.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 48, 59 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations between the EU and the four applicant countries are now effectively closed.  As far as fisheries are concerned the main impact will arise should Norway decide to join.  After difficult negotiations Ireland achieved all its major negotiating objectives.  Not only are Irish fisheries interests preserved and consolidated in the outcome of this negotiation but, in addition, nothing was done <Col N="391" /> at the Council which would have a prejudicial impact on any future negotiations in the fisheries sector.</P>
    <P>The principal elements of the agreement are: one third of Ireland's mackerel allocation may be fished east of 4W including the Norwegian zone.  The resources available to the Union under the EEA agreement will be consolidated and brought forward to 1995 and be further supplemented by additional resources to be obtained from third countries. Ireland, as a cohesion country, will receive a share of these resources.  The internal allocation of these resources as between the cohesion countries remains to be agreed.  Norwegian access to Irish waters will be no greater than currently obtains and will be subject to a special control system: in particular Norway will not be entitled to an allocation of horse mackerel.  A four-year transitional period has been achieved during which a market monitoring and management mechanism will be put in place to minimise disruptions of the Community market which might arise as a result of the removal of the remaining tariffs on Norwegian fish imports.</P>
    <P>The removal of tariffs on products imported from Norway would, of course, create pressures for the Irish industry which has had the benefit of these tariffs for a number of years.  However, urgent discussions are underway on the implications of the lifting of these tariffs and consideration will be given to taking any measures necessary to assist the Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as I have a function in this matter, it derives from my role <Col N="392" /> as licensing authority for all fish farm operations governing their location, management, fish husbandry and production parameters.  The use of all veterinary medical products is quite seperately regulated under legislation administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, while the National Drugs Advisory Board is the competent product licensing authority under EU and national legislation.</P>
      <P>I am advised that Ivermectin is authorised and freely available worldwide for use in the livestock industry and indeed as an antiparasitic agent in human medicine with a record of safety.  I am further advised that an application for its product authorisation as a fish medicine has not been lodged to date.  I consider that on balance it would be a helpful development if evaluation of the compound's efficacy as a treatment for sea lice were continued and intensified with a view to proceeding towards a product licence application which could be considered by the relevant authorities.  I would stress, however, that I have no direct influence in this process.</P>
      <P>The extent to which there is responsible use of applied treatments and preventative medicine in fish management can be gauged by residue testing programmes of the final product.  I am advised that in an ongoing programme of representative sample testing, using state of the art technology and to the strictest limits of detection, no threshold residues of Ivermectin have been found in samples of Irish farmed fish offered for sale.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that Irish farmed salmon production is governed by a quality assurance scheme which lays down strict standards for husbandry, harvesting and withdrawal times for all treatments.  As a result Irish farmed salmon enjoys the highest reputation in markets abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every reason to believe that there is widespread, genuine support for the objective of minimising sealice levels at salmon farms through the use of effective treatments and other lice-eliminating measures.  Such an approach has been strongly endorsed by the Sea Trout Task <Col N="393" /> Force in its final report.  New treatments are continually being devised although it is the case, as with all advances in veterinary and human medicine, that the process of expert verification is a complex and lengthy one.  I understand for instance that trials are going on into an effective vaccine to combat sea lice on salmon.  The results, while encouraging, are still only at a preliminary stage.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy supports the proposition that we should actively encourage means of naturally reducing sealice infestations through improved fish farms, management strategies and fallowing in particular.  A major benefit of fallowing, if accepted and supported in practice as well as in principle, would be to progressively reduce the need for therapeutants and applied treatments for lice control.  With this objective in mind, priority will continue to be given to encouraging, co-ordinating and implementing fallowing proposals backed up by a process of local and regional consultation.</P>

      <P>In March 1991, following extensive scientific studies of the site, the authorised sewage sludge dumpsite was relocated from its previous location two miles off Howth Head to a new site southeast of the Kish Lighthouse about ten to 14 miles offshore.  Some localised environmental impact had been identified in the vicinity of the old site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comparative survey of marine life on the seabed at both the new site and the disused Howth Head site was carried out in 1993 to assess the impact of the change of dumping location on the marine environment.  The range of marine life present at the new site showed <Col N="394" /> that it is not suffering from any pollution. Under present disposal conditions environmental problems are not anticipated at this location which will continue to be monitored.  The assemblage of marine life at the former site confirmed that it was recovering well from the earlier localised pollution.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation currently holds an annual permit under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, and is permitted to dispose of up to a maximum of 340,000 tonnes of sewage sludge at sea during 1994 with a maximum of 6,000 tonnes to be dumped per day.  Three trips are normally made to the site per week with approximately 2,000 tonnes being disposed of on each trip.  The dumping of sewage sludge at sea will be prohibited internationally under the Oslo Convention from 31 December 1998.  Alternative land-based methods of treatment and disposal are being developed by Dublin Corporation with that timeframe in mind.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to clarify the regulatory position in relation to sea angling boats.  Boats used for sea angling are defined as fishing vessels under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, and as such do not require a passenger boat licence under that Act.  All fishing vessel operators, including the operators of sea angling boats are encouraged to comply with comprehensive safety requirements including the carriage of lifejackets and other essential safety equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sea angling boats must, however, be regularly surveyed and certified by the Department under the Merchant Shipping (Load Line) Rules, 1968, for compliance with construction standards. <Col N="395" /> Vessels, including sea angling boats, are exempt from the load line rules if they are less than 80 registered tons and do not carry cargo; do not carry more than 12 passengers; and do not operate more than 15 miles from the point of departure or more than three miles from land.</P>

      <P>I have granted permission to a small number of salmon farm operations to implement fallowing trials for a limited period this year and under strict conditions.  The permissions involve the stocking of smolts at additional sites for a number of months.  This will enable existing sites to be fallowed and will provide a basis for further evaluation and environmental assessment of the additional sites as possible components of overall fallowing strategies for the fish farms in question.</P>
      <P>Fallowing, or rotation, of sites in marine fish farm culture is now an internationally accepted strategy with demonstrable benefits for fish husbandry, health regimes and control of sea lice levels.  The sea trout task force has called for the full and effective implementation of fallowing regimes and single bay management both as sound farm practice and as an effective long term means of controlling lice and other pathogens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Technical guidelines for the fallowing of sites have been formulated by the fallowing advisory group which I established last year and marine fish farmers are being actively encouraged to develop fallowing strategies in accordance with these guidelines.  It is a key objective to ensure that fallowing proposals are planned and implemented in an integrated way.  The strategy is, therefore, being informed by detailed assessment of each such proposal from the local perspective <Col N="396" /> in regional fisheries advisory groups representing fisheries boards, the Salmon Research Agency, the Department, salmon farmers and fisheries interests.  Proposals are also assessed, from technical and other perspectives, by the Department's Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee following consultation with local authorities, the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte and other relevant interests.</P>
    <P>The present permissions are subject to full compliance with standard fish farm licence conditions, together with stringent environmental, sea lice and fish health monitoring and management requirements.  All structures and fish will be removed in the event of the water quality results or general performance at the sites not meeting with the standard set by the Department.  The permissions are, therefore, stringently circumscribed and conditional in nature.  Implementation will be closely monitored by the Department.  I would stress that none of the proposals involves an overall increase in licenced fish production for the operations concerned.  All fish will be transferred back to existing licensed sites in due course.</P>
    <P>The decision to permit these sites to operate on a trial basis does not represent any commitment to the granting of more permanent licences.  The companies have been instructed that, if it is their intention subsequently to seek longer term permissions for the sites, environmental impact statements should be finalised and published during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>Any future decisions will be informed by the performance of the sites, the results of environmental, fish health and sea lice monitoring, environmental impact assessment, further consultation with all relevant interests and all other appropriate considerations, including visual, amenity and tourism considerations.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance is but one element in the Government's presentation of its annual expenditure and taxation plans.</P>
      <P>The primary publications setting out expenditure are the Estimates for Public Services and the Public Capital Programme. For 1994 these provide for substantial increases in the marine allocation and particularly in the provisions for the fishing sector.</P>
      <P>It is not normal that there would be references in the Financial Statement to each individual sector of the economy. On this occasion I should mention that at the time the budget was being finalised no submissions had been received from the fishing industry seeking any particular concessions.</P>
      <P>The fact that no provision is included in the Estimates or the budget does not of course preclude the Government dealing with any new needs of a pressing nature which may arise.  In this regard, measures are, for example, being adopted to deal with the difficulties arising in the fishing sector from exceptional bad weather conditions over recent months.</P>

      <P>The Department is investigating reports that groups of people from outside the area have been netting bass in the Rosscarbery Estuary.  In the light of these reports the area is now being closely monitored by officers from the Department and the fishery boards but to date the offenders have not been pinpointed.</P>
      <P>I should point out that, in an effort to conserve the declining stock of bass in inshore Irish waters, the netting and sale of bass has for some years been prohibited. In addition, certain catch restrictions have been placed on anglers.  I am concerned, in particular, that these conservation measures should not be flouted by commercial netters claiming to be targetting mullet on which there are no restrictions.</P>
      <P>In relation to Rosscarbery Estuary, I am advised by both the Department and the Central Fisheries Board that only a total ban on netting can ensure full compliance with the existing bass conservation measures.  Accordingly, I propose to introduce such a ban and the necessary legal instrument is currently being drafted.</P>

The Act also provides for the application of the 12½ per cent rate of VAT to the supply of such facilities by persons other than non-profit making organisations.  This means that, where a golf club operates on a non-profit making basis, the green fees are exempt from VAT.  Where it operates on a profit-making basis the green fees are liable to VAT at the 12½ per cent rate.  This is so whether the green fees are paid by members or by non-members.</P>

      <P>I have previously set out my Department's responsibilities in this matter and indicated that, arising from discussions between officials of the Departments of Health, Education and Justice, it is considered that unless there is a requirement for custody on conviction for criminal offences, the person concerned should be cared for in a health board-related facility.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Department of Health that social work staff of the Eastern Health Board have been monitoring the welfare of the person in question. The board have tried, without success, to get her to attend day centres and training programmes.</P>
      <P>Refurbishment work at a residential unit is due to be completed by the end of April, 1994.  A place will be available there for the person concerned from 3 May, 1994.  However, it is not clear whether she would be prepared to accept the offer of a place there.  My advice from the Department of Health is that the health board could not compel her to do so.</P>

      <P>The video film entitled &ldquo;The Driller Killers&rdquo; was prohibited by the Official Censor with effect from 13 July, 1993.</P>
      <P>It is an offence for any person to supply or offer to supply or to have in his/her possession with intent to supply a video recording of a video work for which a prohibition order is in force and such offenders are liable to prosecution under the Video Recordings Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, to date, gardaí have not discovered any snuff videos depicting actual murder in the course of searches of video outlets nationwide.  Neither is there any evidence that such videos are being sold in video outlets.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that they have no evidence to suggest that the video film &ldquo;The Driller Killers&rdquo; is being sold in video outlets.  If information to that effect were to become available, the necessary action would be taken immediately.</P>

Since the commencement of the prohibition provisions in mid 1991 nearly 1,000 video works have been banned by the official censor and there has been a substantial number of prosecutions for the possession and/or supply of prohibited video works.</P>

      <P>Because of the introduction of 100 per cent capital grants in 1988 and the elimination of loan repayments and subsidies on capital loans written off by the Exchequer, there was a significant technical once-off reduction in the figures for total local authority expenditure between 1987 and 1988.  As a result, figures for local authority expenditure as a percentage of GDP in the years 1985 and 1987 are not comparable with those for the 1988 to 1993 period.  The percentages in question are as follows: 1985, 8.5 per cent; 1986, 8.2 per cent; 1987, 7.5 per cent; 1988, 5.1 per cent; 1989, 4.7 per cent; 1990, 4.7 per cent; 1991, 4.8 per cent; 1992, 4.7 per cent; 1993, 5.1 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1993, the Council of Fisheries Ministers adopted a new Regulation establishing a Community system governing the issue of licences for fishing vessels and prescribing the minimum information to be contained in licences.  This new system will apply from 1 January 1995.</P>
      <P>The new regulation will bring a degree of uniformity into the general licensing system in the Community and standardise, at a minimum level, the amount and presentation of the information contained in licences.  The main aim is to improve control of the Community's fishing fleet.  As a member state with a large fisheries zone to control, I support measures which will improve our ability to monitor fishing activity in that zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new system all vessels in the Community will have to be licensed and <Col N="415" /> carry the licence on board.  A member state may, however, by derogation exempt boats of less than 10 metres from the obligation to carry the licence on board where those boats operate exclusively within the maritime jurisdiction of that member state.</P>
    <P>The licence will have to include certain minimum information in relation to the vessel such as registered number, tonnage, engine capacity and the fleet category assigned to the vessel under the Community's Multi-Annual Guidance Programme for the fleet.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this will mean that, whereas at present only fishing vessels in the Irish fleet over 65 feet in length are required to hold a licence, as and from 1 January 1995 every vessel in the Irish fishing fleet will require a fishing licence.  I do not envisage that the regulation will cause any significant problems for the Irish fishing industry nor have I received any submissions from the industry.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed at the prospect of a fishing permit being incorporated into such licences.  However this matter is still under consideration by the Commission.  I am keeping an open mind as to the merits of the proposal and will decide whether its adoption is in the best interests of the Irish fishing industry when a formal proposal is submitted by the Commission.</P>
    <P>I will of course be seeking the views of the industry on the matter when the full details of the proposal are known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the recent discussion document on the management and development of the fishing fleet, the Department <Col N="416" /> set out proposals for the introduction of a new fleet licensing policy, which it is hoped will improve fleet management and allow for the development of the Irish fleet to its maximum potential.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the discussion document was to ensure that the fishing industry had every opportunity to assess the implications of these proposals so that the widest possible consultation could take place.</P>
      <P>The document has been discussed both with fishermen at a series of meetings held around the coast and with fishermen's organisations.  It emerged during this process that fishermen were concerned, in particular, that the proposals could result in the loss of traditional fishing rights and lead in some cases to a drop in the value of boats within the fleet.</P>
      <P>These very real concerns are being examined as part of a full scale review of the proposals currently taking place in the Department.  While every effort will be made these concerns in any revision of the proposals, the necessity to meet Ireland's Community obligations in respect of fleet capacity must also be taken into account.  Failure to meet the capacity targets set out in the Multi Annual Guidance Programme for the fleet could endanger the allocation of structural funding to the fishing industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>Since the Department's discussion document has been published, new regulations introducing a Community licensing system have been adopted at the Fisheries Council.  In addition, the Commission intends to bring forward proposals providing for Community fishing permits.  As these developments could have implications for the new licensing policy, they are being assessed in the context of the present policy review.</P>
      <P>Once the review has been completed, I intend to consult with the industry representative bodies and would then hope to be in a position to take final decisions in the matter.  I can assure the Deputy that no decisions will be taken in advance of such consultations.</P>

Payment of the balance due cannot be made until all applications received from him in the course of 1993 have been processed.

      <P>The person named applied for grants on 12 cows under the 1992 beef cow scheme.  He was paid £450 in respect of six cows on foot of this application in 1992.  I regret that due to an oversight he was not paid on six of the animals applied on under this scheme.  Arrangements have been made to have this payment made within the next two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He applied for 12 cows again in 1993 under the beef cow scheme.

      <P>The total sports capital allocation since 1988 for the provision of national, regional and local sports facilities, amount to £42.75 million, of which £7.914 million has been expended on the proposed national sports centre.  All of this allocation, with the exception of £3 million allocated in the 1994 budget in respect of the recreational facilities scheme, has been provided from the proceeds of the national lottery.</P>
      <P>In the same period a total of £40.80 million has also been allocated from the national lottery for current sport programmes.</P>
      <P>All funding for sport is decided in the context of the annual Estimates for Public Services and I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to ensure that sport receives its fair share of funding.</P>
      <P>The future of the site for the proposed National Sports Centre is under review at present and the outcome of this review will depend on the clarification of a number of legal issues.</P>
