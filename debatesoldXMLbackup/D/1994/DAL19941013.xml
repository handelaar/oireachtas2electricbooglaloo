      <P>It is proposed to take statements on the announcement by the combined loyalist military command of a cessation of all operational hostilities from 12 midnight tonight, and Nos. 8 and 9.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the statements will be confined to the Taoiseach, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, the Leader of the Progressive Democrat Party, the Leader of the Democratic Left Party and the Tánaiste and shall not exceed five minutes in each case.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask a question on the Order of Business but I would prefer to deal first with this matter, which is more important.  It would be a pity to introduce any other routine questions beforehand.  I realise that involves a certain reversal of business but if you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Taoiseach would agree to it, it would be best.  I do not wish to raise any extraneous matter now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the decision of the loyalist paramilitary organisations to cease universally all operational hostilities from midnight. They have set out their own stated reasons for their decision, but it has been taken in the light of the continuing IRA ceasefire.  Since I have always regarded the IRA ceasefire as permanent, I regard the loyalist ceasefire as permanent also.</P>
      <P>This decision effectively signifies the end of 25 years of violence, and the closure of a tragic chapter in our history.  It is my hope and my conviction that there will never again be political violence on our island.  We are at the dawn of a new era.  Everyone should now work together in a spirit of goodwill, reconciliation and forbearance to consolidate a just and lasting peace, so as to ensure that all the people of Ireland are rid of the gun and the bomb from Irish politics forever.</P>
      <P>I welcome the clear recognition in the loyalist statement that there must be respect for difference and that all future battles must be political battles within the democratic framework.  This is what the Downing Street Declaration of last December set out to establish &mdash; a level democratic playingfield from which all attempts to influence political developments by violence or the threat of violence would be removed.  For the first time in over 100 years, this will make a new type of politics possible in the North, a politics of consent and agreement involving both sides equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1808" /> I also welcome the element of contrition in the loyalist statement, expressing abject and true remorse for all the innocent victims of the past 25 years. The recognition of wrongs committed on all sides, political as well as paramilitary, must be an element in the process of healing and reconciliation.  The memory of all the victims of violence will be cherished.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to those individuals who have worked for peace and restraint in times of crisis and who helped to bring about a loyalist ceasefire.  A special tribute is due to the Reverend Roy Magee and Archbishop Eames who exercised their influence to bring this about.  Both the Tánaiste and I have continued to maintain our contacts in this community in order to support those trying to bring about a loyalist ceasefire.</P>
    <P>The concerns of the loyalist community will continue to receive the attention of the Irish Government at the highest level, as they have in the course of the Downing Street Joint Declaration and its clarification.  A significant statement of part of the political philosophy of the loyalist organisations has been incorporated into paragraph 5 of the Downing Street Declaration, in addition to other paragraphs which address Unionist and Nationalist concerns.</P>
    <P>We must all work now for the consolidation of peace and for demilitarisation. The question of law enforcement and policing, prisoners and the safe and permanent disposal of weapons arises in this context and affects both communities.</P>
    <P>We must also try to make political progress with all possible speed.  The establishment of the Forum, which will remain open to all, will follow at the end of this month.  The conclusion of the Framework Document and the recommencement of the talks will allow the negotiation of a lasting settlement which will be put to referendums North and South concurrently and which, taken collectively, will be an exercise in self-determination, both in part and in whole, assuming results point in the same direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> This is a wonderful moment, a tremendous and exciting opportunity for all the people of this island.  Let us all look forward with hope and confidence to a new and different future.</P>
    <P>I intend to get in touch shortly with the leaders of all the churches to suggest that we may have a national day of thanksgiving for peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement today of a loyalist ceasefire is extremely welcome.  It is important to say that it flows directly from the Downing Street Joint Declaration.  All involved in that Declaration deserve credit.  That in turn flowed from the Anglo-Irish Agreement which established the principle that any change in the status of Northern Ireland must be made with the consent of both communities.  I am glad almost nine years after the Anglo-Irish Agreement established that principle, the loyalists now realise that it means what it says and there is no justification for any armed activity by loyalists.  Their position is secure until a majority decide to change it by democratic dialogue and decision.</P>
      <P>The loyalist ceasefire will bring a sense of relief to people all over this island.  There are people who will worry until midnight tonight that they might be abducted while out shopping or that a knock on the door will be a prelude to something awful for themselves and their families.  The sense of being able to sleep easy, converse with neighbours and move about easily is beginning to seep into the population in Northern Ireland and is a direct result of the successful political process which has led to today's announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise in these discussions the perspective of the victims of violence &mdash; the families who have been permanently scarred by violence.  In the case of loyalist violence, we are talking about people who have been bereaved simply because the person murdered was a Catholic.  People were murdered for their religion and not for any political involvement.  That has <Col N="1810" /> come to an end and is an enormous improvement in our position.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the fact, as has the Taoiseach, that in their statement the loyalists expressed sincere regret and atonement for the hurt and harm they caused.  That is a notable feature of their announcement and is something which all those who have ceased violence enunciate.  There are, however &mdash; it is important to apply this principle to all cessation of violence declarations &mdash; questions to be answered.  Our approach to this ceasefire should be the same as our approach to the IRA ceasefire &mdash; the application of the principle, trust but verify.  It is part of my function to ask questions that need to be asked. Will the loyalists cease the punishment shootings and beatings they have continued throughout the year against members of their own community? These people may be loyal to the United Kingdom but they are victims and Irish people.  We, in this House, must be concerned about their welfare. This year 58 punishment shootings were carried out in loyalist areas by loyalist paramilitaries.  The statement does not make it clear that these have come to an end.  They have spoken about an end to operational hostilities but have not referred to the application of what might be called policing actions within their own community.  If there is an end to violence in the true meaning of the term, these forms of punishment must also be brought to an end from midnight tonight.  The loyalist statement does not make that clear to date.</P>
    <P>Likewise, we must have evidence from the loyalists that their activities in racketeering, the collection of protection money and the drug trade will be brought to an end.  That does not come within the category of operational hostilities and is not covered by the statement.  If one is to accept that there is a complete cessation of violence and a return to law abiding political activity, operational hostilities must also be declared to be at an end.</P>
    <P>There is the very important question of what will happen to the IRA's and <Col N="1811" /> loyalists' stocks of arms.  In recent years the loyalists accumulated large stocks of arms.  They are very well equipped.  It is understood their level of equipment is equal to if not greater than that of the IRA.  There can be no true acceptance that they have ceased violence unless they make a clear declaration of their intention to put their arms out of commission.  It is very important that this matter be clarified by them also.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that they have not used the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; in their declaration of an end to violence.  The word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; is included in paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Joint Declaration and is the word used by the Irish Government as much as by the British Government as a precondition for entry to normal politics by any political party.  I hope it is possible for the Ulster Democratic Party and the Progressive Unionists to be admitted to normal political activity and be invited to participate in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation meeting in Dublin. If that is to happen we must be satisfied, and they must be willing to say, that their cessation of violence is permanent. The problem is, they say their cessation of violence will continue for as long as the IRA cessation of violence continues, and for some reason or other the IRA are unwilling to use the term &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; contained in the Downing Street Joint Declaration which was inserted by both Governments.  It is important that both organisations use that word.  We are not asking either organisation to be a prophet or to speak for future generations and say violence will never occur in the future.</P>
    <P>No one in any area of activity is a prophet, but it is important for the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries to say that their intention or, to use the legal term, <i>mens rea,</i> is that there should be a permanent end to violence.  If they do this they will meet the terms of the Downing Street Joint Declaration.  Neither side has yet done so, and this is as much a matter of concern to the Irish Government as it is <Col N="1812" /> to the British Government in that we live on this island.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's suggestion that we have a national day of thanksgiving for peace.  This could do nothing but good.  It would act as a focus for all our hopes and desires and provide a means for all of us to show solidarity, tolerance and an openness to a new beginning in Irish and British political life.  I heartily endorse this positive suggestion by the Taoiseach and am willing to co-operate with him in any way possible.</P>
    <P>I compliment everybody involved in this achievement &mdash; the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the British Prime Minister, in particular, Mr. John Hume, Rev. Roy Magee, Archbishop Eames and Cardinal Cahal Daly &mdash; and all those who have been involved in persuading the paramilitaries on both sides to recognise something they should have recognised long ago, that violence leads only to a cul-de-sac.  We are now on the high road for a better life for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that today, 13 October, will, like 31 August, soon be confirmed as an epic milestone in the centuries old quarrel between Orange and Green, a day when those differences will finally be resolved through peaceful democratic means.</P>
      <P>Unionism and Nationalism are incompatible and the challenge for all of us is to find ways of accommodating both traditions on this small island.  That accommodation cannot be achieved through bombs and bullets but rather through argument and debate.  As I said on 31 August, if one form of words has to be used so that some people may save face, or for historical reasons, and at the same time we are going to save lives it would be churlish not to accept that at face value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For too long, 25 years, the images of this country throughout the world have either been ones of evil, eerie, hooded men carrying their weapons of war or of unfortunate victims walking behind the <Col N="1813" /> coffins of their loved ones.  The first person I met on my way to my office this morning was Senator Gordon Wilson who recalled the thousands of victims who have suffered at the hands of the paramilitaries on both sides of the divide.  As the Taoiseach and Deputy Bruton said, we should remember those people today, and their loved ones, whose loss can never be replaced.  In all our deeds and actions, these people must be uppermost in our minds.</P>
    <P>We should also pay tribute to the courageous people in Northern Ireland who have never chosen the paramilitary route, politicians in the Official Unionist Party, the SDLP, the Alliance Party and others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the real people of courage and it is their courage which has brought today's development about.  They have shown that violence is not the way to achieve agreement on this island.  I agree with the Taoiseach that we should have a day of thanksgiving for peace.  I hope it will be a truly ecumenical day when people of all religions and of none can come together and give thanks for what has been achieved.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to all those who have been involved in bringing about today's achievement &mdash; Archbishop Eames, Rev. Magee, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  I have been critical of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste during the past few weeks but I have to pay tribute to them for their achievements in regard to Northern Ireland.  To be fair, the Tánaiste has played a very important role which may have been underestimated.  I also want to pay tribute to the British Prime Minister who has made an enormous impact, even if we would prefer progress to have been somewhat more rapid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are facing a huge challenge and it would be foolish to underestimate the political difficulties involved.  I hope that the future scenes and images of Ireland will be ones of politicians sitting <Col N="1814" /> around a table arguing, debating and seeking to resolve those difficulties and of generous people both on this side of the Border and in Northern Ireland. The challenge facing all of us is to create a truly political society in Northern Ireland, a society where Unionists and Nationalists can give their allegiance, a society where both traditions are respected and are seen as equal.  That is the challenge facing everybody involved in politics and it is a particular challenge for those involved in politics in Northern Ireland.  Those politicians will have to show real courage and leadership on a scale they have never shown before.  One has only to think of the refusal by Belfast City Council to hold a civic reception for the Down football team to realise the long road we have yet to travel.  There will be other days and other fora to deal with political matters.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall some of the awful atrocities carried out by loyalist paramilitaries &mdash; the McGurk's bar attack, the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, Greysteel and Loughinisland, all of which were on a scale equal to anything ever done by the Provisional IRA. Sometimes people take the view that we are not consistent in the way we express our condemnation, but everybody in this House and every sane person on this island rightly condemns those atrocities with the same vigour with which they condemn the atrocities carried out by the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>I am pleased we have an opportunity to discuss this matter this morning.  As the Taoiseach said recently, if we are to make progress on this island we must have talks which are really inclusive. Any person who has a role to play, anyone who chooses to go down the political route and decides to resolve their differences through politics, must be facilitated in every way possible. Nobody must be excluded: we want to create an island which is genuinely reconciled and genuinely inclusive of all the different traditions and shades of opinion.  Like politicians in Northern <Col N="1815" /> Ireland, we in this House have an enormous role to play in that regard.  I hope that this role will be understood and appreciated.</P>
    <P>Today's development is very important but the path which lies ahead is very difficult and complex and it will take a long time to dismantle the war economy which is Northern Ireland.  For example, many people whose jobs depended on violence and a war economy now face unemployment.  Their concerns and fears will be the same as those of people in the South and we must deal with their sensitivities and understand their difficulties.  We talk about the peace dividend but their is an enormous cost in terms of economic matters in Northern Ireland which flow from peace in the short term.  We must be prepared to deal with these matters and be generous in terms of any financial contributions we make, in the same way as we demand financial contributions for others.  Dismantling the war society in Northern Ireland and creating a genuinely political normal society will take an enormous amount of time. However, the task and challenge facing us will be much easier from today than it might have been otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome today's announcement by the combined loyalist command of a ceasefire by the UDA and the UVF, and the historic potential that decision carries with it.  It means that another important piece of the jigsaw has been put in place and that the people of Northern Ireland can now really begin to hope that they will at last be freed from the terrible cycle of violence and destruction which has so scarred this island for so long.</P>
      <P>In my statement to the Dáil on 31 August last, following the IRA ceasefire, I expressed the hope that the loyalist paramilitaries would follow suit and declare a ceasefire also.  That they have now done so really opens up a new chapter of hope in the troubled history of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that debate I expressed the hope <Col N="1816" /> that the IRA ceasefire would be permanent and unconditional and I now make the same appeal to the loyalist paramilitaries.  I have heard only brief reports of the loyalist announcement, but it would appear that in their statement they have gone as far as could have been reasonably expected at this stage.  The firm and resolute message from democratic politicians to all paramilitaries in Northern Ireland is that violence has advanced neither the cause of nationalism nor unionism, but has diminished both: it is time to put away guns permanently to seek to promote political views by force of argument alone.</P>
    <P>The same welcome that was given to the IRA ceasefire must now be extended also to the loyalist statement, but it must also be subject to the same degree of caution.  Paramilitaries have made a major step forward but there is more required on both sides before their democratic credentials can be fully accepted.  I would particularly hope that all paramilitaries would follow up on their ceasefire statements by also ending the totally barbaric practice of so-called punishment shootings and beatings.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of arms.  I look forward to the proposals the Taoiseach may put forward in relation to what he described as the &ldquo;safe and permanent disposal of all weapons&rdquo;.  That also is a key step that must be taken to guarantee the peace we all want.</P>
    <P>It is important that we ensure the potential of the new situation is not lost. A mechanism must be found to allow those whose views are reflected by the loyalist paramilitaries to have an input into the next phase of the process.  The same doors that were opened for Gerry Adams must now be open to the loyalists.</P>
    <P>In particular I appeal to loyalist paramilitaries to accept that the people of the Republic are not their enemies, to acknowledge that despite the diverse political traditions a way must be found <Col N="1817" /> to allow us all to live on this island in peaceful co-existence.</P>
    <P>This time last year Northern Ireland was going through one of its bleakest periods as it appeared that the paramilitaries were attempting to outdo each other in terms of sheer viciousness. Nationalists brought carnage to the Shankill Road; loyalists devastated Greysteel.  In the context of what has happened over the past 25 years, even six weeks free from violent death has been a remarkable achievement.  There is clearly a new sense of hope, a new spring in the step of the people of Northern Ireland.  People who for years have lived in fear of the terrorist gangs can now sleep easily in their beds.</P>
    <P>That new sense of hope and optimism has to be tempered by the realisation that there is a long way to go before we can be sure that the political conditions have been created which will guarantee lasting stability and a lasting peace.  The obligation is on all democratic politicians, in Britain and in the Republic of Ireland but primarily in Northern Ireland itself, to build on the new situation, to ensure that the opportunities presented by the present situation will not be lost and that political structures will be developed which will be capable of winning genuine cross community support.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the proposal from the Taoiseach with regard to a national thanksgiving day.  I appeal to him to bear in mind that this would be an opportunity to express the clear diversity on this island and to include the Muslim community in this day of thanksgiving.  Up to now they have not, to my knowledge, been included in any of our national events.</P>

      <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of many people on this island who do not accept the guidance of religions to take them forward, will the national thanksgiving day give space to the many thousands of people, <Col N="1818" /> humanists and secularists, in both Northern Ireland and in the Republic? Many of us feel out of place at religious ceremonies which do not include a space for us.  It is important that we begin not only to state rhetorically what our acceptance of a diverse society is but to put it into practice.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, and the Green Party in Northern Ireland &mdash; two sister parties &mdash; I welcome the loyalist ceasefire wholeheartedly.  As the Green movement has among its members off-spring of the old guard of Nationalists and the old guard of Unionists, it is hoped that the tensions between those two traditions can be lessened and that they will work together even more following today's decision by loyalist paramilitaries.</P>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and all those who worked both politically and in church circles including Reverend Roy Magee, Dr. Robin Eames, Dr. Cahal Daly, Fr. Denis Faul and all the others who cannot be mentioned here, who took brave decisions at times when it was neither popular nor profitable to do so to pursue the peace process.  We should not forget the many people without any labels or titles who, in their daily lives, have tried to tear down the barriers built around them, both mentally and physically, in their communities.  While I was in Belfast during the local elections, I walked down the green, white and orange and red, white and blue footpaths.  It was clear that there were huge divisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of this continuing process I ask that we should not be led down the same cul-de-sac of referendum after referendum where there are only two options and where people have to make decisions based on those options which would continue the polarisation.  We should explore the politics of consensus which look neither at one nor the other extreme but try to find the most acceptable compromise or middle ground. <Col N="1819" /> There would be a role for a preferendum rather a referendum in pursuing this process.</P>
    <P>I remind the Taoiseach to take careful note on Monday next when a book will be launched in the Mansion House on that subject, <i>The Politics of Consensus,</i> and to see whether that can be worked into the whole process of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>When the Lord Mayor of Dublin from my party and the Unionist Lord Mayor of Belfast met recently it was felt that a trust, which could be the guiding light, was being built between sane individuals from whatever political background on this island who could pursue the welfare of all traditions through a peaceful means.  I hope the politics of consensus will be actively pursued by the Greens in whatever forum is set up by the Taoiseach or anybody else in the other jurisdiction and that it can be taken on board by all parties in this House.</P>

      <P>I have heard with great satisfaction of the decision announced by the Combined Loyalist Military Command that they will universally cease all operational hostilities from midnight tonight.  This decision is a further significant contribution to the creation of a genuine and lasting peace, and will be welcomed by all who have sought the abandonment of violence as a means of advancing political objectives on this island.  We look forward to it being put fully into effect on the ground, and trust that the overwhelming consensus for peace which has been demonstrated on all sides will be supported by all other groups and individuals.</P>

    <P>Taken with the earlier decision by the Provisional IRA to end its campaign, today's announcement opens the way for an enduring peace such as we have never previously known on this island. There is a responsibility on all concerned to seize this historic opportunity and contribute to building a lasting <Col N="1820" /> accommodation which will forever make political violence a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>The Government is confident that the transformed situation in which violence has been taken out of Irish politics can contribute in a major way to the search for a new political accommodation which threatens no one and which is based on equal respect and esteem for the Nationalist and Unionist traditions.</P>
    <P>For the first time in many decades we have a situation where politicians on all sides can address the task of crafting a just and lasting accommodation between our traditions without having to look over their shoulder at the threat of violence from either side.  This is both an opportunity and a responsibility for all who are committed to the democratic process.  It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that this opportunity is used to its full potential.</P>
    <P>The Government restate their commitment to contribute actively to the consolidation of peace by a generous and flexible approach.  Central to the Government's approach are the principles set out in the Joint Declaration of 15 December 1993, and the acceptance by the Irish Government that the democratic right of self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Ireland, North and South respectively.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to maintain the present momentum for progress.  Over the coming weeks we will be working closely with the British Government to reach agreement on the Framework Document which we hope will be quickly followed by talks involving all the parties.  We will also continue preparations for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation which we envisage playing an important role in promoting the kind of mutual understanding and reconciliation essential to political dialogue.  The democratic system provides the only way foward for all groups and communities on this island as a whole. Moreover, against the background of an <Col N="1821" /> end to paramilitary violence it is essential that we do not lose sight of the many economic and social problems which are experienced by both communities in Northern Ireland and in Border regions.  It is our intention, in conjunction with our friends in Europe and the United States, to ensure that in the new climate which has been created these issues are actively addressed.</P>
    <P>I thank the party leaders for the generosity of their remarks this morning. The matters raised by Deputy Bruton are firmly on the Irish Government's agenda.  As the Taoiseach stated, very strong messages were delivered to Northern Ireland regarding the punishment beatings which are, and will continue to be, totally unacceptable regardless of from which section of the community they come.  The Anglo-Irish Conference will also be discussing racketeering and the drugs trade.  We hope normality is returned to all aspects of life in Northern Ireland quickly once we have taken the violence out of the conflict.  We have made our views very clear in regard to the storage of arms.  That is unacceptable and both Governments collectively will endeavour to ensure that arms are taken out of circulation.  If there is no violence in the conflict there is no reason for the retention of arms by any section of the community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Nothing can undo the tragic loss of life on all sides in the past 25 years.  The Government hopes that from today families will never again have to suffer the pain and misery caused by paramilitary violence.  A lasting peace is the most fitting memorial we can offer to those for whom the developments of the past few weeks have come too late.  I express our appreciation to the many people involved in bringing this process to a conclusion.  As the Taoiseach stated, the Reverend Roy Magee and Archbishop Robin Eames, in particular, have played a major and significant role, behind the scenes most of the time, in bringing about today's announcement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1822" /> The ending of the paramilitary campaign offers the chance of a new beginning.  Our objective is to move forward quickly to create the lasting peace for which we have all longed.  I assure Deputy De Rossa that the celebration on the national day of thanksgiving for peace will be an inclusive one, including everybody.  On a lighter note, if he has difficulties about entering the church we shall provide facilities to allow him to lurk with intent in the near vicinity.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1823" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I outlined how the milk industry operated from 1985 to 1987, when the European Union held that the Dublin District Milk Board had a monopoly and should be disbanded.  At that time the Dublin dairies used the 1936 Act to create a virtual monopoly in the distribution of liquid milk.</P>
      <P>The Bill illustrates the difficulties Ministers encounter when winding up a board set up by statute.  In this case ancillary business, such as staff redundancies and pensions, was involved and the services of the Labour Relations Commission were availed of.  Nevertheless, it is difficult to understand the years of delay in this case.  The dairy industry plays an important role in our agricultural economy and, since the 1960s has had remarkable success in improving milk quality, product development and marketing.  Until the 1960s there were only two products involved, namely liquid milk and buttermilk.  Since then long life milk and Bailey's Irish Cream have been developed, two high quality products produced in my constituency.  Also, many high quality yoghurts are produced today.  This has been made possible because of the improvement in the quality of milk.  We had butter mountains and surpluses in the past and, while the development of new products has improved the position, there is still room for the development of more products resulting in less butter production.  The co-operatives have played a significant role in the milk industry. Now that they have moved into the plc area, I hope they do not forget the support they got in their early years and ensure that the milk section of the industry continues to benefit from their international marketing powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to compare the position here with that in Northern Ireland <Col N="1824" /> where the Milk Marketing Board operates.  The fortunes of that board have declined and we have the daily movement of large quantities of milk from Northern counties to milk processing plants in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  As a result the co-operatives involved are providing many additional jobs.  Also Southern co-operatives have successfully made acquisitions in Northern Ireland, a welcome development especially today when the second paramilitary group in the North announced a ceasefire.  Despite the problems created by the paramilitaries in Border regions over the years, beef and pork industrialists continued to carry out business North and South. This was evident to members of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body on the many occasions they visited the North.</P>
    <P>It was evident that industrialists in the North who met representatives of that body were interested in developing both economies.  There will now be a great opportunity to develop resources in agriculture, tourism and so on.  This will contribute to the development of a stretch of land on both sides of the Border which has been neglected for too long.</P>
    <P>I welcome the belated decision to abolish the Cork and Dublin District Milk Boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time of open Government and ethics in Government I wish to make my position clear.  I run a dairy farm which supplies the liquid milk market.  Deputy Leonard referred to the Town of Monaghan Creamery of which he was a former member of staff. I am a board member and, therefore, I have some knowledge of the liquid milk business at both producer and processor level.  I represented my area on the liquid milk committee of the Irish Farmers' Association for a number of years. Deputy Leonard said last night that he was pleased this matter was now being speedily dealt with.  However, this matter was discussed nine or ten years ago <Col N="1825" /> when I was involved with this issue.  Successive Governments failed to address this matter.  At least we are now discussing the implementation of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Many changes have occurred since the demand for this Bill was first initiated by the liquid milk group of the IFA.  They occurred because of EU regulations under which the Cork and Dublin District Milk Boards were considered illegal and had to be disbanded. People in Monaghan also consider the operation of those boards to be illegal. I am sure the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, who was involved in Clona Dairies, Clonakilty, which was outside the control of the district milk boards, would also have experienced some difficulties with those boards in the past.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leonard referred to the difficulties experienced by the Town of Monaghan Creamery in liquid milk production.  In 1985-86 milk was supplied from across the Border and extraordinary measures had to be taken to make that impossible.  While the people in Northern Ireland wished to supply milk to the South, they under their laws refused to accept milk from the South. I joined with others to ensure there was free and fair trade.  We ensured that Northern milk suppliers did not supply milk to the South when they did not accept our milk.  Much has happened since then and I do not intend to cover the ground covered by Deputy Leonard in respect of the legal problems and efforts to solve them.</P>
      <P>In view of the changes since then one wonders how relevant is this Bill.  Our party do not intend to oppose it because a large sector of the farming community requested it.  However, it does not take account of milk produced north of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the loyalist ceasefire announced today. It opens up huge possibilities for co-operation in farming, tourism and in other areas.  However, the problems that will cause for liquid milk suppliers and sales people along the Border areas cannot be ignored.  Section 5 (2) clearly <Col N="1826" /> states that milk produced outside the Twenty-Six Counties cannot be questioned.  Milk legally imported into the State is specifically excluded.  That makes this Bill irrelevant to the northern part of the country.  Ireland is a small island subject to European Union rules.  There is free movement of goods, including milk.  My co-op in Monaghan is extremely worried about this and considers it is not equitable to subject processors of milk produced in the Republic of Ireland to the regulations of the Bill if they do not apply to milk producers in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the milk boards reflected the high level of milk consumption here.  The role played by the milk boards contributed to this country having the highest level of milk consumption in Europe.  That is important not only from the point of view of farmer-producers and the milk industry, but also in respect of health.  Recently medical people raised health concerns about the excessive consumption of milk and milk products.  That view has now been turned on its head and greater efforts are being made to encourage a higher consumption of milk.  The main reason for our high consumption of milk was the structures set up.  The work of the milk boards cannot be ignored.  I take this opportunity to thank the staff of the milk boards for their good work and all those involved in milk recording, AI service and so on.  We all recognise that the Minister and his staff experienced difficulties in finding ways to wind up those boards and this is a traumatic time for all those involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister said yesterday that in certain circumstances the terms and conditions of employment of staff include a right to return to employment in the public sector.  I hope for the sake of the employees in the Dublin District Milk Board this is correct.  Maybe the Minister knows something I do not know about the regulations governing the return of staff to employment in the Civil Service.  I have sought to make representations on behalf of numerous <Col N="1827" /> people who will be affected by the proposed closure of the milk boards to give them an opportunity to return to work.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I received a letter from the Minister for Finance in which he said he was satisfied that the practice of reinstatement must be terminated as he could not continue to operate a scheme which had been declared to be discriminatory, contrary to both national and European law, and that, accordingly, a line has been drawn on 23 July 1993, the date on which the Labour Court issued its determination, after which no applications for reinstatement could be considered.  Perhaps the Minister would check that from the point of view of his own legal situation and that of his employees.</P>
    <P>In regard to the disposal of the milk boards, who will be the buyer?  How will the Minister deal with the sale and disposal of the assets, because this will have major implications down the line for the farming community?  There is great anxiety also among farmers, particularly in the northern part of the country, about the implications for our national herd of importing breeding stock from other parts of Europe.</P>
    <P>This Bill is supposed to guarantee farmers' incomes and the supply of milk to the main areas of population over the next few years.  There is no doubt that the milk board has relevance to the supply of milk to Dublin and Cork. However, areas like Monaghan and many other parts of the country have never had a problem in producing the necessary supplies outside the regulation.  It must be remembered that Monaghan and other areas have at least a six months winter and animals must be fed quite liberally through that period.  We were, therefore, justified in having an all year supply and did not have the same difficulties in keeping up our quotas for lack of milk production as other counties.  Although we suffer the severe disadvantage of a six months winter we are still not declared severely handicapped.  Perhaps that might be rectified in another forum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1828" /> Under EU regulations inspectors visit farmers to ensure implementation of the regulations.  Could matters not be streamlined to avoid introducing another layer of inspectors?  People in the industry are tied up in red tape.  We appreciate the need to make this work, but could there not be some degree of cross-use of inspectors to avoid the time of personnel in these industries being taken up with unnecessary form-filling and bureaucracy?  The EC introduced enough red tape, let us not produce more.  I beg the Minister to take that into account.</P>
    <P>I now come to the levy of 0.25 pence. Will the Minister give an assurance that this will be the permanent level or will this levy be introduced in 1995, increased in 1996 and thus be just another means of extracting money from farmers?  We often hear complaints from the PAYE workers.  I know complaints are justified from the amount of tax deducted from my salary every month.  However, farmers pay a lot of levies for services relating to disease eradication etc., and such levies have increased enormously.  Often an animal that is put down because of brucellosis or TB is worth little more than the levies paid for services at factory level.  I want an assurance that this levy is not the start of a roller-coaster which will cause enormous problems for farmers in the long term.</P>
    <P>The question of the election of the board is also of interest.  I note that boards can nominate members and that there will even be elected members at producer level.  I agree with all this and congratulate the Minister on it. However, in the case of boards like CBF and An Bord Bia which have real decision-making powers, there were political appointees.  It is strange then that having gone to all this trouble &mdash; and I applaud him for it &mdash; in regard to An Bord Bia, to which farmers pay enormous sums of money, the Minister had to have complete control and no producer or other member of the industry could be allowed to represent their <Col N="1829" /> sector on the board; they are represented on the auxiliary boards but not where it really counts.  Perhaps even at this late stage the Minister will reconsider the method of electing board members in the future to take account of the payments made and services rendered by those board members. Much can be learned from the discussion on these issues.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Leonard mentioned our difficulties in County Monaghan when Premier Dairies and Dundalk and District Milk Board decided to dump their surplus in Monaghan and we were not allowed to fight back legally. At that time there were major discounts to Dunnes Stores etc.  It is unfortunate this board seems to have little power in that area.  This could mean that all the areas I covered earlier such as roundsmen could be eliminated if these stores decide, as they did in the past, to undercut the price of milk, to use it as a leader to bring in customers to the cost of the long term structures of the industry. There is nothing in the Bill to cover that.</P>
    <P>There are very good structures in this industry.  Most milk produced, for liquid milk consumption or otherwise, is of a very high quality.  Deputy Leonard mentioned the production of Bailey's.  There is also Emmet's cream which is produced in the Cavan-Monaghan area. These products are leaders not only in the milk market but in the Irish export field.  We are doing extremely well in the American and other markets.  Tribute must be paid to the producers.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill, when passed, will be used in a reasonable manner.  The Northern Ireland milk supply should be taken into account.  The town of Monaghan uses much of that milk for manufacturing purposes and I have no doubt much of it goes further south during the winter to supply liquid milk markets. There are implications and the Minister will have to be very vigilant that the Bill is used in a proper fashion and does not act against the best interests of farmers and the processing sector.</P>
    <Col N="1830" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Chathaoirligh, for standing in for me and allowing me to make a brief contribution.  I am similarly thankful to my colleague, Deputy Michael Ferris, for his unselfish gesture in giving me his time slot &mdash; I know his time is precious.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with the establishment of the National Milk Agency which will regulate the supply of milk for liquid consumption.  The Bill is required because the previous system under which the supply of liquid milk to the Dublin and Cork areas was regulated by the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards was deemed invalid under Community law.  It also arises because of the need to put in place arrangements to ensure a year round supply of liquid milk throughout the country.  It is a relatively short Bill which gives effect to these necessary changes and I heartily welcome it.</P>
      <P>Section 2 deals with the establishment of the agency and provides that it will be a body corporate with power to sue and be sued and to acquire, hold and dispose of land.  The Schedule to the Bill provides details of the operation and staffing of the agency.  While the Bill arises from an EC requirement to change the regulation procedures, the effect will be similar to that relating to other new bodies.  Similar Bills, for instance, to establish the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Roads Authority, involving the creation of a new body from various existing bodies were successfully steered through the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides for the regulation of the sale of liquid milk for consumption in the State.  It requires that the milk be purchased from a producer under a registered contract or from a registered processor and that it be heat treated in accordance with the Milk and Dairies Act.  These provisions, if properly applied and monitored by the agency, will be welcomed by consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 which deals with the registration of contracts provides for a 12 month unbroken period in specific conditions regarding the quality and supply <Col N="1831" /> of milk and compensation to the producer for untreated milk supplied during the year.  I welcome the provisions which ensure that account is taken particularly of winter months and the economic cost of producing milk of a suitable quality, which is vitally important.</P>
    <P>The agency will be funded by a levy payable by processors, the rates of the levy to be specified by the Minister on the establishment of the agency.  Section 17 provides that the moneys so collected will be deposited in a fund from which the expenses of the agency will be paid and any balance remaining invested.  It follows, therefore, that the rate of levy will be related to the anticipated cost of the agency.  It is important that all processors are fully aware of the funding arrangements of the agency.  The Minister has rightly provided in section 17 that the annual report of the agency be laid before the House and that its accounts be open for inspection by all persons for a small fee.</P>
    <P>The provisions in sections 10 and 11 on the keeping of records and publication of contents of registers will be welcomed by all those involved in that there will be open and fair management of the agency's operations, which is essential.  The provisions in section 13 deal with the alteration or cancellation of registration.</P>
    <P>As there is no specific section dealing with offences I presume the Minister is satisfied that an entry in the register procured through fraud or misrepresentation is adequately dealt with through other laws.  Perhaps he will elaborate on this matter when replying.  The Minister has provided very well for notice of cancellation, inquiries and appeals.  These may appear to be standard provisions but they are vitally important for the successful operation of the agency and its ongoing work.</P>
    <P>I received, as I am sure did all my colleagues, a letter from the National Liquid Milk Committee of the IFA outlining its views.  It indicates it strongly <Col N="1832" /> supports the Bill and that is encouraging.  I am sure the Minister was furnished with a copy of this correspondence.  In this era of social partnership agreements and consultation processes, I have little doubt the Minister will take serious cognisance of the concerns expressed and the emphasis placed on various aspects of the Bill by this committee which represents a very important part of this sector, the producers.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the staffing arrangements of the milk boards.  I know the Minister has approached this whole issue in a very caring, responsible way. Regardless of how we approach the matter we must allay the concern of the employees of this organisation and assure their future.  The Minister elaborated on the measures he has taken and I thank him for this.  He stated: &ldquo;To facilitate this sale, it was obvious that the staffing situation would have to be rationalised&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; carries a certain significance and can send shivers up the spine of the most courageous people.  I emphasise that a shiver has been sent up the spine of these employees.</P>
    <P>In this regard I had a traumatic experience when I earned my livelihood in a semi-State organisation when it introduced a major rationalisation programme.  Although they had set out to make it their career, former colleagues of mine had to leave and make other arrangements for themselves and their families.  I had to console members of my staff in that organisation when they bit the dust under this rationalisation programme.  &ldquo;Trauma&rdquo; is, therefore, a word I would use.  It is essential that a caring approach is adopted during the entire process.  People have sore memories of other rationalisation programmes which did not work and under which undertakings were allegedly given by Ministers which were not honoured.  This adds to the trauma and the uncertainty.  The B &amp; I fiasco has lingered for years and we do not want a repetition.</P>
    <P>My constituency colleague, Deputy <Col N="1833" /> Kavanagh, is in the House and I have no doubt that he will address this aspect of the legislation in his contribution. Many of the staff live in my constituency and I am aware that they have been very dedicated in providing ancillary services such as artificial insemination.  During the years they built up relationships with farmers and have provided a personal service.  They will be sadly missed.  It will leave a void in the lives of some of the people to whom I am referring.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>After protracted negotiations between my Department and the union representing the staff, an agreement was reached, in January this year, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, which fully protects the employees' interests in the context of the boards' abolition and the sale of their ancillary business.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that under the terms of the agreement some staff will be retained while others will transfer to the private sector.  Some members of the staff will also be granted voluntary early retirement.  I thank the Minister for giving those undertakings but notwithstanding this I reiterate that there is fear and uncertainty.  I received a letter on 3 October from a Mr. Fintan Clarke who is one of the people who provided the personal service to which I referred.  He stated that he is concerned not only about himself but about his colleagues.  What they are seeking is protection and security.  I have little doubt that this was uppermost in the minds of the Minister and his excellent Minister of State who I am sure is listening attentively to what is being said about this important aspect in the debate.</P>
    <P>This short Bill has been well drafted and is well intentioned.  I congratulate the Minister and his Minister of State for this and I have no doubt they will give serious consideration to this matter which affects the livelihoods of so many people about whom I am concerned.  It <Col N="1834" /> is vitally important that these people are given cast iron assurances.  Given their efforts and dedication during the years they deserve this courtesy and commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill, 1994, and congratulate the Minister on the way in which he has processed the Bill through his Department and the Seanad where it passed all Stages on 5 July.  The legislation has been improved since it was initiated there; this is a tribute to the quality of the debate in that House.  This ensures that its passage through this House will not be hindered or interrupted.  As other speakers said, all those involved in the milk assembly business, producers and processors, have welcomed the legislation which is required to regulate, by way of licence, the supply and processing of this valuable product.</P>
      <P>As a rural Deputy, I am aware of the importance of milk production in my constituency of Tipperary South and to the national economy.  The term &ldquo;heat-treated milk&rdquo; has a broader interpretation than its original meaning and includes flavoured and fortified milks. Diversification in the market has led to a need for new definitions.  All types of drinking milk need to be of a consistently high quality.  The Bill provides for the registration of contracts between milk processors and producers to ensure a constant supply of quality raw milk. The consumer demand for drinking milk of varying fat content levels has to be met.  The Bill requires that heat-treated solid milk be prepared from &ldquo;raw milk&rdquo; purchased from a producer under a registered contract.  The tightening up of the legal arrangements for the supply of milk is widely welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the dissolution of the district milk boards in Cork and Dublin and for the establishment of the National Milk Agency which will function throughout the country as a whole. Previous speakers have referred to the <Col N="1835" /> existing staff who worked under the old structures and it is appropriate to put on record our appreciation of the dedication of the Minister of State to ensuring that staff were redeployed or paid adequate compensation for their services down the years.  Thankfully, agreement has been reached through the Labour Relations Commission on the settlement of all staff claims.  If one does not have industrial peace during a period of change, it makes the change very difficult.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Crawford's concern about appointments to the board of national bodies.  The composition of the board of the new agency is good.  Farming organisations are normally consulted and asked to advise on the suitability of appointees.  The IFA and ICMSA expressed their resentment to me and to others on being bypassed when appointments were made to An Bord Bia.  I have made representations directly to the Minister concerned.  It is appropriate to commend the Minister when we agree with the structure put in place as well as reminding him that it should be used more widely and should certainly have applied to An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>The IFA has lobbied us &mdash; Deputies and Senators appreciate such organisations' assistance in identifying areas where there may be problems &mdash; but in this case the farming organisations are in full support of the Bill and commend that we expedite its passage.  They specify the reasons for their welcome.  In one of their submissions they state that to become a liquid milk producer a dairy farmer must commit himself to delivering a specific proportion of his milk supply at specified times of the year.  This means that whereas a manufacturing milk producer relies on low cost grass-based production and spring calving &mdash; which is the normal farm enterprise in Ireland &mdash; a liquid supplier has to adapt calving and feeding patterns and procedures to achieve the required all year round supply.  One has to be mindful of the additional demands we are making of liquid milk suppliers <Col N="1836" /> as well as the extra costs involved in the production of milk when grass is not growing.  The cows have to be fed specialised quality feeds as well as vitamins and other additives to ensure that the quality of the milk produced during this time will be of the highest quality to meet the standard required by EU requirements on somatic cell counts, and so on.  The IFA and the ICMSA are aware of the demands being made.  No other sector has had to make as many changes as the farming community and it has adapted product supply and production to meet the requirements of EU legislation.  The processing industry has also changed dramatically but at tremendous cost.</P>
    <P>The importance of the milk assembly industry cannot be overestimated.  Milk is a natural product and has wonderful potential for added value.  The importance of milk to a rural constituency cannot be over-emphasised.  I represent a rural constituency in South Tipperary and a small co-operative creamery, Tipperary Co-operative, through its dynamic management spearheaded by Mr. Noel Horgan and his staff has put a relatively small co-operative at the top of the league.  In 1993 its total milk take was 35 million gallons and it had a turnover of £59 million.  It has a subsidiary in France, Tippogral, which manufactures speciality cheeses such as Gouda, Edam and Ementhal.  This co-operative gives tremendous employment as well as an assured outlet to producers.  The co-operative has total sales outside Ireland of £41 million, of which £28 million is within the Community and a further £13 million sales to markets outside the Community.  This gives an idea of the importance of the industry.  The co-operative employs 180 people and the total wage bill is £3.8 million annually.</P>
    <P>Factories set up by multinational companies are important but the processing of a natural indigenous product is equally important in terms of creating employment.  I have given an indication of the importance of milk as a product. At times we treat it as if it were an illegal spirit.  We penalise people for <Col N="1837" /> over producing it.  We tell others that they are not to produce it.  Who would ever have thought ten or 15 years ago that we would treat production of milk in that fashion?</P>
    <P>Throughout my constituency which is within the Golden Vale and is often looked upon as being a wealthy farming area people work very hard.</P>

      <P>There is another factory in my constituency, Miloko in Carrick-on-Suir, which is not directly involved in the intake of milk but is a subsidiary of the Avonmore Group.  Carrick-on-Suir, like Tipperary, suffers from widespread unemployment and Miloko, under the expert management of Tom Casey and others, is also involved in products derived from milk which it buys in from places such as Ballyragget in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The Minister visited Miloko with me and he is familiar with that operation.  It is involved in a major research programme involving various by-products of milk.  It currently specialises in the area of dairy spreads and cheese analogue.  Miloko's total sales last year were approximately £13 million.  The company employs 50 or 60 people and has a wage bill of over £1 million.  It purchases approximately £3.7 million worth of the products that it adds value to from its sister factories in Ballyragget and elsewhere.  Since the change from casein production in this factory, the employees are aware, because of the products in which they are directly involved, of the primary needs of the consumer.</P>
      <P>This Bill addresses the consumer's needs.  It deals with the area of production and the producer because without the producer there is no product to sell and there can be no employment. Consumer demand would not be met and we would have to engage in the costly practice of importing most of our products from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many thousands of people involved in the milk assembly industry throughout the country.  We should pay <Col N="1838" /> tribute to those people who do not work five days per week, who do not work from nine to five but who work seven days per week at all hours of the day when the need arises.  They work longer hours out of season to match the challenges laid down in this Bill.  However, if those people have a reasonable recompense for their efforts, they are happier doing work than receiving hand-outs, whether from the EU or elsewhere.  They are special people. They are often looked upon as being very wealthy but they have capital investment tied up in animals and in the production and delivery process.  The producers have made all the changes required under EU legislation to meet the demands of a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a step forward.  It would be appropriate to commend the Minister on his efforts in this regard because this legislation has widespread support and acceptance in the community at large.  Ireland can be very proud of its green image and the quality of the food it produces whether manufactured or in the liquid milk area.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to contribute to the debate on this Bill because I want to voice some concerns which I am sure the Minister of State can allay.</P>
      <P>I accept the Bill is brought before the House because the EU has decided that milk processors in the Dublin and Cork areas are in contravention of EU rules. The milk boards have been carrying out their responsibilities for almost 50 years and they have worked well throughout those years in guaranteeing supplies of milk to Cork and Dublin.  They have also ensured that the milk supplied is of the highest quality and that the guarantee of price to the consumer and to the producer has worked well over the years.  It is appropriate to acknowledge that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the Labour Party I am a little concerned that we are introducing a Bill which privatises a State board.  I realise this has been brought about because the EU has decided that <Col N="1839" /> we are in contravention of directives and regulations.  Nevertheless, it is unfortunate that a board which has worked well over the years is now to be privatised but I must accept that the Minister has offered guarantees to the suppliers, the consumers and the staffs of the boards and that is all he can do in the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The area in which I am most familiar with the operation of the company is the Dublin district.  I am not as familiar with the operation in the Cork area.  This morning the Minister stated that the sales area in Dublin city and county, together with the urban district of Bray, was covered by the former milk board. I can assure the Minister that the area was much wider.  Not only did the board supply milk, it also operated the AI and the milk board stations in Wicklow town and had responsibility for milk supplies to the whole county.  Most of the liquid milk sales in the county come from the Dublin suppliers so this will have a major effect across the constituency I represent.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill causes me some concern which I hope the Minister can allay.  I hope the Bill will ensure a guarantee of supply to the areas I mentioned.  I am sure I speak for my colleagues in Cork as well as consumers in Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare from where the supplies come and the city based processors.  I hope the pricing regime that has operated in the past will be assured to the people of those areas.</P>
    <P>I was concerned lately about a report that the passage of this Bill will mean that liquid milk may be exported to the European mainland and to Great Britain.  If that were to happen, I hope there would not be a shortage of milk for consumers here.  When shortages occur, the price goes up and if milk is directed to other areas outside the country prices could increase.  If there is an over supply of milk it is appropriate that we should look for markets abroad.</P>
    <P>I hope control will continue to be exercised over the pricing and supply of milk to ensure sufficient supplies for <Col N="1840" /> those who have no alternative but to have it supplied from producers within the milk board areas.  Liquid milk is on sale in supermarkets and we are all happy to purchase it cheaply.  On occasion they have entered into milk price wars which adversely effect milk suppliers and door to door deliveries. There are no local dairies in areas such as County Wicklow and people depend on door deliveries.  We may obtain a short term benefit from a milk price war in supermarket chains but prices would soon rise with competition.</P>
    <P>The House has been concerned about the treatment of staff when changes occur in semi-State companies.  We made our arguments about the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs when it was divided into boards. The impetus for ensuring that staff were well looked after under the Bill came from my party.  However, there is lack of consideration for the staff who will be displaced under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that under the terms of the staff agreement five or six of them will be required for the new milk agency &mdash; there are 170 people involved in the operation of the board &mdash; provided that sufficient numbers of suitably qualified candidates apply for the posts.  I doubt if the Minister will have a problem getting five or six suitably qualified candidates from a staff of 170.  He said 70 per cent of the staff will transfer to the private sector on the sale of the ancillary businesses as going concerns.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals mainly with the supply of milk and EU objections to the milk boards.  The EU directive does not appear to refer to ancillary services such as AI stations and other technical and professional advice given to the agricultural community.  Will the Minister clarify if that is at variance with EU law? The majority of staff were involved in the ancillary services.  The Minister stated that the 70 per cent of the staff who will transfer to the private sector will have safeguards in their conditions and terms of employment including, in certain circumstances, a right to return <Col N="1841" /> to employment in the public sector. That must be made clear by amending the Bill or explaining the phrase.  I do not see any reference in section 4 which reflects the commitments given by the Minister.  In the past, Ministers gave strong assurances in the House but the best assurance is to reflect it in the Bill. Such assurances were written into the superannuation sections of the Bills dealing with An Post and Telecom Éireann.  Section 4 is weak in that regard.</P>
    <P>The agreement also provides that 50 staff will be guaranteed voluntary early retirement on terms similar to those which applied in the public service in 1987-88.  I am informed by some of those concerned about the passage of the Bill that highly qualified people with great expertise in the ancillary services have been told they may take early retirement but if they are employed by those who will operate the ancillary services they will have to give up their pension.  Normally I would agree that if a person takes early retirement they should not take up employment and so deprive someone else of a job but where a person has particular knowledge and skills it is difficult to prove the argument that they should not work again on the basis that they would lose their entitlements.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Bill must be introduced given the EU directive but I am concerned for consumers and producers who may be caught up in a price war. The best way to reassure the staff that they need not fear the passage of the Bill is to ensure adequate guarantees are written into it such as was the case on the establishment of An Post and Telecom Éireann.  This would strengthen the Bill and reflect a caring approach by the Government to those who must accept privatisation of the boards with the consequent loss of employment certainty as public sector employees.  The assurances given by the Minister must be reflected in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Kirk.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1842" /> The dissolution of the Dublin and Cork district milk boards, and their associated and ancillary business, enables the establishment of a national milk agency and, at the same time, provides employees of the old boards with the guarantees commensurate with their previous occupation.  I am sure the Minister will take on board the concerns expressed by Deputies Jacob and Kavanagh about this point.</P>
    <P>We now have an opportunity, perhaps with a nudge from the EU, to put the liquid milk sector on a proper footing.  The new agency will ensure that liquid milk producers have a legal recognition and protection for their products.  Liquid milk producers operate under different criteria from their counterparts in the manufactured milk supply arena.  For example, they have greater costs, supply milk all year round and have to meet strict health regulations in regard to bacterial count, somatic count, the conditioning of milking parlours, etc.  We are fortunate to have a very high quality liquid milk product.  I note the definition of &ldquo;heat treated milk&rdquo; has been extended to include flavoured and fortified milks. This is a step in the right direction. Given the welcome news of a ceasefire by loyalist paramilitaries, perhaps one day there will be an all-Ireland milk supply agency.</P>
    <P>We are high consumers of milk in the European and world league of consumption of milk <i>per capita.</i> Milk is a relatively cheap food which is suitable for the young, old and gravidas.  Some people might quibble about giving milk to babies during the first year of their lives, but there is no better liquid product for older children.</P>
    <P>The new agency will take cognisance of liquid milk supply throughout the year and will record and police the industry.  I hope that this will prevent dumping on the market.  The Bill deals with transfers and the duration of contracts.  The agency will be self-financed through the imposition of a levy on the industry.  I am sure the Minister has taken note of the concerns expressed by <Col N="1843" /> Deputy Crawford in this respect.  The imposition of the levy will mean that neither the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry nor the Minister for Finance will have to worry about financing the agency.  The setting up of the agency represents a new move in terms of liquid milk supply and I am glad the main farming organisations have welcomed it.  I commend the Minister on bringing forward the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This Bill has been awaited with anticipation for some time.  I will not repeat the points made by previous speakers, but we are all aware of the necessity for this legislation and the difficulties experienced by the Dublin and Cork district milk boards which fulfilled a vital role during the development of the dairy sector.  It is vitally important to have an all year round supply of liquid milk and an agency which will ensure a regular supply of top quality liquid milk.</P>
      <P>Those of us from a rural setting know that the dairy industry is no different from the beef industry &mdash; it experiences the same problems in terms of seasonality of supply.  It is clearly much cheaper to produce milk during spring, summer and autumn when cows can graze in fields than during November, December and January, hence the necessity for an agency which will ensure that liquid milk is produced during these months.  Producers must be paid an adequate price for milk during the winter months if they are to stay in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dairy industry has a core of very committed liquid milk producers and has been totally transformed during the past 20 years.  Milk producers do not work sociable hours but those who do a good job get a reasonable return.  Due to the regular cashflow, milk producers have a higher viability threshold than many other smallholders in the agricultural sector.  If producers had been given an extra five or six years to expand before the introduction of the <Col N="1844" /> milk quota regime &mdash; introduced in 1983 &mdash; more employment could have been created in this sector and many small and fragmented holdings could have been made viable.  The various adjustments and reductions since 1983 have reduced the overall capacity of the industry to produce milk.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that an interim board would be established.  This is a wise decision as all boards have teething problems and the experience gained by the interim board will prove invaluable to the agency.</P>
    <P>Milk is one of the most wholesome and cheapest products available to consumers.  It compares very favourably with a pint of Guinness or Murphy's in terms of cost and benefit to the health and well-being of families.  Those involved in health fads tend to be critical of milk as a product.  It is very easy to be critical of milk but the reality is that it costs a lot in terms of time and effort to undo the damage caused by the utterances of somebody who purports to be an expert on the subject.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have constituents employed in the ancillary services will be aware of the implications of the changes.  The Minister said there had been prolonged negotiations and that a satisfactory arrangement had been arrived at.  I hope that is the position and that the interests of those employees who have served both the Dublin and Cork milk boards have been protected in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the disposal of the ancillary services.  As is normal in these circumstances I assume these will be put out for public tender.  Perhaps we should focus on that aspect and try to identify the problems, if any, which may arise from a new arrangement in the sector.  At least one group is anxious to acquire the ancillary services for the development of the dairy industry.  As in every case there will be, to a lesser or a greater extent, a vested interest involved.  I do not know if the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry wishes to retain any control over the ancillary services.  I am sure there are <Col N="1845" /> other mechanisms by which the Department will exercise control.</P>
    <P>It is important that the broad general self-interest of the dairy industry is protected.  It would not be advisable to have a new arrangement dominated by a particular group, whose primary aim might not necessarily be in the best interest of the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>It is important that individual farmers have access to the widest range possible of the best breeding stock.  The ordinary commercial dairy farmer accepts advice from Teagasc personnel or the cattle breeding station.  In some instances it may well be that the availability of breeding stock, through processing semen, may be restricted.  That is not desirable.  The sooner the better top sires for breeding are available to every farmer.</P>
    <P>The Bill is worth while.  I am confident that the milk agency will fulfil its role in ensuring an adequate supply of liquid milk.  It would be very serious if there were shortages.  There is of necessity a need for planning in these matters and I am sure the licensing arrangement provided for in the Bill will ensure that a constant and adequate supply of liquid milk will be available for households in all areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to Deputies' contributions to this debate.  The high level of support the Bill has received is most encouraging.  I should like to reply to some of the remarks and to questions raised during the course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Avril Doyle's queries, I would point out that this Bill is not a further contribution to the corpus of milk supply regulations and price legislation which commenced in 1936 and was last amended in 1967 and under which the present milk boards' regime functions.  The Bill will repeal all that legislation and clear the way for the abolition of the milk boards.  It will also open the way for the establishment of the new national milk agency which will <Col N="1846" /> have a key role in regulating the supply of drinking milk but it will have nothing to do with the fixing of price.  This point was raised by my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, as well as by Deputy Seymour Crawford.  In regard to liquid milk there is no price control regime in operation.  If difficulties arise in relation to the market they will be referred to the Office of Consumer Affairs.  This legislation marks the beginning of something new and is not the last chapter in some long running saga.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies expressed concern about the future of staff transferring to the private sector.  I can assure the House that the agreement reached is most satisfactory.  The Minister gave an outline of the arrangements yesterday. They involve recruitment, where possible, for the agency from existing staff of the boards; an offer of voluntary early retirement to some 50 or more on terms similar to those which applied in the public service in 1987-88 and the transfer to the private sector of those remaining in the ancillary business.  Those who transfer in this way will have the right to be re-employed in the public sector in the event of their being subsequently made redundant due to rationalisation or business failure.  In this connection pay scales have been linked to those in the Civil Service.  They will return with the same pay relativity and to work as close as possible in nature to that which they had when they left.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh raised the issue of the rights of staff transferring to the public sector.  These are set out in a written agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.  There is no need to include them in the Bill.  The agreement reached is binding and fully protects the rights of employees.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed about the impact of this measure on imports of drinking milk, particularly from Northern Ireland.  I wish to make it abundantly clear that the Bill does not have the slightest effect on imports of milk.  Milk legally imported into the State is specifically excluded.  Trade in <Col N="1847" /> milk and milk products, within the European Union is governed by the provisions of Council Directive 92/46/EEC and, provided milk and milk products conform to the standards of that directive, their freedom of movement on the internal market cannot be regulated by the national legislation of any member state.  The definition of &ldquo;heat treated milk&rdquo; for the purpose of this Bill is based largely on the definition of Council Directive 92/46/EEC and includes not only pasteurised milk but also UHT and sterilised milk.</P>
    <P>In regard to the need for an efficient and cost effective pattern of milk collection and transportation this is essentially a matter for the industry to address.  The industry is well aware of the desirability, not to say the necessity, for rationalisation and considerable progress has been made on that front.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the debate to the promotion of milk and milk products.  This is carried out in Ireland by the National Dairy Council.  I am pleased that the industry has agreed to continue to finance these programmes once the EU co-responsibility levy is ended. Deputy McManus referred to the fear of a closed shop.  The key function of the agency is to regulate the supply of liquid milk for consumption.  If this is to be a realistic objective the people involved must have a stake in the business.  It is not sensible or appropriate to provide for the election to the agency of parties who may have no knowledge or interest in the trade.  As new producers will be registered they will be automatically entitled to vote so that it cannot be realistically regarded as a closed shop.</P>
    <P>Deputies Crawford and Ferris raised the method of appointment to the new milk agency and to An Bord Bia and specifically referred to the concern of farming organisations that there was no provision to allow them direct representation on the board of An Bord Bia.  I will reiterate what I said during the debate on those two Bills in the Dáil and Seanad.  The new board will deal <Col N="1848" /> with market development and promotion of Irish produce.  The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the fact that we can no longer rely on intervention as a market outlet means that to sell our basic produce we must move rapidly down the value added agenda.  The operational programme awaiting final approval takes cognisance of that.  Effectively, we were putting in place a marketing board and it would not be practicable for any group to have the right of direct representation on it. It should be stressed, however, that the subsidiary board which will be set up &mdash; which will be the existing CBF board &mdash; will have the direct nomination sought by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>The interim board appointed by the Government has been well received across the industry.  Producers have been appointed to it, albeit those involved are the chairpersons of two of the largest food co-operatives in the country.  It was made clear in the debate that there would not be vocational representation on the board and that the Government would appoint the people best qualified to implement the policies and structures necessary to expand the food industry market and, more importantly, create jobs &mdash; an issue which underlines all Government policy.  It was obvious that we needed to broaden and extend markets for the sale of Irish food products as rapidly and as effectively as possible.  The Government has taken the correct approach on this matter and there is widespread support for the board.</P>
    <P>The selection procedures for board membership of the new National Milk Agency were also raised.  This has been the subject of much consultation with all involved and I am satisfied that those appointed will be the best qualified for the job.  The Bill provides that the appropriate number of processor, producer, distributor and consumer members shall be appointed to the agency.  While an understanding has been reached by administrative means as to the number of each who shall be <Col N="1849" /> appointed to the agency, it is not considered necessary or appropriate to set out those numbers in the Bill.  It is more appropriate to leave room for discretion and flexibility.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with Deputy Kavanagh's point regarding the inclusion of the provisions of the agreement and I sympathise with the staff concerns and uncertainties expressed by Deputies Kavanagh and Jacob.  The agreement with staff provides that a person who takes voluntary redundancy cannot take up similar work with the new private sector employer.  It would be difficult to justify any other provision.  Deputy Kavanagh also raised the matter of the re-employment of a person who retires.  The agreement states that, having regard to Government policy in the areas of unemployment and job creation, it would be difficult to justify public sector employees who availed of the voluntary retirement scheme resuming employment with the new private sector employer.  The officials will take all possible steps to ensure that such a scenario does not arise.  Where a person is re-employed in a post to which an appointment could have been made by the milk boards prior to rationalisation, voluntary early retirement pensions will be suspended. I will be happy to discuss the specific points raised by the Deputy in that regard prior to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies Crawford and Kavanagh raised the retail price of milk.  Indications of unfair trading policies would be a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Deputy Jacob raised penalties. There is provision for penalties for contravening the provisions of the Bill and, obviously, the nature and extent of them would depend on the nature of the contravention.  Fines of up to £1,000 will be imposed for selling heat treated milk in breach of section 5 and fines of up to £500 will be imposed for making a false return to the agency.  Deputy Crawford expressed concern that imported milk would not be covered by the new agency.  Under the European Union <Col N="1850" /> Single Market, such milk cannot be covered by the agency.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies are aware that the standards set under Directive No. 92/46 include structural standards for on-farm dairy facilities.  To assist farmers achieve those standards a generous scheme of grant aid was introduced on 1 September last, providing aid of up to 60 per cent for a wide range of building works and dairying equipment.  Deputy Crawford raised the possible duplication of inspectors.  The inspectorate employed by the milk agency will comprise a small core of staff who will travel around the country to ensure that the returns made by processors to the agency in respect of milk sales and so on are correct and that the terms set out in the contracts registered with the agency are adhered to.  Their function will be essentially auditorial, they will not duplicate the work of another inspectorate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk and others raised the sale or disposal of assets.  The Minister has made it clear that the disposal of the ancillary business of the milk boards will be on the basis of sale by public tender.  Deputy Crawford raised the question of a levy on milk producers.  Under the existing milk boards, the levy is 0.8262p per gallon.  Under the new agency it will be considerably less.  It will be set initially by the Minister and thereafter by the agency with the Minister's consent.  Because the agency will be a small body with a defined role, the fears expressed by the Deputy that the levy will continue to increase are unfounded.  Deputy Kavanagh expressed concern about the milk shortages.  The main objective of the Bill is to provide for an adequate supply of liquid milk.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and for their general support for the Bill which I commend to the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to promote confidence among people investing in Irish companies.  The Central Bank will be given a role in monitoring and supervising the operation of the Irish Stock Exchange and any future stock exchanges.  The Central Bank will be given powers not only to approve rules, a power which is held already by the Minister for Finance, but power to initiate changes in the rules of stock exchanges.  Reports of disciplinary proceedings by the Stock Exchange will be passed to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and they can be published if they deem it appropriate.  The board of the Exchange will be more broadly based with representation on it by Exchange members, users of the Exchange and sufficient independent members to promote the public interest and protection of investors.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House today is the first major legislation relating to the Stock Exchange in almost 200 years.  It establishes the Central Bank as the regulatory authority for the Irish Stock Exchange and for any future stock exchanges that may be established here, also for the member firms of exchanges regulated under the Bill.  The Bill also meets obligations under the European Union Investment Services and capital adequacy directives in respect of Stock Exchange member firms.  It does not deal with futures and options exchanges such as IFOX and FINEX: these are already regulated by the Central Bank under the Central Bank Act, 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1852" /> The existing basic legislation on the Stock Exchange, the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, was enacted by the old Irish Parliament in 1799; this is being repealed and we all agree it is about time it was done.  The present Bill replaces it with an entirely new supervisory system, under which the Central Bank as the supervisory authority will have substantial powers concerning both the initial authorisation of stock exchanges and member firms and their ongoing supervision.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that this Bill replaces the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, 1799.  It would be proper to recall briefly for the House the circumstances of the passing of that Act by the old Irish Parliament. The Act was passed in the year between two landmark events in Irish history, the Rebellion of 1798 and the Act of Union of 1800.</P>
    <P>The 1799 Act was introduced in April of that year by the Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer, Isaac Corry, and by John Claudius Beresford, who, though without formal office, organised House of Commons business on behalf of the Government.  Beresford was a property developer who laid out large parts of the north side of Dublin and was prominent in attracting James Gandon to Ireland as architect for the Custom House.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies will no doubt be encouraged to hear that the 1799 Bill was amended on its second reading and reintroduced in late April with Beresford and Sir William Newcomen, the founder of Newcomen's Bank, as sponsors.  It received the Royal Assent in June 1799.  The newly-established Stock Exchange began to operate in September 1799 and moved to the Commercial Buildings in Dame Street in November 1799.  This was an appropriate move in the context of the Bill now before the House, because the site of the Commercial Buildings is now occupied by the Central Bank.  Later, of course, the Stock Exchange moved to Anglesea Street, where it has operated for over 100 years.</P>
    <P>The old Irish Parliament, no more <Col N="1853" /> than this Parliament, was noted for its characters.  Time permits mention only of two: Boyle Roche, who wondered why we should do anything for posterity, since posterity has done nothing for us, and Henry Grattan, a man whose reputation was so high that the Irish Parliament from 1782 to the Union is dignified by his name.  It was said of him after his death that he thought only of Ireland and lived for no other object; it seems a pity to have to record that Isaac Corry, the Chancellor of the Exchequer who introduced the 1799 Act, fought a duel with Henry Grattan in 1800 after they had exchanged acrimonious words in Parliament.  I trust there will be no such recurrence between myself and Deputy Yates during this debate.</P>

      <P>As a socialist I am in a peculiar position introducing legislation on the Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>Since I mentioned the long interval since the existing stock exchange legislation was passed, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the various stock exchanges and their member firms which have operated in Ireland, and most particularly to the Dublin Stock Exchange which has survived through the decades, now known as the Irish Stock Exchange.  It is no secret that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, has not always seen eye to eye with the exchange, but its long record of achievement must, nevertheless, be acknowledged.  The Stock Exchange has generated capital for industry and helped to meet the funding requirements of Governments down through the years. The Stock Exchange and its members could not have survived through nearly two centuries without a considerable capacity to adapt to changing circumstances while meeting the fundamental requirement of maintaining investor confidence in their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, the passage of time <Col N="1854" /> since 1799, especially in the area of financial markets, means that an entirely new regulatory environment is now necessary for the Stock Exchange and member firms.  The 1799 Act is no longer adequate for modern conditions. The scale and complexity of events in 1799 bears no comparison to those of 1994.  To take one example, when the Act of Union came into effect in 1801, the funded public debt of Ireland stood at just less than £27 million; it is a little higher than that today.</P>
    <P>In the last decade, in particular, the whole financial services sector has been subject to revolutionary change. Deregulation, the removal of exchange controls and rapid technological advance have been to the forefront in this revolution.  Technology in particular has had a dramatic impact on the sector and it has facilitated the development of new and complex financial products. Where would RTE be if it could not broadcast pictures of fellows in shirt-sleeves sitting in front of computer screens &mdash; a graphic of the modern financial sector?  Within the European Union a new single market for financial services is being established.  The financial sector now operates on a global basis using instant communications.  Financial supervision standards are being intensified.  In these circumstances, the need for new legislation to replace an Act nearly 200 years old is abundantly clear.</P>
    <P>The new legislation also reflects the passage of two European Union directives.  The Investment Services Directive, which must be provided for in national legislation by 1 July 1995 and will apply fully from 31 December 1995, requires member states to ensure a common standard of regulation for investment firms and to take steps in relation to supervision of regulated markets, including stock exchanges.  The related Capital Adequacy Directive sets out the levels of capital which investment firms must have in relation to their business.  Legislation to implement these directives in respect of other <Col N="1855" /> investment intermediaries is being prepared and it will be introduced in the House in due course.  In the meantime, the Bill will meet our obligations in respect of stock exchange member firms arising under these two directives.</P>
    <P>The Investment Services Directive is based on EU-wide recognition of authorities granted by the home member state and on the principle of prudential surveillance by the competent authorities in the home member state in accordance with that member state's rules.  Investment firms which are authorised in one member state will, by virtue of that authorisation, be able to operate as investment firms in another member state.  This has been made possible by the fact that prudential standards will be sufficiently harmonised. The directive incorporates parallel measures to those contained in the first and second Banking Directives, namely conditions for granting authorisation to investment firms, vetting of main shareholders and provision for close collaboration among the supervisory authorities in the member states.</P>
    <P>Irish law needs to be updated to meet the requirements of the Investment Services Directive.  At present, the Irish Stock Exchange &mdash; which is the product of the amalgamation of the Dublin Exchange with certain provincial exchanges which existed in Ireland until comparatively recent times &mdash; is supervised as part of the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Limited.  This supervision is carried out under the rules of that exchange and also under local rules which apply to the Irish unit only and are agreed by the Minister for Finance.  While the Minister approves rule changes proposed by the Irish Stock Exchange, he has no right to initiate rule changes which he might consider desirable.  Otherwise the main requirement of the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, 1799, is that individuals selling gilts on commission have a licence to do so; in more modern times the licence requirement is met where a <Col N="1856" /> stockbroking firm employs a person who holds a gilt licence.  While I emphasise the high level of supervisory standards here, it is clear that the legislative arrangements I have outlined need substantial revision in order to conform with the Investment Services Directive. So much for the background of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the issue of insider trading.  Insider dealing is a matter for general company law, not for a Bill about stock exchange regulation, and, as Deputies will be aware, provisions to cover insider dealing are contained in the Companies Act, 1990.  I understand that the Company Law Review Group, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, is currently examining certain aspects of company law and that insider dealing is included in that examination.</P>
    <P>On the principles on which the Bill is based, I would single out four for particular mention.  The first is that the Government decided that the Central Bank should be the new regulatory authority for the Irish Stock Exchange and its member firms.  This decision is both logical and practical.  The bank already has considerable expertise in the area of regulation.  It is the regulatory authority for all Irish licensed banking institutions and its remit has been extended to the building societies in recent years.  In addition, the Central Bank Act, 1989 gave the bank supervisory responsibility for exchanges concerned with the selling of futures and options, such as the IFOX and now the FINEX exchanges.  The bank also plays an important role in the regulation of financial-service activity conducted from the highly successful International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill, therefore, I am building on a significant body of national law on the regulation of financial institutions and exchanges.  The bank has the expertise, the competence and the track record to supervise stock exchanges and their member firms.  In addition, the personnel of the bank have been actively preparing for their new <Col N="1857" /> role and have made a substantial contribution to the preparation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The second principle I want to highlight is that, because this area is of major interest to the public, I am providing a significant role for Ministers.  It is appropriate that, where necessary, the Ministers who have responsibility in this area should be able to set parameters within which the bank would operate. The Minister for Finance has a very direct involvement in the financial services sector; the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has responsibility for company law issues and has, of course, a particular interest in the access of Irish firms to capital.  Accordingly, section 28 provides that the Central Bank may be given guidelines by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to assist the bank in administering the system of regulation.  Such guidelines will only be issued where there is a perceived need to issue them in the public interest, but I am sure the House will agree it is proper that Ministers should have a role in this area.  Other sections of the Bill also provide a role for the two Ministers and I will refer to these when I am discussing the details.</P>
    <P>I should, however, emphasise that, apart from some relatively minor modification there will be no change in the existing responsibilities of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, in company law matters, on issues relating to corporate governance or in matters delegated to the Irish Stock Exchange concerning listing or other procedures set down in recent Acts or regulations.</P>
    <P>The third principle is that the fundamental objective has been to ensure that the Bill provides the necessary measures without being excessive.  The new legislation is designed to ensure that the Irish Stock Exchange will be regulated to the highest standards, but like stock exchanges all over the world it must be able to function with maximum efficiency in an increasingly complex environment.  Accordingly, the Bill does not supersede the highly <Col N="1858" /> developed supervision system which the Exchange already operates to ensure market surveillance.  It, however, gives the Central Bank all the necessary powers to monitor and supervise the Exchange's surveillance of the operations of its member firms and to lay down conditions and requirements which the Exchange and its member firms must meet.  Effectively, there is a strong element of self regulation here with the Central Bank overseeing the self regulation.</P>
    <P>The fourth principle, connected with the third is that stock exchanges must be more open to the concerns of users and the public than has been the case up to now.  Accordingly, the Bill provides that the board of directors of an exchange will have to be broadly based and the composition of the board will have to strike a balance between the interests of the member firms and users of the exchange, and the public interest. Furthermore, the board will have to include enough independent members to promote the protection of investors and the maintenance of proper standards of conduct and practice.  It is particularly important, as the Irish Stock Exchange de-couples from the London Stock Exchange that we have that protection available for members of the public and we establish and maintain confidence among people investing in companies in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>On the provisions, I emphasise that I do not propose to comment on each and every section, but rather to highlight for Deputies the main features of each Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into seven Parts. The first deals with general matters, while Parts II and III deal respectively with the approval of stock exchanges and the authorisation of member firms. These two Parts naturally contain many similar provisions.  Part IV contains detailed regulatory provisions governing stock exchanges and members firms. Part V concerns the duties of auditors, while Part VI deals mainly with large transactions in holdings of stock exchanges and member firms, with <Col N="1859" /> codes of conduct and with requirements relating to client moneys.  Part VII covers enforcement, offences and penalties.</P>
    <P>Part I contains standard general provisions about such matters as short title, commencement, repeals and expenses. In particular, section 2 empowers the Minister for Finance to appoint a day or days for the enforcement of the Bill or portions of it: this will enable its coming into effect to be synchronised with the separation of the Irish Stock Exchange from the London-based Stock Exchange of which it is now a part.  I expect this to happen in spring next year.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the definitions in the Bill.  The term used for stockbrokers is &ldquo;member firm&rdquo; and subsection (4) ensures that that term can include a partnership.  The definition of &ldquo;investment instruments&rdquo; goes beyond the range of instruments normally traded on the Stock Exchange because the legislation is intended to cover all the investment activities of stockbrokers, who may well deal in unit trusts and other forms of investment.  The definition of a stock exchange excludes futures and options exchanges, which are regulated under the Central Bank Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the approval and continuing supervision of stock exchanges.  Section 8 makes it an offence to establish or operate a stock exchange which has not been approved by the Central Bank.  Section 9 sets out the detailed requirements relating to approval.  These include satisfying the bank that the memorandum and articles of association and the rules of the proposed exchange are satisfactory and that the directors, managers and qualifying shareholders are suitable persons.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to a number of aspects of the approval of an exchange.  An exchange will be obliged to establish and maintain procedures to investigate complaints against both itself and its member firms.  In addition, the board of an exchange will have to be broadly based and be so composed <Col N="1860" /> as to secure a balance between the interests of the different member firms and users of the stock exchange, and the public interest.  It will be a matter for the Central Bank to satisfy itself that the board of the exchange has the required balance between members and non-members.</P>
    <P>I would also draw attention to the fact that the rules of a stock exchange must require a report to be drawn up on any disciplinary proceedings conducted by the exchange and that report must be sent to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment if the Minister for Finance, with the consent of his colleague, asks to see it.  The Minister for Finance will be entitled to lay such a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas if he and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment think it proper to do so having due regard to the exigencies of the common good and the rights of any person referred to in the report.  There is general agreement among Deputies on the need for greater transparency in the way stock exchanges are run and in their disciplinary proceedings; the provisions included will ensure transparency, while allowing the Exchange to continue to regulate its affairs on a dayto-day basis under the overall supervision of the bank.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Irish Stock Exchange will be deemed to be approved and will continue to operate, under the supervision of the Central Bank, during the interim period while it is seeking approval from the bank under this Bill.  Any changes to the memorandum and articles of association of an exchange or to its rules will have to be approved by the Central Bank and the bank will be able to require such changes.  Where the bank refuses to approve a stock exchange or to approve changes to its rules or memorandum and articles of association, the exchange will be entitled to appeal that decision to the Minister for Finance, who, with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, may grant the appeal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1861" /> The Central Bank may make its approval of exchanges subject to conditions either at the time of approval or afterwards.  Such conditions must not contravene guidelines which may be issued by the Minister for Finance with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  The exchange concerned will have the right to appeal a requirement or condition to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 14 sets out the circumstances in which the bank may revoke the approval of a stock exchange.  This will normally involve an application to the High Court for an order revoking approval.</P>
    <P>Section 15 obliges an approved stock exchange to maintain such books and records for such length of time as the bank may specify: failure to comply with this obligation will be an offence.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill opens with section 16.  This makes the Central Bank the competent authority in this State in respect of member firms for the purposes of the Investment Services and Capital Adequacy Directives.  The bank will be responsible for supervising all the investment activities of member firms, not just their stock exchange activities.</P>
    <P>The rest of Part III deals with the authorisation and regulation of member firms.  Section 17 makes it an offence to be a member firm of an approved stock exchange unless authorised by the Central Bank or by a competent authority in another member state.  Firms wishing to become authorised must apply to the bank.  The existing member firms of the Irish Stock Exchange will be able to continue to operate but will of course have to apply for authorisation to the Central Bank; they will stand approved, and be subject to Central Bank regulation, while the authorisation process is going on.  Like stock exchange approval, this process will include satisfying the bank as to the probity and competence of each of the managers and directors and the suitability of the larger shareholders.</P>
    <P>Any changes to the memorandum <Col N="1862" /> and articles of association of a member firm will have to be approved by the Central Bank and the bank itself will be able to require such changes.  Where the bank refuses to authorise a member firm or to approve a change a member firm wishes to make in its memorandum or articles of association, the member firm will have the right to appeal the bank's decision to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 22 enables the bank to make its authorisation of a member firm subject to conditions, either at the time of approval or afterwards.  Such conditions must not contravene guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  A member firm will have the right to appeal to the court against the imposition of any condition.  Section 24 sets out the circumstances in which the authorisation of a member firm can be revoked; as with exchanges, this will normally involve an application to the court for an order revoking the authorisation.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of Part III empower the bank to set out requirements as to the composition of a member firm's assets and liabilities so as to ensure the firm can meet its liabilities, and to require an authorised member firm wishing to establish a branch in another EU member state to give details of the proposed branch to the bank.  The bank may permit or prevent establishment of the branch; if the latter, the member firm concerned may appeal the bank's decision to the High Court.  Finally, section 27 obliges a member firm to keep books and records: failure to do so will be an offence.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with regulation and supervision.  Section 28 lays a general obligation on the bank to administer the system of regulation of approved stock exchanges and authorised member firms in accordance with the Bill in order to promote the proper and orderly regulation of such exchanges and member firms and the protection of investors.  As I mentioned earlier, the bank must carry out this function subject to any guidelines which <Col N="1863" /> may be issued to it by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>Section 29 empowers the bank to give directions to stock exchanges and member firms, both generally in the interests of proper regulation or investor protection and more specifically where it becomes apparent that a member firm is getting into difficulties.  The bank will be entitled to apply to the High Court for an order confirming a direction where it believes that the direction is not being complied with.  Detailed provisions relating to directions are included in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 31 and 32 relate to advertising by stock exchange and member firms and give the bank power to impose conditions and requirements relating to advertisements.  An agreement made as a result of an advertisement which contravenes conditions or requirements will be unenforceable unless the advertisement did not have a bearing on the agreement.  Both the bank and the Minister for Finance may require a stock exchange or member firm to display specified information on their premises.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill places significant obligations on the auditors of stock exchanges and member firms.  Auditors are particularly well placed to assess what is going on in a firm and the Bill requires auditors to inform the bank of any material irregularity which emerges in the course of their auditing work, including anything which would give reason to believe that a member firm has breached stock exchange rules, that it has contravened any condition or requirement imposed by the bank or that it has bogus hauliers on its books. An auditor who intends to resign or not to seek re-election as auditor must report that fact to the bank.  It will be an offence to mislead, deceive or refuse to co-operate with an auditor.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill opens with a provision which also deals with auditors. Section 36 enables the bank to appoint <Col N="1864" /> a second auditor where it has a substantial concern about the audited accounts of an approved stock exchange or member firm.  This will allow the bank to carry out further investigation of matters which arise in the course of the first audit.</P>
    <P>Section 37 contains provisions relating to disqualification from employment.  Where, on application by the bank, the High Court finds that a person is not suitable on grounds of probity to be an officer or employee of a stock exchange or member firm, it may direct the employer to dismiss that person. Where the court finds that a person is incompetent, it may direct that the person concerned be removed from a particular position, suspended or dismissed. A person who is the subject of such a direction may not be employed by a stock exchange or member firm, or by any other entity supervised by the bank, without the bank's consent.  A person who accepts employment in contravention of a direction will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>These are substantial powers but it is important to ensure that persons who are entrusted with the safekeeping and prudent management of the funds of others are above reproach.  Deputies will also observe that a direction in respect of any such person will be for the courts to decide, and that the person concerned may apply to the courts at any time for the direction to be revoked and may appeal to the court against any refusal by the bank to consent to their re-employment.</P>
    <P>Section 38 sets out the broad parameters for the codes of conduct which will govern how member firms do business with their clients.  This will normally be a matter for the rules of an exchange, but there is provision for the bank to draw up a code of conduct if an exchange does not draw up and maintain its own rules of conduct.  Stock exchange rules of conduct must of course meet the parameters laid down in the section as regards fair and honest dealing, acting with due care and diligence and making adequate disclosure <Col N="1865" /> of relevant information to clients.  The bank will be responsible for supervising compliance with rules of conduct by member firms operating here which have been authorised in another member state.</P>
    <P>Sections 39 to 49 deal with acquiring transactions, that is to say major changes in the ownership or control of exchanges and their member firms.  The purpose of these provisions is to enable the bank to prevent undue or excessive influence being gained over a stock exchange or member firm unless the bank is satisfied that that influence will not be harmful.  Section 51 provides that a member firm must inform a client of the details of any investor compensation scheme.  The Irish Stock Exchange already operates a compensation scheme but I am not making specific provision in this Bill for compensation because the Investor Compensation Directive is still being discussed at EU level.  Assuming the directive will have been finalised in time, however, I would propose to include whatever measures it requires, in relation both to stock exchange member firms and to other investment intermediaries, in investment intermediary legislation which is being prepared under the aegis of my Department at present.</P>
    <P>Section 52 sets out rules for the segregation of client funds and investment instruments.  It will be an offence not to comply with the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>Section 53 provides a warranty against liability for the Central Bank and the Stock Exchange in the exercise of their functions under this Bill.  The last section in Part VI relates to failed stock exchanges and member firms which did not comply with the obligations in the Bill to maintain proper books and records and safeguard clients' funds.  Where the High Court considers that such non-compliance contributed to the failure, it may declare an officer of the stock exchange or member firm personally liable for all or part of the failed entity's debts.  Similar provisions exist in company law and in <Col N="1866" /> the Building Societies Act, 1989, and I am sure Deputies will agree they are appropriate here, too.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill sets out the powers of authorised officers of the Central Bank, bank-appointed inspectors and inspectors appointed by the High Court. Authorised officers of the Central Bank will be empowered to enter premises to inspect documents and require explanations of such documents.  If a person refuses to comply with a request from an authorised officer, the court can be asked to make an order as to the information to be provided.  Similar provisions are included in the Insurance Act, 1989, in relation to officers authorised by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment; an authorised officer under this Bill will in addition be entitled to request a report on aspects of the business of an exchange or member firm.</P>
    <P>Sections 57 to 63 provide for the High Court, on the application of the bank, to appoint an inspector to investigate the affairs of a stock exchange or member firm.  In addition to having powers similar to those of an authorised officer, an inspector appointed by the court will be able to examine people on oath.  The High Court may publish, with or without omissions, the report of an inspector appointed by it.  A court inspector's report will be sent in full to the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment, who may decide to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 64 provides for the appointment of an inspector by the bank to investigate particular matters relating to an exchange or member firm, including their compliance with any requirements of this or any other Act or with stock exchange rules or codes of conduct.  The bank may publish, in whole or in part, the report of an inspector appointed by it, and must forward any such report in full to the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment, who again may decide to lay it before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 65 enables the bank to set up a committee to determine whether <Col N="1867" /> there has been a breach by a stock exchange or member firm of bank conditions or requirements.  Such a committee will have three members, drawn from a panel of seven to be nominated by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  If it finds there has been a breach, the committee may issue a reprimand or require payment of up to £500,000 by the exchange or member firm concerned to the bank.  It should be noted that this mechanism will only apply where the exchange or member firm agrees, and an exchange or member firm may appeal the determination of a committee to the court.  Where an exchange or member firm does not want the matter settled by a committee, the bank may apply to the court to make a determination, and the court may issue a reprimand or require payment of up to £500,000 to the bank by the exchange or member firm concerned.  Detailed provisions relating to committees appointed under section 65 are contained in the Second Schedule.  Such committees offer a mechanism whereby breaches of bank conditions and requirements can be speedily determined without the expense &mdash; on either side &mdash; of a High Court hearing.</P>
    <P>Sections 66 and 67 provide for an application for a search and seizure warrant by an authorised officer and for the admissibility of an inspector's report as evidence in civil proceedings, while sections 68 and 69 provide for legal professional privilege and for confidentiality of documents.  Section 70 sets out the penalties for offences committed under the Act.  The maximum penalty will be £1 million or ten years' imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to say a few words about future developments in the Irish Stock Exchange.  As I have mentioned earlier and is already well known, the Irish Stock Exchange will be separating next year from the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Limited of which it is at present a part.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1868" /> However, it is of course not intended that the benefits of the close collaboration that has existed between the two parts of the London-based exchange will be discontinued.  Close co-operation existed before the 1973 merger and will continue after separation.  A primary objective in the discussions between Dublin and London about separation was to maintain the closest possible links in future for the mutual benefit of both.  An agreement has been reached with the UK Securities and Futures Authority &mdash; SFA &mdash; the self-regulatory organisation responsible for regulating stockbrokers in the UK, to provide continuing advice and technical support to the Irish Stock Exchange in the initial period of separation.  In addition, the Irish Stock Exchange, in conjunction with users of the exchange, has commissioned a study of the future needs of the Irish equities market, including the question of whether linking with the planned CREST transaction settlements system which is being proposed in the UK is appropriate.  I understand that a final; decision is expected in the next couple of months.</P>
    <P>The Irish Stock Exchange will remain the competent authority for stock exchange listing in Ireland and will continue with its responsibilities under the Companies Acts, including those relating to insider trading.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment is considering what arrangements will be necessary to replace the functions at present carried out by the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers when the Irish and London exchanges separate.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention that my Department has of course consulted the Irish Stock Exchange in the preparation of this Bill.  I acknowledge the constructive contribution made by the Stock Exchange throughout this process.</P>
    <P>This Bill marks a radical departure for the regulation of stock exchanges and their member firms in Ireland.  It replaces legislation two centuries old with a modern regulatory framework.  It establishes the Central Bank as the regulatory authority, so bringing to bear <Col N="1869" /> the bank's wide experience of regulating banks, building societies and futures and options exchanges.  It provides a significant role for the two Ministers closely involved with the Stock Exchange, so ensuring that the legitimate concerns of the Oireachtas can find expression in the regulatory process as the need arises and as the public interest requires.  It enables the Stock Exchange to continue market surveillance, but under the overall supervision of the Central Bank, which will be equipped with all the necessary powers for carrying out its functions.  It meets obligations in respect of stock exchange member firms arising from the European Union Investment Services and Capital Adequacy directives.  It ensures that the Stock Exchange will be more open and transparent in the conduct of its business than has been the case up to now and that its board of directors will be representative of the users of the exchange and the public interest as well as of its members.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable the Exchange to continue to carry out its business in the most efficient way possible in an increasingly complex environment, while at the same time providing investors with the fullest confidence that the exchange is regulated to the highest standards.  This combination of freedom to transact business efficiently with high regulatory standards is vital to the survival and development of the Stock Exchange and its member firms.  I believe the Bill provides this combination and I am sure it will enable the Stock Exchange and its members to face the future with greatly increased confidence.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the areas of investment and capital availability for Irish companies.  It is said that people have relied to too great an extent on debt financing and that there has not been a sufficiently active market in equity financing for those companies. I hope that with our independent Stock Exchange, operating under the highest standards of regulation, we will see an expansion in risk and equity investment <Col N="1870" /> in Irish business and enterprise and that this Bill will prove a springboard for the creation and growth of Irish business and jobs.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the contributions of Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation which deals with law nearly 200 years old.  It is a lengthy and complex Bill comprising 70 sections dealing mainly with technical enabling powers for the establishment of the new Stock Exchange and its regulation by the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael accepts the obligation to break the link between the Dublin and London Stock Exchanges as a result of European financial directives.  We broadly support the provisions of this Bill and we will not oppose it on Second Stage.  However, we believe improvements could be made to it.  Our objective in dealing with this Bill is to ensure that the new structures and Stock Exchange must facilitate the maximum development of the Irish Stock Exchange as a vehicle for providing capital to indigenous industry.  The best means of doing so is to ensure that we have the highest and most transparent standards of stockbroking activity that will give the maximum level of information and protection to ordinary investors.</P>
      <P>I was concerned about the delays in introducing this legislation.  The Minister should give a specific date for when it is anticipated that this legislation will come into effect and when the new Dublin Stock Exchange will be established.  My reservations about the Bill relate to its omissions and the Minister alluded to some of them.  We believe that everything necessary to provide the highest standards of protection to ordinary investors should have been included in this Bill and should be the responsibility of one Minister and one Department.  Often when, on a wing and a prayer, it is promised that other legislation will follow it can be many years before it sees the light of day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1871" /> The first serious omission from this Bill is insider dealing &mdash; it is ignored.  It is accepted that the Companies Act, 1990, is inadequate and defective for dealing with insider trading.  I can give an example of such trading.  It relates to events outside this jurisdiction but which are in the public domain.  They have been the subject of a Department of Trade and Industry investigation in the UK, they are celebrated and give people an idea of the problem involved. This example is what is known as the Archer affair involving Lord Archer.  I offer it as an example of what people perceive to be insider dealing.</P>
    <P>On 13 and 14 January this year Lord Archer brought 25,000 shares each day in Anglia Television where his wife, Mary, is an non-executive director. Curiously, five days after he bought the shares the multinational group MAI, the media corporation, bought Anglia Television.  The corporation paid much more than the price of the quoted stock when Lord Archer bought his 50,000 shares.  Lord Archer bought the shares for Stg. £1.80 and he sold them five days later for Stg. £6.64.</P>
    <P>Are we to believe there has never been insider dealing in this country?  I am not simply saying there has been no conviction &mdash; there has been no attempted prosecution.  This is a notoriously difficult area.  Deputy McDowell and Deputy Kemmy, for example, waltz up to the Horseshoe Bar in the Shelbourne Hotel and somebody flicks a beer-mat across to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a massive oil field in Venezuela is discovered and the 29 <Col N="1872" /> pence looks like exceptional value.  Who can ever say that it was insider dealing? Who can prove that the purchaser of the shares was the subject of inside information?  There has been notorious difficulty in obtaining hard evidence against people who have access to sensitive and important financial information relating to a company before it becomes public information.</P>
      <P>We cannot be complacent that insider dealing has not or does not occur in this country.  In fact, the Irish Stock Exchange &mdash; without any reference to the integrity of the individuals involved &mdash; must be noted for its difference in scale and size.  Fewer people are involved because this is a smaller country in which everybody knows everybody.  In this country all the principal brokers are owned by banks.  Davys is owned by Bank of Ireland, Goodbodys is owned by Allied Irish Banks and it is rumoured that NCB is in the process of being bought by Ulster Bank.  The list goes on.  In this small financial community there is enormous potential for such Chinese walls to be broken and penetrated.  It would not, for example, be unusual for corporate bankers to know the exact details of takeovers, share issues and bad financial news such as the imminent publication of horrendous figures which will greatly affect the accounts.  The time to sell and the time to buy can be greatly influenced by the possession of such information.</P>
      <P>It is unrealistic and extremely naive of the Minister and the Department of Finance to say this matter has nothing to do with the regulatory authority and nature of this Bill but is rather a matter for the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I have some detailed comments to make about this later.  The law is inadequate and should have been strengthened here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second serious omission is the lack of provision to compensate investors who experience unacceptable losses.  What defines an unacceptable loss?  One area would be where fraudulent, incomplete or inaccurate information was given to investors on the <Col N="1873" /> basis of which they invested money in a publicly quoted listed company.  The voluntary code which gives a maximum compensation of £16,000 to an investor is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There are celebrated cases in the UK where people from outside the jurisdiction and Europe &mdash; Middle Eastern people with expensive passports &mdash; come in, set up companies and then mysteriously disappear to north Cyprus or other countries where they cannot be reached by laws covering either extradition or sanction.  We must be realistic. There have been some recent spectacular failures on the Irish Stock Exchange including Classic Thoroughbreds, Xtra-Vision, Cambridge, Atlantic Resources. This was all hyped and involved ordinary investors.</P>
    <P>I would define a small ordinary investor as somebody investing £20,000 to £25,000 which could be a large sum of money to them.  This sum could represent their life time's reward in the form of a pension, retirement or redundancy payment.  These people would have a genuine case for compensation yet there is no provision for compensation.  We are told it will be covered in some financial intermediaries legislation that will deal with Uncle Tom's cobbley and all.  A proper code of conduct with statutory effect should be included to provide for an acceptable level of compensation to be awarded by the courts under some fair and independent criteria.  I make no bones about it. One serious scandal, should it occur, would be enough to rock the Dublin Stock Exchange's credibility and leave it with no future viability.</P>
    <P>There is another omission.  Just as the UK Stock Exchange has supervised all aspects of our current Stock Exchange dealings in Dublin, the United Kingdom panel also has responsibility for the legislation covering monopolies, mergers and takeovers.  My understanding is just as the British jurisdiction will not extend any further in the Stock Exchange it will not extend to the takeover panel.  We therefore do not have a new statutory panel to legally replace it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> If the start up date is spring of 1995, now is the time to bring forward such legislation.  It should be incorporated into this Bill.  We live in an era of multinational consolidation and takeovers can often be predatory.  Many Irish publicly quoted companies have been the subject of takeovers including Carrolls which is now owned by the Rothmans group, Jacobs which is now French owned and Irish Distilleries which is owned by Pernod.  There are many others and it is vital that this new panel is put in place immediately.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of this legislation is to give the Central Bank the role of regulator.  This follows the allocation of a series of new powers and responsibilities to the Central Bank.  Initially, it was just responsible for banking here and the capital adequacy ratios of banks.  In 1989 this power was extended and it was given full remit and responsibility for building societies.  This was followed by the Central Bank Act which greatly widened its powers and we now have this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Central Bank is impartial and of the highest integrity and independence.  However, where is there any evidence to suggest that it has experience or knowledge of stock broking?  I submit that it has no such knowledge, expertise or track record.  It is also quite clear that the Department of Finance does not have that expertise.</P>
    <P>One of the lessons from the Greencore débâcle was that the Department could not see the basic need to have different parties fulfilling the roles of adviser and broker when it came to selling the Greencore stock.  The quite extraordinary reality was that the people who advised the Government sold and bought the stock.  The Department of Finance was shown to have limitations in its knowledge of the market because it took everything Davys said at face value.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of the Central Bank for failing to communicate adequately.  I accused it of being deaf and dumb in some respects.  There was <Col N="1875" /> one area where I was very dissatisfied with the Central Bank in its supervision of building societies.  It relates to the celebrated wrangle between our largest building society, the Irish Permanent Building Society, and its managing director, Mr. Farrell.  This is a mutual organisation with one person, one vote and one owner.  The media alleged that the boss, with the agreement of the board of the IPBS, effectively bought a house with building society funds which he then sold to the society.  The society spent a fortune renovating it and sold it back to Mr. Farrell at a cheap price.  It was alleged that he made a substantial profit from all of these transactions. There were other allegations about a large salary payment which, I understand, is the subject of litigation.</P>
    <P>The supervisory authority responsible for dealing with all aspects of the management expenses of building societies and ensuring transparency and public scrutiny of valid matters of public interest, steadfastly refused to issue any statement.  It was prepared to talk to the Minister for Finance and send memoranda to the Department of Finance but refused to go public.  It is also true that previous governors of the Central Bank refused to appear before committees of this House.  I am glad the new incumbent has let in the light to some extent and is due to appear before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.</P>
    <P>Another area of vital public policy and national interest for which the Central Bank had almost exclusive responsibility is the management of our exchange rate policy.  We had a devaluation crisis some 22 months ago.  It transpired that the bank tried to maintain that it could sustain the Irish punt against sterling and other currencies while the markets took the view that this could not be done.  It put £300 million of reserves against that view and the market washed it away.  We had to enter into a humiliating devaluation of over 8 per cent.  The Central Bank was never accountable for its actions in this <Col N="1876" /> regard.  At least Government Ministers come into the House and have to answer questions on these matters.</P>
    <P>If we are giving all these powers to the Central Bank, it is not unreasonable that there should be some proper reporting procedure to this House so that it could let us know how its supervision of the Stock Exchange or building societies has gone.  It produces quarterly bulletins but these tend to be macro-economic and dense in detail, albeit valuable, independent and proper.  I usually agree with much of what these reports say about monetary policy but the bank has not proved itself to be an effective watchdog for the public interest.</P>
    <P>I would like to know specifically what new resources, staff or unit will be put in place to give it expertise.  Will it second people from London and take on brokers and poachers turned game-keepers?  Will it deal with this area?  It does not have the expertise to deal with it because it has no market experience or knowledge.  In Britain the Bank of England has not been given the task of supervising the Stock Exchange there. This is done by the British Securities and Futures Authority because it has specialist knowledge.  The fact that we have not opted for a specialist authority requires justification and a broadening of the capacity of the Central Bank as it stands.</P>
    <P>There was a number of provisions in relation to the role of the Central Bank in which the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used.  The Bill provides that the bank &ldquo;may&rdquo; make regulations.  The matters are of such serious concern in some areas that &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be changed to the more obligatory word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Investment managers have spoken to me about this and said that the matters are of such gravity that the Bill is too loose at present and should be tighter.  They were referring particularly to annual audits and automatic procedures as opposed to the disciplinary investigations and inquiries that may be conducted.</P>
    <P>It seems that on a day to day basis the <Col N="1877" /> Stock Exchange board, not the Central Bank, will have the primary responsibility for policing this area.  The Minister did not set out &mdash; I may have missed it in her speech &mdash; the detailed composition of the board or give any indication of who is likely to be appointed.  This is a vital issue.  My understanding is that it will have eleven members, of whom seven will be brokers.  There will be an election process whereby broking firms will nominate those seven and no firm may have more than one person on the board.  The biggest criticism being made about the Stock Exchange &mdash; critics are not always right &mdash; is that it is a private self-regulated club.  The market floor of the Stock Exchange is a little like the wigs and gowns worn in courts.  I see no reason for its existence in the future because of technology and what is likely to happen in Britain.  The Stock Exchange is a little paradise of its own. This needs to be looked at if seven of the eleven members of the board will be brokers because it will be difficult to convince outside people that self-regulation does not still exist.  It is important that the interests of small investors be represented on the board.  There must be a balance between brokers and non-brokers.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister's response as to how the balance of seven brokers and four other members was arrived at, if this is correct; if not, what the balance is intended to be; whether there will be an independent chairperson or whether that person will be a broker; and what will be done to secure a proper balance between the interests of brokers and other interests.  The Bill should state that membership of the board should include representatives of investment institutions, listed companies, bankers and, possibly, academics with a specialist knowledge.  I can think of many outstanding industrialists, some semi-retired, who would have a great deal to contribute to the credibility of such a board.  They would be seen to be from the corporate sector and outside of the Stock Exchange and would give <Col N="1878" /> authority to the board.  Successive Governments have sought to pioneer the concept of employee shareholding. Perhaps a representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the board would be appropriate in the context of persevering with the notion of expanding employee shareholding and furthering the democratisation of share ownership.  I would like the Minister to shed some light on the role of the board and its composition and chairmanship.  I would not like to see the Bill's provisions merely give the perception of respectability without essentially changing the situation from one of self-regulation.  This is the critical balance which is required in this legislation.</P>
    <P>We should look at this in a wider context.  The Irish Stock Exchange is tiny and dwarfed by the London Stock Exchange.  There are 79 listed companies operating on the Dublin exchange whereas the London one has 2,500 companies.  My fear is that unless we deal with the issues of credibility, the protection of investors and raising capital successfully on the Irish market, big companies like Irish Life, CRH and the main banks could switch their domicile from Ireland to the UK if they felt this would strengthen their credibility. Before this Bill was published, reservations were expressed by senior executives of Irish multinationals that this might happen.  The future development of the Exchange is vital.  We have seen very few successes of new companies brought to the market in this country. We do not have a major retail chain. Dunnes Stores may&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>One never knows what way circumstances will develop in an individual company.  Many Irish pension funds and assurance companies have been criticised for not investing enough in Ireland.  The first thing they ask me in this regard is where are the investment opportunities in Ireland.  They say they <Col N="1879" /> cannot spend all future pensioners' contributions on high risk ventures.  They are not in the risk capital business but in the business of providing a safe and secure home so that people will be guaranteed their pensions and returns on their investments.  People want their investment to be absolutely secure and these companies are looking for stocks to invest in.  Apart from Greencore, Irish Life and a few co-operatives, the companies being brought to the Irish market and successfully capitalised are few and far between.  The controversy relating to the sale of Greencore shares proved very unsatisfactory last year from a number of aspects.  The £150,000 fine on Davy Stockbrokers was not accompanied by any reason for its findings and details of the London committee's investigation were not given.</P>
      <P>Provision is made in this Bill for reports to be published at the Minister's discretion but they should be published as a matter of course.  Some key questions were asked at that time, such as whether the market was misled, why the shares were not sold to the underwriters, S &amp; G Warburg, and so on, but there was a total lack of information.</P>
      <P>Questions have been raised about the constitutionality of certain aspects of this Bill, given the fact that the Stock Exchange board will be a private limited company, whereas the existing organisation is in nature a club.  Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, could clarify the point on the assurances from the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equities are small in that they average approximately £10 million to £12 million a day, but Government gilts are large because they trade between £50 million and £400 million a day and £250 billion annually.  Controversy has arisen about market making, the new system for the sale of Government gilts put forward by the National Treasury Management Agency.  The Minister did not refer to it in her speech.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us why dual capacity <Col N="1880" /> cannot be allowed under the present agency system, which has 30 per cent overseas participation in the Government gilt market and which has been a success.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me that the Exchequer's way of raising finance will not necessarily be cheaper through what is proposed.  Will the National Treasury Management Agency be represented on the board?  Who will make the regulations on the sale of Government gilts? Will the Government or the National Treasury Management Agency be responsible for it, or should this be covered in the Bill?  The person who issues the stock at the National Treasury Management Agency may not be the appropriate person to make the regulations.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested to me that the Minister should look at section 31 in regard to the ban on advertising.  The wording is such that non-EU stockbrokers may be able to advertise here, while Irish stockbrokers may not have any reciprocal opportunity to advertise on their stock exchanges.  Will the Minister look at section 31 (1) (b) under which non-EU stockbrokers do not seem to be prohibited from advertising here.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank's audit of the effectiveness of that supervision, which is only enabling in this legislation, should be obligatory.  Perhaps the Minister could also clarify if brokers and partnerships will be allowed under the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are serious omissions from this Bill.  Building on the Companies Act, provisions on insider dealing should have been included.  There should be proper cover for compensation for investors so that we are seen to have the highest standards of practice and a Stock Exchange which can be developed and enhanced as a real vehicle for raising capital for indigenous industries which is badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo many of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Yates about this Bill.  However, I do not agree with some of his remarks.  For example, <Col N="1881" /> as regards compensation, I am sceptical about the scope of the State, through the medium of the Stock Exchange, to provide adequate compensation for investors along the lines hinted at by Deputy Yates.  My view is that there is something questionable about putting in place a statutory scheme of compensation for people who make such losses on the Stock Exchange as those sustained in the cases cited by Deputy Yates, including Xtra-Vision, the Cambridge Group and Classic Thoroughbreds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it was not the Deputy's point.  I cannot understand why anyone should put their hands in their pockets to compensate such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the Blue Arrow situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If one is dealing with investment companies, such as Blue Arrow and others, is the Stock Exchange the correct medium through which to offer such compensation?  It seems there is something to be said for not putting in place compensation for speculative investment.  If oil shares treble or quadruple in price, although I know there is capital gains tax, I do not see why people should be asked to pay a vast levy on their gains or why they should be sustained by the market from making speculative decisions in high risk investments.  Deputy Yates spoke about people putting their entire life savings into individual investments.  I would prefer to see a general culture where it was appreciated that decisions to put one's life savings into one investment carried a risk which should be avoided, rather than a risk which should be compensated if the risk materialised to one's detriment.  I echo what Deputy Yates said about the Central Bank.  It is fine for the Central Bank to be independent.  On the last occasion when I was Finance spokesperson for my party, I remember being considerably frustrated <Col N="1882" /> by efforts to achieve a degree of accountability in respect of the staff and costs of running the Central Bank. When I tabled questions in this House I was told that the Minister for Finance had no function in determining staff and wages levels, costs of running the Central Bank or whether it made sense to mint our own money.  I note what Deputy Yates said about the new Governor taking a more open approach to the bank's affairs, but this is said with no disrespect to the previous Governor. It seems there is something questionable about putting a non-accountable agency in place to supervise what are, in effect, functions which require accountability.  I query if it is a good idea to put the Central Bank in charge of policing the Stock Exchange in circumstances where if, in the last analysis, there are failures in the policing function, this House could be left empty-handed in terms of accountability and answers to the questions which ought to be asked.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that legislation will be introduced in relation to investment intermediaries.  I welcome this and I am glad to know that, like everything else, the European Union is forcing a degree of discipline on us in this area.  Until such time as the European Union obliged us to do otherwise, I could not understand how any responsible society tolerated a situation where a person could open an office anywhere in the country, take in people's savings and purport to apply them to various things, charge commissions and give advice.  I cannot believe we live in a democracy where there is no effective regime to work out if it is correct for people with criminal convictions for fraud to operate such companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>They can operate in Moore Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind people operating in Moore Street. However, it is extraordinary that someone with a conviction for fraud could open an office in a suburb in Dublin, <Col N="1883" /> pass himself or herself off as an investment analyst and broker, take the savings of Deputy Yates' little old ladies, tell them they will do various things with it, but then pocket the money, yet there is no person wearing a harp on his hat or in her lapel to ensure that situation does not occur.  How does a serious democracy allow such a situation to exist?  Why do we only say it is right to protect people from crooks in the investment business when Europe introduces a mandatory system?</P>
      <P>There has been a number of instances of investment brokerages and advisers taking people's money and running off with it, leaving investors empty-handed. It seems extraordinary that they operate in a regime, in which there is currently no effective policing mechanism. Nobody has responsibility for ensuring that the money is still where they claim, that they have not misled their customers and that they do not propose to pocket it and do a bunk.  On all the occasions where people have been left high and dry &mdash; I came across them while canvassing in the last election &mdash; one couple lost everything because of the collapse of one such house and there was nobody to whom they could turn for compensation or assistance.  They dealt in good faith with that firm and found that their money was simply stolen from under their eyes.  It is remarkable that it takes a European directive to force this State to face up to that kind of fraud.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister will comply with the European directive and put in place some scheme of regulation to cover investment intermediaries and those who take people's life savings and purport to invest them for reward for them.  It is strange that insurance brokers are currently subject to all sorts of regulatory mechanisms in respect of their premia, but investment brokers are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if that happens, and this is my second point, this State suffers from quadriplegic paralysis in enforcing current financial laws.  With the greatest <Col N="1884" /> respect of the decent and honourable members who compose the Fraud Squad, they are not in a position to prosecute complex fraud.  We simply do not have the capacity.  Indeed, the Director of Public Prosecutions said recently that existing mechanisms are simply not adequate to chase sophisticated thieves.</P>
    <P>Any financial criminal sanctions in our company criminal law rely on people to get the evidence together, go to a District Court and seek a warrant for the arrest of somebody, put that person in the dock and present the evidence in court to convict them.  The sad fact is that this society is waiting to be seriously plundered and Deputy Yates pointed out the danger of a major scandal in the whole Irish Stock Exchange edifice.  This society has its neck exposed to thieves and has no protective mechanisms or response to what probably will occur at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>There have been countless occasions on which liquidators and the courts, in the course of winding up companies, have found massive fraud by directors. However, I ask Members to consider, from their own experience, how many company directors have ever been the subject of criminal sanctions for corporate fraud in this country.  Offhand, I cannot remember any and it would stick in my mind if it had happened in the 20 years I have been a practising barrister. I have never seen a company director criminally sanctioned for fraud or the company law provisions relating to fraud effectively put into operation in respect of a collapse of a company. Many times a liquidator and the courts have sent papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Fraud Squad for the matter to be investigated, but on every single such occasion, the impetus to prosecute and make people liable for their criminal behaviour has dwindled under the weight of bureaucracy and the inadequate state of our laws.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission came forward with interesting proposals to <Col N="1885" /> reform the law in relation to commercial dishonesty.  I played a part in making some submissions to try to elevate our laws of evidence to a stage where people who are involved in serious crimes would have to engage in the process and would find that the laws of evidence made presumptions against them if they decided not to participate in the legal process.  As matters stand &mdash; people refer to the right to silence in the context of murder and armed robbery &mdash; those engaged in serious corporate fraud can send a polite letter through a solicitor to the Fraud Squad saying that their client does not particularly want to speak to it about this matter.  That is the end of most investigations; they stop at that point.  There is no point in putting together safeguards against fraud if, at the same time, this country is not serious about doing something to punish the fraudsters when they are caught.</P>
    <P>When it comes to policing this Act, doubtless the Central Bank will operate through its regulatory powers given in respect of individual Stock Exchange members.  I guarantee that there will be no improvement in the capacity of this State to deal with proven fraud in the Stock Exchange or anywhere else unless there is a revolution in our thinking in respect of the way in which we prosecute people and operate our criminal law to make them accountable.</P>
    <P>My third point relates to the notion of capital formation and the taking of risk in Ireland.  I do not own a share and never have done.  That is not because I did not have the money to put into them but because there is no culture or tradition here of putting money into shares, although there has been the odd craze for oil company shares and the like.  It is generally true, and I am reasonably typical of most people of my experience and standing in society, that most people avoid equity investments in this country.  The reason for this is that there is not a tradition of capital formation based on equity risk participation in enterprise and that worries me considerably.  Why is it that Ireland, in particular among the northern European <Col N="1886" /> democracies, is one in which the idea of buying and owning shares and investing some of one's money in enterprise is so restricted and stunted as an attitude in our society?</P>
    <P>We need to transform our attitudes. I am not holding out a kind of instant, Thatcherite conversion of Ireland to a share-owning democracy where everybody will suddenly take their money out of the post office, run down to these unregulated people in their suburban offices and hazard all their savings on unwise investments.  However, there is a role for the Government in creating a risk taking culture by savers and investors.  In a sense, we have to break our cultural dependence on risk aversion. Most bourgeois people of means think of the most risk averse investment they can possibly make with their money and demand of the State that matters like investment in land, houses and such matters be treated in a tax regime which is entirely different from investment in something which might create employment for others.</P>
    <P>One place where we could start &mdash; and doubtless we will start when this Government has run its course, which I hope is soon &mdash; is in the area of privatisation.  I was recently visited by an American academic who asked me about the process of privatisation in Ireland.  He made the point that Greencore was not the only model available, but that it is possible to adopt different models in relation to privatisation.  One is to vest shares in a company widely among the people, say, two or three years in advance of its full commercialisation and flotation, and allow everybody to participate in the upswing or downswing that company would experience thereafter.  To take an example, if it were determined by a future Government, as I hope it will be, that our airports need not be owned and run by the State and it was decided to vest them in a company which was to be eventually sold off, they would not have to be sold to the highest bidder like the British Airports Authority or some group of that kind.  It would be possible <Col N="1887" /> to adopt a radically different approach to such bodies and to make shares in them available to everyone as of right, much like the Irish Permanent Building Society flotation of recent times.</P>
    <P>Things like that represent the future, creating a society in which people are willing to risk some of their savings in employment-creating activities.  It has been said, of course, that there are intermediate steps between outright private ownership of shares and no investment at all.  One of them is venture capital funds where risk-taking is, so to speak, mediated by the interposition of advisers and experts working on behalf of people.  The same applies to unit trust funds and the like.  I accept that that is true but I feel that if we are talking about genuine employment creation in Ireland there must be mechanisms for attracting investment into small-scale enterprise.  In a small economy such as ours, greater emphasis should be put on unlisted securities and informal small-size investment opportunities than has been done in the past.</P>
    <P>Whereas it is obviously desirable that Irish people should have access to internationally recognised investments, if we are talking about creating employment opportunities and capital for people to create jobs for others, it will not be done via the medium of the Stock Exchange except, perhaps, in the context of companies set up to act as specialists in the area.  If we are serious about persuading people to invest some of their savings in employment-creating enterprise in Ireland, it will not be achieved through the medium of the Stock Exchange alone, taking into account the good work that has been done by venture capital companies to try to span that gap as things stand.</P>
    <P>My view on this Bill is that it had to come into effect on foot of a European directive; it is setting up an unaccountable and independent body &mdash; the Central Bank &mdash; as the regulatory body; that whereas there is a clear case to be made for the independence of the Central Bank in relation to maintaining the <Col N="1888" /> integrity of our currency, there is no such case to be made for the independence of the Central Bank as a policing authority in respect of Stock Exchange discipline and the like.  Whoever polices the Stock Exchange must be publicly accountable, and, if things do go wrong, must explain why the regulatory and protective mechanisms failed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement in the Minister's speech that this is only one leg of the State's proposals to deal with the whole question of investment intermediaries.  I strongly deprecate the fact that it has taken until this point for any protective mechanism to come into place for people, many of whom have suffered as a result of the failure of the Irish State to police the whole investment area.  I am not just talking about the brokerage firms that have collapsed, two of them in my own constituency.  I am also talking in terms of people around the country &mdash; some of them clerics, I notice &mdash; who run informal investment funds, some of which have ended up in grief in at least two parts of the country.  I am thinking of the right and duty of people to invest and the duty of others to protect them from fraud.</P>
    <P>Corporate crime in Ireland is, in my view, something which this State is simply not equipped to deal with.  I do not know why that should be.  I do not know why we, among all the countries of northern Europe, have a police system, prosecution system and a set of laws of evidence more worthy of the 18th century than the 21st century.  I do not know why it is that this little corner of Europe cannot prosecute anybody for stealing other people's money if the theft is reasonably sophisticated.</P>
    <P>Before I finish I have to say one thing about the whole issue of accountability. I noted today that the Taoiseach was again quoted on radio as saying he only earned £3 an hour.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 37 and 122.</P>
      <P>I am firmly committed to free access to education at first, second and third level.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to ensure no student is deprived of access to third level education because of his or her financial circumstances.  As I indicated on RTE on 26 July, I believe I will see, in the lifetime of my Ministry, free access to all who can avail of further and third level education.</P>
      <P>The time is right for public representatives and the general public to discuss in a positive manner the question of wider and fairer access to third level education, and the need for the essential reforms and greater resources to achieve this.  I am actively working on detailed proposals on this matter.  I hope in this way to help many people on modest incomes who are outside the income eligibility limits for higher education grants and who are experiencing growing financial hardship in providing a third level education for their children.</P>

On other occasions the Minister indicated her commitment to helping the disadvantaged.  Would the introduction of free fees at third level be of help to disadvantaged students in gaining access to college?</P>

I am committed in the lifetime of my Ministry to the introduction of free fees for undergraduates.  I am actively working on proposals for this.  On the question of whether one person from a disadvantaged background would gain access to third level education, my Department has taken many initiatives to ensure people from all social backgrounds benefit fully from the education system.  There must be intervention in some cases at pre-school level to ensure that children, regardless of background, will aspire to and benefit from third level education.  It appears from the information available to us &mdash; this is the subject of a separate question &mdash; that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are increasingly taking up places at third level.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 51, 55, 119, 121, 135 and 168 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met representatives of the Irish Society for Autism in July 1993.  Subsequently, senior officials of my Department met representatives of the society. On that occasion, the society presented material in support of its case for a dedicated educational facility for children with autism.  The case put forward by the society has now been examined in detail by my Department and I hope within the general framework approach set out in the report of the Special Education Review Committee, it will be possible to target resources specifically <Col N="1895" /> at the needs of autistic children.  I hope to be able to announce a pilot initiative in this area in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have received a copy of an education policy statement prepared by the Irish Society for Autism.  I note that this document has as its core the principles and recommendations set out in the report of the Special Education Review Committee, which my Department is seeking to implement on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that discussions to secure suitable alternative accommodation for James Connolly Special School are at an advanced stage. However, in deference to the other parties involved in these discussions, I am not in a position to be more specific at this time.  I can, however, assure the House that every effort is being made to finalise these discussions as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for indicating that the Department will actively consider the provision of special education for autistic children. This is long overdue and I hope the pilot project will proceed quickly.  The Minister referred to the James Connolly Special School which she hopes to rehouse.  As she is aware, autistic children are being taught with emotionally disturbed children.  Does she agree that this is not a suitable place for autistic children to receive education?  Will the Minister agree that designating a special category for autistic children would be a more suitable way of ensuring they get an adequate education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The accommodation in Ballyowen Meadows and James Connolly Special School is not adequate for the children being educated there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Autism can be broken down into different characteristics: some children suffering from autism have impaired language development, social development, obsessive behaviour, other might have another handicap.  We know that 80 per cent will need life long support <Col N="1896" /> and supervision in dealing with their different levels of handicap.  There are between 14 and 22 cases each year.  As the Deputy correctly said autism has been brought under the umbrella of the emotionally disturbed, mentally handicapped and learning and language disabilities.</P>
    <P>If the outcome of talks on accommodation is positive we should be able to make special arrangements for autistic children by providing a special unit in schools, a specially designated curriculum, and a separate special teacher to address the particular educational needs of autistic children.  That new initiative will be closely monitored to establish its effectiveness and to provide a basis for possible future developments in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling us that she will set up a special class for autistic children?  Will the Minister clarify whether it will be in an ordinary school, or a school for the emotionally disturbed?  Would the Irish Society for Autism not prefer a specific school for autistic children or at least a special class within a mainstream school?  The option of having a special class in a school for the emotionally disturbed is way down its list of recommendations. When will this initiative get under way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate giving a time-frame but, presuming the matter will be resolved and that things go well, it should get underway by the mid-term break.  I know there is great concern on all sides of the House about this issue. We have been working towards this throughout the summer.</P>
      <P>I expect to be able to put in place a specific unit and when we find accommodation for the other schools we will put in a special unit with a teacher working on a special curriculum and monitor it closely because future developments may be different from in the past.</P>

The delay is very disappointing for anybody involved in education as the Green Paper was published in June 1992.  What work has been done on the legislative framework of the education Act?  When one considers the difficulties the Minister is experiencing with the Act based on the 1937 Constitution, one realises how urgent this is.  It is very disappointing to hear the Minister say the publication will be towards the end of the year.  Will she be more specific?</P>

      <P>The White Paper is a very important document which will outline a framework for the development of education into the next century. It will be the most comprehensive education legislation to be put on the Statute Book since the British established the national school system at the end of the last century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1898" /> There has been an intense and innovative consultation process.  A convention on education was held in Dublin Castle in October 1993 and there was a report to the convention in January 1994.  It emerged at Dublin Castle that we needed to have further consultation and discussion on the proposed regional education councils.  I was invited by the partners to the convention on education in Dublin Castle to publish a position paper, I did so on the regional education councils in March 1994 and had round table discussions under Professor Coolahan who reconvened that group in Dublin Castle in June 1994.</P>
    <P>The other area of concern and of great differences in opinion that emerged in Dublin Castle was the future of the governance of schools.  In July 1994 I responded to concerns expressed in Dublin Castle and subsequently hosted a two day meeting in September 1994.  I will not apologise for the consultative process because I know it has resulted in a substantive debate on complex issues and now we are facing the prospect of real change.</P>
    <P>What we are doing in Ireland is of considerable interest to our partners, and the OECD is specifically monitoring this process where the partners in education are being consulted, heard and responded to before the &ldquo;tablets of stone&rdquo; are finished.  I make no apology for this.  I would not quibble over the difference between November and December, I am aiming for the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that discussions have been ongoing since the two day meeting on the governance of schools &mdash; interestingly they are not being carried on behind the doors of the Department of Education as we have finally established a new mechanism of consultation where the partners involved in one sector, parents, teachers, owners and managers consult each other to achieve an agreed model that would be flexible enough to respond to the three pillars on which I asked that the governance would be based, plurality, partnership and <Col N="1899" /> accountability.  The discussion is not quite over and I would prefer to facilitate it rather than saying I have committed myself to 30 November and that I cannot wait another month.  It has been a century since such legislation was put on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that some legislation will be ready to go on the Statute Book six months after the publication of the White Paper.</P>

      <P>As previously indicated to the Deputy &mdash; I believe this is the seventh time &mdash; the medical advice available to my Department is that there is no scientific indication that the health of children is impaired by writing on a flat desk.</P>
      <P>All school furniture for primary and post-primary schools grant-aided by my Department is designed in accordance with the relevant official Irish, British and international standards.  My Department constantly monitors these standards and will update its specifications for school furniture in accordance with new and revised standards including those that might be set at European level.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the Deputy's previous question on this matter, I outlined the medical advice available to my Department.  However, I asked the Deputy to direct my Department to research that highlights the different effects of sitting at a sloping or a flat desk.  I also said I would ensure that my officials would respond in a positive way to new information.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Brevity is important today but so also is common sense.  I am appalled, for the seventh time, at the Minister's reply.  I supplied her with a report of a study carried out by a surgeon who said that people like the Minister and those in charge of school furniture have forgotten about the problems in schools.  How can the Minister give me the same reply for the seventh time, namely, that there is no medical evidence for this when I supplied her with a surgeon's report and with medical evidence from the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Occupational Health and Ergonomics, <Col N="1901" /> in addition to evidence from the president of the Association of Physiotherapists in Ireland.  Is the Minister seriously concerned about the damage that may be done to children's backs or has the Department any interest in this matter? According to the Department's publications, 80 per cent of people suffer from backache and, although medical proof of that has been supplied to the Minister, she continues to tell me there is no evidence to that effect in the Department.  What is the Minister up to?</P>

      <P>I am aware Deputy Browne has a strong interest in this matter and that he has gone to much trouble in this regard.  I invited him to support his proposition that flat desks can cause back problems.  From the medical advice available to us that proposition was not borne out.  There is a Department of Health booklet on back care that makes a strong case for teaching children to sit up straight and for the use of proper chairs.  The Deputy brought to our attention evidence from the Association of Physiotherapists in Ireland and he also quoted Dr. Mandel, the chief surgeon at the Vincent Institute in Copenhagen.  I assure the Deputy that both these authorities are being contacted by my Department and I will keep in touch with the Deputy on the matter.  We have, therefore, responded to the question put to us.  I must say to the Deputy that there is a slight difference between this answer and other answers given previously, namely we are now pursuing the two sources cited by the Deputy.</P>

The Minister's Department has not moved one iota in this regard and if she does not take action it is quite obvious that no moves <Col N="1902" /> will be made, despite the available evidence.

      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 5, 22, 61, 72, 118 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with those aspects of Deputy Gilmore's question relating to the abolition of third level fees in my answer to priority questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support reported to me on 11 November 1993.  Arising from my <Col N="1904" /> consideration of the committee's report I have already implemented a number of improvements in the student support arrangements such as the abolition of the separate attainments for eligibility for a grant; this will ensure that all students who have secured a college place will now qualify for a grant subject to their meeting the means test; the introduction of new rules for second chance cases; this is to ensure students who did not complete their initial studies will be eligible to apply for grants for second chance courses after five years; the provision of a discretionary budget in 1994 so as to set up a hardship fund with the third level institutions; and an increase in the income limits in line with the rise in the average industrial wage and in maintenance grants in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>I also propose to implement the following further improvements: the processing of grant application and payments by the Central Applications Office; transfer of the means test to the Revenue Commissioners and transfer of the appeals function from the Minister for Education to the Appeal Commissioners appointed under tax law.</P>
    <P>The group have made a number of other important recommendations which extend beyond the remit of my Department.  I am addressing these recommendations in consultation with my colleague in Government.  I intend to publish the group's report when the Government has completed consideration of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>Subject to resource constraints I intend to continue to develop the schemes of student support particularly with a view to making them as equitable as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions to put to the Minister.  On 26 July the Minister announced that she intended to abolish all university fees within three years.  Does that mean that in 1997 university students will not have to pay fees?  Does it mean there will be a reduction in student fees in 1996 or a reduction in student fees in 1995?  I <Col N="1905" /> would like some clarity in the Minister's reply to that question.  Second, on 14 December last the Minister promised in this House that she would publish the report of the de Buitléar group on third level grants in February of this year.  It is now October and the report has not yet been published.  When will the Minister fulfil the promise she made to the House to publish the de Buitléar report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that I had dealt with this part of Deputy Gilmore's question in an earlier reply.  The Deputy asked for specific commitments in specific years.  I refer him to the answer I gave.  I am committed to see, within the time of my Ministry, the abolition of fees in order that students may have free access to first, second and third level education.</P>
      <P>I commissioned the report on the grants system in which there was not much confidence at the time.  I asked the advisory committee (a) to look at appropriate criteria for the assessment of eligibility of means with reference to equity and financial capacity of parents and applicants to pay and (b) to examine and make recommendations for the most effective organisational arrangements for the administration of the schemes.  When the report was made available (b) was within my remit and it must be acknowledged that the administrative changes made ensure that the organisational arrangements for the administration of the schemes is not only tidied up but streamlined to the benefit of pupils, parents and guidance counsellors.</P>
      <P>The advisory group made a number of recommendations regarding (a) which extended beyond the remit of the Department.  They are being addressed on consultation with my colleagues in Government.  I intend to publish the report when the Government has completed consideration of all recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on her <Col N="1906" /> own admission had the report in her possession last December when she promised the House she would publish it in February.  Why is it taking so long to publish a report commissioned by her Department?  Is there, as is widely believed, a degree of political difficulty between her and her colleagues?  I ask her to publish the report as promised in the House last December.</P>
      <P>Her announcement to abolish university fees was made voluntarily.  I ask her to put herself in the position of a student or parent who heard her announce in July that she would abolish university fees and who now wants to know whether they will have to pay fees next year, the year after or in 1997.  She announced specifically that they would be abolished in three years.</P>

      <P>History seems to be rewritten.  In reply to a question posed by Charlie Bird regarding bringing the appeals system under the remit of the Revenue Commissioners I replied:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well today the Government took the decision to introduce the Revenue Commissioners with the CAO in order to process applications for the present fee and maintenance system and that, I think, will be widely welcomed by people who were dealing with over 70 agencies up to this, so next year students filling in a CAO form for their place in university will, we hope, be able to fill in at the same time their application for their fee and maintenance.  Now I want to widen the access of people who qualify for free fees and maintenance, a family income of £15,000 is the cut off <Col N="1909" /> point for a full free fee and maintenance grant and I believe as a teacher and as somebody involved in Government that investment in education and in jobs and for our community that quality education is what we need and as Minister for Education I will see, in the lifetime of my Ministry, free access to all who can avail of further and third level education.</P>
    <P>I repeat I am actively preparing proposals.  That is what I said to date and we should not rewrite history for anyone.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 162 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>Gaelscoileanna have a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio than ordinary primary schools.  I will arrange for a copy of the staffing schedules for both types of schools to be circulated in the Official Report.  The gaelscoileanna become entitled to a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio from a complement of two staff upwards.</P>
      <P>In addition to the normal capitation grant, gaelscoileanna are allocated a bonus payment based on 50 per cent of the capitation grant.  The current grant rate per pupil for ordinary schools is £38 with an additional £17 per pupil for disadvantaged schools.  The rate for gaelscoilenna is £57 per pupil.</P>
      <P>This additional bonus payment was granted to gaelscoileanna from the 1977-78 school year.  The records in the Department of Education indicate that the more favourable treatment was sought on behalf of the then Minister on the basis that the catchment areas for pupils attending the schools were larger than those of ordinary schools and invariably covered a number of parishes.</P>
      <P>The gaelscoileanna play a valuable role in promoting the Irish language which has special recognition under Article 8.1 of the Constitution as the official language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where management authorities of gaelscoileanna have no suitable sites, or <Col N="1911" /> where existing school buildings are not available, full cost grants are provided for suitable sites and permanent accommodation.  These grants are provided when the need for permanent schools is clearly established and where the schools have permanent recognition status.  This practice has been in operation since 1978.</P>
    <P>The position in ordinary schools is that school authorities must provide the site, while grant-aid for the school building varies between 85 per cent and 95 per cent.</P>
    <P>Schedule of enrolment of pupils governing the appointment and retention of assistants in all-Irish national schools.</P>
    <P>The figure required for these purposes are the figures of enrolments on 30th September of the preceding school year.</P>
    <P>This schedule will come into effect from the school year 1994/95.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I previously asked the Minister to put a preservation order on male teachers.  I am one of the last of those dinosaurs who graduated many years ago with enough colleagues with whom to play football.  Will the Minister who leads the fight for gender balance accept that she has a fight on her hands considering that the percentage of male student primary teachers employed this year is 15 per cent?  I am aware that the number of male students entering this field is increasing but given the low rate this year it is unlikely that the increase will be great.  Does the Minister have plans to increase the number of male student teachers because there is a serious imbalance at classroom level?  No matter how capable female teachers are, boys need a male presence.  I might say to the Minister, with tongue in cheek, that the pursuit of a 40 per cent gender balance is as important for males in primary education as it is for women in respect of representation on boards and so on.  The Minister should address this matter either by encouraging males to become primary teachers or by introducing a percentage regulation for male teachers.  While such a measure may be unfair as it may block the appointment of female teachers with higher qualifications, the Minister needs to consider some measure to deal with this matter.</P>

      <P>The ratio figures of male to female student primary teachers are interesting.  In 1975 there were 28 <Col N="1926" /> per cent male primary teachers and 72 per cent females.  However, those figures fluctuated since then and in the 1981-82 academic year the figure for male teachers was 13 per cent, 11 per cent in 1982-83 and the lowest fixure was 6 per cent in 1990.</P>

      <P>Because the ratio between male and female teachers has fluctuated over the years it is difficult to discern a reason for the pattern.  I am a believer in gender balance, I do not discriminate against either gender. European primary school statistics are interesting.  In Ireland 76 per cent of teachers are female and 48 per cent of principals are female; in England 75 per cent of teachers are female and 44 per cent of principals are female; in France 75 per cent of teachers are female and 44.8 per cent of principals are female; in the Netherlands 70 per cent of teachers are female and 13 per cent of principals are female.  Ireland's ratio of male to female primary teachers is in line with those figures.  In Spain 60 per cent of teachers are female and 39 per cent of principals are female.  In Sweden education statistics are slightly different and 98 per cent of teachers are female.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about this matter and I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss it.  We know that more males than females fail to meet the minimum education standard required for teaching. Fewer males than females attend interviews for teaching posts when called, more males than females fail the interview and more males than females refuse the offer of a place.  I do not believe lowering standard requirements for entrance to teacher training college is the way to address this matter.  We have been able to bring about change in the education graph in other areas and that is the course we should follow in future. Special intervention programmes have been set up to encourage girls to take higher level mathematics to ensure that <Col N="1927" /> an increasing number of them take up engineering and science subjects.  Such an intervention programme is a positive one introduced in secondary schools and it is backed up by the work of career guidance teachers.  I want to pursue positive programmes such as this at second level in order to have more males than females applying.  Having applied, more would turn up and, subsequently, more would pass and when they are offered jobs, more would take them up.  I can tell the House the negative side to this but we must move forward and address something which is of concern in other communities and other countries.  We have something to learn from the positive intervention programmes that have been introduced on behalf of girls in the school system. There has been a 1 per cent rise this year but the figures fluctuate to such an extent that I can see no reason for it.  I would prefer at this stage to look at the possibility of an intervention programme at second level, but lowering the standard for entry to teacher training colleges is not and should not be the answer.</P>

      <P>I am a believer in gender equity in primary school education as in every walk of life.  I am glad to see that there seems to be an increase of male teachers at primary level, but how is it that at primary level only 30 women out of 163 people are inspectors?  There is a need for gender balance there too. What is the level of male applicants for teacher training colleges?  I have a very good idea why the figures dropped so much in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</P>

However, there is a positive side to coming into the House to answer questions and it is the amount of information that is brought to one's attention.  We are not an extraordinary dinosaur in the <Col N="1928" /> European Union.  The subject concerns our other partners.

      <P>I apologise to the Minister, and to my colleagues, for my absence during her speech.  We were, perhaps appropriately enough, having a final meeting with the Committee of Public Accounts with the retiring Comptroller and Auditor General and <Col N="2017" /> looking at the adequacy and transparency of public accountability procedures which I suppose, in the context of this Bill, is fairly apposite in so much as whatever else the public think or know about the Stock Exchange, transparency and accountability are not two features that first occur to their minds.</P>
      <P>I had been here for one minute when I moved the Adjournment and I was confused that the debate at that stage was about the paltry pay of the Taoiseach, at £3 an hour.  I would like to put on record my support for Deputy McDowell's proposal for a minimum wage to bring it up at least £4 an hour which would be more in keeping with minimum pay legislation in the neighbouring island.  I am not clear what it has to do with the Stock Exchange Bill but that was the subject of discussion when I was here earlier.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Sir.  I will. It is almost 200 years since there was last major legislation to do with the Stock Exchange.  That ought to tell us something.  It is extraordinary that there should be an institution of some significance in the State that has not attracted scrutiny and the necessity for reforming legislation over a period of almost 200 years.  It is, therefore, all the more important that we get it right on this occasion.</P>
      <P>It is not often that we are treated to levity by the Minister for Finance but a number of things in his script caught my eye, one being the fact that one of his predecessors, as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1799, had to take on board some amendments during the passage of the Bill on Committee Stage. It gives me some hope that the present chancellor of the Exchequer in Dáil Éireann may follow suit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably a portent of no good, however, that that particular Chancellor of the Exchequer ended up in an acrimonious dispute with Mr. Henry Grattan, and fighting a duel. That was an unusual way to solve parliamentary rows.  One wonders whether if we were still fighting duels last week we could have disposed of the little internal difficulty in Government and perhaps have had a clear winner now as distinct from a stand-off, unless Deputy Kemmy, who is next to speak, can enlighten us.  I am not clear on how that battle ended up.</P>
      <P>I want to deal first with the overriding necessity for the Bill as it is presented deriving from a European Union directive to separate the Dublin Stock Exchange from the London Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>I would like to query the Minister on the background to that directive.  My advice is that the European Union was happy to maintain the link between the London and Dublin exchanges provided we devised a regulatory system and that it was London that wanted to get rid of the Dublin connection because of considerations arising from the conduct of affairs on the exchange here in recent years.  London regards it as an irritant. It is happy to be rid of Dublin and the European Union had no alternative but to take that on board.  I would like the Minister to address that matter.  It is a point of significance in the sense that questions are raised about the future viability of the Dublin Exchange in isolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Dublin exchange on its own have a viable future?  The people currently responsible for the Dublin exchange argue that they have no concerns about the future.  They believe they have a viable exchange and that it could be a growing exchange if one anticipates more privatisation and flotations.  It is in their interest to say that. The Minister for Finance might comment on the viability of the Dublin Stock Exchange as an instrument for raising equity and development capital <Col N="2019" /> for Irish industry and say what he thinks of its future under the new arrangements that will be brought about by this Bill.</P>
    <P>For a long time a small number of big companies has dominated the Dublin exchange.  Five or six companies account for 80 per cent of turnover and that cannot be an ideal position.  I would have thought that under the new arrangements the prudent decision of big companies would be to seek a quoting on the London exchange where they would have access to a wider range of investors and that that practice would accelerate in the new circumstances. That is not to say I do not acknowledge the need to raise equity locally; obviously that need will continue to exist.  I do not know of any quantum of measurement in terms of the success of the Irish exchange in providing venture or seed capital for Irish industry.  What is the order of its contribution in this area.</P>
    <P>A second consideration raised by the Bill is concern about disciplinary procedures and the lack of transparent accountability in the exchange in recent years.  The Minister seems to believe that the position will be enormously enhanced as a result of this Bill but I am not clear how that will be so.  Since 1973 London regulated this aspect and had the disciplinary powers to tackle these matters.  There seemed to be a great lack of transparency and accountability in how that was done.  On some of the celebrated questions that arose, which most definitely had a public interest dimension, the public and Members of this House are little wiser now as to how those matters were resolved.  On my initial reading of the Bill I see no dramatic change in that position.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will get a report from the discipinary committee, but that is as far as the report will go. Will the Minister have the freedom under the Bill to advise this House of the finding of such a disciplinary committee report or the contents of the report?  Will he have the freedom to <Col N="2020" /> publish such reports and what will be his disposition in the matter?  For example, on the controversy that took place surrounding the placing of Greencore shares by Davy's, would the Minister, if he had access to the report, publish it in those circumstances?  I am tempted to the view that initially that will still be a matter internally for the Stock Exchange authorities.  The Minister has a right to seek the report but it is not clear whether, even where there is a public interest dimension, the Minister can apprise this House of the issues involved or whether it would be his intention to publish such reports.</P>
    <P>A similar question is raised about the role of the Central Bank as a regulator. It is an improvement that regulation of the Stock Exchange will be transferred from a committee of stockbrokers meeting in private to the Central Bank.  That seems to be a step forward, but it gives rise to questions that are hardly ever debated in this House about the suitability of the Central Bank as a regulator.  What is the proven record of the Central Bank as a regulator?  For example, by accident or intention, the Central Bank has vested in it regulatory authority to deal with virtually all financial institutions, banks and building societies.  There will probably be an enhancement of its role in that regard in other areas of the financial areas services industry and in its role relating to some of the financial services located at the Custom House Dock.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has no record as a spectacularly good regulator.  During the period of high activity in terms of exchange controls there does not appear to be evidence of a single prosecution initiated by the Central Bank.  I do not believe one should be complacent or take automatic comfort from the fact that it is the Central Bank that will have this authority in the future. How much does the Central Bank, no more than this House, know about the way in which the Stock Exchange does its business?  I presume these points will be teased out on Committee Stage as they are important.  Initially, the Stock <Col N="2021" /> Exchange will act as regulator and only when something is manifestly wrong will the matter be referred to the Central Bank.  This is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>As regards the future of the Stock Exchange there is a credibility question. I hope it is correct that it has a viable future because it is an instrument of some significance in terms of raising equity locally.  The Minister ought to be sufficiently concerned about this policy area to address it in detail in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to make changes in the board of the Stock Exchange.  It will now contain some outsiders.  Up until now it has been an incestuous &mdash; I do not use that term in a derogatory way &mdash; in-house committee. What would the Minister's attitude be to a proposal on Committee Stage that the chairperson of the board of directors should be an outsider?  The Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Bill provides that the board of directors of an exchange will have to be broadly based and that the composition of the board will have to strike a balance between the interests of the member firms and the users of the exchange, and the public interest.  Furthermore, the board will have to include enough independent members to promote the protection of investors and the maintenance of proper standards of conduct and practice.</P>
    <P>I agree with that as an aspiration.  It is because it is a closed shop and a secretive incestuous internal committee there is public suspicion that self-regulation is entirely inadequate.  I would like to be satisfied on Committee Stage that participation by outsiders will be meaningful.  Given that non executive directors &mdash; I mentioned Greencore in a different context a few moments ago &mdash; do not have a great record it will be difficult to expect them to come to grips with the issues which will arise on a day to day basis in a specialised agency such as the Stock Exchange.  I put it to the Minister that it would strengthen public confidence in the new arrangements if <Col N="2022" /> the chairperson of the board of directors was an outsider and seen to be independent.</P>
    <P>Despite the major hiccups which have been of public interest it seems, as Deputy McDowell so colourfully put it, the last thing one will have to do is hang up one's Armani jacket on the back of a cell door in Mountjoy Prison.  In the United States legislation positively encourages the role of whistle blower and conviction seems to be the norm when it has been established there has been a breach.  This rarely happens in London and never happens here.  The report of the Stock Exchange for last year adverts to the fact that three cases were referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions but so far as I am aware no prosecutions have been initiated.  This is unlikely to happen.  It seems therefore that one can commit these offences almost with impunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that we should not criticise the Bill on the grounds that it does not address the question of insider trading; that the question is addressed in the Companies Act, 1990.  There is a great deal of cynicism in this town about insider trading. I fail to see why this question is not addressed in the Stock Exchange Bill which is the first of its kind in over 200 years.  I understand that the commentators and experts agree that it is virtually impossible currently to prove insider trading and there is nothing in this Bill which will change that.  It is interesting to note that the London Stock Exchange is embroiled in controversy at present concerning the Jeffrey Archer affair.  I understand it is examining its rules and that changes are likely to be made.  It is likely that the burden of proof will be shifted to the defendant. At present, as it is difficult to secure a conviction, prosecutions are not initiated.  We seem to be incapable or unwilling to address the question of white collar crime and this adds to the cynicism of the public.  It is a major defect in the Bill that it does not address separately and distinctly the question of insider trading.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> We have had some bad experiences in this jurisdiction where ordinary people were the casualties of financial institutions.  There have been a number of heart rending collapses for the unfortunate investors, small investors in the main, rather than for those who controlled the financial institutions concerned.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey who is present in the House will be familiar with the book <i>Gibgate</i> produced by one of his constituents, a Mr. Flynn, which refers to the liquidation of a bank incorporated in Gibraltar, the principals of which are from this jurisdiction.  A significant number of unfortunate people lost their life savings in that scam, a great many of whom are members of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland.  The Minister of State and I have met them on occasion.  We seem to be incapable of addressing that question or securing any remedy for those people.  They have been arguing for a long time that a High Court inspector should be appointed under the Companies Acts to see what can be rescued, if anything, from the shambles.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, will not mind my saying that it appears he has changed his position since his days in Opposition because he then supported a position that I support, as indeed did Deputy Ruairi Quinn, who as Minister for Enterprise and Employment has responsibility for this matter, that we should seek to do what we can to tackle the situation.  The Government seems to have taken up the position that because the company in question has been incorporated outside the jurisdiction it is not possible to address it.  I would have thought that in these days of global economies, growing internationalisation, membership of the European Union and North-South <i>rapprochement</i> it ought to be possible to intrude that shameful collapse into these discussions at some level and by some stratagem seek to get some relief for the unfortunate people who were cheated in that scam.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary saga surrounding <Col N="2024" /> the placing of shares by Davys in the Greencore affair ought to be recorded. After all the brouhaha and the creation of a major political and public controversy at the time, the procedures of the Stock Exchange are such that after this investigation, which we were promised would reveal so much and have a definitive conclusion, we are still in a situation that the public knows virtually nothing about the outcome.  One has to be sceptical about the adequacy of internal procedures in a major case such as that. Presuming the investigation is concluded, which I believe it is, one has no accessible result from the investigation and inquiry into the serious issues that arose in that affair.</P>
    <P>In summary, anything that enhances the regulatory procedures of the Stock Exchange is welcome.  However, it is not clear whether the Central Bank is prepared to act as a policeman as well as a regulator.  The Central Bank may well be willing &mdash; and I do not know if it is able &mdash; to take on the role of regulator but when it comes to policing the procedures I greatly doubt if the Central Bank will consider that is its task.  Judging it on its record, I think it leaves something to be desired.  The mere transfer of these powers to the Central Bank alone is not something that should be considered automatically acceptable and hopefully this matter will be teased out on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Exchange has been in decline for some time; at a minimum it is fair to say that it has been static.  That stems partly from its reluctance to modernise itself and its reliance on the link with London.  That link is now severed and it raises a question about the viability of the exchange.  It is surprising that there has been no public debate on the matter.  I cannot say that my constituents &mdash; and I am sure the Northside constituents of the Minister for Finance are no different &mdash; think of little else other than the rules of the Stock Exchange but nonetheless it is an important public issue.</P>
    <P>It is surprising &mdash; and I do not know if it is related to how we do our work &mdash;<Col N="2025" /> that there has been virtually no public comment on this recently published Bill. That is extraordinary.  It is a sufficiently remote and secretive organisation in the eyes of a great many people, but I would certainly welcome expert commentators bringing some of these issues into the public arena before we proceed to Second Stage.  I trust the Minister will give us some latitude between the conclusion of Second Stage and Committee Stage to deal with some of the questions I have raised.</P>

      <P>While reflecting on Deputy Rabbitte's contribution I looked around and saw few in the Chamber, the empty public and press galleries and I thought of the lines from McNamara's Band &ldquo;although few in number we are the best band in the land&rdquo;.  This is typical of what happens during debates in this House.</P>
      <P>The quality of the debate has been excellent.  I do not always agree with Deputies Yates and McDowell.  Usually I disagree profoundly with them but they made some very good points during their measured contributions to this debate.  A great deal of thought had gone into what they had to say and they showed some liberal streaks, which I found rather surprising.  It was a pity they did not try to put some of those ideas into practice during their time in Government.  Deputy Rabbitte also made some excellent points.  Deputy McDowell ruined his contribution by his ritual denunciation of public enterprise and his plea for privatisation. Ideology should serve the people instead of the other way around.  We are far from being infallible but Deputy McDowell never seems to see anything wrong with his own doctrine and appears to think he is infallible.  A real politician would understand that we do our best to find solutions to problems most of the time but there are certainly people who are more skilled and gifted than we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A long time ago I learned in the catechism that a mystery was defined as <Col N="2026" /> something one could not fully understand.  The Stock Exchange reminds me of that as it is a mystery that most mortals do not understand.  I am not claiming that all the figures in it are sinister villains but most ordinary people have no understanding of what goes on there. The last time legislation governing the Stock Exchange was passed was in 1799, almost 200 years ago.  That speaks for itself.  America, the land of the free, of liberty and of market forces has the most convoluted and modern business laws governing the Stock Exchange.  In the land of the Mafia and of organised crime people go to jail and are fined huge amounts for such misdemeanours. Anyone who reads about Wall Street will know that they have very important laws to deal with the Stock Exchange and those laws exist side by side with organised crime and the Mafia whereas in Ireland we rely on unreformed law.</P>
    <P>This Bill is timely and the fact that there are very few Members in the House is no reason for not debating it thoroughly and amending it.  That might sound strange coming from a Government Deputy but that is how I feel about it.  I am not here to speak for the Government or to answer the questions posed by Deputy Rabbitte.  I cannot say whether the Central Bank is the best mechanism to deal with the Stock Exchange because I do not know.  I agree that an appropriate body with outside influence should have the teeth to deal with the Stock Exchange as that is necessary to protect the public interest and people's democratic rights. There is need for transparency, openness, democracy and, most importantly, public accountability in those structures. We have not had that in the past but that does not mean we cannot have it.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind about the body to benefit that role.  If the Central Bank has the confidence, the efficiency and the experience, I will accept that.  Several speakers, including Deputies Yates and McDowell, cast doubt on the competence of the Central Bank to fulfil this role in our society but that issue can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2027" /> Deputy Rabbitte asked why the separation from the London Stock Exchange has occurred now.  I do not know why and the answer has not been provided by the Minister.  Perhaps there was pressure from the European Union; there was a reference to that in the Bill and the Minister also referred to it and the need to bring our legislation governing stockbroking into line with other EU countries.  Perhaps the Minister will answer those questions.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Bill will meet our EC obligations and that it was important for us to have common international laws and regulations that would operate throughout the 12 countries of the EU and even further afield to govern transactions.  We learned to our cost 20 months ago, during the monetary crisis, how money can be moved from country to country at the press of a button and it highlighted the ineffectiveness of national governments in controlling speculation at that time. We must have some international code of practice governing that activity.</P>
    <P>It is important also that the Stock Exchange has the support of firms here because we have had some spectacular failures of stockbroking firms and companies.  If Lester Piggott or Ernest Saunders had lived here they would never have been charged, let alone sent to prison, for their misdemeanours.  Deputy Rabbitte was correct when he said one would have to think long and hard before one could remember somebody being convicted of wrongdoing in this area who went to prison.</P>
    <P>In regard to white collar crime and fraud, our fraud squad and police force are lagging behind in their ability to tackle this problem.  Many of the criminals involved in white collar crime simply laugh at the police and at the politicians because they believe we are only amateurs operating in an area where the professionals have been able to pull the wool over our eyes.  We must tighten our laws and their application so that money cannot be easily moved around.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for more <Col N="2028" /> informed financial journalism.  I read the <i>Phoenix</i> magazine &mdash; perhaps I should not &mdash; merely to see if my name appears in it.  When it does not I am fairly relieved.  However it is interesting to read about the various financial transactions although they are not written about in a serious way.  I had hoped some years ago with the development of financial journalism that people would understand a little more of what goes on and journalists would write about wealthy people not to lionise them or show them in their expensive hats and coats at racecourses and so on, but in a critical way in regard to how they made their money and whether it was in the public interest.  What we read, however, are reports of how these people spend their leisure time, their parties, their sons and daughters and their divorces.  There is no critical analytical assessment of them and that is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>One of our colleagues in the upper House, Senator Shane Ross, is a former stockbroker turned journalist.  He is well placed to write about high finance and business transactions but he seems to spend much of his time condemning people such as me and the Labour Party in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> I am sure there are other equally large targets to write about but for a man with such a background he writes very little about stockbroking and some of the activities I have described.  That is a pity because we could benefit from more informed journalism in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Bill outlines how to set up a stock exchange and how firms can qualify for membership.  That is important because every firm, including the stock exchange, must have proper directors, officers and shareholders but, above all, they must be accountable to the people who invest, to clients and to the general public.  There has been very little accountability in the past.  Indeed 200 years have passed since legislation governing stock exchanges was last enacted. If one examines the history of banking here in the last century one will find that most of the banks set up then collapsed very quickly.  When there was a <Col N="2029" /> run on the money in banks in Cork, Dublin and Limerick, many of them folded up causing consternation, recrimination and great misery for the people who invested in them.  While the banks more recently have remained free of crisis in that respect, many people who invested their money wisely and with good intention have been rooked. In some cases people even lost their pension funds because of unscrupulous people.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset the difficulty firms experienced in entering the Stock Exchange which was like a closed shop or an old boys club and as far as I am aware it was run by men only.  The attitude seemed to be &ldquo;you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours&rdquo;.  It was a cosy club and nobody on the outside seemed able to become a member. There are a few examples of small banking firms able to break into this area and they required great ingenuity, determination and courage to do so because their way was blocked.  That is not good enough.  We must have openness and transparency.  We cannot have a closed shop in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the Greencore debacle and Deputy Yates asked earlier whether insider trading took place here.  Of course it takes place.  The Greencore affair is a glaring example of insider trading where people used privileged information to enrich themselves at public expense.  That takes place throughout our society but we never hear about it.  The Greencore affair was merely the tip of the iceberg but there are many other &ldquo;Greencores&rdquo; about which we have not heard because there has not been sufficient proof and therefore they have not made the headlines.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important and serious attempt to introduce legislation to a vital part of our lives.  Its provisions affect not only the directors, officers and shareholders of the stock market but also investors and, most importantly, the general public.  We <Col N="2030" /> must get it right because it has implications not merely for the rarefied segment in the stock market but for society as a whole.  We are talking about behaviour that is illegal and people operating in this area must behave in an honest and ethical way.  We cannot have one law for people engaged in stockbroking and another law for the rest of us.</P>
    <P>We are a small player in the world of finance but it is important for us to do things right and to be honest in our affairs.  In any society, even where market forces operate, we need laws and regulations to control monetary affairs. I do not care how much an unbridled capitalist one is.  One cannot say &ldquo;I believe in a free market.  I believe in market forces that will dictate to society&rdquo;.  One cannot have such a simplistic attitude.  There must be rules and regulations governing economic life in any society otherwise there will be chaos and anarchy.  People would use inside information to enrich themselves and impoverish the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for the imposition of penalties for illegal and unauthorised activities and there is provision for up to £500,000 to be paid to the Central Bank.  I am not sure how that will be enforced.  The Bill also provides for penalties up to £1 million or ten years' imprisonment for offences committed, including failure to keep proper records and books, providing false and misleading information to an auditor and misappropriating clients' funds.  In spite of that, some laws are honoured more in the breach than the observance.  When penalties, no matter how draconian, are put on the Statute Book they should be enforced to deter unethical behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a late response to the crying need in society to regulate our monetary affairs and bring our legislation into line with European countries.  I believe in learning from the experience of others and I wonder if the Minister has examined the position in other countries to see how they closed loopholes in their legislation.  We must seek to make the banks and other financial <Col N="2031" /> institutions more accountable to the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the separation of our stock market from the London stock market.  Too often in the past we were not seen as an independent stock market but as an adjunct to London.  If we will have greater autonomy and if it will be beneficial in bringing greater transparency to the stock market then it will have been worthwhile.  If not, I would like to know why this is being done now.</P>
    <P>Time will tell if the Bill is a good one and if the Central Bank is capable of fulfilling the role entrusted to it.  The Minister must address the doubts that have been cast on the competence and skill of the Central Bank personnel to carry out this function.  In my limited experience of dealing with bankers and financiers, a freemasonary operates.  It is a small world and dog does not eat dog.  However, we must protect the public interest.  I see the Bill as an attempt to bring the legislation up to date.  The only way we can test the effectiveness of the Bill is to see how it works in practice in making the stock market more accountable to the House and the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this extremely important matter.  The recent and shocking revelations that a convicted paedophile was employed as chaplain to a Tralee hospital with unlimited 24 hour access to a childrens' ward necessitates the immediate introduction of extensive background checks on all those looking after children in residential centres and other areas.  Setting up the often mooted national register of child abusers is now, more than ever, a matter of urgency.  I urge the Minister to use the <Col N="2032" /> full powers of his office to act immediately and expeditiously to reassure the public that such a situation will not be tolerated again.</P>
      <P>Surely the introduction of procedures by which the health boards must be fully briefed and involved in the decision-making process on all appointments and now, in particular, pastoral appointments, must be deemed a matter for immediate action?  What action will the Minister take to set up an advice service for the parents of those children with whom this chaplain may have come in contact?  Who is to help them as they attempt to confront an issue which is repugnant to society?  Who is to counsel and reassure those vulnerable children? Will there be consultation between the parents, health board and the Church authorities?  Will the Minister demand and facilitate this?</P>
      <P>There is a suggestion in the newspapers today that the parents of these children should approach them and ask them what happened.  We are talking about the years August 1990 to September 1993.  What are the parents to say to their children?  Who will advise or help them?  We all know that it is not exactly a routine question any parent has to ask their child.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the role of the Church in this affair.  According to newspaper reports this morning among their number were people aware of the priest's criminal convictions before his appointment as chaplain to the Tralee hospital yet no one in any position of authority either in the hospital or the health board was informed.  Why?  The Church could not deal with the reality.  At the cost of the health and welfare of children they preferred to ignore the situation and hope it would go away.  Until the Church proves that it is capable of facing up to the real problems of sexual abuse, highlighted by this case, the Minister for Health must immediately act to ensure that they no longer have the right to unilaterally appoint staff to posts where they will come in contact with vulnerable young people in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> The public are informed and articulate.  At the recent Progressive Democrats conference in Cork, I called on the Minister for Education to say who is looking after the children.  I did not think at that time I would need to call so soon on the Minister for Health to ask him not to shirk his responsibilities to those who do not yet have a voice in society, our vulnerable children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue and allowing me an opportunity to comment on it.  I will being by commenting on the specific issue of the conviction for sexual offences of a former locum chaplain at Tralee General Hospital.  This priest was not employed as a chaplain to the children's ward alone but to the hospital as a whole.  It is deeply disturbing that a person in a position of trust, as Father Smyth was, could have been appointed in circumstances where a long history of allegations of child abuse appears to have been deliberately withheld from the health board concerned.</P>
      <P>The appointment of hospital chaplains is a function of the bishop of the diocese involved.  When the question of appointing a locum chaplain at Tralee General Hospital arose I understand written references were sought by the permanent chaplain from the candidate's superior, in this instance, his abbot.  I understand that these confirmed his suitability and that there was no reference to his previous history. The management of the Southern Health Board has already expressed its grave concern that despite its best efforts it was misled in this manner.  I can assure the House that I fully share the board's extreme disquiet, to put it at its mildest, at this action by Fr. Smyth's superiors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On discovering that Fr. Smyth had acted as chaplain in one of its hospitals on a number of occasions since 1990 the board immediately advised the Garda authorities of this fact.  It also alerted the director of community care and put <Col N="2034" /> in place arrangements to allow immediate access to social work services for any family concerned that their child might have been in contact with Fr. Smyth.  In addition, I understand the board has entered into discussions with the diocesan authorities for Cork and Kerry so as to review the system of appointing chaplains and locum chaplains to its hospitals.</P>
    <P>With regard to the vetting of staff working in children's residential centres, responsibility for selecting suitable persons for employment in these centres rests with the management involved.  In view of recent allegations of child sexual abuse in certain residential child care centres, I am taking steps to ensure greater vigilance in the selection of staff in each of these centres.  My Department is actively pursuing ways and means of improving the selection procedures for all staff applications for posts in children's residential centres.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I established a working group which is preparing draft standards for children's residential centres. The working group includes representatives of my Department, the health boards, the Resident Managers' Association, the Conference of Religious of Ireland and the Irish Association of Care Workers.  As part of its remit the working group is currently reviewing the guidelines on recruitment of child care workers which were first issued by my Department in 1979.  I am confident that this review will be completed by the end of the year and will lead to improvements in the recruitment and selection procedures for staff applicants in residential child care centres.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this review, I am concerned to ensure that immediate measures are put in place to provide for the safety and protection of children in care.  In this context, I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that my Department recently reached agreement with the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána on the introduction of a formal system of Garda <Col N="2035" /> clearance for applicants for posts in children's residential centres.  My Department is now making arrangements to have these Garda clearance procedures put in place in conjunction with the management and staff interests concerned.</P>
    <P>While this system will be an important additional part of the selection procedures, I am conscious that it will not of itself be a guarantee that unsuitable persons are prevented from working in residential child care centres. I urge all concerned with the recruitment of staff to be constantly vigilant in all aspects of the selection procedures to ensure the safety and protection of children in their care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I previously raised this matter on 14 April last with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Dea, who, I think, is chairman of the national co-ordinating committee and who has special responsibility for this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister of State has not been able to honour the commitments he made in April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter relates to a very serious social issue.  It is vitally important that urgent steps be taken to provide treatment for people addicted to heroin when they seek treatment.  It is a scandal that when heroin addicts turn up at treatment centres they are turned away and told their names will be put on the waiting list.  God only knows when those people will receive treatment.  In the meantime they are at the mercy of drug <Col N="2036" /> dealers and are driven to crime in order to pay for a fix.</P>
    <P>In April the Minister of State agreed that this situation was unacceptable, yet the waiting list at the centre in Amiens Street is the same, if not longer.  Two counsellors are employed in this drug treatment centre to treat 120 addicts, while there are more than 200 people on the waiting list.  This mirrors the situation which pertained in April.  A pharmacist is available for a half a day, five days a week to dispense methadone.  There is a clear need for the employment of additional staff in this centre.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State charged with responsibility for this very important issue has failed to meet his obligations, failed to honour the commitments he made in April and failed to make any impact on the waiting lists at these satellite clinics.  The clinic in Ballyfermot has a waiting list of approximately 150.  He has also failed to set up the two new satellite clinics he promised and to provide adequate staff and resources for the city clinic in Amiens Street.  In addition, he has failed to bring general practitioners into the service.</P>
    <P>This is a litany of failure by the Minister of State charged with the responsibility to care for those people who desperately need support and treatment.  In these circumstances, he has no alternative but to offer his resignation.  This may not be much comfort to the unfortunate victims of heroin addiction.  I hope the Minister will outline the steps he is taking at this very late stage to ensure that people seeking treatment for heroin addiction will not be turned away and will not simply become a name and number on a waiting list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gregory for sharing his time with me. The Minister of State should not be rushed into providing mobile clinics for the city of Dublin.  The Eastern Health Board is dealing with what is a very delicate situation and has engaged the services of the best counsellors, doctors and professionals to run satellite clinics. <Col N="2037" /> We cannot ignore the fact that communities are reluctant to accept the setting up of satellite clinics in their areas. It is, therefore, important to target those areas with acute drug problems through community drug teams.</P>
      <P>The satellite centres provide treatment for up to 250 addicts.  My colleagues in the Eastern Health Board and Dublin Corporation have been targeting the Dublin 8 area.  While this is a slow process we are making progress with a very dedicated community drug team which is gaining the confidence of people living in a particular flats complex which has a minimum of 60 drug abusers.  I appeal to the Minister to make adequate finance and personnel available to develop the concept of community drug teams with the specific task of targeting areas with acute drug problems.  This is the way forward.  Why is Trinity Court, which is under his jurisdiction treating only 23 addicts when the Eastern Health Board &mdash; for example, the Aisling Centre &mdash; is treating 145 addicts?  Will the Minister agree it is time he looked at the performance of Trinity Court and extended the mandate of the Eastern Health Board to service the drug addicts through the Trinity Court network?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for raising this important issue.  I am sorry the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Dea, did not have an opportunity to respond to Deputy Gregory's question yesterday.  Unfortunately we ran out of time for Priority Questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of services for drug misusers in the Dublin area is a matter for the Eastern Health Board.  As Deputy Gregory is aware, Government policy in the area of drug misuse is based on the national strategy formulated on the basis of the recommendations of the national co-ordinating committee on drug abuse.  Because of the high incidence of intravenous drug use among those who are HIV positive, <Col N="2038" /> the strategies for dealing with drug misuse and HIV AIDS are closely interlinked.</P>
    <P>Methadone maintenance programmes have been introduced as a means of stabilising the behaviour of drug misusers and preventing the spread of HIV through the use of contaminated needles.  To date, as the House is aware, three satellite clinics have been established in the Dublin area for the provision of methadone maintenance, in Baggot Street, Ballyfermot and Amiens Street.  The latter clinic is the one referred to by Deputy Gregory.  Methadone maintenance is also provided at the drug treatment centre in Pearse Street.  These satellite clinics, in addition to methadone maintenance, provide a wide range of services to drug misusers such as needle exchange, counselling, free condoms, outreach and risk reduction programmes and HIV testing. They have become victims of their own success in so far as waiting lists have developed in each clinic.  Some 350 people are now on methadone maintenance at the satellite clinics and approximately 400 people are on the waiting list for services, an issue with which I am unhappy.</P>
    <P>From January to September 1,506 people attended the drug treatment centres and 109 are currently on methadone maintenance.  Funding was allocated to the Eastern Health Board to allow for the provision of two additional clinics this year.  Because of opposition from local communities, progress on establishing these two clinics has been slower than anticipated.  Both Deputies will be aware that the Eastern Health Board is now, as a matter of urgency, examining the options available to it to provide an appropriate service for those currently on waiting lists and who have not been in receipt of a service to date. The board will continue the programme to provide a network of satellite clinics around Dublin which will provide services for communities within their particular catchment area.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that the report of the expert group on a protocol <Col N="2039" /> for prescribing methadone has recently been sent to general practitioners.  This offers another option for the provision of methadone maintenance for drug misusers, since it provides the necessary framework for support services which will allow general practitioners to become involved in prescribing methadone.  The intention is that drug misusers attending the satellite clinics who will have been stabilised on methadone, would then be referred to general practitioners who would take on the responsibility of ongoing treatment. This would have the effect of freeing places at the satellite clinics for those on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the combination of measures I have outlined will result in a significant reduction in the waiting lists.  I will take careful note of the specific points made by the Deputies and ensure that the Minister of State is made fully aware of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this important matter concerning the full-time status of the Ennis Teachers' centre which was opened in 1973 and was immediately successful.  In 1974 the Department of Education offered financial assistance towards the erection of a purpose built centre.  Since then the facility has moved to three locations, despite undertaking many initiatives.  The centre provided in-service support for over 534 primary teachers and services 123 primary and 19 post-primary schools.  The majority of Clare primary teachers have availed of this service even though some schools are 40 miles west of Ennis.  West Clare primary schools are 70 miles from Limerick but the uptake in Ennis was high because of its suitable geographical location in an essentially rural setting. Over 1,600 attendances were recorded in one year by the centre and in 1993 a total of 147 teachers registered for courses on assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2040" /> There have been many other examples of the enthusiasm with which the service was taken up.  The complete staff of St. Partick's comprehensive school at Shannon which has 56 teachers, Rice College, Ennis which has 30 teachers and Scariff Community College which has 31 teachers, attended three courses in the centre.  A whole staff development day for post-primary teachers of County Clare vocational education committee schools will be held during the November break.  A variety of subjects have been dealt with in the centre: ornithology and the primary teacher, children's emotional problems and teacher stress, keep fit and the primary teacher, archeology, computers and the teacher, craft in the classroom, video promotion and negligence in school and its legal effects.</P>
    <P>People are concerned about proposals to downgrade the Ennis teachers' centre.  They are disappointed that Clare will be the only county in Munster without a full-time teacher centre.</P>
    <P>If this downgrading occurs, it will be most regrettable particularly as the teachers demonstrated their ability to co-operate by working with such diverse groups as the Western Education and Library Board, Omagh, County Tyrone; Maoin Cheoil an Chlair; the Leader programme; Scoilsport; St. Patrick's Comprehensive School, Shannon; Rice College, Ennis; Mid and East Clare Arts and Crafts Association and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy.  Important people have also lectured in the centre. They include John McElroy, education officer from Omagh; Oliver Mahon, barrister; Sr. Thecla Kelly, Armagh; Dean Perdue, Killaloe; Maria Stubbings, Master of Education; Dr. Morris, University College, Limerick; Mícheal Ó Conghaile, school inspector, Department of Education; Sr. Geraldine Collins, speech therapist, Mid-Western Health Board; Dr. Tony Humphreys, B.A., with a Higher Diploma in Physical Education, Cork; Ms Dympna McNamee, Principal, St. Mary's School, Tyrone; Kieran Burke and Eugene <Col N="2041" /> Wall, Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick; Mr. Jim Lyons, chief executive officer and Don Herron of the Department of Education in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State for his support and agreement with the wishes of the teacher unions in County Clare, particularly the INTO.  They are strongly of the opinion that a full-time teachers' centre is necessary in Ennis and they want a full-time director appointed.  Will the Minister arrange a meeting with the Oireachtas Members from my constituency to discuss this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision has been made to amalgamate the Ennis and Limerick teacher centres. The Department of Education recently issued a discussion paper outlining proposals on the future organisation of a national network of education centres. It was clearly stated in the document that the proposals had not been adopted as official policy and that the discussion paper was being presented for consideration and feedback, in order to inform the debate on the development of an overall framework for in-career development.</P>
      <P>At present there are 25 teacher centres at various locations around the country.  Their purpose is to provide a meeting place for primary and post-primary teachers to discuss issues related to their work; to promote and facilitate in-career development; and to act as resource centres which would provide a library of educational materials.</P>
      <P>Of the existing network, nine are full-time centres with a fulltime director and the remainder are part-time centres whose directors receive an honorarium. The running costs of the centres are funded through grants from the Department of Education and through income generated from course fees and the sale of materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion paper envisaged that two new centres would be established and a further seven upgraded to fulltime status in order to provide a network of <Col N="2042" /> 18 fulltime centres throughout the country.  These would henceforth be known as main centres and provide a service for teachers in their respective catchment areas.  The proposal to exclude a number of existing part-time centres, including Ennis, from the fulltime network was on the basis of geographical location, and in no way denies that excellent work has been done to date in the centres.</P>
    <P>The discussion paper proposed that associate centres could be proposed by any main centre in its catchment area on the basis of regional requirements and such factors as the spread of school-teacher population, distance from the main centre, teacher interest, local needs etc.  Such centres, if established, would be run by a part-time director under the general management of the main centre.</P>
    <P>In setting out proposed locations for centres, Limerick Teacher Centre &mdash; an existing full-time centre &mdash; is designated as a main centre within the network, and is located near the existing part-time centre in Ennis.  The House will appreciate that the discussion paper provides a basis for the continued operation of part-time teacher centres, but on the basis of an assessment of needs in the overall region, and under the general management of the main centre.</P>
    <P>The rationale underlying this approach is to ensure, within a climate of scarce resources, that the best possible use is made of the incareer development budget, so that staff in all first and second level education institutions are located in the catchment area of a full-time main education centre, and that every region is catered for.  The proposals attempt to balance the need for economies of scale against the demands for local provision in various towns.  In that context, the geographical spread of provision has to be a prime consideration.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the document is a discussion paper only and has not been adopted as official policy.  It was presented to the Association of Teacher Centres in Ireland in order to further <Col N="2043" /> debate and elicit feedback.  Officials of my Department will shortly be attending an annual general meeting of the Association of Teacher Centres in Ireland in order to hear the responses to the proposals, and no decisions will be made until the consultative process has been completed.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to express my Department's appreciation of the excellent work being carried out in the Ennis <Col N="2044" /> Teacher Centre, and to stress again that considerations of geography underpinned the proposal not to upgrade the centre to fulltime status.  It will remain an associate centre.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to take up Deputy Carey's request to organise a deputation to the Department.  I will communicate with him in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 on Tuesday, 18 October 1994.</P>

      <P>I am aware of widespread concern about the possible detrimental effect on children of carrying heavy school bags.  The most practical and workable solutions to this problem, however, are most likely to be achieved at school level.</P>
      <P>Teachers and parents, working in partnership at individual school level, can make suitable practical arrangements for school work and homework. These involve timetabling and advance planning by teachers so that pupils know in advance what books are required on any particular day.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for storing books in schools, where this is possible, can also be helpful.</P>
      <P>Parents can ensure that school bags themselves do not add to the problems by being excessively heavy and also through ensuring that pupils do not carry unnecessary material in their school bags.</P>
      <P>Following the recommendations of the Cooney-Carey report, I am in the process of establishing a committee representing the NCCA, teachers, publishers, parents, women-equity groups and my Department to monitor the provision of textbooks and other materials for schools.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>I regret that data relating to the allocation of remedial teacher posts in the primary school system before 1990 is not readily available within my Department as the appropriate records were not kept or maintained.</P>
      <P>The number of remedial teachers currently in place is 1,133.  This includes 100 additional remedial teacher posts allocated with effect from September, 1994. The corresponding number in 1990-91 was 867.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of remedial teacher posts requested by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate with the official report.</P>
      <P>Breakdown of Remedial Teacher Posts at Primary Level by County.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed to have read newspaper reports that students are experiencing delays in receiving grant payments and I have asked my Department to prepare a report for me on the situation.  The reason for the delays may include incomplete income documentation from applicants, late registration in colleges, late applications for grant aid and applicants failing to notify Local Authorities/VECs about their final course acceptance.</P>
      <P>I made significant improvements this year to the operation of the grant schemes in order to ensure delays will not arise.  Overall the effect of and reaction to these changes has been very positive.</P>
      <P>I arranged to have the third level student support schemes issued at the end of April, 1994.  This allowed the Local Authorities and Vocational Education Committees an additional three months to process grant applications over and above that in previous years.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will recall I intend to transfer the administration of the grants schemes to the CAO in order to provide a better service to students.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 16 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>I intend to fulfil the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to establish an intermediate education structure.  The White Paper will elaborate in detail on the powers, functions and responsibilities of Regional Education Councils (RECs), which will be established under new legislation.  My intention, subject to final decisions at Government level, is that the RECs will have substantial co-ordination and support service functions, broadly along the lines proposed in the Position Paper on RECs, but informed by the subsequent roundtable discussions.</P>
      <P>In the Position Paper on RECs, it was recognised that specific arrangements would be necessary in relation to the ownership/trusteeship of Vocational Education Committee (VEC) schools. My view is that Vocational Education Committees would continue to function as statutorily-based providers of education within the framework established nationally by the Minister for Education and regionally by each REC.  Vocational education committees would have the same relationship with the RECs as the other providers of education, within their remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this framework, the vocational education committees would continue to own their schools and employ the <Col N="1937" /> staff in their schools.  The intention would be that all vocational education committee schools will have Boards of Management and the vocational education committees will appoint these boards, having regard to the criteria applying to all other schools.</P>
    <P>I also envisage that the vocational education committees would continue with their role in the provision of vocational education and training and adult and continuing education in their schools.  Other providers would also be free to have a role in the provision of these activities.  The RECs would act as the co-ordinating bodies in regard to these areas through their role as the channel for the delivery of Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>The role I envisage for vocational education committees would also ensure that there is a smooth transition into the new system.  The White Paper will set out in detail the transitional arrangements to the new structures.  It is also my firm intention that the necessary legislation would ensure that respective roles and responsibilities of RECs and vocational education committees are set out and that all schools and providers would enter the new structures on an equal basis.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing negotiated between the Department, the INTO and management bodies.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of Clonea national school on 30 September 1993 was 121 pupils which warrants a staffing in the current year of a principal and three assistants.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose to sanction the appointment of a fourth assistant teacher at this stage.</P>
      <P>I understand that the school's enrolment has increased to 132 in the current year and this will warrant the sanctioning of an extra post in September 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 27, 30 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the protracted history of the question of building a post-primary school for the Knocklyon-Scholarstown area.  Because of this I commissioned the Service Industries Research Centre of UCD under Dr. Michael Bannon to reassess the post-primary needs of the area.</P>
      <P>The report of this independent and expert assessment (popularly known as the Bannon report on Knocklyon) considered that a new post-primary school located in Knocklyon was not warranted.</P>
      <P>I have indicated my acceptance of the recommendations in the report and I do not intend to authorise the construction of a post-primary school for Knocklyon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I arranged for an official from my Department to discuss the feasibility of the implementation of the recommendations with the managements of the schools concerned and they indicated their full co-operation in the matter.  I consider that the report's recommendations are the most cost-effective <Col N="1942" /> method of ensuring that Knocklyon-Scholarstown pupils have access to post-primary schools within a reasonable distance and a choice of available schools. These recommendations relate mainly to the provision for boys.  There are adequate places available for girls in schools in the general area.</P>
    <P>Current costings within my Department indicate that implementation of the recommendations contained in the report on extending two of the post-primary schools within a reasonable distance of Knocklyon would cost £1.9 million as opposed to a cost of £4 million for providing a post-primary school for 800 pupils in Knocklyon.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that where expenditure of public moneys is involved I must have regard to the cost-effectiveness of any particular project in the light of the needs of the pupils in question, the many demands on my Department for capital expenditure and my resolve to take particular account of the needs of areas of most disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Dr. Bannon himself carried out the fullest consultation with all interested parties, including the Knocklyon-Ballyboden Post-Primary Committee, before arriving at his conclusions and recommendations.  I arranged that copies of the report be sent to TDs and to the post-primary committee before publication.  I will make arrangements to meet the Dáil Deputies for the area and the chairman of the post-primary committee.</P>
    <P>No decision has yet been taken in regard to the site purchased by my Department some years ago for the provision of a post-primary school in the area.</P>
    <P>Because of the shortfall of places for pupils in the Knocklyon-Scholarstown area, I am committed to the immediate implementation of the central recommendations of the report.  Planning of the necessary projects will start immediately and the necessary resources required will be made available in 1995.</P>

      <P>From September 1994, on the introduction of the restructured senior cycle programme, schools have been offered the option of providing the transition year programme.</P>
      <P>Schools wishing to offer the transition year programme for the 1994-95 school-year were required to notify my Department by January, 1994 of their intention to offer the programme.  A total of 575 schools did so.  A transition year had been in operation in 159 of those schools in the 1993/94 and previous school years.</P>
      <P>My Department is, at present, seeking confirmation from schools of the actual up-take and I will make this information available to the Deputy when it has been assembled.</P>
      <P>I have taken the following steps to assist schools in providing the transition year programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools already receive an allocation of teaching resources and grants towards recurrent costs in respect of recognised pupils, including pupils taking the transition year programme.  The <Col N="1945" /> rate of capitation grant for voluntary secondary schools was increased by £8 per pupil and by £23 per pupil in the case of disadvantaged schools.  The budgets of community and comprehensive schools and of vocational education committees were also increased.</P>
    <P>As a contribution towards the planning and coordination necessary to ensure that students derive maximum benefit from the programme, an additional grant of £50 per annum will be paid in respect of each pupil on the transition year programme.</P>
    <P>A video and a booklet on the restructuring of the senior cycle, including the transition year programme, has been produced and circulated to schools, students and parents.</P>
    <P>A special pack of resource material for the transition year programme has been developed and distributed to schools and is available from public libraries.</P>
    <P>Applications or additional accommodation, where required, are being dealt with as part of the second-level capital programme.</P>
    <P>An in-career development programme for the teachers in schools which opted to offer the transition year programme is under way.</P>
    <P>I have established two monitoring groups, one within my Department and one including representatives of managerial authorities, teacher unions and parents, to keep all aspects of the implementation of the senior cycle restructuring under review.</P>

      <P>My Department issues leaving certificate results direct to students' homes each year in the case of <Col N="1946" /> the 5,000 or so students who are admitted to the examination as non-school candidates.  The results of the remaining 60,000 or so students are issued to the schools which entered them for the examination.  My Department has no plans to issue leaving certificate results direct to student's homes in the case of the 60,000 school candidates.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons for this.  In the first place, it would be a huge task to record the 60,000 addresses and the inevitable changes of address. There would also be great room for error in notifying my Department of the correct address, in notifying changes of address or in recording the address.</P>
      <P>Secondly, An Post is in a position to guarantee next-day delivery of the results to the 800 post-primary schools. This could not be guaranteed in the case of 65,000 individual addresses in view of the sheer size of the task and the possibility of wrong addresses, out-dated addresses and imprecise addresses.  My Department's experience of issuing results direct to the 5,000 non-school candidates is that each year many claim that they have not received the results on the due day.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would not like to underestimate the role played by school principals in conveying the results directly to their students.  In particular, candidates who are disappointed will often be reassured by the school principal, at the time that they receive their results, that there are options open to them either for future study or for applying for a recheck.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the <Col N="1947" /> case made for additional accommodation for the Cork School of Music.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, an extension to the school was at an advanced stage of planning in 1985 when, having regard to the financial circumstances at that time and the need to utilise funds for capital projects in areas of greatest priority, the planning of the project had to be deferred.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January 1993 the school has been incorporated into the Regional Technical College, Cork under the terms of the Regional Technical College Act 1992 &mdash; it previously operated under the city of Cork Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>A submission by the regional technical college to my Department for capital funding under the 1994-99 European Regional Development Fund programme in respect of a broad range of projects for the college, included a proposal in respect of the extension of the school of music.  As already indicated in my press statement of 13 January 1994, a sum of £3.75 million has been included in my Department's 1994-99 European Regional Development Fund submission to the EU for capital developments at the college.  Regrettably, it was not possible in the specific allocation to the Cork Regional Technical College, to include the school of music project.  As an interim measure, however, my Department gave approval last autumn for the remitting of additional space for the school.</P>
      <P>The present position with regard to the proposed extension for the school of music is that following consultation with the director of the regional technical college my Department has received a revised submission, prepared by the school of music.  It, together with a number of other project proposals which have been received from the regional technical college, are at present under examination.  The revised submission of the school of music was necessary due to the many new developments which have arisen since the plans for the extension were originally prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1948" /> On completion of the examination and when the proposed project has been fully evaluated it will be considered in the context of the capital money's available to my Department.</P>

      <P>Grant assistance is provided for sport and recreation facilities by my Department under the recreational facilities scheme and under the major sports capital programme.  The total allocation provided for the recreational facilities scheme since the introduction of the national lottery in 1988 amounts to £8.9 million, which includes £3 million from Exchequer funds provided in the 1994 budget.  The total amount allocated specifically to youth facilities amounts to £517,000 or 5.8 per cent of total available under this scheme.</P>
      <P>A total of 81 applications specifically in respect of youth facilities were received by my Department earlier this year in response to the advertisement seeking applications under the scheme. Grants totalling £227,000 were allocated to 39 projects which represents 48 per cent of the applications received.</P>
      <P>The projects assisted include the provision, refurbishment and improvement of scout dens, youth clubs and other youth facilites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the major sport facilities programme up to 100 major sports projects have been assisted including swimming <Col N="1949" /> pools, sports centres, community centres, playing pitches, athletic racks and a wide variety of other sport and recreation facilities.</P>
    <P>These projects include new facilites, extensions and refurbishment of existing facilities.  Total expenditure under this scheme from 1988 to end of 1994 will be £23 million.  It is not possible to indicate the specific amount spent on new facilities in the youth area, as requested by the Deputy.  It is a condition for the payment of grants under this programme that all facilities be accessible to the community including youths groups.</P>
    <P>I would also point out to the Deputy that my Department receives separate funding for the provision of youth services.  A total of £12 million is being provided for this service in 1994 and the main schemes involve grants to national youth organisations, grants for projects to assist disadvantaged youth, grants for youth information centres and youth exchange programmes.  The total amount allocated for these youth services from 1987 to 1993 £62.8 million.</P>

A means tested grants scheme to cover both fees and maintenance for students who participate in post-leaving certificate courses which are provided in schools and colleges outside the third level sector would cost of the order of £10 million per annum.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the proposal from the Parents Association for Vocational Schools and Community Colleges in regard to grant for PLC students.  I will be meeting with the National Parents Council in the near future and I expect that this proposal will be amplified by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply of 4 May <Col N="1951" /> 1994 a balance has to be struck between competing demands for resources in the education sector &mdash; between funding for the different levels of the system, between initial and second change education, between student supports, investment in quality assurance, and special measures to combat disadvantage and under achievement.</P>

      <P>Eligibility for VTOS includes the requirements that a person be unemployed for six months or more and seeking paid employment.  It is on this basis it receives EU structural fund support and being on the live register satisfies these requirements.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this provision, I succeeded last year in having a quota of up to 10 per cent of places allocated to lone parents and other welfare categories.</P>
      <P>My Department is not in position to exceed this 10 per cent even where there are vacancies on courses otherwise.  Vocational education committees are expected to make every effort to fill places outside the 10 per cent quota from those on the live register.  My Department also allows for a margin of vacancies in allocating places.</P>
      <P>The question of eligibility for VTOS will be one of the areas that will come up for consideration in the context of the work of the recently established task force on long term unemployment.  This will include issues such as position of unregistered unemployed people.</P>

      <P>I would hope that this approach will result in the pupils developing a basic familiarity with the language and some practice in its informal use which will be of benefit when they transfer to infant classes.  The operation of this approach will be monitored on an ongoing basis. A sum of £344,000 has been allocated to the pre-school programme in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme will initially operate in eight locations which have been targeted because of the high level of disadvantage in the area in question.  Each of the eight pre-school centres will cater for up to sixty pupils aged between three and four years.  Each centre will <Col N="1960" /> consist of two classrooms and each classroom will have the services of a fully qualified primary teacher and a special needs assistant.</P>
    <P>A capitation rate of £55 per child will be paid to the board of management of the base national school to which the pre-school is attached.  In addition, a start up grant of £4,500 per classroom will be made available to each centre to enable them to purchase the necessary equipment.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the important role played by existing playgroup services and it is certainly not my intention that the new pre-school programme should compete with these services in any way. Indeed.  I consider that the new pre-school programme will complement existing initiatives in the playgroup area.

      <P>In July, I issued a position paper on the governance of schools outlining illustrative models for boards of management in all schools, based on the principles of plurality, partnership and accountability.  A two day meeting involving the concerned interests was held in September.  I am now carefully considering the outcome of the meeting.</P>
      <P>The process of multi-lateral dialogue involves each of the interested parties setting out their position, giving consideration to the position of others and perhaps revising their own position as a result.  The aim of this dialogue is to give the partners in education the collective opportunity to consider the issues raised, to develop on areas of agreement.  I am confident, given the very constructive nature of the debate to date and the very high level of engagement among the partners with the issues, that the issuing of the paper and the ensuing debate will greatly facilitate both myself, as Minister, and the Government in finalising proposals on these key issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution of the EU Council of Ministers of Education to which the Deputy refers calls on member states to intensify, where necessary, their efforts to integrate or encourage integration of pupils and students with disabilities, in all appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of that resolution, it is the policy of my Department to encourage the maximum possible level of integration of children with disabilities into ordinary schools.  However, the pace of development and the degree to which integration can be achieved will vary depending on the specific and evolving needs of the children concerned.  It is important that a range of responses be available to meet the variety of needs which can arise and I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to ensuring that this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some children, integration in the ordinary classroom is possible, supported, if necessary by a remedia teacher, a resource teacher or the visiting teacher service.  In other cases, placement in a special class in an ordinary school is the most suitable solution <Col N="1963" /> In the more severe cases, placement in one of the dedicated special schools may be the most appropriate solution.</P>
    <P>At present, 1,133 remedial teachers are in place, including 100 posts which were allocated in September 1994.  The corresponding number of teachers at second level is 275, which includes 25 additional posts which I allocated this year.  The Visiting Teacher Service was also supplemented by the addition of a further 8 teachers in 1992, bringing the total number of teachers in the service to 37.</P>
    <P>An additional six teachers were appointed in 1993, bringing the total in place to 13.  This year, I intend to make further resource teacher appointments to selected ordinary schools to facilitate the integration of groups of children with disabilities on their rolls.</P>
    <P>The approach which I am taking towards the implementation of the EU resolution is a flexible one, which seeks to accommodate where possible the preferences of parents in the placement of, and provision for, their children.  In adopting this approach, I am supported by the report of the special education review committee, which calls for a continuum of services to math the continuum of special needs.</P>
    <P>I should point out that a Departmenttal task force is examining the recommendations contained in the review committee's report with a view to drawing up a phased action plan for its implementation.  It is my intention to be as positive as possible in relation to these recommendations and to implement them as quickly as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The European Community Council Directive of 25 July, 1977, on the education of the children of migrant workers applies only to children for whom school attendance is compulsory under the laws of the host State.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the terms of the Directive do not apply to third level education.  However, membership of the EU obliges the relevant authorities in all the member states no to discriminate between their own nationals and nationals from other member states in the administration of their schemes of third level student support or in access to third level education generally.</P>
      <P>The benefits and conditions of whatever students support schemes or other arrangements for access to third level courses which apply to a member state's students who are nationals, must be applied in an identical fashion to students who are nationals of another member state.</P>
      <P>As a result of these obligations, the situation regarding third level students from Ireland studying in the UK, for example, is that practically all under-graduate students from Ireland qualify to have their fees paid by the UK authorities.  In order to qualify for maintenance grants, they must have been resident in the UK for three years, which is the same requirement that applies to UK students.</P>

      <P>The incident in question <Col N="1965" /> took place on the evening of 21 September, 1994 and involved three boys detained at the centre.</P>
      <P>The boys in question had been engaging in disruptive behaviour throughout the day and as a result had been directed to go to their bedrooms at 8 p.m.  The incident began while the boys were using the toilet facilities prior to retiring.  During this period, the boys were under the supervison of two care staff.</P>
      <P>In what appears to have been a pre-planned action, the three boys gathered in one of the bedrooms and when staff attempted to remove them, one of the boys produced a piece of metal with which he threatened staff.</P>
      <P>A period of stand-off ensued, during which staff of the centre, including the centre's psychologist, attempted to persuade the boys to abandon their action. These efforts resulted in one boy abandoning his action.  The remaining two boys proceeded to damage sink units and windows in the unit.  In the meantime, the centre had called for the assistance of the Garda.  Following the arrival of the gardaí, the remaining two boys were eventually restrained and having been thoroughly searched, were confined to their bedrooms.</P>
      <P>Arising from this incident, a thorough review of security arrangements was undertaken by the centre and corrective action was taken where necessary.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that the nature of young offender centres is such that difficulties of the type described will inevitably arise from time to time. However, I can assure the House that every effort is made to avoid such situations and to deal with them in an effective manner where they do arise.  The fact that no serious injury resulted from this incident and that only minor damage was caused, is a tribute to the professionalism of the staff in the centre and to the gardaí who came to their assistance and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all concerned.</P>

I understand that a sum of £27,134 has been allocated this year to the Roscommon Regional Youth Service by the National Youth Federation.  This figure does not give the complete picture for grants for youth services in County Roscommon.

      <P>Many of the measures advocated by my Department to reduce the financial burden on parents also have the beneficial effect of reducing the actual number of textbooks in the school system. For instance, the operation of school book loan/rental schemes obviously reduces the number of books in circulation.</P>
      <P>However, textbooks must be changed periodically if teachers are to keep their work educationally stimulating and if content and methodology are to be kept up to date.

      <P>A sum of £320,000 has been made available to facilitate the payment of grants to national schools encountering serious financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Early Start&rdquo; programme of pre-school education has been put in place in selected areas of high disadvantage in September, 1994.  Eight areas have been targeted in the initial pilot phase of this programme.</P>
      <P>The scheme for the payment of television licences for schools in disadvantaged areas is being continued in the current year.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level the provision for special initiatives to improve retention of second level pupils from disadvantaged areas has been increased by £222,000 to £780,000 for 1994.  These initiatives include programmes to enhance parental involvement in their children's education; the establishment of linkages between post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas and third level institutions; payment of grants towards the running costs of junior training centres for travellers.</P>
      <P>Fifty five additional teaching posts have been allocated to post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas with effect from the beginning of the 1994-95 school year.</P>
      <P>Five new visiting teachers will be appointed to encourage traveller children to avail of second level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional fifteen second level <Col N="1972" /> schools have been invited to partake in the home-school-community liaison scheme in the 1994-95 school year.  Each of these schools is being allocated an additional 11 teaching hours per week. In addition, a grant of £2.00 per pupil is paid to participating schools subject to a minimum of £1,000 per school.</P>
    <P>In addition to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant of £158 schools which have been classified as disadvantaged receive an additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £15.</P>
    <P>In 1994 a provision of £391,000 has been made for the allocation of grants to schools as seed capital to set up book rental schemes.  Eighty-six schools which have been classified as disadvantaged have been allocated grants on the basis that they committed themselves to setting up such rental schemes for the first time.</P>
    <P>The cost of the scheme for the alleviation of the fees for the certificate examinations for necessitous pupils increased from £360,000 to £394,000 in 1994.</P>

      <Quest>if he will change the practice currently in operation in his Department whereby letters to the next of kin of deceased pensioners are sent out within a week to ten days of the death causing great distress to the relatives with particular reference to the case of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is obliged to ensure that social welfare recipients and their dependants are paid their correct entitlements.  Consistent with this obligation, it is very important that the next of kin of deceased pensioners receive any outstanding payments as soon as possible after the death of a pensioner. Prompt payments to next of kin are very important at a time when funeral expenses can be extremely worrying for many families.</P>
      <P>When the death of the pensioner concerned was reported to my Department, the date of death was not specified in the notification supplied.  In order to determine if any payments were due to the next of kin, a form requesting details of the date of death issued to the late pensioner's representative shortly after receiving notification of the death of the pensioner.  It was the issue of this inquiry form in this particular case that prompted the Deputy's query.</P>
      <P>My Department is notified routinely of more than 20,000 pensioner deaths each year.  In many cases, not all relevant information is supplied at the time of notification of these deaths to enable all aspects of the pensioners' entitlements to be finalised.  Where incomplete information is supplied, it is necessary to have an inquiry procedure in place, such as was issued in the particular case referred to by the Deputy. In issuing the inquiry form in this case, my Department was acting in good faith and was not aware at that time of any specific circumstances involved which may have caused distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> The practice of obtaining information from next of kin about deceased pensioners is necessary and is of overall benefit for pensioners' families. However, I have arranged that the Pension Services Office will review its procedures to ensure that information pertaining to the deaths of pensioners is sought in as sensitive a manner as possible in each case.</P>

      <P>The smokeless fuel allowance of £3 already available to people in the Dublin area will be paid in Cork to recipients of social welfare and health board payments living in the restricted areas who meet certain conditions when the ban on bituminous coal commences. In future years, it will be paid from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>People on social welfare, living in the restricted areas of Cork who will receive the new allowance includes:</P>
      <P>&mdash;all households which already receive a weekly fuel allowance of £5 under the National Fuel Scheme.  Their allowance will now rise to £8 per week.  They include all long term social welfare and health board recipients who are unable to provide for their own heating needs and live alone or live only with dependants or other social welfare recipients who are also qualified for a fuel allowance;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1976" />&mdash;people receiving short term unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or disability benefit for at least three months or Family Income Supplement (FIS) who meet the other conditions outlined above for qualifying for a fuel allowance under the National Fuel Shcme.  Their weekly payments will be increased by £3.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for payment of this allowance are as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare Pensioners already receiving a Fuel Allowance</i>
    </P>
    <P>Pensioners who live within the designated area will have the fuel allowance of £5 already included in their normal pension book for the winter fuel season. An additional book containing weekly payable orders of £3 for the relevant period will be issued to them as soon as possible.  This will top up their fuel payment to £8 weekly.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Health Boards Clients</i>

    <P>These clients apply for an allowance under the National Fuel Scheme through the local health centres.  The additional £3 allowance per week will also be paid through the local health centre.</P>
    <P>
      <i>People receiving Disability Benefit for at least three months</i>
    </P>
    <P>These recipients are paid by weekly cheques and the new allowance will be included in the weekly cheque.  In the case of people on long term disability and who are paid by book, an extra book containing payable orders for the additional £3 a week smokeless fuel supplement will be issued to customers resident in the designated areas as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Part V of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, which empowers county councils and county borough corporations to make by-laws to apply local speed limits without the need for the approval of the Minister for the Environment, is in effect since 22 July 1994. The preparation and adoption of speed limit proposals in County Galway is therefore a matter for Galway County Council, acting in consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  In the case of proposals relating to national roads, the Council must obtain the consent of the National Roads Authority.</P>

      <Col N="1983" /> The rates for local authority variable and convertible loans are those applicable at 13 October 1994 and are generally related to prevailing market rates.</P>
    <P>The rates for local authority fixed rate loans (which were not advanced since 1 December, 1987) were fixed by reference to the cost of long term funds to the Exchequer or the HFA at the time the loans were made.</P>
    <P>The rates for HFA loans are those that applied for the year ended 30 June, 1994 and are based on the rate of inflation for the year ended mid-May, 1994.  The difference in the two rates charged by the HFA is due to the different operating margins chargeable under the loan contracts.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy, as I stated in previous answers to parliamentary questions in this House, that investigation of problems with the reception of RTE 1 and Network 2 is a matter for RTE in the first instance.  RTE have the technical expertise and the local resources to investigate such complaints effectively. If, following those initial investigations, there is evidence of interference from another frequency spectrum user, RTE will inform my Department which then takes responsibility for the matter and liaises directly with RTE.</P>

    <P>I understand the issue to which the <Col N="1990" /> Deputy is referring has been brought to the attention of RTE who have investigated it and identified the source of the problem which is the Garda Communications System in the area.  RTE and the Garda are jointly addressing the issue and they believe that they will shortly have a solution to the problem.  My Department will be kept informed of developments.</P>

      <P>A draft EU Directive on Parental Leave which would provide for leave for both birth and adoptive parents was considered at the meeting of the Council of Ministers of Labour and Social Affairs on 22 September 1994.  Ireland supported the draft Directive but the measure failed to secure the unanimity of support required for adoption by the Council. The Commissioner for Social Affairs has signalled the likelihood that the Commission will now take an initiative in this area under the Maastricht Treaty Agreement on Social Policy.</P>
      <P>I understand that the recent Labour Court decision in relation to adoptive paternity leave is the subject of appeal to the High Court.  The outcome of that appeal will be considered when it becomes available.</P>

The first of these payments was made last July and the second payments are in the process of being made.  Third and final phase payments are proposed to be made in November next.  All groups, including the group to which the Deputy refers, have been informed about their position.  The allocations to the group concerned are £18,500 and £23,500 in July and October respectively.  Third phase payments will be notified in due course to all groups. Subject to budgetary considerations my aim is to maintain the system which I have put in place in 1994 for the development of marriage guidance and counselling services.</P>

      <P>The patient concerned was placed on the out-patient waiting list for orthopaedic treatment at Merlin Park Regional Hospital, Galway on 7th June 1994 but it is not possible for the Western Health Board to provide an appointment date at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of hospital appointments is a matter for the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always given priority. Should the patient feel that his condition has deteriorated he should return to his general practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of his case directly to the consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that under <Col N="1992" /> the Waiting List Initiative 1994 a total of £850,000 has been allocated to the Western Health Board for the provision of 1,222 additional procedures, including 109 orthopaedic procedures.  This should help to reduce the overall waiting time for patients in the specialties targetted.</P>
    <P>In addition, Development Funds of £400,000 were provided to the Board this year for the expansion of orthopaedic services at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  As a result, approval has issued to the Western Health Board to recruit a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and a consultant anaesthetist together with the necessary support staff.</P>

      <P>All sources of ionizing radiation used in hospitals are subject to control by licence issued by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), which is the competent authority in this area.  The detailed procedures in operation in any particular hospital are a matter for that hospital under the RPII licensing arrangements.</P>
      <P>The general practice is that sealed radioactive sources used by hospitals are returned to the manufacturers. Other radioactive sources used in medical treatment and diagnosis tend to have a short active life.  If necessary, these sources are held in storage until such time as the radioactivity has decayed to a negligible level, at which stage they may be disposed of as non-radioactive waste.  These principles apply to all hospitals, including the hospitals in the Southern Health Board area.</P>

The Irish Marrow Registry was set up under the aegis of the Blood Transfusion Service Board in 1989 to provide volunteer bone marrow donors for patients needing bone marrow transplants who did not have compatible family donors.  The registry is linked to other similar registries worldwide.</P>
      <P>The Irish Marrow Register is administered by the Blood Transfusion Service Board and was set up mainly by funds provided by voluntary sources.  The initial target of 10,000 people on the Register has been achieved.  It is now estimated that the figure of 10,000 will have to be substantially increased over the coming years.  The Board is carrying out a review of the level of resources which would be necessary to fund this expansion.  I understand that the results of this examination will be reported to me as soon as it is complete.</P>

      <P>Traditional definitions of illiteracy, as an absolute, are no longer employed.  The concept is seen as outdated.  To define the issue clearly, researchers most recently have adopted various measures of functional literacy to determine the number of people with serious literacy problems.</P>
      <P>Irish nine year olds and 14 year olds participated in the international literacy studies conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement &mdash; IEA &mdash; in 1991.  A random sample of 3,500 children was involved.  In an analysis of the data from this study, three criteria were used to determine the percentage of 14 year olds exhibiting serious literacy problems.  Under all three criteria, the estimated percentage of Irish 14 year olds with serious literacy problems was in the range of 6.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>There is no reliable estimate of the number of Irish adults who have serious literacy problems.  My Department has commissioned a survey to be conducted by the Education Research Centre to establish literacy levels among the adult population in Ireland.  The results of this survey are expected to become available in early 1996.</P>

      <P>In 1990 and 1991 my Department issued <i>Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline</i> together with <i>A Suggested Code of Behaviour and Discipline</i> to all schools.  School authorities were reminded in the guidelines that the managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.</P>
      <P>Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up a code of discipline appropriate for that school.  In drawing up the code, school authorities should have regard to the guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
      <P>In October 1993, following consideration of submissions received from school managerial authorities, teacher unions, the National Parents' Council and other interested parties, my Department issued <i>Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour in Primary and Post-Primary Schools.</i></P>
      <P>I am confident that guidelines issued by my Department are of very real benefit and assistance to all concerned in the development of a school behaviour policy.  It is recommended in my Department's guidelines that school authorities monitor the effectiveness of school behaviour policies.

      <P>The Equality Working Group in my Department co-ordinates and monitors departmental activities relating to equality of opportunity for girls and boys in education.  It ensures that all gender interventon projects, initiated by my Department, are monitored and evaluated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I took office in 1993 the measures-activities undertaken largely focus on the primary and post-primary sector.  This is in order to introduce both girls and boys to non-traditional subject choices at an early age to ensure that the manner in which programmes are <Col N="1999" /> delivered does not unwittingly reinforce gender bias.</P>
    <P>Measures-activities include: (a) a series of regional seminars organised in 1993 following the national dissemination of the FUTURES project.  This was followed by three joint seminars organised by my Department and the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland &mdash; ASTI.  The focus of these seminars was on gender issues relating to post-primary education with particular reference to encouraging greater participation by girls in non-traditional career paths; (b) dissemination of results of the intervention projects in physics and chemistry.  These projects were designed to encourage more girls to study these subjects by introducing them into schools in which they were previously unavailable; (c) the development of science resource centres to provide support and encouragement to schools and teachers in promoting the benefits of following senior cycle programmes in the physical sciences; (d) participaton by my Department in exhibitions-seminars organised to promote science and technology; (e) an awareness pack distributed to all primary schools earlier this year.  The pack contained copies of recent relevant reports including the GEAR report on the gender gap in primary schools and the report on the elimination of sexism and sex stereotyping in textbooks; (f) the funding of a manual to accompany a video on sex stereotyping produced by the Irish Advisory Group of the European Commission Network on Diversification of Vocational Choice for Young and Adult Women.  My Department also undertook the distribution of the manual and video to schools; (g) in 1993 my Department commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to carry out a comprehensive research project on co-education in second-level schools.  The project is due to be completed in the 1995-96 school year; (h) all in-service courses for primary and post-primary teachers approved by the Incareer Development Unit of my <Col N="2000" /> Department include a module on gender equity or actively promote gender equity; (i) increased provision for career guidance in post-primary schools.  Thirty ex-quota whole-time equivalent career guidance posts were allocated and a further 45 whole-time equivalent posts have been allocated in 1994.  This service will be further enhanced by the National Guidance Centre which is in the process of being established; (j) the nomination of an equality officer in my Department to develop and implement an equal opportunities policy; (k) I am currently bringing before the Dáil amendments to the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, and the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, to facilitate the implementation of the Government's gender balance policy on the selection and appointment of governing bodies; (l) in line with a recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, my Department has set up a committee to review the recruitment, development and working procedures of primary and post-primary school inspectors with the aim of increasing the number of women inspectors.  The committee is chaired by the chief inspector of my Department; (m) under the New Opportunities for Women &mdash; NOW &mdash; Programme, initiatives for the recruitment of more women students in non-traditional areas are taking place in Cork Regional Technical College and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Further initiatives are anticipated in other colleges.  In October 1993, a new B.A. evening course in women's studies commenced in University College Dublin The Women's Education Research and Resource Centre at UCD also offers an MA course and a postgraduate diploma as well as an evening non-graduate certificate course. The National Unit for Equal Opportunities was established in University College Cork with assistance from the Higher Education Authority to collect and distribute information on gender issues in higher education; (n) my Department funded the &ldquo;Role Model&rdquo;<Col N="2001" /> booklet produced by Women in Technology and Science &mdash; WITS &mdash; Group; (o) a project entitled &ldquo;Boys and Girls come out to Play&rdquo; was conducted and published by the Physical Education Association of Ireland in 1993.  This research was funded by my Department and monitored by the Sports Research Committee.</P>
    <P>The reaction to these initiatives have been very positive.  The Physics and Chemistry Intervention Projects have attracted substantial interest from many groups.  OECD have expressed great interest in the projects and have carried out an in-depth study of them.</P>
    <P>The framework and materials of the Diversification Project currently being undertaken by the Flemish Community in Belgium is based on the FUTURES project.  The class materials developed as part of this project is in its third print.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision of in-service training, participant reactions to training courses on gender equity have been very positive.  However, the results of some of the initiatives I have described will not, of their nature, be fully evident for some time.  However, I am convinced that the removal of barriers to complete access to the full range of what our educational system has to offer both girls and boys can only have positive results.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a new special school dedicated to the needs of children with specific learning disability has recently been established at Balrothery, Tallaght.  This new school, which is located at Scoil Aengusa, Balrothery, will cater <Col N="2002" /> for 36 pupils from the west county Dublin area and represents an important advance in provision for children with specific learning disability.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the level of funding made available to boxing clubs throughout the country under schemes operated by my Department is satisfactory.  While there are no specific proposals to increase funding for boxing clubs outside these schemes, I would point out that the annual grant paid to the Irish Amateur Boxing Association has been increased this year and in 1993.</P>
      <P>Under my Department's capital programmes a grant of £100,000 was provided in 1990 to the Irish Amateur Boxing Association for refurbishment works at the National Boxing Stadium and a grant allocation of £150,000 is currently being provided for further development works at the stadium.  A grant of £30,000 was allocated to Glen Boxing Club, Cork in 1989 for renovations to their clubhouse.  A list of recent grant allocations made to boxing clubs under my Department's recreational scheme is being circulated in the official report.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above scheme, boxing clubs are eligible for funding at local level under the annual youth and sport scheme operated by the vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the annual scheme of grants for national sporting organisations a <Col N="2003" /> grant is paid annually to the Irish Amateur Boxing Association which is the recognised national governing body for the sport of boxing.  This annual grant is to cover expenditure in the areas of administration, coaching, the purchase of special equipment, support for outstanding sportspersons, attendance at technical or executive meetings of the international federations and international competitions.  In common with all other sports, funds are channelled through the national governing body, the IABA, which has responsibility for the development of the sport at club, county, regional and national levels.</P>
    <P>In 1992 a once off special grant scheme was introduced to assist boxing clubs nationwide in the purchase of equipment.  I am satisfied that this scheme improved the standard of training facilities available to boxers at club level.  The scheme was operated by the Irish Amateur Boxing Association who sought tenders by way of public notice in the press.  Following analysis of the tenders received by officials from the Department and the IABA it was decided to award a contract to a single supplier.</P>

      <P>Some 81 per cent of students who applied for a third level place through the CAO/CAS in 1993 obtained an offer of a place, although not all of these offers were accepted.

      <P>I can confirm the accuracy of reports that research undertaken on behalf of the Steering Commmittee on Third Level Education shows very high disparities in the participation rates in third level education by students from different areas in Dublin.  These present findings confirm the unequal participation by different social groups in higher education and, of course, give cause for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should stress that even though the research results appear to be very interesting and relevant, I have not yet received any reports or recommendations from the steering committee. This committee was set up by me in December 1993 and is at present examining the future development of higher education.  A variety of technical working papers on aspects of the remit of the committee have been prepared by a technical working group which is assisting the steering committee.  Only preliminary discussions have taken place and no final conclusions have been reached or recommendations made by either the technical working group or the steering committee.  This is the <Col N="2006" /> second time that reports submitted to the steering committee have been &ldquo;leaked&rdquo; to the media.  At the least this does not help the steering committee in its analytical work and in submitting recommendations to me.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to give a considered policy response to these reports until I have received a report from the steering committee.  However, a number of valuable indicators do seem to be emerging from this work.  One of the conclusions is that students who do well in the leaving certificate are likely to go on to third level irrespective of their social and economic background.  This conclusion confirms my own view that the struggle for equality of opportunity may be won or lost at primary and post primary levels and even at pre-school.  As the Deputy knows, I have implemented a range of decisions to improve the situation for disadvantaged students at all levels &mdash; not just third level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" /> Nonetheless, in this case, the service has been allowed to continue, as an exceptional matter, since September, 1990 when the number of eligible pupils fell to five.  When the number of eligible pupils fell to four, a preliminary notice of withdrawal of the service was sent to the chairperson of the school's board of management, indicating that the service could not be retained after Easter, 1995. I understand that there are now only three eligible pupils involved.  No final notice of withdrawal will however be issued pending consideration of a further report which Bus Éireann has been asked to furnish before the end of the Easter term.</P>

      <P>Subject to resource constraints I intend to continue to develop the schemes of student support particularly with a view to making them as equitable as possible.  Under the existing 1994 schemes of student support the relevant reckonable income limits are increased by £2,000 where there are two such children attending full-time third level education, by £4,000 for three such children and so on, by increments of £2,000.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee on third level students support reported to me on 11 November 1993.  Arising from my consideration of the group's report I have already implemented a number of improvements in the student support arrangements such as: the abolition of the separate attainments for eligibility for a grant; this will ensure that all students who have secured a college place will now qualify for a grant subject to their meeting the means test; the introduction of new rules for second chance cases; this is to ensure students who did not complete their initial studies will be eligible to apply for grants for second chance courses after five years; the provision of a discretionary budget in 1994 so as to set up a hardship fund with the third level institutions; an increase in the income limits in line with the rise in the average industrial wage and in maintenance grants in line with inflation.</P>
      <P>The group has made a number of other important recommendations which I am addressing in consultation with my colleagues in Government.  I intend to publish the group's report when the Government has completed consideration of its recommendations.</P>

      <P>The measure to which the Deputy refers was first introduced in 1993 as a special initiative to alleviate the difficulties of certain schools in disadvantaged areas which were encountering serious current financial difficulty.  Under an arrangement agreed between my Department, the INTO and school management authorities, the latter are invited to make application for once-off grant support on behalf of selected schools which have been identified as having serious financial difficulties.  In each case, confirmation is required regarding the declared level of debt.</P>
      <P>Applications are vetted by my Department and available funding is apportioned across successful applicants on the basis of a standard percentage of the declared debt level.  A sum of £250,000 was allocated to this scheme in 1993.  For the current year I have increased this allocation to £320,000.</P>

My Department has established two advisory committees at primary and post-primary levels respectively which include representation from the Department, school management and teacher interests, and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the National Council for Vocational Awards, as appropriate, to advise on overall policy and priority in-career development needs.  The priority needs for 1995 will be determined following a consultative process, and in the light of the implementation plans for reforms of the primary and second level curricula.</P>

      <P>The report of the Special Education Review Committee indicated that the prevalence of a very significant degree of emotional and/or behavioural disorder among pupils of primary age was of the order of 0.6 per cent of the total school population.  The report did not suggest an increase in the number of children in mainstream schools with this disability.</P>
      <P>In general, placement of pupils with special educational needs is based on comprehensive up-to-date psychological assessments.  In the case of severely emotionally disturbed children, a psychiatric assessment is also necessary. Appropriate educational placement would be based on the outcome of these assessments.  In the case of those with severe emotional and/or behavioural disorder this would typically involve placement in a special school setting.</P>
      <P>The Special Education Review Committee report recommends the establishment of designated ordinary schools at local level to which additional resources could be allocated to support children with special educational needs. My Department is at present drawing up proposals to implement the recommendations of the report on a phased basis and the establishment of designated schools is being considered in that context.</P>
