    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 8, inclusive, and No. 113 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> The decision of the loyalist paramilitary organisations to cease all operational hostilities, following on the IRA cessation of violence, brought to an effective and a tragic period in our history. That decision virtually completes the acceptance on all sides that the use of violence in pursuit of political aims is an obsolete and counter-productive approach.</P>
    <P>The violence of the past 25 years has left a legacy of deep division within Northern Ireland and between North and South, and has caused development in the political, economic and social domains to stagnate.  An onerous responsibility therefore rests on us all to enter this new era in a spirit of generosity, thereby ensuring that the fear, sorrow and anguish of the past quarter century will never happen again.  The two Governments, every political party, all the churches, each community organisation and person must now work hard towards the achievement of lasting peace and stability on this island. Reconciliation is fundamental to that objective and it requires, first and foremost, a demonstrable willingness to understand, respect and accommodate difference.  The son of an 81-year-old victim of the Greysteel massacre described in a very poignant way the challenge facing us all when he said: &ldquo;I think it is time for everybody to try and pull together and end all the mistrust&rdquo;. We must indeed start building a new future by breaking down the barriers of suspicion.</P>
    <P>At the outset, the primary stimulus and sustaining factor in the peace process has been strong and constructive relationships between John Major and me, and our respective Governments generally.  We remain firmly committed to the shared objective of an agreed political settlement in an environment of lasting peace.  For some time now, the Tánaiste and I, as well as other people, had been advocating the need for the British Government to demonstrate in a number of practical ways their determination to accelerate the consolidation of peace.  We are very pleased therefore <Col N="498" /> with the series of measures announced on Friday last.  They give a new impetus to the peace process, while serving to advance within that context our collective efforts towards a new agreed political settlement.</P>
    <P>The British Government's acceptance, at least for working purposes, of the performance of the IRA ceasefire is of great significance.  Similarly, the British acceptance of the loyalist cessation of violence is a source of encouragement to us all.  The logical consequences of these have unleashed a much-needed momentum to the peace process.</P>
    <P>We greatly welcome the fact that the British Government will convene exploratory talks with Sinn Féin before the end of this year.  We fully support also its intention to work towards full participation by the loyalists in the democratic process.  These developments constitute a decisive advance towards all-embracing political agreement in a totally demilitarised situation. It is our sincere desire that the processes of dialogue with Sinn Féin and with representatives of the loyalist viewpoint will achieve significant progress, serving to expedite the realisation of all our hopes with regard to the potential of this new era.</P>
    <P>The other announcements of Friday flow logically from the British Government's acceptance of the IRA and loyalist cessations of violence.  They are very important developments in both practical and symbolic ways and help consolidate peace.</P>
    <P>The decision to rescind all remaining closure orders on Border crossings is particularly welcome in two respects.  It provides tangible evidence of the British Government's conviction with regard to the lasting nature of the IRA and loyalist paramilitary announcements on the cessation of hostilities. The reopening of these routes will bring huge benefit to local communities, serving to facilitate economic development and rejuvenation, as well as a return to normality in everyday social interaction. In addition, work under way at present to secure EU, US and other financial <Col N="499" /> supports to underpin the peace process will, in time, help to eliminate the peripherality and economic distortions endured by communities on both sides of the Border over the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>The Government likewise welcomes the decision of the British Home Secretary to lift the orders which excluded Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness from visiting Britain and to keep under review other such orders still in place. Again, that development is testament of conviction with regard to Sinn Féin's commitment to the peace process.  It contributes to the process in another way by facilitating more open and inclusive debate on matters of interest and importance to the people of the two islands.</P>
    <P>All of the aforementioned measures are landmark developments in the consolidation of peace.  An urgent need remains however to build on that progress and to sustain the momentum towards a totally demilitarised situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Tánaiste and I met the British Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in Chequers yesterday. Our discussions, ranging over a number of crucial issues, were conducted in an open and constructive way.  A comprehensive exchange of views on recent developments took place.  The Tánaiste and I expressed our whole-hearted endorsement for the aforementioned British Government responses to the peace process, making clear as well the need to sustain momentum.</P>
    <P>The Chequers meeting focused in the main on the development of a shared understanding and co-ordinated approach with regard to future developments in the peace process.  Within that context, progress was reviewed on the formulation of the Joint Framework Document as a basis for inclusive all-party talks on a political settlement. Very solid progress was achieved in the course of our meeting, though some matters still require further consideration. The liaison group is now taking <Col N="500" /> matters forward on foot of the political direction given at yesterday's meeting. A final date has not been set for completion of the framework document but the two Governments share a determination to bring the discussions to a successful conclusion at the earliest possible date.  It is our intention to apply all necessary urgency and effort towards that end.</P>
    <P>The successful conclusion of the Joint Framework Document, addressing the North-South and East-West relationships, is of crucial importance.  The British Government's intention to accompany release of the document with its own ideas on internal structures arising from the 1992 talks, will give tangible expression to our shared understanding of the reality that the three interdependent relationships will need to be accommodated in a comprehensive way.  It would not be beneficial to bring into the public domain any details of the ongoing discussions on the framework document in advance of intergovernmental agreement being reached.  The Government's broad position on the core issues is well known and I have nothing further to add at this stage.</P>
    <P>The question of the safe and permanent disposal of weapons and explosives is essential to the creation of a totally demilitarised situation and to the consolidation of peace.  We therefore undertook at yesterday's meeting to develop a co-ordinated approach in that regard.  With regard to the next summit meeting, a definite date has not yet been set.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that this new era will facilitate over time much greater interaction and co-operation between both parts of Ireland on a whole range of issues to the benefit of us all.  I hope that a greater confidence in simply visiting each other is now taking root.</P>
    <P>I have visited Northern Ireland in an official capacity on two separate occasions since this Government was formed.  These engagements took place in Derry last year, and were undertaken on foot of invitations issued by the <Col N="501" /> North-West Region Cross-Border Group.  On 16 April 1993 I attended the launch of a Secretariat for the group and on 19 November, I participated in a conference on the development of a strategy for growth in the north-west region.  Full details of these visits were given in the course of replies to Dáil questions on 27 April and 30 November last year.  The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Tom Kitt, visited Northern Ireland on one occasion in his capacity as Minister for European Affairs.  On 26 February 1993 he spoke at the Ballymena Academy and St. Louis Grammar School Joint Current Affairs Society debate in County Antrim.  I have no immediate plans for further visits to Northern Ireland, but visits at the level of Minister and Minister of State are a regular feature of political interaction under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I continue, however, to maintain contact with political, religious and community leaders in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept there is considerable concern at the continuing inability of the two Governments to agree the Joint Framework Document?  Will he explain the reason for the delay in this regard? Does he recollect that on 24 May last in reply to a question from me in this House the Taoiseach told us the document was well advanced and was expected to be completed before the end of June?  Has there been a change in the position since then, leading to unexpected difficulties, or did the Taoiseach under-estimate the complexity of the issues involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Two significant changes took place in recent months in Northern Ireland: the IRA ceasefire on 31 August and the ceasefire in recent weeks by the loyalist paramilitaries. Work continued throughout the summer in the liaison committee on the framework document, but against a background of continuing violence.  It is only reasonable to expect that we <Col N="502" /> slowed our work in the past two months to take cognisance of the developments in terms of the IRA ceasefire and the loyalist ceasefire.  No such serious concern as the Deputy referred to exists between the two Governments in terms of the work on this document.  A fine balance needs to be struck in this regard.  We must move step by step and every word has its own meaning.  It is important not to rush but to get the balance right at the end of the day.  Otherwise we cannot expect support and allegiance to be forthcoming from the two communities and the political leaders in those communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the comments of the British Prime Minister that his Government intends to publish a separate document dealing with internal arrangements in Northern Ireland, will the Taoiseach indicate if the framework document will contain any proposals in that regard and if the British Prime Minister indicated that it is intended to establish an elected assembly in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Talks will resume on the three stranded basis.  As we are all aware, strand one involves internal debate between the various political parties in Northern Ireland to try to reach agreement among themselves on a devolved Government structure in Northern Ireland.  They travelled a certain distance and we are all aware of the type of proposals that were on the table. The framework document will take into consideration North-South relations and relations between Dublin and London. It will contain the proposals agreed between the two Governments.  The other document will contain the ideas of the British Government which will be put forward for discussion and consultation among all the political parties. The three strands are interlocked; in other words, an internal settlement is not a reality and both the British Prime Minister and I have said this.  Unless we <Col N="503" /> can get agreement all around there will be no agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be misunderstanding and fear on the one hand and heightened expectations on the other about the concept of cross-Border institutions with executive authority. Will the Taoiseach indicate what exactly the term &ldquo;executive authority&rdquo; means in the context of these bodies and how and to whom these bodies would be accountable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go into the detail of any aspect of the negotiations as this would not be helpful. The Government's position is clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there is a problem in that some people are needlessly fearful of these bodies; that the Foyle Fisheries Body which was proposed by the Unionists is a cross-Border institution with executive authority and works very well and that if more detail was given as to what exactly is in mind many of the worries people have would disappear and it would serve the interests of a peaceful resolution of all these issues if more explanations were given about what is in mind?  I believe what is in mind would be beneficial to everybody.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach two brief questions the first <Col N="504" /> of which relates to his statement regarding demilitarisation of society in Northern Ireland.  Has he had time to study the copy of the report I passed on to him from the Families Against Intimidation and Terror dealing with so-called punishment beatings by both the IRA and loyalists groups?  Will the indicate if he has made representations to these groups to have the beatings stopped and the exclusions brought to an end?  Can he give the House some information on the reported new paramilitary organisation, the Irish National Republican Army?</P>

      <P>On the latter part of the Deputy's question, I have nothing further to add to what he has read in the media.  I do not propose to refer to any confidential security reports I receive from time to time in that regard. On the first part of the Deputy's question, I thank him for providing the information which has been relayed to Sinn Féin for its observations.  From the information available to me, in recent times it seems there has not been a repetition of these beatings.  If anybody has evidence to the contrary I will be glad to receive it.  We all condemn such beatings, rightly so, and I hope we have seen the last of them not alone in the Nationalist community but also in the Unionist community.</P>

      <P>As it has been central to what I would describe as the Irish case since the negotiations began, that &ldquo;nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed&rdquo;, was the Taoiseach satisfied with the assurance he received from the British Prime Minister in this respect and did he not think it strange that, apparently, Mr. Major denied that it had been brought to his attention that Mr. Molyneaux had been very critical of this procedure?  The British Prime Minister was in Belfast recently and I presume he received intense briefings before he met Mr. Molyneaux.  Does the Taoiseach not think it strange that it was not brought to the attention of the <Col N="505" /> British Prime Minister that Mr. Molyneaux had expressed criticism? Second&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the criticism expressed by Mr. Molyneaux, I have no doubt that criticism of the final agreement will be expressed by both sides. We would not be doing a good job if we were not criticised.  We therefore expect it.  From time to time Mr. Molyneaux said he is only interested in strand one. Both Mr. Major and I have made it abundantly clear that an internal settlement is not on, that it would not work and has not worked in the past.  North-South institutions form part of the recognition of the Nationalist identity; like the Unionists, they are entitled to have their identity recognised.  We have to reach a finely balanced agreement which takes account of all these matters and which I hope will lead to a just and lasting settlement which is what Deputy Currie and every other Member of this House wants.</P>

      <P>It would be a good idea if the leaders of the parties in the forum &mdash; the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, other party leaders and I &mdash; visited Northern Ireland together; this would be a good gesture.  Will the Taoiseach agree to examine the impact on businesses on this side of the Border of competition from north of the Border given that higher PRSI, social insurance, income tax, and postal and telecommunications charges have to be met on this side of the Border?  This needs to be examined in a positive way to ensure that there is balanced economic development on both sides of the Border.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the total demilitarisation of Northern Ireland.  Given that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is on record prior to the ceasefire as saying that the verifiable handing over of the arsenal was a precondition for talks with Sinn Féin-IRA, does the position taken by the Government as late as yesterday not indicate a serious back slide from that important policy position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear on a number of occasions in this House and elsewhere that as far as the Government is concerned a condition for entering into talks and participating in <Col N="508" /> the forum is a complete cessation of violence.  That has been the position. Yesterday in Chequers we had discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, and Sir Patrick Mayhew on the question of the destruction or disposal of the arsenal.  We have asked the security officials on both sides to look at the logistics of carrying out the operation. Everybody accepts the situation must be confronted.  We want officials to look at the logistics of the operation and report back to us at an early date.</P>
      <P>Everybody recognises that for a true and enduring peace in Northern Ireland, the arsenal must be destroyed. I was glad to hear on the radio today a spokesperson for the loyalist group say that the loyalist paramilitaries would be considering handing in their arms in the near future.  That is very helpful.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain in a little more detail to the Unionist population in Northern Ireland the functioning of the Foyle Fisheries Commission? Will he explain to Unionists his position on the joint Government structures, which he says is not a joint authority, as this seems to threaten the culture of the Unionist people of Northern Ireland?  The Foyle Fisheries Commission has been in existence for approximately 40 years and performs a very useful function.  It does not threaten either side.  The then Minister for Agriculture, Mr. James Dillon, set it up and it serves as a useful model of cross-Border co-operation.</P>

      <P>Certainly the model of the Foyle Fisheries Commission has been taken into consideration but it is not the entire answer to what we are trying to achieve.

In a speech in Strabane, Sir Patrick Mayhew said that the British Government proposals for devolution in Northern Ireland would have the same status as the joint framework document.

      <P>On the basis that all three strands are interlocked, clearly there has to be agreement on all three before the three come into operation. We are well aware of the position in relation to strand one talks which took place in 1992.  There will not be a divergence from the views expressed then. The British Government is well aware that all three strands have to interlock at the end of the day and all three have to be agreed by everybody concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 77, 94, 100 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>Earlier today, the Government approved, on my proposal, the moving of resolutions in both Houses of the Oireachtas for the purpose of ending the national emergency which Dáil and Seanad Éireann resolved to exist on 1 September 1976.</P>
      <P>The national emergency which the Oireachtas declared to exist in 1976 arose, as the terms of the resolutions adopted on that occasion made clear, from the armed conflict taking place in Northern Ireland.  That armed conflict has thankfully now come to an end arising from the complete cessation of military operations by the Provisional IRA as and from 31 August and the more recent decision by the combined Loyalist military command on 13 October to universally cease all operational hostilities. The Government intends to respond to that new situation by moving resolutions to end the national emergency.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that the ending of the national emergency will give symbolic expression to the new hope and opportunities created by those developments.  We believe them to represent a decisive turning point in the history of our island to which the House will want to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues that would be raised in reviewing the operation of the Special Criminal Court or more generally the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939-85 are quite different from those which arise in connection with ending the national emergency.  The former would require wide consultation and extremely careful study &mdash; the Offences Against the State Acts, which contain provision for the operation of Special Courts, <Col N="511" /> form part of our wider criminal law.  In the absence of such consultation and study I am not at this point in a position to signal any proposals in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 68, 84 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>Let me stress at the outset that I have no proposals from the Garda Commissioner to reduce the opening hours of any Garda station in the Dublin area and I understand from the Commissioner that he has made no such proposals.</P>
      <P>However, in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 19 September 1994 he referred to a number of policing issues which have an important influence on the service that the Garda Síochána provide to the public.  In doing so he was attempting to broaden the public debate on policing and policing options.  In this context, by way of an example, he questioned the need to have all 42 Garda stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Area open to the public on a 24 hour basis as many of these would have very few callers between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree there is a need to have a broader and more reasoned debate on policing and what we expect from our police service among the general public and indeed here in the House.  The Commissioner pointed out in the press article that it is generally perceived that if a Garda station is open to the public for 24 hours per day the people somehow get a better police service. However the Commissioner states, &ldquo;the reality is that the more stations we keep open to the public for longer periods reduces correspondingly our ability to patrol the streets&rdquo;.  In this example, the <Col N="513" /> Commissioner estimates that a minimum of an additional 4,200 man hours per week could be made available for patrolling in a proactive and visible way on our streets.</P>
    <P>The question the Commissioner is raising is what we want from our police. Do we, for example, want them sitting in Garda stations in the middle of the night waiting for the occasional caller or do we want them patrolling the streets to the maximum extent possible?  I will be listening with interest to the views of Members of this House and those of the public on this issue</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of rural policing referred to by Deputy Mitchell I can inform him that I am in consultation with the Garda authorities regarding a review of the community policing scheme for rural areas to ensure that its objectives are being met at present.  I am also anxious to ensure that there will be sufficient consultation with local interest groups before any decision is made to extend the scheme to additional areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of whether I had discussions with the Commissioner in connection with policing procedures.  I can inform Deputy Kenny that I regularly meet with the Commissioner to discuss matters in relation to crime and policing generally. The details of such discussions are, naturally, confidential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister is interested in hearing my views &mdash; and those of other Members but, since they do not have access to the Garda Commissioner or his advisers, I suggest to the Minister that to get the reaction of the Opposition.  She might put before the House her views on this proposal. Will she state whether she accepts the argument put forward by the Garda Commissioner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner put forward his account in <i>The Irish Times</i> article &mdash; I do not have the date &mdash; to broaden the ongoing public debate in relation to policing in <Col N="514" /> urban and rural areas.  In an attempt to put before the public his views in relation to how he saw policing and policing duties developing in the years to come, he referred to 42 Garda stations in the Dublin area.  He did not say he was putting forward proposals that they should be closed, nor has he put such proposals to me, and until I receive them, it would be foolish of me to make a decision based on my own assessment of something that has not come before me.  I agree with the Garda Commissioner, and I believe Members also agree, that we want more visibility of gardaí on our streets.  I am sure members of the public would be very concerned if they felt gardaí were sitting in Garda stations, between the hours mentioned by the Commissioner, answering two or three telephone calls during the night or waiting for an occasional caller between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. if the alternative was to have those gardaí patrolling the neighbourhoods in which those stations are located.  I do not have a recommendation from the Garda Commission, however, and until such time as he might make such a recommendation to me I am not in a position to make a decision.</P>

      <P>No. Proposals in relation to the closure of the 42 specific Garda stations to which he referred in the article have not been put by him to the Department or to me.  In relation to rural policing, the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; to which Deputy Mitchell refers is a communication link whereby if somebody calls to a Garda station which is closed, they speak through the communication link, not to a recorded message on a machine, but to a garda in the district headquarters.</P>
      <P>I think some people are confused about the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; but it gives them instant access to members of the Garda Síochána who in return respond to the relevant request.  Also, we are endeavouring to ensure that the system where somebody rings a Garda station, the Phoneplus system, which now operates in quite a number of Garda stations will be extended to all Garda stations throughout the country.  In other words, rather than the telephone ringing with nobody answering it, the call will be automatically diverted to the nearest district headquarters, thereby giving the caller immediate access to a member of the Garda Síochána.  The communication link is not on the way out, rather I see it as an aid or a support to the scheme of rural policing.  In the past, however, Governments and commissioners were not very good at explaining to the public, when we brought in changes in policing, what they meant or indeed in asking for opinions.  I am concerned that, in the case of rural policing, we explain fully to the community served by rural policing schemes what exactly the scheme is about and how they can help and support it because, in the areas where that was done, it is working very well.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>if she will make it a criminal offence to knowingly conceal, or fail to report to Gardaí, adults who are known to have sexually molested children in view of recent events; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Child abuse, including child sexual abuse, is a form of crime which the vast majority of people abhor.  There is a duty on all of us to protect children from abuse.  If a person becomes aware that a child has been the subject of a sexual assault, the matter should be reported to the Garda.  Secrecy is not the way to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law a person who knowingly conceals a felon, which includes a person who sexually assaulted a child, or the fact that a felony has taken place &mdash; and any sexual assault is a felony &mdash; could, depending on the circumstances, be found to be an accessory after the fact and liable on conviction to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  Where a person, knowing that a felony has taken place, does not report that felony to the police then the offence of misprison of felony may have occurred.  That offence is subject to certain limitations such as non-disclosure due to a claim of right made in good faith.  For example, a doctor might be entitled not to report a felony if the information regarding the crime was disclosed in the context of a professional relationship.</P>
      <P>The existing law, which is of general application, therefore does, at least to some degree, cover the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Deputy is particularly concerned about this matter in the context of child sexual abuse and whether some strengthening of the law is required to deal with concealment of that particular form of abuse.  The Law Reform Commission in its Report of Child Sexual Abuse (LRC 32-1990) specifically <Col N="517" /> addressed the question of mandatory reporting of suspected child sexual abuse.  It also arose for consideration in the report submitted to the Minister for Health in the Kilkenny incest case.  The matter, as is clear from the Law Reform Commission report, raises a number of controversial issues and could have significant implications, in particular for health and social workers.  The Minister for Health has primary responsibility for the examination of the issues involved and is looking at the matter. I understand he intends to engage in a widespread consultative process with interested groups on the issues involved before finalising his own views.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the need to report suspicions of child abuse to the Garda and perhaps I should say a little more about Garda capacity to deal with such cases.</P>
    <P>As previously announced, the Garda now have a specialist unit &mdash; the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit &mdash; which is based in Dublin but is available to give advice and specialist assistance, as required, to all divisions.  In addition, a Garda inspector has been assigned responsibility in each division to co-ordinate and exercise an overview of cases involving domestic assault, including child sexual abuse, and to liaise with the specialist unit based in Dublin if and when the need arises.  I have outlined the position in this regard because I think it is important the public should know that, within the Garda Síochána, there is the level of expertise necessary to ensure that cases of this kind are handled effectively and sensitively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I stress that my question relates not to persons who are suspected of having molested children but to persons known to have committed such offence.  Given that the Fr. Brendan Smyth case has revealed an institutionalised culture of cover-up, by reassignment in the context of the higher echelons of the Catholic Church, as has been admitted by the Church, will the Minister agree it is now time to confront the Church about this issue <Col N="518" /> and to impose a penalty for non-reporting of known cases of sexual molestation of children?  Will the Minister agree also it is necessary that a clear message goes out from this House that the reporting of such crimes cannot be waived, for example, by a monetary settlement as has been the case in the United States?  Also, in relation to this particular case, are there any plans to initiate proceedings and prosecutions in relation to crimes which may have been committed by Fr. Brendan Smyth in this jurisdiction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there are any plans at present but, as I said in an interview over the weekend, if such complaints are made to the Garda they will be dealt with regardless of which quarter they come from or where blame is laid.  I share the sense of outrage which has been widely expressed since the Fr. Smyth case came to public attention and the fact that so many children in this and our nearest jurisdiction were exposed to risk over a long period. People who have knowledge of such crimes should be obliged to report them to the prosecuting authorities.  It is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda as to whether a person should be prosecuted and it would not be appropriate for me to make any public comment on whether I think a person or a number of persons who knew such acts were taking place should or should not be prosecuted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the common law offence of misprision of a felony.  Is she aware of any such prosecutions for such an offence in the recent past?  If there are no recent examples of such charges, surely that indicates the law is not effective and needs to be legislatively recast with particular reference to the reporting of sexual abuse cases?</P>

If it is represented to me that further changes are required in this area to protect children &mdash; that is our primary responsibility &mdash; I will not hesitate to further amend the criminal law appropriately.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice of Ministers for Justice to disclose, in the absence of special reason, the existence or otherwise of a request for extradition as disclosure of that information could hinder Garda action. As that danger no longer exists in the present case, however, I am prepared to make an exception for the purposes of the reply to this question.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to say that the allegation referred to by the Deputy is without foundation.</P>
      <P>Nine warrants in respect of the person referred to in the television programme mentioned by Deputy Mitchell were received by the Garda Síochána on 29 April 1993.  On the following day, 30 April 1993, the Garda forwarded the papers to the Attorney General's Office as they do in the case of every request for extradition for the purpose of enabling the Attorney General to ensure that the request met the requirements of our law and of enabling him to discharge the special functions imposed upon him by the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1993 and before consideration by his office of the extradition request had been completed, it was informed that the Northern Ireland <Col N="520" /> authorities had become aware of the likelihood of the person concerned going voluntarily to Northern Ireland, as in fact he duly did.</P>
    <P>In January of this year the Northern Ireland authorities requested that the warrants be returned to them and they were returned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that there is not the same propensity to kick in the head the Attorney General's Office as there is to kick in the head of the Catholic Church because of the activities of a small number of members of that church even though the Attorney General is a paid public official and should be accountable for his actions.  If we are to apportion criticism we should be prepared to do so across the board, without fear or favour, even if someone sits around the Cabinet table with us.  Why did it take from 30 April 1993 until November 1993, seven months, for the Attorney General to consider this matter when it was clear that the RUC spent two and a half years preparing the charges and, to quote an RUC source, had crossed their is and dotted their is?  Why did the Attorney General not act on those requests immediately or within a week or two?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the nine warrants received alleged offences committed on three unknown dates between 1964 and 1971, on three unknown dates between 1968 and 1976, on two unknown dates between 1982 and 1988 and on one unknown date between 1986 and 1988.  I also understand that this case was the first in which provisions had arisen for consideration by the Attorney General's Office since the enactment of the 1987 Act.  In addition to the normal requirements of ensuring that the warrants and ancillary documentation were properly drawn up and there was sufficient evidence in the possession of the requesting authorities to justify extradition as required by the 1987 Act, it <Col N="521" /> was necessary for the Attorney General's Office to consider whether extradition, particularly in respect of offences committed up to 30 years ago, would be likely to be admitted by the courts which, as Deputy Mitchell will be aware, scrutinise extradition applications with great care to ensure that the rights of the accused are fully protected. I understand from the Attorney General's Office that the delay was not unusual given the legal issues and the complexities of the case.  These were such that the normal examination of the case by officials prior to seeking a decision from the Attorney General on the request had not been completed at the time his office was informed that the person had voluntarily returned to Northern Ireland.</P>

This came about because of the time taken to have the matter examined within the Attorney General's Office.  I am aware there are enormous pressures on the office due, among other things, to new legislation coming onstream.  That matter is being addressed.  I am advised that the application involved the consideration of issues affecting extradition generally because this was the first case since the passing of the 1987 Act.  It was vitally important in the interests of the effective operation of the extradition code &mdash; by that I mean it should operate in the manner intended by this House &mdash; that an application which raised core extradition issues should be examined with the greatest care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 92, 103 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>The drugs problem is a matter of the very highest priority for myself and for the Garda, and it is not confined to inner-city areas.  The smaller towns and rural areas are also at risk and I am determined that we deal with the problem in these areas before it takes hold.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that a number of substantial seizures have been made by the Garda this year.  Figures available from the Forensic Science Laboratory &mdash; where all drugs seized by the Garda are analysed &mdash; show that as of 30 September this year 4,081 cases were sent for analysis.  Of these, 3,016 cases had been examined by that date.  Of the cases examined, 2,236 involved cannabis resin with a total weight of 1,060,565 grams.  This continues to confirm the established trend that cannabis resin accounts for about 75 per cent of drugs misused in this country.</P>
      <P>There have been 157 cases involving heroin with a total weight of 1,697.3 grams; 16 cases involving cocaine with a total weight of 35 grams; 157 cases involving ecstasy tablets with a total of 15,520 tablets siezed; 83 cases involving LSD with a total of 14,500 tablets seized, and 29 cases involving amphetemine powder with a total weight of 66 grams.  Arising from these seizures, prosecutions have been taken and more are currently in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Garda drugs units are co-ordinated on a national basis through the National Drug Administration Office in <Col N="525" /> Garda Headquarters.  In Dublin, monthly meetings are held between all drugs units at which recent seizures and trends are discussed and future operations planned.  This ensures maximum co-ordination and cohesion of the fight against drugs in the capital.  As part of its strategy, the Garda has commenced a &ldquo;patrolling system&rdquo; involving a high profile Garda presence in certain innercity complexes.  This is designed to break the influence of drug dealers operating in particular locations in the city.</P>
    <P>An important part of the fight against drugs is to target the ill-gotten gains of drug deals and traffickers.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, contains provisions for the confiscation of proceeds of crime and deals with money laundering by criminals, including drug traffickers. This Act represents a major initiative against the drug menace.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the use of syringes as weapons of crime. Attacks with syringes are deeply traumatic for the innocent victim who is confronted with the potential threat of being infected with HIV or some other serious disease.</P>
    <P>All possible measures are being taken by the Garda to deal with this problem, including patrolling and surveillance. However, this is not a problem that can be easily resolved given the availability of syringes, the ease with which they can be concealed on the person and the desperation of the addict to get money for drugs.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that recently a person found in possession of a blood filled syringe was successfully prosecuted under the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990.  This is a most significant conviction, which suggests that adequate legal provisions may already be in place to deal with the possession and use of an infected syringe in connection with a robbery or other crime.  However, I am keeping this aspect of the drugs problem under continuous review and I shall not hesitate to make further proposals to deal with this matter, if it appears to <Col N="526" /> me that existing legislation is not adequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the figures she has given the House. May I suggest her conclusion that 75 per cent of the drugs problem appears to be associated with cannabis is a gross misanalysis of the problem and that the really serious drugs problem relates to hard drugs such as heroin, ecstasy, etc. which are now probably more widely available now than at any time in our history?  There is a public perception that the Garda and State are losing the battle against the widespread peddling of hard drugs such as heroin and ecstasy and that while the suppliers are widely known to local people in the communities where these drugs can be obtained apparently the Garda is not taking effective action against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Garda are not taking effective action against these people as they are very alert to the problems in relation to ecstasy.  A number of very significant seizures took place recently as a direct result of the Garda targeting events at which they believed young people would be using ecstacy or where ecstacy tablets would be sold to young people.  As Deputy Gilmore is aware, one such well known establishment in Dublin had its licence successfully opposed by the Garda in the courts. This is an indication of the type of proactive approach and response by the Garda Síochána to the ecstasy problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to heroin, I said that the Garda has commenced a patrolling system involving a high profile Garda presence in inner city areas where, as a number of gardaí, local community groups and Members of this House brought to the attention of the Garda Commissioner and me, heroin is sold and people are actively involved in its provision to younger people and others.  In addition, there are the specialised drugs units.  All members of the Garda, and not merely those involved in drugs <Col N="527" /> units, are trained to deal with the drugs problem.</P>

      <P>In regard to the part of my question dealing with the crime associated with drugs.  I am pleased with the measures being taken to deal with people who use syringes of blood as weapons.  Does the Minister believe that possession of a syringe should be made an offence?  Is she concerned about the increase in gangland killings and shootings, some of which appear to be associated with the drugs trade, in Dublin in recent months and, in particular, the reports that guns are now widely available in Dublin?  Apparently hand-guns can be obtained for as little as £50.  Does she or the Garda authorities intend to take any special measures to deal with this, perhaps unanticipated, aspect of the peace dividend?</P>

      <P>While I appreciate what Deputy Gilmore is trying to do in terms of making the possession of a syringe an offence, it would be very difficult to do as exceptions would have to be made, the most obvious of which would relate to a diabetic who has to carry a syringe of insulin at all times.  The recent conviction under the 1990 Act of a person found in possession of a blood filled syringe is a very important step forward.  If I believe there is a necessity to or a way in which we can strengthen the law in this area I will have no hesitation in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of contract killings and the availability of firearms, Deputies will be aware that a number of very successful early morning raids were recently carried out by the Garda and a number of firearms recovered.  I am sure Deputies will accept that this is very important and a significant step forward. Special measures have been, and continue to be, taken by the Garda to deal with the availability of firearms, where they are kept and the persons who might be in the possession of them, and contract killings, which have been condemned by all of us.  We do not want <Col N="528" /> to see that type of crime, different from normal crime, spreading or increasing in any way.  Special measures are being and have been taken by the Garda but I am sure Deputy Gilmore would not wish me to spell them out as the people who may be contemplating such a crime could escape detection because of knowing in advance the special Garda measures.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of my view, expressed in the House time and again, that we have a serious hard drugs problem, particularly in Dublin? Is she aware that in parts of my constituency &mdash; Deputy Gregory will relate similar problems in his constituency &mdash; people are shooting heroin openly on stairwells in flat complexes as well as in green areas in housing estates and that this indicates a serious problem?  Is the Minister aware that from ten named countries, based on a ten to one heroin substance from 4,000 tonnes of opium, about 40,000 tonnes of heroin is exported?  Has the Minister raised this matter at EU level with a view to the European Union taking a co-ordinated action against those exporting countries? Is it correct that the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, with the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, allow for life imprisonment for a person who threatens another with a lethal syringe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, there was a successful prosecution under the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990.  Unfortunately, I do not know the term of imprisonment imposed in the court but I can supply it to the Deputy.  It was a significant breakthrough because people felt there was no law in relation to the use of a blood filled syringe, but now there has been a successful prosecution.  In relation to the hard drugs problem, and the fact that the Deputy and other Deputies consistently bring to my attention the problems relating to heroin in city centre housing complexes, I said in my reply that as a result of information <Col N="529" /> given to me here by a number of Deputies, and passed on to the Garda and to the head of the Drugs Squad, there is high profile patrolling in a number of these complexes where heroin was openly sold or used.  As a result, there has been a number of successful prosecutions.  I commend the people who live in those complexes who are not involved in heroin dealing and who do not want it for their co-operation and support for the Garda Síochána who patrol these areas.  In relation to whether I have raised the matter at EU level, I should say that at all our meetings one of the priority items on the agenda for EU Ministers for Justice is the whole area of drug trafficking and the international drug trade.  Drugs and drug related problems are the same in all EU countries and in the countries that will join after 1 January 1995, they extend across all borders.  It does not mean that because one lives in an island the drugs problem can be kept out.  We are all facing the same problems and we want to face them together.  We want the EU to make radical changes and proposals in this area.  Commissioner Flynn, who is strongly of the view that a Commission initiative is required, is in the process of preparing for presentation to Ministers at EU level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the increase in organised crime, to which the Minister referred, and the use of firearms in criminal activity, will the Minister agree it is important for the State to retain the Special Criminal Court to deal with such criminal activity?  Will she agree, that despite the fact she is willing to repeal the emergency powers and the state of emergency legislation, it is vital to have the Special Criminal Court? The Constitution allows for setting up the Special Criminal Court where ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and <Col N="530" /> the preservation of public peace and order.  It is vital to have the Special Criminal Court to bring such criminals to justice in cases of intimidation of juries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks in relation to the high profile patrolling of flat complexes, some of which I requested for my own constituency, which has been successful. Does the Minister accept that, overall, the Garda appear to be losing the battle against heroin dealers and that heroin, which is extensively available, is now half the price it was a couple of years ago?  Because huge sums of money are made by heroin drug dealers, many of whom have invested in property and so on, some of them are resorting to the execution of rivals.  Communities are living in fear because of the use of firearms and the killing of rivals.  Unless the Garda get to grips with the big dealers this problem will escalate and spread throughout Dublin city.  Already it is spreading to large working class suburbs throughout Dublin.  Will the Minister ensure that all the resources necessary for the specialist Garda drug units in each area where there is a serious heroin problem are made available and that the dealers who have escaped justice until now and who are leading ostensibly respectable lifestyles and buying property are brought to justice and not allowed live to in luxury off the misery of their victims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the big drug dealers involved in creating misery for many thousands of people and families, not only in the inner city areas of Dublin but throughout the country, must be brought to justice.  We now have very stringent powers under the confiscation legislation, not alone <Col N="531" /> when dealers are found guilty of the offence but equally to confiscate their assets and put the onus on them to prove they did not get them from the proceeds of drug dealing.  I do not accept the Garda are losing the battle. They are engaging in high profile patrolling in inner city complexes, the results of which he has seen.  I thank the Deputy for his compliments to the Garda.  This is something which the Commissioner, the Assistant Commissioner and the DMA are anxious to see extended to other complexes where they do not have high profile patrolling. It has proved successful and they have had a number of good seizures; equally, they have had a number of successful prosecutions.  Obviously, that is the way to proceed.  I do not think Deputy Gregory made the point that the Garda have sole responsibility in this area.  A huge effort can be made in the health and education areas but particularly in the education area.  We must try to make drugs socially unacceptable as we did with cigarette smoking.  There are proposals for such a health education programme in all schools, starting at primary level.</P>

      <P>Ensuing from the peace process, has the Minister considered the possibility of redeploying gardaí previously assigned to security duty in relation to subversive crime, for example, gardaí detailed to Border duties or intelligence gathering?  Having regard to the experience, expertise and skills they have developed, particularly in the intelligence area, perhaps they could be assigned to addressing the serious problem of drug dealing, the whole underworld associated with it and organised crime.</P>

The Commissioner is actively <Col N="532" /> looking forward to redeploying members from Border regions where much of the work in which they were involved might now be considered non-productive. They could be redeployed in inner city areas and other divisions which are experiencing problems similar to those referred to in the question.</P>

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to introduce tighter controls on charities and street collectors, in line with the recommendations of the Costello Committee Report on Fundraising for Charitable Purposes.  Work on the preparation of this legislation is proceeding in the Department of Justice as a matter of priority and my proposals will be announced in the usual way in due course.</P>
      <P>The reason the committee was established was because of public disquiet and unease about possible abuses in fund raising for charitable purposes and because of alleged inadequacies in existing legislation in relation to fund raising and the way in which proceeds are accounted for and distributed.  I accept that difficulties will remain until the new legislation is enacted.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the reputation of the many charities who are doing magnificent work here and abroad, particularly in the Third World.  Has the Minister of State read the 1993 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General?  Is he aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General estimated the number of charities at more than 6,000?  Is he aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General's estimate of moneys made available to such charities from the State is approximately £200 million per annum and that they also raise approximately £130 million from the public?  Is the Minister of State aware that we are talking about a business, as it were, where the total money involved is approximately £333 million?  Will he explain how he is unaware of those facts?  Does that explain the lack of urgency by his Government in updating the legislation?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the 1993 report published by the Comptroller and Auditor General in which he made a number of estimates, some of which are disputed.  My Department does not have the mechanism for establishing the exact figures because charities are not obliged to register or publish their returns.</P>
      <P>In regard to the lack of urgency in introducing legislation, the Minister has been in the Department for only 20 months during which time nine important Bills were introduced and three published.  The Costello Commission reported at the end of 1989.  It was our intention that the legislation would be passed by now but, unfortunately, a number of more pressing and urgent matters arose.  Nevertheless, we are proceeding with the drafting of the legislation and will publish it as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State believe he is being fair to the House in not giving the estimates which he now admits were available to him? Will he agree that the public disquiet <Col N="534" /> and unease to which he referred is shared by many others, including the Comptroller and Auditor General who in his 1992 report referred to the potential for abuse as charities become organised on a business basis?  Does he recognise the urgency, from the point of view of reputable charities, of establishing a proper registration authority so that accounts can be submitted annually by charities and proper control exercised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy my views on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There is some dispute about his conclusions and I do not intend reproducing that report.  My Department does not have a mechanism for calculating the figures sought by the Deputy, and if the Comptroller and Auditor General comes to certain conclusions, that is his business.</P>
      <P>The Costello Commission was set up following public disquiet.  It was given the role of making recommendations about how we might address such disquiet by amending the law.  The commission produced more than 80 recommendations for change; therefore, the legislation will be comprehensive.  We should not overstate this case.  In reality, the majority of people collecting for charity do so on a bona fide basis.  They are honest people with entirely altruistic motives and they should not be tainted by the activities of a few.  Having regard to the figures for prosecutions and allegations over the past number of years, it is clear that the problem has not increased significantly.  The Government is not bound to accept all the recommendations of the Costello Commission. However, it must study them to ascertain the ones that are most desirable for inclusion in legislation.  We will meet our commitment to produce the legislation and it will pass through the House during the lifetime of this Government.</P>

Will he further accept that the Costello Commission was set up approximately eight years ago and that its report was published more than four years ago?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that honest operators are tarnished to some extent by the activities of unscrupulous ones, but, as the amount of money going to charity is increasing, the effect of such unscrupulous behaviour is minimal.  The legislation is more than 38 years old; it dates back to 1956.  We set up the Costello Commission to recommend changes and its report is being considered. The amount of legislation introduced by the Minister in the past 20 months is an all time record and we intend to continue at that pace.  The legislation will be introduced.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of the established and proper charities are concerned that, for example, it is possible to set up a charity to send one's family to the World Cup? They are also concerned about the &ldquo;open buckets&rdquo; system of collection. Those matters have been the subject of recommendations in the report of the Costello Commission.  Does the report include draft legislation on which the Minister could base her legislation so that the drafting would be a relatively <Col N="536" /> simple matter and welcomed by charities concerned about abuse from a minority of unscrupulous operators?  I would not wish to give the impression that we are concerned about all charities, the majority of them are well run and organised.  I am concerned that we protect the majority of charities against a minority of unscrupulous operators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I cast no reflection on the Comptroller and Auditor General, I merely said that there is a dispute about the figures he produced.  As there is no registration or accounting system in place it is difficult to calculate the figures accurately.</P>
      <P>I am aware that it is possible to set up any type of charity.  The Costello Commission report recommends that the legislation should propose a system of registration and that applicants should apply to the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests if the amount raised is more than £50,000 per annum and to the Garda if it is less than that figure.  They are suggesting a registration, reporting and accounting system, for which there is a need, and which will be implemented.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked me also whether draft legislative proposals accompanied the Costello report which would make it easier to introduce the legislation more or less straight away. Of course, it would be very easy to introduce the legislation if the Government agreed to accept the report of the Costello Commission in its entirely. That report contains a number of controversial proposals with which I am not arguing.  The objectives of the Costello Commission might be set in another way.  In particular I have views on the Street and House to House Collections Act, 1962.  The Costello report is being studied in the Department and legislative proposals will follow.  The Government will meet its commitment to introducing legislation to transform the law on charities.</P>

      <P>Replying to Deputy <Col N="537" /> O'Keeffe the Minister of State spoke about tighter controls and his concern for bona fide charities.  Will the forthcoming legislation take account of the Big Brother role at present being adopted by the national lottery in its attitude to smaller charities?  The national lottery is abusing its monopoly position by advertising on television its scratch cards and in its latest innovation of the bingo scratch card which will have a dramatic effect on bona fide charities about which the Minister spoke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate the precise format of the relevant legislation but I am aware of the point made by the Deputy.  As the Deputy will be aware there are proposals for scratch cards and so on in the report of the Costello Commission.  The relevant legislative proposals will have to take into account the fact that we have a national lottery.  However, there are several people undertaking altruistic work collecting money for charities. That will have to be taken into account and reflected in the legislative proposals to be brought before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 45, 51, 57, 58, 69, 72, 83, 87, 88, 89, 101 and 178 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity in answering these questions, all of which relate to the issue of investment-linked naturalisation, to report back to the House on developments in relation <Col N="540" /> to matters which I outlined on 15 June 1994 in response to questions on this issue.</P>
    <P>On that occasion, I referred to the advisory group on investment-linked naturalisation which the Government had, at my request, earlier established. I made this request to the Government because I considered it important that I have available in respect of such applications the advice of appropriately qualified people.  The group consists of representatives of my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Enterprise and Employment, Finance and the Government agency engaged in the support and development of indigenous industry, Forbairt.</P>
    <P>In establishing the group, the Government also decided that the Minister for Justice should bring its terms of reference to Government at an early date.</P>
    <P>In June, I informed the House that a Cabinet sub-committee consisting of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Justice had been formed specially to advise the Government on the terms of reference for the advisory group.  I undertook to make the terms of reference of the advisory group known publicly when they had been settled by the Government.  I am now pleased to say that the Government has approved the terms of reference for the group and they are as follows:</P>
    <P>First, to consider applications for naturalisation based on investment in the State received by the Minister for Justice and referred to the group and to make recommendations to the Minister based on the group's assessment of the job-creating or job-maintenance capacity of the investment; second, the group will examine each application for naturalisation based on investment, with the assistance of evaluation/advice from relevant agencies where necessary and, in making its recommendations, will apply the following criteria:&mdash; (a) substantial <Col N="541" /> residence must be purchased and retained in ownership for a period of at least five years with an undertaking to reside in the State for a minimum of 60 days in the two years following naturalisation; (b) the level of investment must involve a net contribution of at least £1 million per applicant; (c) where the investment is in the form of a loan it shall be for a duration of at least seven years at an interest rate not greater than 1 per cent below the representative Government bond yield on the secondary market, or not greater than 1 per cent below DIBOR, whichever is lower.  The loan shall be made by the applicant direct to the firm concerned, without involvement by any intermediary.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference continue:</P>
    <P>The loan arrangement shall be transparent and open to scrutiny and shall be such as to prevent the loan being factored or sold on.  The loan shall not be secured by the assets of the company in which the investjyment is to be made; (d) as ordinary naturalisation would be for life, the duration of the investment should be for a significant period: at the very least five years; (e) the number of jobs created or maintained must be readily quantifiable and arise from the investment only; (f) audited and certified confirmation of the investment to be available to the group from an established auditing firm of accountants to the effect that the investment has taken place in accordance with the rules of the scheme for naturalisation; (g) the investment will be monitored by Forfás to ensure that the conditions of the investment are being maintained and, in the event that they are not, will inform the group who, in turn, will inform the Minister for Justice with a view to revocation of citizenship; (h) police certificate of character must be provided by authorities in country of origin &mdash; and, if required, from the police in any country where the applicant has resided or carried on business or <Col N="542" /> maintained substantial investments &mdash; together with express permission to the authorities in Ireland to inquire behind it, and (i) annual certification by the established auditing firm of accountants to Forfás that the investment is being maintained for the appropriate period. </P>
    <P>The Government has also decided that the scheme of investment-based naturalisation should be put on a statutory basis and that priority should be given to the preparation of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>The task of examining this proposed legislation was given in June to the interdepartmental committee established in 1993 to examine policy and practice with regard to non-nationals. The committee has been asked to consider the Government decision in the context of its comprehensive review of legislation in this area generally. The committee will report on the matter when it has reviewed all aspects of it.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, and to ensure valuable job-creating investment opportunities are not lost to the State, the Government has agreed that the Minister for Justice may continue to make decisions on investment-based naturalisation applications acting on the recommendations of the advisory group which will operate on the basis of the terms of reference to which I have just referred and which have, of course, the approval of the Government.</P>
    <P>There is a further matter which I wish to bring to the attention of the House. In my response on 15 June, I also indicated that no further investment-based naturalisation would be decided by me until the advisory group was fully operational and in position to give me its advice on each case.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House in June, seven applications for naturalisation on the basis of investment had been granted at that stage in 1994.  However, there were also on hand 29 applications which had been approved in principle. <Col N="543" /> The Government decided that the papers in relation to the 29 applications should be referred to the Attorney General for advice as to whether there existed a legal obligation to naturalise these applicants.  The Attorney General advised that I was legally bound to grant the applications provided all the necessary conditions were met.</P>
    <P>The necessary conditions of course were specific to each application but in general required that this investment has been made, that a residence has been purchased and that the applicant has given an undertaking to spend a reasonable amount of time in the State. The conditions also include the statutory requirement that an oath of loyalty and fidelity to the State be sworn in the prescribed manner and that the statutory naturalisation fee be paid.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I propose to issue certificates of naturalisation to the applicants concerned if they satisfy me that they have fulfilled all the necessary requirements.  The list of persons naturalised will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in the prescribed manner.</P>
    <P>Pending the enactment of specific legislation in the matter all future applications including the remaining applications on hand of course, will now be dealt with as I have indicated, that is, they will be examined by the advisory group which will, acting on the basis of the approved terms of reference, make recommendations to me as to whether the application should be granted or not.</P>
    <P>Now, turning to some of the more specific aspects of the questions, of the 39 applicants approved in the periods 1992, 1993 and up to 15 June, 25 of these applications were based on low interest loan facilities given to Irish-based companies and a further two applications were based on combined low interest loan facilities and share investments.  However, in researching this question, officials of my Department have informed me the figure given to me previously for 1992 of 17 applications granted in fact, should have <Col N="544" /> been 20.  The additional three applicants were granted on the basis of investment in forestry.</P>
    <P>A total of 22 applications have been received to date in 1994.  One application only has been approved since 1 June 1994.  This application was based on a £1 million investment which a company in County Limerick needed to save approximately 100 jobs and to create an additional 82 jobs.  I received representations from a broad range of political interests in support of this case. The circumstances were so compelling and, in an effort to secure the employment of the 100 employees, I asked the advisory group in August to meet and consider the application operating on the basis of the approved terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I would obviously have preferred not to take this step until after I had an opportunity to announce the terms of reference to the House, but on balance I felt that Deputies would not thank me for sticking too rigidly to protocol at the risk of seeing approximately 100 people lose their jobs in County Limerick.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton has asked me specifically when the Government decision was made on the working rules for the granting of citizenship as referred to by me in the House on 15 June last. However, I would remind the Deputy of exactly what I said on that occasion which, in fact, is accurately reflected in the Dáil Official Report.  I said that the scheme which we had then is the scheme which has existed since the Government decided that inward-based investment should constitute grounds for deeming the investment to have qualified for naturalisation on the basis of what the legislation describes as &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice itself had adopted certain working rules, the more important which were that an investment of about £500,000 would be required and that the applicants would demonstrate an intention of residing in the State by purchasing a residence. <Col N="545" /> Although these working rules were submitted to the Government, the Government decision was that the question of granting or refusing naturalisation in individual cases should be left in the absolute discretion of the Minister for Justice.  Despite this, Justice Ministers operated on the basis that investments of the order mentioned would be required and that intention to reside in the country for a reasonable period &mdash; to be evidenced, basically, by the purchase of a residence &mdash; would also be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a previous question put by me on this matter the Minister informed the House that to be eligible under this scheme it is necessary to have a residence and to live here.  I note the Minister has not taken Question No. 43 in relation to 11 Arabs on the Glenmore House soccer team in County Meath but it will be taken later. Given the Minister's comprehensive reply I wish to ask a number of supplementary questions.  Will she indicate how many jobs have been generated by the business migration scheme during the past eight years and how the Government measures its success? Given that 39 applications have been granted to date, will the Minister indicate if it is a worth while scheme and if it has worked well?  Will she indicate the level of investment in companies under that scheme to date and if such investment was made by way of share capital or soft loans?  Will the Minister agree that the proposed ethics commission under the Ethics in Public Office Bill should be allowed consider all applicants who have been naturalised and granted payments since the introduction of the scheme?  Will she inform the House how many of those applicants were intimately known by the Minister for the Environment, other Ministers or TDs?</P>

      <P>It should not have control over parliamentary questioning either.  That is the purpose for which we are here.  Will the Minister agree that the files opened under this scheme during the past eight years should be passed to the proposed ethics commission and it should report to the House on the matter because of widespread concern about the manner in which the scheme has operated and, in particular, how it has benefited a member of the Government, a matter about which the House will hear more?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a comprehensive reply because a number of Deputies asked details about the new scheme, its terms of reference and the qualifying conditions for naturalisation based on investment here.  The new scheme has been introduced because people, including members of the Government, were concerned that there was not the required level of openness and transparency.  I do not have answers to Deputy Mitchell's questions in regard to the number of jobs created or the measure of the success of the scheme. The new scheme has been set up to provide such answers.  It will indicate how many jobs will be created as a result of specific investments not because of a grant given by the IDA, Forfás or Fobairt.  The information requested by Deputy Mitchell and others will be available in respect of future applications that come before the Minister for Justice that will be referred to the advisory group for decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to whether the scheme was worthwhile, whenever the scheme was discussed in the House I gathered that all Opposition Members were opposed to it, that it had not operated well and <Col N="547" /> that it lacked openness and transparency. I gave a commitment in the House that I would not make decisions in relation to new applications until such time as I informed the House of the new terms of reference.  Shortly after I gave that commitment, a company in County Limerick identified a proposed overseas investor who wished to be naturalised on the basis of his investment in that company.  It is interesting that many people took the time to telephone me, to speak to me personally, to telephone a number of my colleagues and to put in writing requests that I should in extraordinary and exceptional circumstances such as this case support the application and do what I told the House I would not do. They encouraged me in every possible way to make a positive decision in relation to that company.  I resisted those entreaties until such time as it became apparent that many Opposition Members were concerned about that investment and because I considered that 100 jobs in the company would be lost if I did not make a decision.</P>

      <P>I believe the Minister was being facetious and disingenuous in her last statement.  Will she indicate if the advisory group which sought to improve the business migration scheme made a fundamental recommendation in that regard, namely, that a member of the Cabinet should not avail of the scheme for the purpose of investing in his or her company?  Surely the original complaint about the scheme arose because it was abused by a member of the Government.</P>

      <P>During a debate of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security I said it would be a terrible tragedy if, for example, a law company were deprived of support under a scheme such as this purely on the basis that one of its former partners had become a member of the Government. One company cannot be treated differently from another.  It would be grossly unfair to a company and its employees to exclude it from the scheme because its previous managing director had entered politics and became a member of the Cabinet.</P>

Will the Minister accept that most people value their citizenship and are concerned that citizenship is for sale at any price?

      <P>The primary use made of this scheme, and I presume will be made of the scheme in future under the new terms of reference, criteria and conditions, is to save existing jobs and to create new jobs in a company. Under the old scheme there was no requirement to quantify the number of jobs saved or created.  Under the new scheme there will be a condition whereby the number of jobs retained or created will have to be specifically quantified and that will exclude any grant facility that might be made available to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the soft loan arrangements, I do not have the information as to how many of the 25 cases would have qualified under the new scheme.  I do not have the companies' names or the type or amount of loan made in each case. Deputy Gilmore will agree that in the last 20 months many changes were made by the Department of Justice in the area of immigration and naturalisation. The Refugee Bill is being discussed by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  The terms of reference, conditions and criteria of the new scheme will be set down in law. When I became Minister for Justice I said I was unhappy with the way we dealt with the general naturalisation of individuals.  I felt this system should be <Col N="550" /> more open and transparent, and that is the intention in all legislation in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take these Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>As the House will know, it was open to me to give a personal explanation to the House on this matter which would preclude subsequent questions.  I have not taken this option but have chosen to inform the House fully in response to Private Notice Questions and I am happy to answer any supplementaries which may arise.  Given the importance of the issues which the Government is dealing with at the moment I apologise to the House that inattention to the detail of my personal affairs has resulted in an unnecessary distraction for Members and, more particularly, for my colleagues in Government.  I am genuinely sorry that an oversight on my part in failing to link, however inadvertently, a nominal share holding in the then Conroy Petroleum and Exploration Company with a possible perception of a future conflict of interest in dealing with a mining application by Arcon, should be a source of some embarrassment to me or to my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my first statements to the House as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in early February last year was to inform the Dáil that I was delegating responsibility for mining, among other duties, to the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Noel Treacy.  The industry in particular knows how well and how seriously he has taken those responsibilities; his initiative in setting up and directing the National Minerals Policy Review Group which is undertaking the most comprehensive examination of the whole sector since the foundation of the State is the best manifestation of his commitment to his allocated task.  In addition, he oversees the day-to-day work of the officials in the Exploration and Mining Division and the Geological Survey of Ireland in their business interaction with mining enterprises.  There were, of course, occasions when I was <Col N="553" /> kept informed of progress of the application because of my ultimate responsibilities under the relevant statutes.</P>
    <P>At no stage did I intervene in any of the ongoing and predictable technical discussions between my Department, including the Geological Survey of Ireland, and Kilkenny County Council, on the Arcon application.  The House will know of the public and transparent nature of many of these procedures.</P>
    <P>Although I had, from the outset, delegated responsibilities for mining to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, I accept that, as Minister with formal statutory responsibility, I should have made the connection between the minor shareholding I had in Conroy with the preliminary work undertaken by the Department in processing the Arcon development at Galmoy.  While I recognise that some people could allege that in a narrow and technical sense I was in breach of Cabinet guidelines because a possible conflict of interest might arise there was, however, no breach of the spirit of the guidelines in this case.  It never entered my mind at any stage that the forgotten nominal Conroy shareholding I bought nearly five years ago could be interpreted as affecting any of the decisions that would be taken on Arcon.  The processing of the Arcon application has been dealt with at all times on the basis of the best professional advice from the staff of the Department.</P>
    <P>The two safeguards which might have activated this linkage did not arise.  The fact that the Arcon proposal had never been submitted to a Government meeting meant that the discipline of declaring possible interest under Cabinet Procedure Instructions which might have been prompted by such an event never occurred.  In addition, when I first read the Cabinet Procedures Instructions in 1992 as the incoming Minister for Labour no such potential problems arose in my mind.</P>
    <P>For completeness and absolute clarity I am stating to the House that, in February 1990.  I purchased a small shareholding in Conroy for £960.  This was among <Col N="554" /> a number of small shareholdings I had acquired around that time, nearly five years ago.  This must be put in some context.  I have never had anything more than a small number of nominal shareholdings; I have never actively traded in these shares and therefore, when the shareholding in Arcon was brought to my attention on Friday by a journalist.  I realised immediately the perception that could arise, no matter how small my shareholding was, of a potential future conflict of interest. Obviously this was embarrassing and I regret that circumstances did not arise earlier which would have alerted me to this possible future conflict of interest. I did not, and would not, knowingly or consciously, retain financial interest in any enterprise where such a possibility could arise.</P>
    <P>Having sold the shareholding on Friday for £430 I subsequently advised the Taoiseach on Friday afternoon on the matter.  He accepted my explanation and in particular that while it might be possible to make a case that some small technical breach of Cabinet procedures had occurred inadvertently, there was no breach of the spirit of the Cabinet guidelines.  The House should also be informed that in 1989 and in 1990 I acquired small shareholdings in a number of publicly quoted Irish companies. In locating and then checking through my personal financial records around that time, on Friday last, I was reminded that among these small purchases were minor shareholdings in Glencar and Ennex.  There has been no active consideration of proposals involving my Department in the companies and no papers of any kind have been put to the Minister of State.  Deputy Treacy for decision relating to these companies in recent years.  However, as technically they, too, fall within my Department's responsibilities and could be open to the same construction I also disposed of them last Friday at a loss.  The value of these shares was £620 for Glencar and £100 for Ennex.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, I regret that this minor shareholding in Arcon from <Col N="555" /> which I derived no benefit of any kind should be a complication when there are such important demands to be made of Government.  As the House will I am sure accept there was no question of the shareholding having any influence in dealing with the Arcon mining application. I again wish to apologise for any inconvenience I have caused to my Government colleagues and the Members of this House.</P>

      <P>I owned £400 worth of shares in Arcon and it was an inadvertent act of omission on my part.  I purchased the shares five years ago.  I did not seek to hide anything about the Conroy Petroleum shares.  I have a copy of the share certificate and it certifies that Brian Cowen, TD, Leinster House, Kildare Street, Dublin 2, owned those shares.  If I was in the business of making a few pounds, as has been suggested and implied in all the allegations and contentions that have been made, this would not be the way to go about it. After I bought the shares I became increasingly disinterested in them.  It was a modest shareholding and, unfortunately, as time passed it became even more modest.  I acknowledge, despite the inadvertent act of omission on my part, that once it was brought to my attention I decided immediately to do what I did without instruction from anybody as that was the proper thing to do. At no stage did I seek to put personal self-interest before the proper discharge of my duties.</P>

      <P>In his reply the Minister did not give details of the transactions between his Department and Arcon and Kilkenny County Council in relation to the planning application and the advice his Department gave to Kilkenny County Council in processing that application. Is it true that a report commissioned by the Geological Survey of Ireland, and sent by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to Kilkenny County Council in connection with Arcon's planning permission, referred to possible serious safety risks attached to Arcon's planning application; that Arcon's planning application did not contain enough information and that, effectively, on that basis Kilkenny County Council could not grant Arcon planning permission? Is it also true that when Kilkenny County Council drew this matter to the Minister's attention he required all copies of the report to be withdrawn, overruled the advice of senior officials and caused the report to be changed before reissuing it in a form that would allow Kilkenny County Council to grant permission to Arcon?</P>

The House will know of the public and transparent nature of these procedures.  I assure Deputy Hogan and anybody else who seeks to question my integrity inside this House with privilege or perhaps outside, without privilege, that at no stage did I interfere in the technical discussions between the experts in my Department and those in Kilkenny County Council.  At no stage was any political direction ever given by me to change one scintilla of anything.  There were ongoing discussions between Kilkenny County Council, the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Exploration and Mining Division.  The Deputy may be aware, as it is in his county, that there were two planning applications and I presume that, subject to everything being done properly, he will not object to the issuing of a mining licence, based on the consideration of the mining board.</P>
      <P>Let me nail this for what it is &mdash; another part of the new Fine Gael tactic to smear me or this Government.  If Deputy Hogan wishes to insinuate or to express in explicit terms that I have done anything in the performance of my duties against the national interest, that was wrong or in any way incompatible with the performance of my duties I look forward to him saying that outside the House because I will vindicate my good name.</P>

      <P>The question I want to put to the Minister relates to the second matter which is the subject of Deputy Hogan's question and which, by comparison, is far more serious in its implications.  The Minister says he wants time to answer detailed questions but the question required him to say he will outline in detail his own personal dealings in regard to the report of the Arcon planning application.  That is in the question. Is the Minister aware of a report prepared by consultants &mdash; Cairns &mdash; from Scotland?  Is he aware also that under the law neither the planning authority nor An Bord Pleanála could have granted permission for this mine if there was any sentence in the report which indicated that the consultants felt they had insufficient information in the Arcon environmental impact study to make the decision?  Is the Minister aware also that the report which is on the files of Kilkenny County Council had such a sentence excised and has he any knowledge of where that took place?</P>

If any Deputy wishes to put down a question in this regard it will be answered.  The questions being asked now are totally separate from the mining shares issue, as I understand it.  It is a totally different issue but I want to make clear that there are answers to those questions which are well grounded.  No one should attempt to imply that there has been some wrongdoing in this instance.  To my knowledge there has not been any wrongdoing.  I have total confidence in the competence and professionalism of the people who work in my Department. That is my position in relation to those matters but in regard to the question as it applies to me, I repeat that I have had no dealings with Kilkenny County Council; it would not be my function nor my business to have dealings with the council on such matters.  I deal with the broad policy areas.

      <P>Accepting the truthfulness of the Minister's replies, would it not be wise for all Ministers to dispose automatically of all shareholdings in companies dealing with the Departments for which they assume responsibility? Would it be useful if all shareholdings by Ministers in all companies were to be disclosed immediately so that no other Minister would find himself in the position in which the Minister <Col N="563" /> now finds himself where apparently &mdash; through inadvertence &mdash; he forgot that he had a shareholding in a company he was dealing with?  Will he agree also that this is not a trivial matter &mdash; to use the words of the Minister for the Environment &mdash; and that it is important that procedures are seen to apply to the holding by Ministers of shares, be they large or small?

In respect of myself, I have done so impartially and correctly at all times.  There has not been at anytime a conflict of interest in relation to me.  I accept I could have saved myself some problem here today if I had realised the situation and disposed of my shares before assuming office.  To err is human but I am saying honestly and without equivocation that I did my job, that the shareholding in question did not inhibit me doing that job and will not inhibit me from doing it in the future.  I am thankful that many Members of the House accept that.</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag caint an oíche faoi dheireadh dúirt mé go mbeadh an tAire Airgeadais ag teacht go hInis chun brainse den ACC a oscailt go hoifigiúil.  Tháinig sé Dé hAoine seo caite agus tréaslaím leis an mbainisteoir agus leis an ACC as an bhfoirgneamh iontach atá acu.  Molaim an tAire féin as ucht an banc láidir atá anois faoin a choimirce aige san ACC.</P>
      <P>Tá brainse láidir den bhanc i gCill Rois chomh maith.  Níl sé ach cúig nó sé bliana ó shin ó bhí cuid mhaith airgid á chailliúint ag an ACC.  An uair sin ba le gnótha talmhaíochta agus feirmeoir-eachta amháin a bhí baint ag an ACC. Ach ansin thug an tAire cead dóibh leathnú agus gnó pearsanta agus ginearálta a ghlacadh.  Ó shin i leith tá an ACC mar bhanc ag dul chun cinn go maith agus brabús á bhaint amach gach bliain.  Mar sin féin tá baint láidir go fóill ag an mbanc le cúrsaí talmhaíochta agus féachann a lán feirmeoirí air mar bhanc dá gcuid féin, le bainisteoirí agus foirne a thuigeann na fadhbanna atá acu agus atá réidh chun scéimeanna speisialta a ullmhú a oireann dóibh.</P>
      <P>Luaigh mé cheanna an iasacht speisialta a chabhróidh le feirmeoirí a bheidh páirteach sa scéim CFP atá ag an ACC. Mhol mé scéim iasachta dóibh siúd a cheannóidh cúóta bainne faoin scéim nua a bhunaigh an tAire Talmhaíochta, Bia agus Foraoiseachta agus a d'fhógair sé inniu.</P>
      <P>I wish in passing to acknowledge the impact and importance of the milk quota study undertaken in conjunction with the Leader programme in Clare, the forerunner of the excellent subsidy scheme being introduced by the Minister, the details of which were announced today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of an understanding and committed bank in the development of agriculture cannot be over emphasised. There is no doubting the success of the <Col N="743" /> ACC in this regard.  We would do well to protect this specialist requirement of agriculture in the medium term.  The bank's branches in Ennis and Kilrush have added hundreds of farmers to their customer base and, as the Minister saw at first hand last Friday, are providing the service required by farmers.  It is appropriate to acknowledge the quality of service provided by the staff of the bank and to reflect this by guaranteeing their employment in so far as possible in any measures adopted.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday I referred to the report on jobs in the farming and food sectors by Liam Downey and Lance O'Brien.  In the section dealing with the maintenance of employment in agriculture the report found that the total number employed in agriculture declined by a half between 1960-85 and remained relatively static at approximately 168,000 between 1986-90 and that the number in farming and food declined by 12,000 and 4,000, respectively, during the next three to four years.  Increasing the competitiveness of the agriculture and food industries would help to maintain and generate job opportunities in the agricultural supply service sector and create a demand in other sectors most notably for building and construction industries. Clearly, this could only be possible in the context of a banking service which is tailored to the needs of farmers.  The total labour force engaged in farming, including those who engage in farming outside their principal non-farming occupations, is 254,000, approximately a quarter of the total workforce.</P>
    <P>Measures aimed at maintaining the level of employment in agriculture may yield a better return in investment than those which involve an over reliance on the industrial and services sectors. Measures are required which will generate additional part-time jobs in farming. Unfortunately, the main banks do not frequently look favourably on proposals along these lines.  The ACC has traditionally played a very important role in facilitating such developments, and I <Col N="744" /> hope it continues to do so in some form in the future.  While the scope of domestic policy is obviously limited, an expansion of advisory and training services would clearly help, as would a policy by the banking sector which is well disposed towards agriculture.</P>
    <P>The establishment of alternative farm based enterprises and community development projects is essential in ensuring the viability of farms and the maintenance of rural communities.  Such developments must be supported by the banking sector.  I welcome the Bill and the growth in the ACC and agriculture which it signals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this short technical Bill which proposes to increase the borrowing limit of the ACC.  I thank the ACC for the way it has conducted its business over the years and am glad it has turned the corner and is now a profit-making bank, which is essential.  During the early 1980s when the bank had some difficulties with outstanding loans the agricultural sector was also experiencing problems. I welcome the substantial improvements in that area in the intervening period.  I also welcome the decision by the ACC to get involved in retail banking as it gives people more options.  The bank is now a major player in the provision of house mortgage finance and its rates are highly attractive.</P>
      <P>The Government will have to decide on the future of the ACC and I hope any decisions will be in the best interests of the community at large.  I do not know if an amalgamation of financial institutions is the proper way to go about creating a third banking force as it could eventually lead to redundancies or early retirements.  Consideration should be given to the possibility of the ACC forming a link with a major banker in the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the ACC is to continue in the banking sector it will have to be given the necessary powers.  The State guarantees the savings of depositors, which is very <Col N="745" /> important.  The banks have been criticised for the interest rates paid on savings and the amounts charged for overdrafts. It is very hard to explain to ordinary people the differences in rates. A sum of £5,000 in a savings account in an ordinary bank attracts a maximum interest rate of three quarters of 1 per cent while the interest charged on a £5,000 loan can be as high as 12 per cent &mdash; the average is 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to explain the differential between deposits and the rates being charged.  Most of the main banks have introduced new schemes to assist industry, farming and the housing mortgage market.  Arrangements for fixed loans are also being put in place.  The question is whether one should avail of a fixed loan when the variable rate is extremely attractive.  There is no certainty about interest rates at the end of this year or early next year.  If we continue to control the finances at our present rate I do not foresee any pressure on the financial institutions to increase interest rates.  That will depend on how we manage our affairs.  Wages and salaries have increased substantially during the past three years, well beyond the rate of inflation.  Public sector pay is an enormous drain on our resources.</P>
    <P>Bankers, industrialists and commentators agree that if we can keep our finances in order and day to day spending in line, interest rates which are attractive to the borrower will be of enormous assistance to the economy. During the past six months especially the building industry has grown and the order books indicate an upturn in the economy.  If we can maintain the momentum and be seen to manage our affairs effectively our interest rates in 1995 will remain static.  If there is any slippage in the management of our financial affairs there will be concern in the markets.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  I have no doubt it will be in the best interests of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to reply to <Col N="746" /> this debate.  I am glad to note the broad support for the Bill expressed by the great majority of speakers.  While this is a short Bill there have been many speakers on both days.  I thank those Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I have taken note of the comments made and I regard them, by and large, as useful food for thought in the general process of preparing legislation on the banking sector.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies referred to the future of ACC Bank and of the State banks in general.  Any commentary by me on this matter at this time would be premature and would amount to speculation. Deputies are aware that on 10 October I received the report of the consultants whom I appointed to advise me on the available options in respect of the State banks in the context of Government policy for the banking sector, and in the light of a recommendation from the trustees of the Trustee Savings Bank which envisages the disposal of the State's interest in that bank. I am examining the report and expect to be in a position to put the matter before Government at an early date.  As I indicated on two occasions in recent weeks, I cannot make any comment on the matter until the Government has had the opportunity to consider it in detail. For that reason I do not propose to comment on any of the general points made by Opposition speakers in relation to that issue, other than to reiterate that no bank is for sale nor has any decision been made as to whether any bank will be sold.  Having said that, I would like to put on record my complete agreement with Deputy Yates that uncertainty can be damaging and that a prompt decision aimed at maximising the overall benefit to the economy, as several speakers have suggested, is therefore highly desirable.  I will be impressing that fact on my colleagues in Government.  I have no doubt that they will recognise that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention to Deputy Yates that the chairman of ACC Bank has assured me that he and his board will accept and act upon whatever <Col N="747" /> decision the Government comes to as regards the future of the State banks. There is no ambiguity about this.</P>
    <P>I want to reassure Deputy Rabbitte that major strategic decisions, in any area of policy, are not taken on the basis of budgetary opportunism.  In relation to the future of the State banks, as in other areas, policy decisions are taken with a view to maximising the benefit to the national economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell took issue with the very fact of ACC Bank being in State ownership.  He put this in the context of his general view of the role of State enterprise.  He should be able to take comfort from the fact that in reality, except on occasions like this when we have to interest ourselves in its affairs as legislators, ACC Bank is allowed run its own business at arm's length from any official intervention.</P>
    <P>Whatever our views on this issue, the fact is that ACC Bank is in the public sector.  The Minister for Finance is the 100 per cent shareholder.  As such I must take the necessary steps to make sure that the bank's operations will not be impeded.  That is why I am before the House with this Bill.  Most Deputies will accept that this is a good reason.</P>
    <P>Deputies McDowell and Rabbitte referred to Fóir Teoranta.  There is, of course, no question of re-establishing Fóir Teoranta in another guise.  That goes without saying.  We learned our lesson during the 1980s when Fóir Teoranta built up huge bad debts, so much so that the Exchequer had to write off £75 million when the rump of the Fóir Teoranta portfolio was transferred to ICC Bank in 1990.  We should not conclude that Fóir Teoranta did no good &mdash; far from it.  The balance of advantage lay with winding it up.  On Question Time some months ago I outlined the full facts and the difficulties for Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte and Hughes expressed widespread displeasure at the levels of bank charges.  This area is outside the remit of this Bill, as mentioned by Deputy Connolly, but the Taoiseach <Col N="748" /> and other Ministers, including myself, have met with the chairmen and chief executives of the major banks to discuss the various aspects of the relationship between the banks and their customers and how the banks can best contribute to the development of the economy. This initiative is ongoing.  I avail of every opportunity at meetings with senior executives and chairmen of the banks to make the points which are made to us by large businesses and the Small Firms Association.  This issue belongs for consideration on the Consumer Credit Bill but I have taken note of the points made and the views expressed.  I will avail of every opportunity to make these points known to the individuals concerned in the banking fraternity.</P>
    <P>There was also general support for increased competition in the banking sector.  The desirability of competition goes without saying.  I have already mentioned the importance I attach to it. This is a wider issue for another day, as is the question of the transparency of banking operations and accounting, which was raised by Deputy Higgins.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins usefully called attention to the quarterly survey carried out by the Small Firms Association and published some weeks ago.  ACC Bank came first in the survey's ranking of the cheapest banks for all business.  The survey took a basket of typical facilities and standard charges applied to small business people.  I welcome this endorsement of ACC's performance by an independent source.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes applauded the £100 million small business expansion loan scheme which is being administered by the ICC Bank.  He is correct in recognising the success of the scheme which is generating significant numbers of jobs by making subsidised credit available for eligible customers with viable projects. The leverage effect has been impressive and we are pleased with the way the scheme is proceeding.  I noted Deputy Hughes's comments regarding the encouragement of an enterprise culture by tax initiatives.  A total of 21 <Col N="749" /> reliefs and other significant tax concessions for businesses generally were introduced in this year's Finance Bill. We also introduced concessions in the Finance Act, 1993.  The recent urban renewal changes will greatly assist businesses and investors.  The &ldquo;living over the shop&rdquo; scheme was announced recently and last Thursday the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and I launched a new scheme for enterprise areas in six locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kenny and Power raised the question of the bank's capital requirements. This is a significant issue for ACC Bank, as for any other.  Capital is required by banks to enable them satisfy the capital adequacy requirements laid down by the Central Bank in accordance with EU requirements and the solvency ratio directives and, in general terms, to enable them increase their business.  The capital required by ACC Bank to increase its balance sheet by the £400 million increment provided for in the Bill will depend on a number of factors, including profitability, market conditions, the dividend policy of the board and the composition of the balance sheet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke correctly described ACC as a success story.  I noted his comments regarding funding for the horticulture sector and its importance to many parts of the country, especially his constituency of Dublin North.  Deputy Burke is of course aware that the ACC board is fully independent in its commercial decisions and I know he is not suggesting otherwise.  Nonetheless, I recognise his genuine concern and I noted his points about adequate and ongoing funding for the horticulture sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan proposed raising the borrowing limit, not to £1.4 billion but to £2 billion or more.  Not even the chairman of ACC Bank requested me to do that, but I welcome the Deputy's enthusiastic support for the bank.  From the enthusiasm he showed for the bank last week, its staff must be taking good <Col N="750" /> care of him.  I take his point, but I cannot oblige him.  As Minister for Finance I hold 100 per cent of the shares in ACC Bank on behalf of the people and this House is the fundamental representative institution of the people.  I do not often hear suggestions that I should not assume accountability for the powers and rights I exercise on behalf of the people.  All things being equal, a limit of £2 billion would take more years to reach than would be reasonable to keep ACC's affairs away from the scrutiny of this House.  One of the functions of the Bill is to allow parliamentary scrutiny and debate on an institution such as the ACC bank which is 100 per cent owned by the people.  I amended the limit some years ago and allowed Deputies an opportunity to express their views.  On the two occasions I have presented an ACC Bill to the House those views have been positive.  The changes proposed will allow ACC to move away from its sole concern with the agricultural sector. As Deputies may wish to air their views about this or other State companies in the future, it is appropriate that such matters be brought before the House.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the question of dormant accounts and I appreciate that is a source of genuine anxiety. Earlier this year I undertook to establish the number and size of such accounts in the banking system &mdash; a complex exercise.  There are obvious definitional and legal difficulties involved in such a process.  I obtained data from the banks and building societies, but as yet I do not have a complete picture of the position.  Accordingly, I sought further examination of accounts on the basis of new and broad criteria. When such data is to hand I will decide how best to proceed.  I replied to parliamentary questions in that regard recently in the House.</P>
    <P>Deputies remarked positively on the efficiency and profitability of ACC Bank.  That is gratifying.  It shows that a State shareholder need not be a bad thing.  More fundamentally, it shows how positive management and a serious <Col N="751" /> sense of purpose can turn around a business in difficulty and make it viable and profitable without much fuss, agitation or industrial relations or human resource difficulties.  ACC used imagination and innovation to get substantial footholds in sectors outside its traditional base in farming and agribusiness. In opening new branches I met regional managers and the people who do business with the bank.  As Deputy Killeen stated, I had the opportunity to carry out that function in Ennis last Friday.  I have witnessed the standing of ACC in both urban and rural areas.  The expansion of their business base is good news. The board, management and staff at all levels should be congratulated.  While ACC Bank is a serious player in other sectors, it remains active and profitable in the agricultural sector.  Its ethos of personal service and tailor-making schemes to individual needs has produced success and profitability.  It deserves out congratulations and should be allowed get on with its business, which is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell appears to hold the view that the Government is involved in the daily running of all State institutions.  Other than making legislative or policy changes or assigning the £100 million portfolio of loans at reduced interest rates to ICC, the involvement of the Minister for Finance or other Minister in the daily affairs of such institutions is effectively nil.  Issues such as staffing and the sanctioning of loans are decided on a commercial level. ACC Bank, although a State bank with 100 per cent of its shares held by me on behalf of the people, is a totally commercial bank which adopts similar criteria to those it would follow if owned by somebody else.  While I welcome the acknowledgement of its success.  I am concerned that people frequently believe there must be no State involvement if such ventures are to be a success. That is a slight on those who work in State companies.</P>
    <P>Most Members, including Deputy Michael McDowell, made very clear <Col N="752" /> their support of the bank.  I am not too sure whether the concept of its being 50 per cent or 100 per cent one way or the other would make any difference. However, if it engaged in joint ventures or issues perhaps it could grow more but that is a matter for consideration at another time.  Along with ACC and others I look forward to discussing these issues in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly asked whether it is true that the bulk of deposits with ACC are guaranteed by the State.  In this respect it is worth pointing out that in the past couple of years the bank has been very successfully raising deposits without any guarantee cover, as was the case with ICC bank, demonstrating the credibility of those banks <i>vis-à-vis</i> the investing public.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 20 to 40 and subtitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The court, on an application to it under subsection (1) (c) may, subject to subsection (5)&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  take evidence from the respondent by way of affidavit or sworn deposition,</P>
      <P>(b)  cause a copy of the affidavit or deposition to be sent to the Central Authority for transmission to the central authority of the designated jurisdiction with a request that the claimant provide an answering affidavit,</P>
      <P>(c)  send letters of request pursuant to section 17 for the taking of further evidence in a designated jurisdiction,</P>
      <P>(d)  take the evidence of the claimant or of any witness residing in a designated jurisdiction through a live television link,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> (e)  pending the final determination of the application, make an interim maintenance order under section 7 of the Act of 1976.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>These amendments relate to the procedure to be followed by the court when hearing an application for a maintenance order made by the central authority on behalf of a foreign claimant.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (4), which amendment No. 3 proposes to replace, seeks to recognise the difficulties in dealing with an application from a claimant who may be living thousands of miles away, who usually, through want of resources, will not be in a position to attend the hearing. It lists various options open to the court.  If, for example, the respondent &mdash; normally the husband &mdash; disputes any of the grounds put forward by the claimant in the documentation received through the central authority, the court can ask the respondent to make his case by swearing an affidavit outside court or by way of a sworn deposition in the courtroom there and the affidavit then could be sent to the central authority for transmission to the central authority where the claimant lives, with a request that the claimant provide an answering affidavit.  Alternatively, the court could ask a court in the foreign jurisdiction to take evidence on the matters raised by the respondent in his affidavit.</P>
    <P>If the court is not in a position to give a decision on the basis of those affidavits and any oral evidence of the respondent, it has the further option of requiring a claimant to give evidence through a live television link.  The necessary facilities can be provided in the equipment already in use in the Four Courts, though similar facilities may not be available in all of the foreign jurisdictions concerned.</P>
    <P>In most cases it is probable that the question of whether or not to make an order can be decided on the basis of the documentary evidence, especially when the foreign central authority is obliged to satisfy itself that the application is made in good faith and when it is authorised by the UN Convention to express <Col N="755" /> to the central authority here an opinion as to the merits of the case.  However, in order to comply with our constitutional requirements, we are obliged to provide for a case where the respondent may bona fide wish to cross-examine the claimant whether by way of television link or otherwise.  That is done in section 14 (5).</P>
    <P>As to the amendments, section 14 (4), has been redrafted to make it clear that the various options authorised can be exercised at the discretion of the court and do not need a prior determination by the court that the particular option is required in the interest of justice.  It excludes a specific reference to requiring the attendance of the foreign claimant or witness at the hearing.  This is a power normally exercisable by any court.  In addition, as section 14 (5) provides, the attendance of a witness for cross-examination can be required if television facilities are not available.</P>
    <P>The amendment of section 14 (5) is of a purely drafting nature and makes provision for the availability of a witness for cross-examination by television link as well as by personal appearance in court here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill received considerable welcome on Second and Committee Stages when there was general recognition of the major problem we have here whenever people abscond when it is very difficult to extract maintenance from them.  In the course of our discussions we discussed the expenditure entailed in circumstances in which people, husbands in particular, may have gone very far beyond this jurisdiction &mdash; as the Minister has said, thousands of miles away. Initially we thought more in terms of hundreds of miles.  Since the provisions of this Bill refer not so much to the United Kingdom &mdash; indeed they do not refer at all to the United Kingdom since that problem was covered by previous legislation &mdash; presumably we are talking about countries like Germany, the <Col N="756" /> United States, South America, to wherever people abscond leaving behind their responsibilities.  God knows how far such people may travel.</P>
      <P>The question arose as to the problems inherent in the case of someone in poor circumstances having to travel to some foreign country to give evidence.  In maintenance cases we accepted that we might be dealing with a section of our society within which resources would be very limited indeed.  For that reason some of the suggestions the Minister has now accepted by way of his amendment No. 3 were made on the manner in which the affidavit might be made and the use of a live television link.</P>
      <P>One question which the Minister promised on Committee Stage to investigate and reply to on Report Stage related to free legal aid.  It was pointed out that free legal aid did not cover travelling expenses.  I know that the proposal in this amendment for the live television link and affidavits will reduce that transport requirement in so far as witnesses will not be required to be present, but some travelling expenses may still be incurred.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to consider that matter?  He promised to do so on Committee Stage as reported in columns 881 and 882 of the Official Report of 21 July in response to a contribution by my colleague, Deputy Browne.</P>
      <P>He also referred to equipment in the Four Courts.  He is more aware of what happens there and the equipment in place than I am.</P>

I am sure he will not want to go there too soon in the future, but I could not agree with him on that.  I hope he will have an opportunity to go back to the Four Courts to test how rusty he is and that sufficient time will not elapse to allow him to become too rusty.  What <Col N="757" /> equipment is available in the Four Courts in respect of this matter?</P>
      <P>I am aware that the use of live television links has been considered in respect of taking evidence and so on and that rules and regulations have been drawn up to cater for that.  Has the Minister considered that television is a tricky medium which requires control and will he consider that?  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Currie for his helpful remarks.  The Legal Aid Board is charged with the administration of the free legal aid system and considers each case individually.  There is no hard and fast rule on this matter, but there is provision for the retention of professional witnesses, calling witnesses and providing travel expenses if the board considers such measures are necessary and appropriate.  It is open and objective in that regard and where it considers such expenditure is necessary it will agree to it.  I hope to introduce the Civil Legal Aid Bill shortly at which time we can discuss this issue at some length.  The increased funding available to the Legal Aid Board enables it to be more liberal in respect of incidental expenses.  One must be careful how resources are administered and I am sure the board is careful in that regard.  Often, professional witnesses are required and this uses up substantial resources to the detriment of other litigants.  The board adopts a sensible approach and where expenses, including travelling expenses, are necesary it provides for them.</P>

      <P>I commend the chairman and members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on the publication of the committee's report, <i>The Enlargement of the European Union</i>, last month.  That report sets out the views of member states on enlargement and its implications for the European Union.  It concludes that the proposed increase in membership of the European Union from 12 to 16 states will greatly benefit European and will deepen and strengthen the Union.  The committee strongly supports the principle of the united approach and rejects the two speed option as divisive and undesirable.  That view was expressed by a number of speakers who indicated their concern about the implications of a two speed option for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of institutional change arising from enlargement the report of the joint committee raises possible choices under three different headings, namely the <i>status quo</i> plus model, the <Col N="760" /> evolutionary model and the federal constitutional model.  It argues that the first model cannot continue to be viable given the inevitable institutional pressures a series of enlargement would bring and recommends that the implications for Irish policy of the evolutionary and federal constitutional models be examined and debated.  All options and their implications should be considered given our involvement in the European Union is such an important issue.  It further highlights the need for Ireland to play a leading role in outlining and promoting a series of effective and appropriate mechanisms to protect the contribution of small member states.</P>
    <P>Arising from that it is vital that small states should have a disproportionate presence in the institutional system.  The approach of the Benelux countries in its submission to the Lisbon European Council is along those lines and supports the presence of one member per state in the Commission and the continuation of the six month rota of the Presidency.  In the context of support from those three founder states the position of small nations is virtually assured.  Nevertheless, the larger states, two in particular, make a disproportionate contribution to the income of the Union and it would be tragic if the democratic element were to be undermined on foot of that.  It is provided on the six month rota that Ireland will hold the Presidency in the second half of 1996.  During that time we will have an opportunity to advance our views and it is vital that we assess our own position in the EU and take action to protect and enhance it in future years.</P>
    <P>From the outset Ireland welcomed the application for membership of the EU by the four EFTA countries &mdash; Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden.  This country has close relations with all four countries and has a similar outlook on a range of international issues.  There was strong co-operation between the EU and EFTA countries, particularly as a result of the EEA agreement.  Ireland's national response to problems that <Col N="761" /> emerged during the negotiations for accession elicited considerable admiration, seeking as it did to strike a balance between the interests of the Union and its member states on the one hand and the legitimate requirements of the applicant on the other.</P>
    <P>New members will be required to adopt from accession a large body of treaty provisions, regulations, directives and decisions, as well as the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. In very exceptional circumstances and to cater for overriding national concerns, the applicants were granted temporary derogations from particular provisions of Community secondary legislation, none of which has detrimental effect on Ireland's interests.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State outlined, the question of weighted voting posed some difficulties, but these were ultimately resolved, apparently to everybody's satisfaction.  There was concern here at the prospect of new members joining the EU, with a particular reference to the Common Agricultural Policy.  I welcome the outcome of the negotiations on this front in view of the continued support for CAP and the satisfactory result on budgetary implications. However, we need to look down the road to the day when the current CAP and GATT regimes come up for renegotiation and when new members seek accession to the EU.</P>
    <P>Our agriculture sector is investing huge levels of finance in environmental protection measures.  While this programme receives substantial EU aid under the control of farmyard pollution and rural environmental protection schemes, the vast majority of farmers who are investing in these measures will never see a return on their investment. It is a capital programme which does not add to productivity and will ultimately become an ongoing burden of debt for many farmers.  We urgently need to review the operation of some of these programmes to ensure the maximum level of benefit for Irish agriculture as a whole and, perhaps more importantly, to ensure that individual <Col N="762" /> farmers are not steamrolled by a burden of debt which ultimately may put a large number of them out of business.  In this regard the backdating of the CFP scheme to January 1994 for all who were previously on the FIP scheme would be most welcome and beneficial.</P>
    <P>There are ongoing problems with some of the grant and premium schemes which require alterations to significantly improve their impact on the industry. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has succeeded in negotiating worth-while improvements, but the entire programme must be kept under constant review and greater control of its operation must be exercised by the Minister as opposed to the EU.  In this regard I welcome the Minister's announcement during the week of the quota review groups.</P>
    <P>If some of the eastern European states which have applied for membership of the EU are successful in their applications it will impact very significantly on CAP, leading to a severe reduction in the level of support available to Irish agriculture.  We ignore these developments at our peril.  It is incumbent on us to prepare a strategy and to pursue it vigorously, with the support of all who share common cause with us, to ensure its ultimate adoption within the EU's new Common Agricultural Policy and to achieve further acceptance of the successor of GATT.</P>
    <P>We urgently need to review our regional policy in the EU context.  To all intents and purposes we have heretofore presented Ireland as one region. Account must be taken in the not too distant future of the economic advances in parts of the country that may be disqualified from category 1 status. Assuming that this happens &mdash; there is a possibility that it will not happen &mdash; it will be important to ensure that those areas which continue to suffer economic disadvantage are categorised accordingly. This will be particularly important in the event that some of the less developed eastern European and Mediterranean applicants become full EU <Col N="763" /> members and draw down considerable funds from an ever-decreasing kitty.</P>
    <P>One must be concerned at the resurgence of racism, xenophobia and intolerance in parts of the world contingent on Europe.  These developments run counter to the foundation and spirit of a united Europe.  There have been worrying instances within the EU of acts of violence against foreigners and migrant workers.  This country has received negative publicity arising from the violence in the Six Counties during a 25-year period.  However, we are now entering a new era of peace thanks to the success of the peace process and all those involved in it.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers last week mentioned the growth of neo-Nazism in some countries, including Austria, one of the applicants for accession.  This development is very worrying for those who are committed to the democratic process.  The pursuit of peace based on justice and international co-operation is vital for the preservation of human society and civilisation, and the developed EU is central to this aspiration. If we are to discourage our citizens from turning away from the European ideal we must take effective action to forestall the re-emergence of extreme nationalism and the negative forces I mentioned.  It is a matter of urgency that we redress the democratic deficit which could threaten the political basis of the European Union and of democracy in any or all its member states.</P>
    <P>While national parliaments are the ideal fora for democratic debate on the future of Europe, it is important that European institutions be responsive to people's views and be seen to be so. They urgently need to seek means for wide public participation by debate, by informing the public of issues and by clearly outlining the various policy options and their implications.  We sometimes fail miserably to put all the options before the people &mdash; that applies in the current debate on accession of these countries.  In the general political context we frequently fail <Col N="764" /> to explain to people the implications of actions proposed by Government.  That undoubtedly has a detrimental effect on the way people view their politicians.</P>
    <P>In this regard many of us in this Parliament could profitably review the manner in which we all too frequently seek to misrepresent the position of our political opponents.  We had some examples of that here today and also in recent times in terms of ministerial travel. Politicians who knowingly misrepresent actions of opponents for personal or party gain do an enormous disservice to the political process and to democracy as a whole.  This is reflected in a very negative view among the general public of politicians and, much more importantly, of public institutions, including the EU.  While everybody knows that government ministers in an island country must travel to do business, the constant media criticism fed by political comment has a negative effect and merely serves to undermine democracy and the institutions which sustain it.</P>
    <P>The EU is very quickly becoming central to the operation of our own political system and we would do well to include people in the process rather than feeding the cynicism which is gradually undermining the basis of our State.  The same applies to other countries, both inside and outside the European Union.  In some countries the rule of law has disintegrated and, in effect, there is no government and no respect for human rights.  Since some of these states are close to the European Union and each of us has an interest in their well-being and that of their citizens it is incumbent upon us to attempt to be constructive.  Frequently we fail to do so and the blame can be shared equally. Many of us fail to realise that ordinary people are cynical about the political process.  We need to address this problem in the short term rather than allow it to fester to the point where we will have to contend with the problems that other countries not too far from us have to contend with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> I welcome the report and the enabling legislation dealing with the accession of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria.  I hope we take the opportunity as frequently as possible to uphold the institutions of the State and of the European Union which have become a central feature of the political process here.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about this issue in which I have had an interest for a long time.  When asked what he thought about America Brendan Behan replied that it would be a great country when it was completed and finished.  When we think of the European Union we often get the sense that there is always something underway and that it is constantly changing.  This is particularly true at present.  This is an important and critical time for all of us to play a strong and forceful role in the development of the European Union.  I firmly believe in the ideal of European integration.  There is no alternative to working closely at European level to tackle major issues and to ensure greater prosperity and peace both at European level and throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I begin by addressing the question of finance.  A number of speakers have expressed the fear that there will be a two speed Europe whereby some states would move ahead with, for example, a common currency and others would lag behind.  People fear that there will be an élite group of countries which will march ahead leaving the smaller nations behind.  This is a real possibility.  Smaller countries will be under enormous pressure because of this during the next few years.  It is important therefore that we should be vigilant and do all we can to ensure that this will not happen and track the suggestions that are being made at European level about a two speed Europe.  There is no doubt that there is a strong temptation for the larger countries to move ahead on their own.  This means that it is absolutely essential that a proper balance, in terms of powers, is struck between the bigger <Col N="766" /> and smaller countries.  Given that a referendum has been held in Finland and is due to be held in three other countries it is extremely important that we pay a great deal of attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>It is being assumed that, at a financial level, we are grouped with the bigger countries which meet the financial criteria. While it is true that we meet many of the criteria under the Maastricht Treaty it is also true that we face two major problems &mdash; our high unemployment rate and the national debt.  There is no point in saying that we meet the criteria.  The reality is that other countries are reluctant to include Ireland in the group of countries that would move ahead, whereas Belgium is always mentioned.</P>
    <P>Our efforts in this regard are not helped by the perception that traditionally we have adopted a begging bowl mentality towards the European Union and have gone out of our way to get the largest amount of funds possible.  I am not saying that this is a bad thing; obviously we have derived great benefits from the Structural Funds but we are not being consistent in the two lines we put forward.  This invariably leads to comments and questions from other countries.</P>
    <P>It is critical that we show we are tackling our high unemployment rate and our level of debt.  We face two problems in this regard; the first is high Government spending which means that our ability to tackle our debt is reduced and the other is that the long term unemployed account for a large percentage of the total number unemployed.  We are not putting the mechanisms in place to reduce the number of long term unemployed, which includes many young people.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the working group of the National Economic and Social Forum which recently produced a report on long term unemployment.  It is critical that the Government gives priority to the recommendations made in that report.  This has not happened to date although I understand a task force is considering the matter to see how the <Col N="767" /> problem of long term unemployment can be tackled.  I note that a pilot scheme is to be introduced to provide counselling which is so essential in helping people break the cycle.  I look forward to the report of the task force and hope that the pilot scheme will be extended.  This was one of the core recommendations we made.</P>
    <P>Our dependency on sterling also presents a problem in the sense that if sterling is devalued jobs will be lost here.  There is a question mark over our ability to cope with the after effects.</P>
    <P>People frequently use the term &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo;.  There is a problem in terms of the information provided to the public and their understanding of the European Union.  It is critical that links are developed between national parliaments and the European Parliament and the European Commission.  This became evident during the campaign leading to the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty when there was a backlash from the public who felt that they had not been kept informed and that information about the European Union had been kept at an élite level.  European leaders picked up this message and have tried to tackle the issue in those countries in which referenda are due to take place.</P>
    <P>The President-elect of the European Commission, Mr. Santer, has dedicated himself to tackling this issue and has said that it will be given priority during his presidency and that all institutions are determined to make a huge effort to resolve it.  It is critical that we do likewise. It is interesting that the European Commission office in Dublin received a strong response when it provided a special telephone service during the past few weeks to deal with queries from the public about the European Union.  I am not surprised that people are interested and want more information.</P>
    <P>There is a good story to be told about what is happening at a European level but it is unacceptable that it is not being told carefully at grassroots level.  Future <Col N="768" /> referenda on European Union matters will face enormous problems if we do not prioritise this issue and make the work of the European Parliament and Commission more accessible and understandable to society.  It is very sad that in Finland fewer came out to vote in the referendum on the European Union, although it was passed successfully, than come out for its presidential election.  It is also sad that there has been so little discussion in this country on the implications of the enlargement of the Union.  It is hard to see people keeping up their interest in Europe if information on developments is not continuously fed back to them.  I find it very interesting that in Sweden the success of its referendum will probably depend on how young Swedish women will vote. They are very concerned that by joining the European Union their social benefits will deteriorate.  The EU Commission and the Parliament have spent a great deal of time trying to convince them that this is not the case, that &ldquo;social Europe&rdquo; does exist and that at European level we care about women's rights and issues such as combining work and family life and parental leave. These will be critical factors in determining the success of that referendum.</P>
    <P>These are very real issues for the European Union and we need to spend much more time bringing information on European issues to the people.  That has not happened.  I understand that people may be nervous the referendum will not be passed in the various countries but I do not think that is an excuse not to discuss issues such as the implications of enlargement for agriculture. We should have a real debate and discussion about the implications of Finnish membership.</P>
    <P>It is time to stop talking and do something about the matter.  Members of the European Parliament obviously can attend the Oireachtas Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs, but as one MEP said yesterday at a meeting I attended, Wednesday afternoon is certainly not the best day for most MEPs to attend a <Col N="769" /> meeting in the Dáil.  This is a practical matter.  We need to develop mechanisms to allow for more contact with our MEPs.  We need also to develop a mechanism whereby what has been done by our Ministers at the Council of Ministers is discussed and presented at some level in the Dáil before it goes to Council of Ministers' meetings.  When I was chairwoman of the Council for the Status of Women I remember trying to track the paternity directive at European level and it was extremely difficult to discern Ireland's view on that directive. I am not sure that Ireland was out in front in support of that directive. From what I remember there was a large question mark in 1993 over how supportive our Government would be.</P>
    <P>As shadow spokesperson on Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, I found it extremely difficult to shadow the European dimension of the Minister's work and it was very difficult to get information at that level.  There was no forum available to me in the Dáil where I could get that information and it was difficult to discover what was on the agenda.  That is completely unacceptable. We have to address this matter and implement reform so that it is dealt with in this House and that we develop a committee system to deal with it.  They have done so in other countries.  Information which is difficult to track in Ireland is accessible in another member state because they have a method in their national parliament of presenting the information before it is dealt with at European level.  My experience illustrates how difficult it can be for those outside the House to gain access to the system.  It is important to tackle this issue.</P>
    <P>The European Union will have a population of 380 million by the year 2000, making it the biggest civil and commercial power in the world.  How it works is extremely important.  Seventy-seven per cent of Irish people think European unity is a good thing in contrast to only 45 per cent of those in Britain and an average of 58 per cent throughout the Community.  Irish <Col N="770" /> people are supportive of developments at European level.  There is no doubt that there is an exciting build-up to the intergovernmental conference in 1996 with important items on the agenda and the Irish Presidency.  In some areas we need to move much more swiftly at European level if we are to tackle certain problems.  The drugs problem must be tackled at European and world level if we are to interrupt the supply and stop the trade.  The public is dissatisfied that the establishment of an agency to deal with this problem at European level has been so slow.  This needs to be hastened, as does work on the environment. Some very good initiatives at European level have impacted on the quality of our environment.</P>
    <P>Defence is a major area to be addressed.  We must take part in the debate on how we want to work for peace.  We must have a debate on neutrality, on our defence commitment at European level and the shape it will take in the years to come.  The Finnish Government has a policy of neutrality and with Austria, Sweden and Norway being involved in the Community there should be scope for a pro-active peace-keeping role to be developed in the European Union.</P>
    <P>We will see further cohesive action being undertaken by the Community on energy, tourism and civil protection from 1996 onwards and this will be welcomed by citizens.  A number of issues need to be tackled at European level if Europe is to survive the competition it will face in the years ahead.  The increasing level of unemployment, above all other issues, makes people doubtful about Europe.  People hope that if we work together we can solve the problem of unemployment.  There must be a radical overhaul of our unemployment systems throughout the Community and of our training, education and tax systems.  We have to put the creation of jobs to the forefront and face up to the fact that many of our employment systems are inconsistent with the economic and social realities <Col N="771" /> that individuals experience.  I am constantly struck by this at constituency level.  I can give an example.  I spoke to a lone parent who was given a present of a cheap car by a family friend but was then immediately questioned by the local social welfare officer as to where she had got the money for the car.  This young woman is determined to make it on her own and trying to crawl out of dependency on social welfare yet every step is actually frowned upon by the system. This story illustrates that what we are good at doing is helping people to remain dependent on the system rather than supporting their steps towards independence.</P>
    <P>It is essential that our taxation and economic systems reflect the movement of people in and out of the workforce. People want flexibility and career breaks.  They will move through many jobs in a lifetime or else, unfortunately, face periods of unemployment.  Our systems must react to this new situation which is quite different to anything our social security systems had to deal with previously.  People are making different choices and work is presenting in a different way.</P>
    <P>We must also tackle Government reform.  The division of ministries is no longer efficient.  The Department dealing with Social Welfare, for example, should not be completely separate from the Department dealing with enterprise and employment, labour or industry. We need more interaction between Government ministries and more sophisticated systems should be developed.</P>
    <P>Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the Community said: &ldquo;We are not forming coalitions between states but union among people&rdquo;.  It is clear that we are well on the way towards that and this is an exciting time but there is much work to be done if the European Union is to offer a high quality of life to its citizens in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I <Col N="772" /> enjoyed listening to Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  It is important we have this debate in the House.  In the past, major developments in Europe were not given the consideration they deserved here. This is the national Parliament and issues concerning Europe must be addressed in the House on a regular basis.  Many Members referred to the lack of communication or co-operation between the European Parliament and this Parliament and it is important to address that issue.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs for its report on the enlargement of the European Union.  A number of members of that committee put much time and effort into the report which is well worth reading and offers much food for thought.  It outlines a number of opportunities which the enlargement of the EU will present to Ireland.  We have good relations with Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden and I hope those relations will be strengthened in the future.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers referred to the lack of information from Europe on European developments.  Unfortunately, over the past number of years, only during European elections or referenda on Europe did information come from the EU.  It is either a feast or a famine.  Ireland should receive information on a regular basis concerning the developments in Europe that will affect us.  We should not have to wait for European elections to receive such information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on Maastricht, we were assumed that if we voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to Maastricht, we could have our passports at home when travelling to Europe. That has not happened and a number of my constituents have contacted me asking if there has been change in this regard.  That was one of the small selling points of the Maastricht debate but it was something with which people could identify because it would benefit them when travelling to Europe.  It seemed at the time that some of the red tape would be eliminated and people could identify with that.  Unfortunately, we <Col N="773" /> have not seen any great development in that area but I hope to see some in the near future.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the enlargement of the European Union, a number of problems of the four countries concerned were discussed.  There was a certain amount of confidence that those problems would be overcome.  One area in which we are interested related to fisheries.  I am delighted the Minister indicated in the House that under the European Economic Area Agreement Ireland will receive 7.5 per cent of the Norwegian cod allocated to cohesion countries and this represents access to an area to which Ireland has not previously had access.</P>
    <P>We have failed our country with regard to fisheries.  Despite being an island nation, when we entered the EC our fishing industry was very underdeveloped and we were not in a position to capitalise on it.  In the last few years we have recognised the tremendous potential in the fishing industry and we should pay particular attention to that in the future.  Being an island nation, our fishing industry should be much more advanced but, unfortunately, it is not.  When the quotas were being allocated the industry was underdeveloped and we were not in a position to make the most of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the begging bowl mentality and that criticism, has been levelled at various Governments over the last few years. However, we should not underestimate the tremendous role that Irish MEPs have played in Europe.  I refer in particular to past commissioners, Ray Mac-Sharry, Peter Sutherland and our present commissioner, Padraig Flynn, who have all excelled in Europe.  Perhaps the Irish are late developers but certainly those three individuals have contributed much to Europe and we can be proud of their work not just on our behalf but on behalf of Europe.  It is wrong, to continually refer to the begging bowl mentality.  We are an island nation further removed from the market and it is important that we receive <Col N="774" /> compensation for that shortcoming.  We need not apologise for moneys received in the past and we should not be under any illusion but that those moneys will continue to be required in the future.</P>
    <P>The European Union will undoubtedly continue to grow &mdash; it may eventually comprise of 25 or 30 member states &mdash; so it must become more relevant to our people.  I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald's reference to drugs and unemployment. People underestimate the devastation the drugs problem is causing throughout Europe.  We must have an overall co-ordinated approach to dealing with it.  Regardless of resources we allocate to dealing with it, it is an international problem which must be dealt with in that way.  From a European point of view it is important to have an overall strategy to deal with the problem, which is the cause of many troubles in Europe.  People can see the effects of the drug problem in the devastation it causes in their neighbourhoods and among their families.  We must publicise European policy on that and let people know the steps we are taking to resolve the matter.  Until we tackle it in a serious fashion it will remain the biggest problem in Europe.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald's comments about the need to change the educational system.  We tended to educate people for secure positions, for example, the Civil Service or the bank. Nowadays people change jobs regularly and it is estimated that most people will have eight or ten different jobs in their lifetime.  We must encourage the spirit of enterprise at an early age.  People must be encouraged to use their talents and we should change our educational system to allow them develop to their full potential.  We all know people in every village who are musical but who never had an opportunity to develop their talent.  That is the case in every walk of life and it is sinful not to develop such talent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the enlargement of the Union but it is important that the Government makes business aware of the opportunities it will create.  There is <Col N="775" /> a column in one of the Sunday newspapers which focuses on a different country each week and highlights the opportunities which exist for trading with it.  I find it very helpful and it makes good reading.  Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden will soon become part of the EU.  The big increase in the population in Europe will create opportunities for industry in Ireland and it is important to avail of that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and hope that the EU will soon grow from 12 to 16 member states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the enlargement of the EU and on our attitude towards it.  The committee's report is useful in that it highlights areas that need to be examined. Enlargement of the Community will mean increased competition and it will be necessary for us to encourage business to improve its base.</P>
      <P>Finland did not have a history of peat production but it used the technology we had acquired for peat production and reclamation and now it is miles ahead of us.  Their regional airports are profitable while in some regions our airports are not economically viable.  Why? Is it because we have become too dependent?  Shannon Airport is in steady decline mainly due to the impression given by those in Dublin that they suffered from the loss of American traffic.  I would like the committee to examine further what other countries have achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Germany holds the presidency at present and it will be our turn to do so in 1996.  We are slow to make proper preparations for this responsibility.  I put down parliamentary questions to the previous Taoiseach who enjoyed holding the presidency.  The replies given were negative and vague.  There is an onus on the Government to set up a body which would make progress in this area.  At present all the pressure is on the German Ambassador but we do not seem to have prepared for the German presidency.  If we had there would be a <Col N="776" /> greater appreciation of Ireland at important meetings which we attend in Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Government parties are committed to Europe.  One of them was doubtful about whether we should join the EU and the other was reluctant to campaign about it when Jack Lynch was Taoiseach.  Fianna Fáil went, begrudgingly, into the EU.  The Taoiseach spoke about billions of pounds coming our way during the Maastricht Treaty referendum and, because of that, people voted for it.  The talk from Fianna Fáil was how would we use this money we were getting for nothing.</P>

Dr. Garret FitzGerald's record of leadership will stand comparison with that of anyone in Europe while Peter Sutherland proved that not only was he a successful Commissioner but also a successful negotiator, as was seen during the GATT negotiations.  There were a number of rows in this House about the lack of Government support for Peter Sutherland's candidacy for the post of President of the Commission.  This lack of support was deplorable, especially in light of the united approach adopted by all parties in support of the Maastricht Treaty.  When the Taoiseach had an opportunity to nominate a candidate of substance to lead Europe into the year 2000 he ignored it.</P>

      <P>All I am concerned about is the leadership shown by Ireland in Europe.  I was illustrating my point by referring to a former commissioner and the former leader of the Fine Gael Party, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who played a major role in ensuring that Ireland joined the EU.  I was being critical of the lack of Government support for a person whom other countries supported.</P>
      <P>I should like some preparations to be made for the Irish Presidency in 1996. On the last occasion Ireland held the Presidency the Department of Justice was very much involved with the EU legislation on aliens and asylum seekers in Europe and little attention was paid to legislation dealing with aliens and asylum seekers in Ireland.  As a result numerous people were incarcerated in jail.  Things might have been otherwise if the officials had more time to deal with this issue, to prepare properly for the Presidency and to consider the legislation which would arise when we assumed the Presidency.  Our legislation was put on the long finger and some people were left to languish in jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to <Col N="778" /> ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance to ensure that proper Civil Service back up is provided prior to Ireland assuming the Presidency in 1996.  In view of its ongoing nature, some sort of permanent structure should be established to deal with this issue.  Such a structure might have a role to play in providing information on the Presidency and the legislation which might arise and explaining the consequences of EU enlargement to the electorate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  Finland and Austria have already voted in favour of membership, while referendums will be held in Norway and Sweden next month.  It is important to point out that 40 per cent of the electorate in Sweden and 45 per cent of the electorate in Norway are opposed to membership of the EU.  I hope these countries, which have strong democratic traditions and strong economies, will vote in favour of membership. There are problems in Finland following the demise of the former Soviet Union but the indications are that Finland will pull itself out of those difficulties following membership.</P>
      <P>Like Ireland, these countries have a very good peace-keeping tradition within the UN and share our views on intervention.  As more smaller countries join the EU the fear, as rightly voiced in England, of a Franco-German bloc controlling the EU will be overcome. Like Ireland the four applicant countries are on the periphery of Europe and their membership will ensure more sympathy for people living in these areas. We have many things in common with these countries.  Ireland is being cited by them as a country which has done well from membership of the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be foolish of us to ignore the negative aspects of membership outlined by these countries. For example, they believe that the EU is backward in terms of social issues relating to women and that their legislation is stronger on <Col N="779" /> the protection of the environment.  They also raise questions about freedom of information, which is much greater in Sweden than in the EU.  This will become a much more topical issue in Ireland and the EU.  These countries believe they will lose in these areas as members of the Union whereas we believe we have benefited.  This is an indication of how far ahead of us they are in these areas.  Freedom of information will become even more important in the future.  There was reference to the problem of drugs in Europe and some of the decisions in Europe in general, particularly if we include Switzerland, were very radical compared with those in Ireland.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann supports the need for competition between community television and existing licenceholders under the 1926 Wireless and Telegraphy Act and calls on the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to amend the Wireless Telegraphy (Television Programme Retransmission) Regulations, 1989 to implement this policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, the Minister for Communications has the power to grant or refuse an applicant a licence to transmit signals within a certain frequency band.  By regulations published by the Minister for Communications in March 1988, the Minister <Col N="780" /> regulated the manner in which licences for an apparatus used solely for the purpose of transmitting television programmes were to be applied for and granted.  Subsequently, it was decided to grant ten franchise areas throughout the country for the purpose of retransmitting television programmes and multipoints micro wave distribution systems, known as MMDS, were identified as the appropriate technology which would provide a range of high quality multi-channel TV choice in rural areas as is already available to people served by cable systems in urban areas.  An extension of existing cable systems would not operate satisfactorily to the less densely populated areas due to the high cost to subscribers and the large capital investment that such developments would demand.  Accordingly, the Department of Communications ignored all possibilities and adopted the MMDS system, the best available technology, to give greater choice of TV channels at a reasonable cost in those parts of the country where a cable system would be cost prohibitive and meet our international treaty obligations on the use of radio frequencies.  MMDS owes its development to two systems first used in North America in the early 1960s, the metropolitan distribution system, MDS, and the instructional television fixed service, ITFS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>MDS is a local delivery system capable of distributing video voice and data signals by radio waves from a central transmitter to individual residential locations.  It has the potential to retransmit up to 11 channels in addition to the RTE services without any requirement to change a television set.  However, an MMDS receiver antenna and a down converter will be required to pick up the MMDS signals from the control transmitter and change them to frequencies suited to the TV set.  On 6 May 1988 the Minister for Communications issued retransmission licences for the ten franchise areas.  The decision announced by the Minister was that only applications <Col N="781" /> for the supply of a retransmission system known as MMDS would be entertained by the Minister; that licences granted would be exclusive licences, that is, the licensee would have a monopoly in the area over which the licence was granted and no other licence would be granted over it and that the MMDS system be used for the transmission of signals in the band 2,500 to 2,700 MHZ.</P>
    <P>The result of the Minister's policy decision was that no other community group could obtain a licence under the 1926 Act, or be approved for a deflector system on the VHF band.</P>
    <P>Frequency bands are a national asset and must be managed carefully by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  However, there are also international obligations for Ireland.  A specialised agency of the United Nations, known as the International Telecommunications Union, ITU, regulate the telecommunications services worldwide.  One of its committees &mdash; the Consultative Committee for International Radio, CCIR, is responsible for establishing regulations governing all forms of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Under these radio regulations UHF channels are allocated.  Following an agreement reached at a conference in Stockholm in 1961, specific channels were allocated to each member state for broadcasting.  They were termed primary and secondary stations using power output levels greater than ten kilowatts.  In addition permission was granted for what was called a tertiary status which was defined as operating on a non-interfering basis.  Accordingly, a system must be put in place that will meet our international obligations and also not interfere with space on a frequency band that has already been allocated to RTE or other users of radio transmission.</P>
    <P>The Minister holds that there is no space available for community TV services on the UHF band.  This is contradicted by existing community television groups who have been providing a low cost and high quality service for the past <Col N="782" /> number of years without any interference problems with RTE services.  In fact there are many parts of this country where RTE services are not provided. They maintain that there is ample room in the UHF band to accommodate Irish and UK TV broadcasts.  That is graphically demonstrated by the fact that the northern counties in the Republic and the Six Counties receive without mutual interference RTE 1, Network 2, BBC 1 and 2, UTV and Channel 4, all transmitted from high powered national primary stations.</P>
    <P>It is argued that the Minister is not implementing the spirit of EC Directive 89/552/EEC, which deals with aspects of transfer frontier television broadcasting. Microwave transmitters have been erected at various sites in the Republic to broadcast European and satellite television signals to the population.  At present the only European terrestrial television signals being re-transmitted are those from the United Kingdom and there do not appear to be any plans to transmit television signals from other European member states.  The transmitters are generally sited on high ground in isolated areas.</P>
    <P>Deflector systems operate on a part of the UHF band which is governed by an international treaty.  The Department has stressed on many occasions that deflector systems cannot be licensed.  It has been said that there are simply not enough frequencies available to Ireland to establish a nationwide network of deflector transmitters while at the same time meeting other national requirements such as RTE frequency requirements.  The treaty provides Ireland with spectrum capacity for the equivalent of four television networks and no more.  RTE already uses part of these bands both for medium power transmitters and local transposers designed to improve reception in areas where it is poor.  Capacity equivalent to two of the four national networks has effectively been allocated for RTE requirements.  Furthermore, Teilifís na Gaeilge has to operate on the UHF band and technical studies indicate that <Col N="783" /> the third of the four available networks will be required for this service.</P>
    <P>The final network has been ear-marked by the Department for any future development of an independent TV channel.  The Minister has argued that the fundamental physics of frequency management, combined with the international constraints which apply, mean that the opportunity for multi-channel television throughout the country can only be provided by MMDS.  However, new technological developments could be different in the near future.  The advent of digital compression has made the transmission of high quality digital television a laboratory reality.  In the future it may be possible for an MMDS operator to transmit multiple high quality television signals on a smaller frequency band through compression.  Recent advances in digital compression have reduced the necessary data rates by factors of more than one hundred to one while retaining most of the original picture quality.</P>
    <P>There are 11 channels available on MMDS at present.  Through digital compression it is anticipated that only two channels will be required to meet the same re-transmission obligations which will allow more frequency space to be made available for other use.  Technology has major implications for community television.  The technological basis will be available to allow a licence to be granted by the Minister and not interfere with existing operators or international treaties.</P>
    <P>Each MMDS transmission facility can cost up to £250,000 and between £250 and £300 worth of equipment has to installed in the subscriber's home.  The annual charge to subscriber varies as between franchise areas from £84 to £140.  The latter charge is regarded as the norm while the charges by operators of the illegal deflector systems at present are approximately £30 to £40.</P>
    <P>All forms of radio and television broadcasting employ a broadcasting frequency. For example, the popular music station, Radio Atlantic 252, broadcasts <Col N="784" /> at 252 kilohertz or 252,000 cycles per second.  While this seems a large number of cycles, in broadcasting terms it is quite low and suitable only for transmitting music and the spoken word.  When transmitting more information one must use higher frequencies.  Black and white television employed VHF frequencies of between 30 and 300 million cycles per second.  For colour transmissions the broadcasting frequencies had to be increased to the UHF range &mdash; 300 million to three billion cycles per second. MMDS which can broadcast up to 11 colour channels utilise frequencies at the upper end of the UHF range.  In international telecommunications circles, engineers define all frequencies between 300 million cycles per second 300 billion cycles per second as being in the &ldquo;microwave&rdquo; region.  The use of this terminology and the association in the public mind of microwaves for cooking has given rise to much of the public concern in respect of the safety or otherwise of this system.  A great deal of confusion has been generated by vested interests on all sides in regard to the health implications of this issue.</P>
    <P>Within the last five years the health advisory organisations in a number of major countries re-examined their guidelines for public exposure to electro magnetic fields in the MMDS range. Last year the World Health Organisation updated and published its guidelines. With one or two exceptions the authorities recommended that public exposure should be limited to ten watts per square metre.  As part of the safety requirements for MMDS transmitters, the system was complying with the international radiological protection guidelines on limits of exposure to electro magnetic fields.  The National Electronics Test Centre under the auspices of Forbairt is the only agency in Ireland properly equipped to carry out independent monitoring of MMDS installations. To date, this centre has not found any non-compliance in respect of its monitoring or any breach of the IRPA guidelines limit for public exposure of <Col N="785" /> 1 m W/cm squared.  The centre has indicated that the levels of power density measured in areas accessible to the public or on typical MMDS installation have been found to be several orders less than the guidelines limit and, to be subjected to appeal to a strength in excess of the guideline limit, it would be necessary to be within several metres distance of a main broadcast transmitter antenna.  It has been argued by other scientists that the International Radiation Protection Association guidelines are concerned only with preventing thermal injury from microwave exposure.  It has also been argued that biological defects can occur from exposure to non-ionising radiation. There is no independent body with responsibility for non-ionising radiation in our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In reply to questions in the House, the Minister gave an undertaking on a number of occasions to examine the possibility of using the resources of the Radiological Protection Insitute of Ireland as an independent body to allay public fears.  Advice given to members of the public or politicians on exposure to non-ionising radiation appears to be divided among various Government Departments, namely, the Departments of Energy, Environment, Health and Communications.  As a member of the South Eastern Health Board, I asked many times for a definitive view on exposure to non-ionising radiation, but as yet I failed to receive such a view from the South Eastern Health Board through the Department of Health or any other health agency so that I could inform the general public in my area that their concerns about non-ionising radiation are unfounded.</P>
    <P>Under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 the Minister for Energy has the power to extend the functions of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to cover non ionising radiation, which requires a ministerial order.  This independent body could have an important role to play in the monitoring of the microwave emissions from MMDS transmitters in all regions.  I <Col N="786" /> understand the Department of Communications has a sophisticated microwave meter which was used to measure density levels around the Galway MMDS site and this should be used by an independent body such as the RPI.</P>
    <P>South Coast Community Television, based in Carrigaline, County Cork, runs an unlicensed deflector system in Cork. It pursued injunctive action to restrain the Minister for Energy and Communications from taking action against the company under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts.  The case was heard in the High Court in May by Mr. Justice Costello who granted the right of the plaintiffs to a full hearing on the issues raised by them.  I understand a full hearing on the application of South Coast Community Television will be heard early in 1995.  The action was linked to proceedings seeking declarations that the 1988 MMDS regulations, the MMDS licence granted to Cork Communications and the refusal to grant a retransmission licence to South Coast Community Television were all made <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>A number of issues was raised by the plaintiffs, considered by Mr. Justice Costello in the context of that High Court case and subsequently upheld in respect of an appeal to the Supreme Court.  The question of competition between a local community television group, such as South Coast Community Television in Cork and Cork Communications, was raised.  The spirit of European directives and deregulation agreed by Ireland in the context of our membership of the European Union indicates we will be forced to deregulate and generate a system of competition in all public services.  In that context and in the context that the technology is now available for community television to be licensed I move the motion tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Fianna Fáil and Labour parties have been speaking with forked tongues on the question of community television. <Col N="787" /> Prior to the last election specific commitments were given by both Government parties, but were not honoured.  I have a copy of a letter dated 13 November 1992 issued by the then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan Quinn, addressed to Pat Farrell, General Secretary of Fianna Fáil.  The letter was not submitted to me, but it went into circulation and consequently landed at my door.  In that letter the then Minister promised that Fianna Fáil would arrange for the examination of the monopoly of MMDS operators under competition legislation.  In the course of the same letter the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>...I will examine the role of deflector systems in the provision of multi-channel services.</P>
      <P>That was the approach of the Fianna Fáil Government prior to the last general election, as evidenced by the letter signed &ldquo;Máire&rdquo; dated 13 November 1992.  One would reasonably assume that that commitment was made in good faith and that the promises given therein would have been carried out after the election if Fianna Fáil continued in power.  For a variety of reasons Fianna Fáil did continue in power.</P>
      <P>What happened after the general election?  The former Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, had a different portfolio and we had a new Minister in this area.  A few months later her succcessor, the present Minister, Deputy Cowen, was again approached by people involved in community television, apparently for the first time as far as he was concerned.  This approach was made through a prominent Member of the Fianna Fáil Party in Cork.  A letter from the Minister dated 23 March 1993 addressed to a Fianna Fáil Deputy was given wide circulation and a photocopy landed on my doorstep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty whatsoever in accounting for the background fully and fairly.  I can recollect the full circumstances surrounding it. This was not a private letter because it was given wide circulation.  The Minister wrote to Deputy Michael Ahern that he was still settling into his new responsibilities, which is fair enough.  He had this to say in response to a request for a meeting with those involved in community television:</P>
      <P>...I have found that the question of establishing a licensing regime for deflector systems was seriously considered and successive Governments have concluded that it would not be practical nor in the national interest to license such systems...</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances I am not prepared to meet with those involved in illegal deflector systems.</P>
      <P>That sudden change took place within Fianna Fáil because in the intervening months a general election had taken place and it was not then considered necessary to honour those election commitments.</P>
      <P>The position of the Labour Party on this issue is even more exposed in that campaign literature was circulated on behalf of the candidates which included a promise that: &ldquo;Labour in Government will license community television throughout the country&rdquo;.  There were no ifs or buts; it was a straightforward commitment. That promise was not kept either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime there was one further development on the Labour end.  Under pressure from a reporter, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who has responsibility for broadcasting, committed himself, as reported in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on 6 February 1993, to conduct &ldquo;an extensive and thorough review of community television policy&rdquo;. He was speaking in Cork in the wake of <Col N="789" /> a court decision restraining the transmission of Cork South Coast community television service.  The Minister said he would be looking at ways in which community broadcasting could be advanced.  Subsequently he evaded all questions on the issue and had them transferred to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen.  When finally I cornered him in this House by something of a technical subterfuge on 7 July 1993 and eventually got him to answer for the commitment he had given in Cork about community television his answer was that he was not referring to community television at all.</P>
    <P>That is the sorry record of the Government parties in the debate on the legislation of community television.</P>

      <P>There is a huge sense of outrage and grievance in many coastal areas because community television has either been taken off the air or threats made to have it taken off the air.  Many citizens of our towns and villages have enjoyed multi-channel television programmes for many years solely because of community television, without any rental, without any connection fee or any hidden extras.  There had been a voluntary contribution of £30 annually; if one wanted to make it that was all that was collected.  Essentially the people were fully satisfied with the service provided at the cost of a box of matches per day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> I raised the issue a dozen times in this House with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Stonewall Jackson had nothing on him when it came to his attitude.  He always claimed that the service was illegal.  I want to reject this approach.  What is available in south-west Cork and other coastal areas is the same service available on over-spill in the eastern part of the country.  Is the suggestion being made that what is legal on the east coast is illegal on the west coast?  That is the nub of the issue.  I do not accept that it is illegal; it is unlicensed.  I believe it should be licensed.  What we in Fine Gael seek is to ensure that community television is licensed.</P>
    <P>Technical objections have been raised but I understand these can be overcome. If we are interested in competition, why is the service not licensed?  I have no difficulty with the MMDS system. If they want to operate side by side with community television, that is fine with me.  The old saying is that competition is the life of trade.  However, I object to a monopoly position.  If the MMDS system is as good as is suggested why does it not compete with community television?  Of course, there is the question of cost.  A voluntary subscription of £30 annually is in very sharp contrast to installation fees in the case of MMDS of between £130 and £160 annually.  Thereafter there is an annual fee of £140 to £160, in addition to which there is a further charge of £95 for a movie channel, plus another £73 annual charge for a sports channel.  That is the enormous difference in cost.  It is a matter for the private commercial organisation in charge of the MMDS system to justify these charges.  I ask whether they can justify the higher charges they are imposing in Cork as opposed to other parts of the country, including Galway, where I understand it is much cheaper. We in Cork are used to being discriminated against.</P>
    <P>I regard it as entirely unreasonable and unacceptable that people should be forced to pay these charges.  Many people, particularly the elderly and <Col N="791" /> others living in deprived circumstances who have come to rely on community television over the years, are not able to afford multi-channel television on the MMDS system.  For them a shut down in community television means that their multi-channel viewing will be finished.</P>
    <P>How can the Government justify the 1989 agreement which negotiated a monopoly arrangement with MMDS for the paltry sum of £20,000 plus 5 per cent royalties?  That was absolutely outrageous. The MMDS system will progress to being the alternative Eircel system, but I will not go into that at this stage.</P>
    <P>When I raised the issue in the past with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications great play was made about the illegality of community television.  Is he not aware that, following a recent decision of An Bord Pleanála, it has been found that the erection of MMDS antennae is not an exempted development from the point of view of planning and it appears that dozens of these antennae erected around the country are unauthorised?  I have a further letter from Cork County Council dated 14 October 1994 confirming this to me.  I will be interested in the Minister's response about the legality of the other system in the light of the unauthorised structures they have erected all over the country.</P>
    <P>It was possible before the general election for both Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party to give specific commitments on the issue of community television. What was possible before the election should be possible now, otherwise the whole profession of politics and the overall credibility of policy promises is debased.  It is time for those who gave those promises to honour them.  The way to do so is for Members to vote in favour of the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what my colleagues Deputies Hogan and Jim O'Keeffe have said.  I might pick up where Deputy Jim O'Keeffe left off in <Col N="792" /> relation to the political commitments and promises given in advance of the last general election.  In that regard my constituency of Cork East was not different from many others.  At least one Labour Deputy, representing Cork East, owes his presence here in no small measure to the commitment given by his party to make the necessary legislative changes to facilitate the introduction of community television.  In that constituency a community television service has been provided and enjoyed by many communities in Mitchelstown, Fermoy, Midleton and Cobh for many years.  I agree with Deputy Hogan about many communities benefiting greatly from the MMDS system.  Many people enjoy the system and those who did not have access to the community system considered it a godsend.  In Mallow, where the community system is not in place, there has been a widespread take-up of the MMDS system, people are reasonably happy with the service although I am sure many are dissatisfied with its cost.</P>
      <P>We must consider the hundreds of thousands of people, who for many years enjoyed a good community service system at a nominal cost, who demand that we, as their elected representatives, put in place the necessary legislative changes to ensure that the system they enjoy can operate in tandem with the MMDS service and provide necessary competition to multichannel television.  The debate on the provision of a multichannel service goes back to the 1960s and it is amusing to reflect on the large demand at that time for BBC and ITV.  People who lived in the major urban cities were the first to receive the multichannel service and were considered privileged.  A demand quickly rose for that service to be made available throughout the country and as a result there were initiatives to relay community systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A profit is not made from the community system in my constituency.  The cornerstone of that system is a voluntary group who gives its time and money to maintain it.  When transmission masts <Col N="793" /> are taken down as a result of legal challenges local community activists erect their masts on the mountain tops within hours, often in harsh weather conditions. Those people responded to a community demand and took the initiative, for which they did not receive a monetary gain.  It will be disappointing if there are not legislative changes to ensure that those systems remain in place.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Keeffe, I tabled questions on this matter during the past two to three years.  I am not concerned about the Minister's personal attitude to this problem.  Aside from the illegality of such a service, he indicated that there was a technical difficulty in providing it in tandem with the MMDS service. Technology is ever changing and advancing and the previous contributions illustrate that there is no difficulty in those systems operating side by side.  I hope this matter can be taken off the agenda as quickly as possible.  Given that the problem can be technically solved, I hope the Minister will change his mind in this regard.  I am aware there was strong support for community television in the Minister's constituency.  If he is brave enough to face down the people of Laois-Offaly I would not be surprised if he did the same for the people of Cork East.  I respect his opinion, but I believe he has been hard-headed in regard to it.  He should be willing to listen to the technical arguments for the two systems to operate in tandem. I hope we will be able to get the Minister off the hook and he will be able to get the thousands of people throughout the country dependent on community television off the hook.</P>
    <P>The cost of the service is a major issue.  It is difficult to explain to a person in receipt of a top class multichannel service at a maximum cost of £50 per annum that they will have to pay £100 to £200 for the provision of that service by a new group operating a different system.  Under the deflector system the number of channels is more limited but the choice provided is sufficient for <Col N="794" /> most people.  In the wider debate questions must be asked about the level of fees charged by MMDS companies.  A plethora of satellite channels dominate the airwaves and some broadcast sporting events live but its cost is beyond the reach of most people.  People who wish to view live sporting events must subscribe to Sky Sports channel and pay a hefty charge.  Such charges appear to have increased astronomically in recent years and that matter must be addressed.  It is a subject for another debate but I would like the Minister to refer to it in his reply.</P>
    <P>This motion seeks to respond to a community demand and initiative.  The economics of community television appeal to people in receipt of low incomes, like the elderly and the unemployed, who are able to avail of the service free of charge.  I know people in Fermoy and Mitchelstown who collect money for that service.  Those people are generous in that they consider the ability of people on low incomes to pay for such a service.  As a result many people enjoy virtually free television.  A social case can be made in that regard. Some people cannot afford MMDS despite incentives by companies providing the service.  While many people sign for the service free of charge they cannot afford the bi-monthly bills.  The provision of such a service has been an emotive issue in recent years.  In my constituency the largest public meetings I attended during the past three to four years have not been in respect of health, education or budgetary policy &mdash; that makes a political point &mdash; but in respect of community television.</P>
    <P>I never attended a meeting about community television at which fewer than 400 people attended.  It is an issue about which people feel strongly and which strikes a chord among community activists in rural areas.  I hope the Minister will address this matter.  I note he has taken a hard line on this issue to date but that approach results from a technical argument about the difficulty in providing the two services.  I hope we <Col N="795" /> will be able to convince him that technical improvements will allow for the licensing of an alternative system, that its provision is important in the light of the spirit of competition at European level and that it is important to respond to the needs of and the initiatives taken by communities.  I hope he will respond favourably to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, recognising the need to manage in the public interest the use of the radio frequency spectrum, supports the implemenntation by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications of the Wireless Telegraphy (Television Programme Retransmission) Regulations, 1989, pending the decision of the Courts in relation to the deflector systems when consideration can be given to any necessary review of the regulations and legislation involved.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Firstly, I am very surprised that the Opposition has put down such a motion at this time.  The Deputies are fully aware of the fact that a case currently listed for hearing in the High Court is concerned with this very issue.  I have answered questions in this House as recently as last week informing Opposition Deputies that the date for this case has been set for 11 January next, so I know that they are fully aware of it and of the nature of the case.  Leaving aside any question there might be about the propriety or otherwise of our discussing matters bearing so closely on that case &mdash; which is of course <i>sub judice</i>&mdash; in this House, they must know that those matters cannot receive a full airing without the risk of prejudicing the matter before the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that the Deputies would not want me to prejudice the outcome of that case.  It seems <Col N="796" /> however that they would like me to go further, because what I am being asked to do here is to actually pre-empt the court's judgment on the entire issue by amending the 1989 Wireless Telegraphy Regulations now.  That course of action would be unwise and irresponsible, indeed I am not sure that it might not be construed as contempt of court.  I have no desire to undermine the due and fair processes of the law in this way and I can only express my surprise and dismay that the Deputies would ask me to do so.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting in that regard that Opposition Deputies have persisted in recent times in tabling parliamentary questions specifically relating to this issue, questions that are asking me in effect to either interpret the High Court's judgment to date, which they will be aware is an interlocutory one, or to pre-empt the court's judgment in the substantive case which is now listed for hearing.  Such a course of action is unthinkable.  I make no apologies for saying that I will uphold the law and that I will not be browbeaten into any action which might prejudice that case.</P>
    <P>Turning to the substance of the motion itself, the first aspect I want to address is the use of the term &ldquo;community TV&rdquo; as liberally used by Deputy O'Keeffe earlier today.  What this motion does is to set out clearly the intention of those Deputies behind it who align themselves with a specific cause.  So let us look at this &ldquo;cause&rdquo;. What exactly is it?  The first thing that must be said is that this issue has been fudged and confused by those people who persist in using the ambiguous and misleading term &ldquo;community TV&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Community TV&rdquo; somehow implies a civic minded, community based operation properly and lawfully providing a service without the need for Government assistance or intervention.  Let us be quite clear.  What the Opposition is talking about here is not &ldquo;community TV&rdquo; in that sense at all.  Their status now is that of illegal transmission systems that are misappropriating the use of the radio frequency spectrum by <Col N="797" /> arrogating to themselves whatever frequencies they choose in their own areas. The people who operate these systems are in effect advocating the abandonment of the national radio frequency plan and the abdication by Government of its responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any confusion about this, I acknowledge that community television does exist, but it is not what the Deputies are referring to here tonight.  Community television, properly so called, is in operation on a number of cable systems throughout the country.  It consists of local people, in what is truly a community activity, producing local programming about local events which is then lawfully transmitted over the local cable systems.  This provides a valuable service to the local area, including experience in programme making and other related activities, and contributes to a sense of community identity.  It does no service at all to these innovative and valuable service providers to lump them in with those who, in contrast, simply pick up signals and retransmit them illegally on the deflector systems.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Opposition here and now to cease the misuse of the term &ldquo;community television&rdquo;.  It is only confusing the issue, reflecting in turn on those activities which can be truly described as community television.</P>
    <P>Let me now remind the Deputies of the genesis of, and the reasons for, the existing scheme for providing multi-channel television throughout the country. Let me remind them of the sequence of events which led up to the establishment of the current licensing regime.  I will point out the detailed planning which went into the process and indeed the acceptance by successive Governments of the principles which underline the decisions which were made and the policies which were adopted.</P>
    <P>It is well known in this House that the demand for multi-channel television in those areas which could not, for economic or technical reasons, be cabled was recognised a long time ago.  What was <Col N="798" /> also recognised from the earliest time was that such services could not be provided by means of the deflector systems about which we are now talking.</P>
    <P>In this regard, let me quote the Fine Gael Minister for Communications. Deputy Jim Mitchell, when he said, in this House on 2 July 1985:</P>
    <P>...the broadcasting frequencies available to this country under international agreements are not sufficient to allow the widespread rebroadcasting of television signals.  Any such systems serving extensive areas would lead to unacceptable interference with other services and would inhibit the improvement of reception of existing RTE services and the development of new services.</P>
    <P>This, as early as 1985, was a clear acknowledgment by the then Minister of the problems posed by the deflector approach, and of the type of action which is now being requested of me in my capacity as Minister.  The same Minister said in the House on 6 November 1986:</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce legislation to legalise television rebroadcasting systems or deflectors as they operate at present.  As I have said in replies to questions on this matter on a number of occasions, these systems raise major practical and policy issues from the point of view of good radio frequency management. </P>
    <P>That Minister not only acknowledged the difficulties posed by this issue, but also stated that deflector systems cannot be licensed.  This conclusion was not arrived at overnight.  The issue was thoroughly researched and the available options were fully considered, including the possibility of provision of services by deflector systems.  The conclusion arrived at was that such systems were not practicable, for the same reasons which I, in my turn, have stated many times and which were summarised by the then Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, in a press release on 5 March 1987.  I would like to quote that press release. <Col N="799" /> In it the then Minister referred to deflector systems, stating that he &ldquo;... could not see his way to legalise the use of such systems as they create major practical and policy issues from the point of view of good radio frequency management ...&rdquo;.  He then went on to say &ldquo;...the UHF spectrum used by existing rebroadcasting systems represents the only remaining spectrum space to cater for the improvement and development of our terrestrial television broadcasting service for the foreseeable future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sure that much of this must sound very familiar to the Deputies, and well it should; I know it sounds familiar to me.  That is because not only was it stated by Deputy Mitchell in 1986, but it was repeated by him in 1987 and by successive Ministers since then, including myself.  It is a clear statement of the need to adopt a realistic and viable policy in relation to the provisions of multi-channel television to non-cabled areas. It is an acknowledgment of the difficulties involved in formulating such a policy and the need to have regard to the proper and responsible management of a valuable national resource, the radio frequency spectrum.  It is also a recognition that deflector systems cannot be licensed.  It is a policy which I have continued to uphold and to implement.  It is a policy, based on sound frequency management principles, which was first stated by the Fine Gael Minister for Communications, Deputy Jim Mitchell.</P>
    <P>In that same press release the then Minister announced plans for an alternative to the deflector systems, a system which would meet the objectives of providing real multi-channel television choice in a professional, technically competent manner and make available the same quality and continuity of service which was available in cabled areas.  Let me quote him again:</P>
    <P>On the basis of the examination carried out the Minister has concluded that MMDS is a feasible alternative to illegal rebroadcasting, and <Col N="800" /> his Department is at present drawing up a national frequency plan and technical specifications for the system, as well as a regime to govern the licensing of the installation and use of such systems.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to labour the point, the date of this announcement was 5 March 1987.  The then Minister had obviously concluded at that time that the MMDS system was the only practicable system for the provision of multi-channel television in non-cabled areas that was compatible with national and international frequency management obligations.  I agree with that conclusion, in common with the intervening Ministers, and I have continued to implement that policy decision with the result that significant progress has been made in the provision of such services and we are well on the way to being able to provide a legitimate multi-channel choice in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>At the risk of repeating myself, and possibly boring the Deputies with information, I have provided to many of them on previous occasions, I will not reiterate the reasons for that policy decision, which was stated in 1986 and again in 1987, not to licence deflector systems.  The frequency spectrum is a limited national resource.  The use of that spectrum must be properly managed, not only in Ireland but in all other countries.  Radio transmission does not of itself respect national boundaries and so a great degree of co-operation and co-ordination must take place to ensure that the use of the spectrum can be maximised and that any possible interference can be minimised.  As a result, much of the frequency spectrum use is governed by international treaty.  This includes the UHF band, which is the one in which the deflector systems operate.</P>
    <P>Under the Stockholm Treaty of 1961 Ireland has been provided with spectrum capacity in this band for the equivalent of four television networks and no more.  This is after we have taken account of the need for fill-in stations <Col N="801" /> and schemes for repeating the use of frequencies in different parts of the country.  Having obtained this resource, its use must be carefully planned on a nationwide basis to ensure maximum benefit to the country.  What we are talking about is nationwide planning. The Government is obliged to ensure equity of services throughout the country and this is an important factor in such planning exercises.  Given these conditions, there are simply not enough frequencies available to facilitate a nationwide network of deflector transmitters to be established and at the same time meet other national requirements.</P>
    <P>I will set out briefly the uses for which these four national networks are allocated. Two of the networks are allocated for RTE's requirements.  RTE already uses part of these bands both for high and medium powered transmitters as well as for local &ldquo;fill-in&rdquo; transposers designed to improve reception in areas where it is poor.  In addition, there is a need to take into account the new technology being developed in Europe and worldwide for digital television. Spectrum within the UHF band will have to be reserved for this eventuality. In particular my Department will have to make provision, sometime in the coming decade, for the simultaneous operation of the existing television networks as well as the new digital networks for a transition period of up to 15 years.</P>
    <P>In addition, the new Teilifís na Gaeilge service will need a third of the four networks.  The Government's decision with regard to Teilifís na Gaeilge would be negated if this spectrum had to be given over for other purposes.  This is a very good practical example of the effect which a decision to licence deflector systems would have.  Therefore, we are effectively left with UHF frequency capacity equivalent to about one network and, as Deputies will know, that has already been earmarked for any future developments with regard to an independent TV channel.</P>
    <P>These spectrum allocations to Ireland <Col N="802" /> are national assets and must be used prudently and wisely in the national interest.  Any decision to licence deflectors would immediately negate this plan and inhibit future developments such as digital television.  All frequency planning in my Department is done with the objective of providing equity of service to all parts of the country.  These frequencies cannot be taken over and used haphazardly by those involved in deflector systems while they are already earmarked for national requirements.  It is important to understand, therefore, that there is not actually a choice between deflector systems and MMDS if the non-cabled public are to be offered nationwide quality multi-channel television. The fundamental physics of frequency management, combined with the international constraints which apply, mean that it can be done only by an MMDS type system.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Deputies have asked that the Dáil support competition between these deflector systems and the existing licence holders who are legally franchised to provide multi-channel television services &mdash; in other words, the cable and MMDS companies.  Deputies may tell me that they are not asking me to abandon the existing schemes.  They may say that if they are so effective, why not allow the deflector systems to compete with them.  I say that they are being disingenuous.  It is clear from what I have said tonight and what was said back in 1986 and 1987 that the issue here is not competition.  The situation is simple: deflector systems cannot be licensed either in substitution for or in addition to existing systems.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe, who is a practising solicitor in Cork, mentioned that a service was not illegal; rather it was unlicensed.  Let me cite a premises which does not have a publican's licence as an example.  That is an unlicensed premises and it is illegal to serve intoxicating liquor in such a premises.  The Deputy was being disingenuous in attempting to split the atom; this argument does not hold up.</P>
    <P>I hear the allegation of &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo;<Col N="803" /> being levied in relation to both cable and MMDS operators.  This liberal use of the word &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; is inaccurate and irresponsible.  Deputies will be well aware of the economic and practical realities which underlie the decision by successive administrations to issue licences for both cable and MMDS which are exclusive within a specified geographic area.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there is a massive investment involved in establishing the infrastructure which is necessary to ensure reliable and high quality multi-channel television services in the long term.  This is the sort of investment which is now being made by the lawful franchisees, and it is one which the deflector operators would be neither able or willing to make.  In order to foster this investment a regulated franchise of an exclusive nature was clearly indicated as the best solution and was so adopted.  These companies, having made these very substantial investments are, as was intended, entitled to a reasonable return on them.  Direct competition of the kind proposed in the Opposition motion would be inimical to the economics of the scheme at this stage of its development and would deny that return to the investors.  Regulated exclusive franchise is a well tried and trusted means of procuring public infrastructural investment.  There is simply no other way to bring about that kind of investment in this case except by ensuring a fair return on the necessary capital.  The MMDS scheme, provided for by this House under the 1989 regulations, is now operating successfully.  It is gaining in strength and it is only in those areas where deflector systems have refused to co-operate that major difficulties have arisen.  It would be unthinkable that we should not stand by those companies that have invested so heavily and endured such difficulties at a time when the scheme is under threat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford mentioned by own area where the MMDS system has replaced the deflector system.  Everybody is satisfied with it, in terms of the <Col N="804" /> broad product range and the quality of the service.  They are also satisfied that it is a more professional operation. Clearly, it is acceptable to the people I represent and to people throughout rural Ireland as people now recognise that it is a different product to the deflector system.</P>
    <P>I would not rule out competition in the future; I am well disposed to competition wherever it is feasible and in the public interest.  Such competition would also have to be technically feasible.  It would have to be spectrum efficient. For example, having two competing systems in a particular area effectively halves the number of channels available on each.  At this stage, and for the foreseeable future, the MMDS system makes sound economic and practical sense.</P>
    <P>To conclude on the competition aspect, the MMDS franchisees compete with direct to home satellite transmissions. They compete with each other in the sense that people, even if their choice is limited to a particular franchisee, are aware of the standards and the charges in neighbouring areas, both on MMDS and cable, and can make their views known.  Finally, the standard of service is subject to regulation by my Department, so it cannot be argued that this is an area where there is unfettered monopoly.  I wish it were not necessary to repeat this, but the fact that we are addressing a motion of this kind suggests that it is.</P>
    <P>The MMDS infrastructure has implications far beyond the provision of multi-channel television.  The telecommunications industry is one which is changing rapidly and demand for sophisticated communications services is increasing greatly.  In this context the entertainment industry has a role to play.  The demand for multi-media services in both the business and private sectors is emerging as the concept of the &ldquo;information superhighway&rdquo; develops. The multi-channel industry has provided a valuable resource in the existing and developing infrastructure which can be used to provide such services.  If <Col N="805" /> Ireland is to consolidate its position as a centre of communications excellence and harness the great economic potential of this new market, it must have, and make good use of, that infrastructure.</P>
    <P>To return to the original text of the motion put down by the Deputies, I would like them to be clear on exactly what they are asking me to do.  I am being asked to overturn a policy decision which was made by a Fine Gael Minister for Communications and which has been upheld by successive Governments. By doing so I am being asked to pre-empt the High Court's judgment in relation to the implementation of that policy; to negate the sound frequency management principles of the country's long term plan and put into question our international obligations; to misuse a valuable and scarce national resource, that is the frequency spectrum; to disregard my obligation as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, and this Government's obligation, to ensure that all parts of the country are treated equally and fairly with regard to the provision of multi-channel services; to restrict the scope for any further development of national television services and particularly to negate the Government's decision on the provision of the Teilifís na Gaeilge service.</P>
    <P>I hope that the magnitude of what is being requested here is clear.  I hope also that the Opposition is prepared to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the actions it is asking me to take. Indeed, I believe that they are fully aware of these implications, because it was the Fine Gael Party which was in Government when these decisions were initially made.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, however, I am not prepared to do these things, and I object in the strongest terms to being asked to do them at this juncture.  I would ask the Deputies opposite to cease this unreasonable and unproductive debate, to acknowledge the principles governing the policy which has been put in place <Col N="806" /> and to allow me, as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, to put my efforts into implementing that policy and ensuring that the objectives of that policy are met.  In addition, I call on them to recognise the great potential of the multi-channel industry in Ireland's future communications industry and all the implications that has for the economic development of this country.</P>
    <P>In so doing I call upon this House to reject the motion and to support the Government's amendment, which seeks to meet the present situation.  As I have stated, the Government's amendment recognises the need to manage in the public interest the use of the radio frequencies spectrum; support the implementation of the regulations of 1989, pending the decisions of the courts on the deflector systems, when consideration can then be given to any necessary review of the regulations and legislation involved.  That is the responsible and prudent thing to do.  The matter is before the High Court and will be heard on 11 January next.  We must await the outcome of the case and respect the fact that it is <i>sub judice.</i>  We must examine the implications of the outcome and the view of the law as outlined in the High Court decision.  At that stage we will be prepared to look at the situation in the fullness of that information and certain legal issues being clarified.</P>
    <P>To do otherwise and to attempt to take on board the Fine Gael Party's motion is simply not on.  The party knows it is not on.  It appears to be a cynical exercise at this time.  We are all aware that an attempt is being made to create a situation, as it continues with its negative campaigning during the by-elections. Deputy Bradford was suggesting that the motion was offering to take me off the hook.  Given what has been happening in the House today, it is amusing, to say the least, that someone from the Fine Gael Party is trying to get me off the hook.  They having been trying to impale me on a hook this afternoon, but thankfully without success. We have been asked to put the facts to <Col N="807" /> the people while certain legal issues are clarified in the High Court.  If they are genuine in seeking to meet the needs of people in that or other areas rather than playing the political trick&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they would await the outcome of that decision.</P>
      <P>Quite simply, it is another politically opportunistic occasion for the Fine Gael Party to turn on its head its policy in Government and then to claim consistency in Opposition.  The attempts to square this circle have been pitiful.  I know some of these Fine Gael Deputies have a certain view or are seeking to represent their constituents to the best of their ability.  That is fine by me, but at the end of the day one cannot get away from the facts, which are as I have outlined.  Certain legal issues have been raised.  It is the proper right of anyone to seek remedy in court and that is being done.  I respect any citizen's right to do that, but in the meantime I must hold the position as it is under regulation based on the decisions that have been taken and the broad radio frequency management system that has been put in place on foot of a great deal of consideration by successive Ministers of all political persuasions.</P>
      <P>We must await the outcome of the court case and this Government is saying in its amendment that at that stage we will take the outcome on board and see what review, if any, is required of the regulations and the legislation.  That is the logical, prudent position to adopt and it is not in any way seeking to dismiss legitimate concern that people feel must be recognised.  The courts as arbiter will decide these matters in the legal area and the Government will look at the position in the fullness of that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Often when there is a debate in which the present Minister is involved, the tone he adopts can at <Col N="808" /> times defeat whatever strength there is in his arguments.  He regards everybody who disagrees with him as in some way inferior and open to abuse simply for disagreeing with him.  It is regrettable that a matter of this kind cannot be debated in a somewhat calmer atmosphere.</P>
      <P>This motion deals with a matter which is a serious problem for a great many people throughout many parts of the country.  As a party which looked with some scepticism at this proposal on MMDS when it was first mooted in the mid-eighties, I believe the scepticism we expressed at that time through our then spokesman, the former Deputy Pat O'Malley, may well have been quite justified. MMDS has not worked out as a satisfactory medium of transmission or retransmission.  In many areas there are a great many problems connected with it.  Apart from the major problem of cost, which is a very substantial and continuing one, it is unsightly: the various masts and aerials that are a necessary part are not what one would like to see in our countryside.  Arguments have also been made with regard to health considerations and, while these have not been proven, they have not been disproven either.</P>
      <P>Certainly the community television services, as they are called, have provided a very satisfactory and adequate service to a great many people who otherwise would not have access to a variety of television programmes.  I think people cannot be blamed for wanting to retain that service or get it back where they have lost it.</P>
      <P>I looked at what the Minister had to say in regard to monopolies.  He was very critical of references by some Members to monopolies &mdash; he may well have been referring to me because I have referred to the monopoly aspect of this too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation today is very different from when these various services were first licensed in 1988 or thereabouts. The ownership of parts of all the franchises and of a majority interest in many of them has changed.  Some people are <Col N="809" /> no longer involved.  The control of most of these franchises is in the hands of two or three companies.  It is difficult to pin it down exactly because many of them trade through a variety of intermediate companies, all of whom seem to have different names.  Unless one is directly involved in the matter as the Department is, it is difficult to trace the ultimate owners.  They seem to be two or three different companies and that is very far from the intention when these licences were originally granted.</P>
    <P>It is a cause of concern that a monopoly should be developing in most parts of the country in regard to retransmission. It is not a coincidence that one of the major companies involved, a public company associated particularly with the ownership of newspapers, claims to its shareholders and to potential shareholders that one of the areas where it will make a killing in the years to come is in the retransmission of television and other programmes.  It states that it incurred a lot of cost and sustained losses in the early years but it now controls much of the market and intends making a great deal of money.  Perhaps it will but it is undesirable that this kind of control should exist.</P>
    <P>After the passage of the 1978 Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act I found it necessary to bring in an order under one of the sections in relation to the ownership of newspapers and magazines because they were organs of opinion.  It has been generally accepted that the making of that order was right.  It requires all changes of ownership of newspapers or magazines to be approved by the Minister. This has prevented a far greater concentration of ownership.  As local television is likely to evolve and develop in the years to come it seems to me undesirable that that organ of opinion should be under the control of people who already control a very large proportion of the newspaper market.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the decision to allow Telecom acquire a major interest in the largest of the cable <Col N="810" /> companies licensed under these regulations. That was very undesirable. Telecom made no secret of the fact that it wanted to acquire control, not because it was interested in the retransmission of television but because it wanted to prevent anybody else using the cable network for any purpose that might conflict or compete with the existing telephone network.  That was entirely wrong and I said so at the time but my view did not prevail.  We are not now allowed to refer to the views we held, so silly has the law become as a result of the efforts of the present incumbent of a particular quasi-political office.  It is regrettable that the patent lack of competition and the deliberate attempt by the then Government and the Department to stifle competition should have led to this development, particularly with Telecom, which is certainly not a model as a provider of services at a reasonable cost in a competitive environment.</P>
    <P>In this motion the reference to competition may be misplaced because it is difficult to envisage how we can have competition between two completely different services in respect of the same network of programmes.  I do not think competition as such should simply be the objective.  In areas where it is clearly the most appropriate and the most popular manner of transmitting signals, the deflector system should be allowed. There is little point in suggesting that people who currently receive a television service in parts of Connemara, for example, from a deflector system could have reception from an MMDS system.  They could not.  Reception in many areas is very poor and that extends even to RTE 1 and Network 2.</P>
    <P>The Minister is rehashing the arguments of five years ago or more.  He has not taken into account technological changes which were set out in some detail in a letter I received last year from a gentleman in County Cork. Deputy Hogan reiterated many of the arguments that were made in that letter and I believe they are correct.  It is <Col N="811" /> physically, legally and otherwise possible to have a deflector type service here without interfering with existing national services from RTE or international services coming from Britain through the BBC or ITV.</P>
    <P>The proof that these different activities can co-exist is that for several years they have done so and there have been no complaints.  There is no reason they cannot continue to do so in the years to come.  People have not complained that they lose reception from some stations because there is a community television service.  These things can be adjusted. Limitations on a local retransmitter can be imposed and taken into account so that it does not interfere with anything else.  It seems rather arrogant to tell people they cannot do any of these things from a technical or a legal point of view when patently they can.  The question is whether they may do so.  The Minister says they cannot and they may not but the fact is they can and the House should decide whether they may.</P>
    <P>We were told some years ago that anything other than what was in place would be illegal and there was no arguable case to the opposite effect.  Mr. Justice Costello thinks there is a <i>prima facie</i> and arguable case to be made and he has given a conditional order in respect of the relief sought from him.</P>
    <P>The efforts made by the Department over the years to seize people's property and transmitters has ceased.  It is legally doubtful if they can do this.  If we take the European context of freedom of information into account and the considerations there, the black and white legal scenario that the Minister, and his predecessors, tried to paint becomes much greyer and more dubious.</P>
    <P>The changes in technology, as outlined by Deputy Hogan, are not taken into account in the approach to this but what is more important are the changes that will take place in years to come. They will be enormous and it may be that the system licensed under the 1988 regulations will be irrelevant within a short time.  The Minister and the <Col N="812" /> Department should have a more open mind on these matters.  They should be less heavy-handed although, in fairness, they are less heavy-handed than they were but that is because the courts plucked their wings.  It may well be that the courts will pluck more feathers from their wings and restrain them to a greater extent.  The European Court may find it necessary to do so ultimately.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we only have access to foreign channels through a particular licensed system when in many European countries there is freedom of access and no-one tries to enforce things in the way they do here.  The Minister should look carefully at a developing monopoly position.  What he said tonight was unreal, that it does not exist. There has been a considerable change in the ownership of the franchises in recent years and it could be quite serious if a monopoly were to develop to a greater extent than at present.</P>
    <P>Far more consideration should be given to the motion proposed by Deputy Hogan than was evident in what the Minister said.  It is regrettable that he is so combative on every issue, even one like this that does not call for that kind of attitude.  If he had an open mind and was prepared to consider matters rationally and equitably the problems which hundreds of thousands of people complain about might well be solved.  I find it impossible to support the Minister's amendment because of the tone and attitude he adopted.  My inclination is to support the motion even though I would not have drafted it in those terms.</P>

      <P>Television sets purchased here are equipped to receive VHF and UHF bands and people pay a television licence fee for both bands. The Minister said citizens of the south and west cannot use the UHF band because there is no room for the frequency. That is not true.  I am sorry the Minister is not present to hear that. England, Wales and Northern Ireland enjoy UHF transmission.  The Minister gave a licence for the MMDS to connect the UHF band into the SHF band for retransmission.  The ordinary television receiver is not equipped to accommodate the SHF band with the result that people are asked to pay an exorbitant rental to the MMDS to convert the SHF signal to UHF by means of a black box. That is a costly black box for the people.</P>
      <P>The MMDS are converting BBC and UHF signals from Northern Ireland to super high frequency and retransmitting that signal to the VHF band.  What does the European Broadcasting Union think of that?  It violates the European broadcasting system.  If this was referred to the European Court the south coast community television group would win the case.  The Minister cannot pull the wool over the eyes of half our citizens.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter which concerns a constituent of mine, a woman who after suffering a stroke in May 1991 was paralysed on one side.  This woman was in receipt of disability benefit and was cared for by her husband who worked the night shift for a security company and her daughter who worked during the day &mdash; they looked after her on an alternate basis.  When her daughter emigrated to the United States this summer her husband was forced to resign from his job to care for her.  Before resigning he made some general inquiries about the possibility of receiving a carer's allowance and was assured that he would qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This man applied for the allowance at the beginning of August and resigned from his job on 16 August.  When he telephoned the social welfare office in Sligo towards the end of August he was told he did not qualify for a carer's allowance as his wife was on disability benefit and he could only qualify if she was receiving an invalidity pension. When he inquired about her eligibility <Col N="815" /> for an invalidity pension he was told he would have to apply to the office in Longford.  When he asked if this could be done automatically by the office in Sligo he was told this was not possible. He then contacted the office in Longford and, following acceptance of his application over the telephone, he had to make a second application for a carer's allowance.  On receipt of his P45, P60 and birth certificate from Sligo he had to submit them to Longford. However, as he only had a short version of his birth certificate he was required to get a long version which he subsequently submitted.</P>
    <P>Following that, arrangements were made for a medical which took place on 12 October.  His wife was told at the medical that she would get an invalidity pension and a carer's allowance would follow in due course.  However, he then had to make a formal application for an invalidity pension &mdash; apparently the procedure is that the formal application is made after the medical.  When I inquired if the form could be sent out quickly I was told it could not be sent out until it came up on the screen.  The forms have now been submitted and I understand it will be two or three weeks before the payment is made.</P>
    <P>My complaint tonight does not relate to any individual officer in the Department of Social Welfare, which responded promptly and efficiently to the inquiries made by the applicant and me.  Rather it relates to the mind blowing bureaucracy this man had to navigate in order to get a basic entitlement. It will take three months from the time this man resigned from his job to care for his invalided wife to receive the carer's allowance.  It is crazy that the social welfare system is designed in such an incredibly bureaucratic way that there is that degree of delay, that at least a dozen officers of the Department of Social Welfare had to handle this very simple application at one stage or another, with its attendant costs, and that applicants should have to put up <Col N="816" /> with delays and be frustrated and inconvenienced in this way.  I am satisfied that this case will be resolved in due course, but I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to review the entire system so that applicants do not have to go through a maze of bureaucracy in order to receive a basic entitlement.  The system is costly and unwieldly and very unfair on the applicant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the Minister for Social Welfare who is unable to be present.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the necessary documentation in the Department of Social Welfare today, invalidity pension has been awarded to the wife of the person concerned at the weekly rate of £62.60.  As a consequence of this decision, a carer's allowance of £61.00 a week has also been awarded today to the person concerned.</P>
      <P>A carer's allowance is payable to those who care full-time for: (a) persons over 66 years of age who are in receipt of a social welfare pension, and (b) persons under 66 years of age who are in receipt of blind pension, invalidity pension or disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board.  A carer's allowance is also payable where the person being cared for has an equivalent payment from another EU member state or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.</P>
      <P>Qualification for a carer's allowance is based on the criteria that the applicant is aged over 18, satisfies a means test, lives with the person being cared for and is not employed or incapacitated themselves.  In addition, the person being cared for must be so invalided or disabled as to need full-time care and attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full-time care and attention means that the person receiving the care must be incapacitated to such an extent as to require continuous supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself and that continuous supervision and frequent assistance is required throughout <Col N="817" /> the day for his or her normal personal needs.  The degree of incapacity should be such as to require full-time care and attention for at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>The person concerned made a claim for a carer's allowance on 10 August 1994 in respect of his wife.  However, as she was in receipt of disability benefit, which is not a qualifying payment, his application for a carer's allowance was refused.  Following an inquiry received on 30 August 1994, the Department of Social Welfare assessed his wife's entitlement to invalidity pension which, being a qualifying payment, would qualify him for a carer's allowance.  Having confirmed that his wife would qualify for an invalidity pension an application form for this pension was issued and was received, duly completed, today. Payment of invalidity pension to the wife of the person concerned is being backdated to 11 August last, while payment of the carer's allowance is being backdated to 18 August, the date on which he became entitled to the carer's allowance.  Arrangements are being made to pay all arrears due as soon as possible.  I will convey to the Minister for Social Welfare the Deputy's points about the level of bureaucracy in this case.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Defence Forces Review.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue which is causing great concern to the families of members of the Defence Forces.  The Price Waterhouse review of the Defence Forces was presented to the efficiency audit group three months ago but so far it has not been published and as far as I know, has not been made available officially either to PDFORRA or RACO.  In the meantime there have been a great many media reports and leaks about the contents of the report. So far as we can see, the recommendations are far reaching and would involve major restructuring and reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  It also <Col N="818" /> appears &mdash; and this is much more worrying &mdash; that the general staff of the Defence Forces are extremely unhappy with many of the recommendations in the consultant's report.</P>
      <P>In the light of the many media reports and leaks, the chief of staff felt the need to take the unprecedented step of making public some of his concerns about those recommendations.  We are led to believe &mdash; again by media reports and leaks &mdash; that the general staff have submitted a separate dissenting report to the efficiency audit group.  The result is that enlisted personnel, non-commissioned officers, officers and their families are uncertain of their future and are in a state of high anxiety.  If the reports about the recommendations are true, what is proposed is a major restructuring and a reduction of our Defence Forces, potentially the most fundamental change in the structure and organisation of our Defence Forces for 50 years.  It is reportedly proposed, for example, that half of the barracks will be closed.  The Minister for Defence has said this suggestion is in the realm of &ldquo;science fiction&rdquo; but he has given no indication of what he proposes.  We are told there is a proposal to reduce the strength of the Defence Forces by 3,000, a 25 per cent reduction which would fundamentally alter the nature of our Defence Forces.  I would like to know the Minister's position on this proposal.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to close the equitation school, the catering school and two of the three hospitals currently run by the Defence Forces.  How are those services to be replaced in the event that those proposals go ahead?  We are told that a two brigade model is being proposed for the Defence Forces.  I would like to know not only what the Minister thinks of that but also what the general staff think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that changes are needed.  Our security needs have changed utterly and, we hope, permanently. European security has been transformed as has the world scene. Reorganisation of the United Nations is mooted and the Tánaiste has promised <Col N="819" /> a White Paper on foreign policy which must surely take some account of security issues.  These developments have substantial implications, directly or indirectly, for the role and the structure of our Defence Forces.  If the demands of Border security are reduced should we use this as an opportunity to reinforce our commitment to UN operations? If the European Union proves capable of playing a coherent role in European and world security and defence, what is our capacity to respond and to participate?  In a totally transformed world what are the ideal or the practical prescriptions for defence of our national territory?  Those are issues we should address seriously and with deliberation now.  However, we are left in the dark in that we do not know the consultant's proposals nor the views of the general staff.  Why?  Countries with much larger defence budgets than ours, including the United States with a defence force which is much larger than our total GDP, can discuss defence options, defence policy and defence budgets in detail in parliament and in public.  Why can we not do likewise?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to publish the submissions to the efficiency audit group by the consultants and by the general staff so that we can have an open and informed debate on the issues that face us and our Defence Forces. Evasive ministerial platitudes and the usual bone headed mania with secrecy can only exacerbate the anxiety and the distrust which have been building up for three months and which can only be detrimental to the morale and efficiency of our defence forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State and the Department of Defence (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased Deputy Dukes has raised this matter but he appears to have made the same mistake as everyone else in referring to an internal document which was part of a number of submissions to the efficiency audit group.  He has given them the title of proposals.  I want to make it clear they are no such thing. <Col N="820" /> The reason a report has not been issued is that the Government has not received one from the efficiency audit group.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that a considerable degree of confusion has been created by recent speculation about the likely direction of the efficiency group audit review and I welcome the opportunity to clarify some of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>The efficiency audit group has not yet made its report to the Government. Accordingly, the Government has not taken decisions on the future of the Defence Forces in the context of the review.  The report of the consultants employed by the group, to which the Deputy has referred, is only one element in the review process.  When the Government receives the efficiency audit group's recommendations, the advice of other interested parties, including the military authorities, will be sought before any final decisions are taken.</P>
      <P>The review was not undertaken out of the blue.  It is widely accepted that there is a need for change in the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces.  Deputy Dukes acknowledged that this evening.  Military personnel from the top ranks to enlisted men would agree and have no difficulty with that.  Over four years ago, the report of the Gleeson Commission highlighted serious shortcomings in the structure of the Defence Forces.  Similarly, the problems regarding the rising age profile of military personnel have been the source of debate and question in this House for some time.  Last year, the Government issued a revised statement of roles for the Defence Forces which re-emphasised the need to focus on the effective performance of operational tasks. Given the acknowledged need for reform, it is in the interests of the Defence Forces that these issues be confronted as soon as possible to enable remedial measures to be undertaken as part of an organised programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing to me and to a number of other people that much of the comment to date about the review has been negative.  In undertaking the <Col N="821" /> exercise, the Government's objective is to ensure that the Defence Forces will be staffed, equipped and organised to meet the challenges of the future.  The achievement of this objective is in the interest of military personnel and the taxpaying public alike.  Unfortunately, some of the wilder speculation repeated tonight about possible outcomes has clouded the positive nature of the review process.</P>
    <P>There is no question of closing 17 military barracks or any such extreme measures.  There will not be compulsory redundancies.  There will be consultations with the representative associations in accordance with the agreed system of representation.  Where changes are required, they will be introduced as part of a comprehensive programme and will be delivered at a pace which the military organisation can digest.</P>
    <P>I should inform Deputy Dukes, who has a particular interest in this matter, that when the efficiency audit group report is completed and the Government has deliberated on it, I will have no difficulty in having a full open discussion and debate on the proposed reforms which will take place in the Defence Forces.  It would be healthy for this House, the public and the military authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I attended a large public meeting in Ballinasloe convened by the Ballinasloe parents' group in connection with the lack of facilities for the mentally handicapped in the Ballinasloe-east Galway and south Roscommon areas.  The meeting was attended principally by parents of children with mental and physical <Col N="822" /> handicap.  It was an intense, open, direct, hard-hitting and above all, sincere meeting.  Parents young and old, who care for handicapped sons or daughters poured out their stories of difficulties, frustrations, concerns and bitter disappointment with the powers that let them down in their hour of need.  Nobody was spared the scathing attacks on how insensitive officialdom can be when dealing with the special children of the greater Ballinasloe area. This is not a political matter.  Politicians of every colour were starkly reminded of their responsibilities and their inability to deliver a proper service.</P>
      <P>The twin providers of services to mentally handicapped in the Ballinasloe area, the Brothers of Charity and the Galway Association for Mentally Handicapped were both represented by their chief executives and while they were deservedly praised and thanked for their contribution so far, they were left in no doubt that their efforts did not meet the needs of those at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Mothers of handicapped children gave heart-breaking accounts of the lack of a crisis relief centre in unforeseen circumstances &mdash; one case involved a 17 year old mentally handicapped youth who had to be admitted to St. Bridget's psychiatic hospital due to the non-availability of a crisis relief service in the area.  A mental hospital is no place for such a youth.</P>
      <P>We were told that there were no respite beds in Ballinasloe.  Some of the children and their families never receive respite care and if they do they have to travel to Aras Attracta in Swinford, County Mayo.  As the Minister is aware, that is a long way from Ballinasloe, and if parents do not have a car they could not go there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great bone of contention at the meeting was that there was no progression to second level education for follow on service for students from either St. Teresa's CDEC or St. Hilda's school in Athlone.  There is a huge problem with places at workshops at many levels.  In fact at the Deerpark centre in Ballinasloe, young adults are receiving <Col N="823" /> only a part-time service because of insufficient staffing levels.  The necessity to provide a far greater number of speech therapists was highlighted as was the crying need for the provision of remedial teachers at local national schools.</P>
    <P>The most lasting impression I took away from that meeting was the anxiety expressed by parents concerning the future welfare of their beloved handicapped sons and daughters when God calls the parents from this world.  The solution involves expense and great investment is required.  The funding allocated to the service is welcome, but is not enough.  Is it possible to provide funding on a planned basis in the future rather than on a stop-go basis, with a certain amount provided this year, less next year and more the following year? That does not allow for reasonable planning and development.  Taxpayers would shoulder a greater share of the financial burden in the provision of services to the mentally handicapped, but they must see a concerted effort by the Government to develop strategies that will, among other things, attract European Union funding.  We owe it to those special children and their parents to do all we can for them.  I hope the position will improve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time with me. The Brothers of Charity, the Galway Association for Mentally Handicapped and, in particular, the Western Health Board have done an excellent job in providing services in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  The Ballinasloe-east Galway and the south Roscommon areas are bereft of services. That is why we raised the matter in the House and why such a large number of people attended a public meeting in Ballinasloe on 18 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for a crisis relief centre and residential services in the Ballinasloe area is obvious.  The case of the 17 year old child, to which Deputy Connaughton referred, was highlighted at that <Col N="824" /> meeting.  That child was admitted to a psychiatric hospital at a time when the health board was removing 25 people with mental handicap from the hospital to community based accommodation. We should be consistent in what we do and provide such services in the community.</P>
    <P>It was confirmed by the two voluntary organisations that plans were submitted to the Department for the provision of a relief centre and residential beds in the Ballinasloe-east Galway area and I hope the Minister will give them favourable consideration.  The Ballinasloe Parents' Association has worked hard in an effort to have those services provided in the area.  However, the speech therapy service for example has been reduced from five to three days per week.  Also, the local schools to which parents wish to send their children do not have the necessary remedial or resource teachers.  Resource teachers, in particular, could provide services for mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the Department will give favourable consideration to this matter.  As it involves the Departments of Health and Education, I hope both Ministers will meet a deputation of parents from the Ballinasloe area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I acknowledge Deputy Connaughton's point that this is not a party political matter, I must correct him in regard to one matter.  Since this Government took office the increase in funding for mentally handicapped services has been greater than at any other time.  The Deputy referred to stop-go funding which was stopped until the Government took office and is now going again. I acknowledge Deputy Connaughton's suggestion about European funding and will pass it on to the Minister.  I will also pass on Deputy Kitt's request for a meeting with a deputation from the Ballinasloe area.  I know the Deputies were not exaggerating when they referred to <Col N="825" /> the intensity and emotion of the meeting in Ballinasloe last week.  I attended many similar meetings in Limerick, one in the last three weeks.</P>
      <P>The provision of services for persons with a mental handicap in the Ballinasloe-east Galway area is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Service developments in the region are agreed by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee within the guidelines issued by my Department and approved by the Minister. The Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee comprises representatives from the Western Health Board, the Western Care Association, Galway County Association, Brothers of Charity and three parent representatives, including one from the Ballinasloe area.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware an additional £12.5 million was made available for the development of mental handicap services in 1994 which will become part of their on-going annual funding.  Substantial capital is also being provided for the development of training centres for persons with a disability.  From this the western region was allocated a total of £200,000 to enable the Western Care Association and the Galway County Association upgrade and renovate training facilities.</P>
      <P>Of the £12.5 million available, £2.5 million was used to strengthen the funding base of some agencies and to meet some essential service needs.  Agencies which benefited from this included the Brothers of Charity services, the Western Care Association and the Galway County Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £10 million was allocated to the health board regions to provide a broad range of additional services from which the Western Health Board region was allocated £1.018 million.  The following additional services are being put in place in the region in 1994: 40 residential and one respite place; 18 day care places; and home support services for up to 72 people.  Funding was also provided for the transfer of 25 persons <Col N="826" /> with mental handicap from St. Bridget's Hospital, Ballinasloe, to more appropriate accommodation in the mental handicap services.</P>
    <P>At the specific request of the regional co-ordinating committee the Minister agreed a mix of services which focused on additional residential and respite places as opposed to day services. Additional residential and respite places were identified as a priority to enable service providers, particularly in the Galway area, to free up respite and crisis intervention places which had become blocked by persons for whom a residential place had become essential.</P>
    <P>In regard to special educational provision for persons with mild mental handicap in the Ballinasloe-East Galway area, I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Education, that two special classes have been established and are attached to Scoil Mhuire Gan Smal, Creagh, Ballinasloe.  This provision is meeting the identified need in that area at present.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for children with moderate mental handicap in a special class in Portumna boys' national school. Furthermore, children of second level age from the Ballinasloe area are catered for in St. Hilda's special school, Athlone, and the Department of Education pays the cost of transporting the pupils to this school.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education provides grant-aid for instructors in vocational training centres for moderately mentally handicapped young adults. Such centres are established by the health boards or voluntary agencies. One such centre which provides for the area referred to by the Deputy is St. Hilda's Vocational Training Centre, Athlone.  The Department of Education provides funding for three instructors in this centre.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Education is not aware that the level of special educational need in the Ballinasloe-East Galway area at present is such as to require the provision of additional special educational facilities <Col N="827" /> for children with mental handicap. However, my colleague, the Minister for Education, has arranged for her Department's inspectorate to investigate the special educational needs of the area and consider whether further special provision is required.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, of course would be prepared to consider any detailed proposals in this regard the Deputy may wish to submit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Kitt requested specifically that a deputation be arranged to meet the Ministers for Health and Education.  I will communicate with both Ministers tomorrow and with both Deputies thereafter.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Ashford (Wicklow) Retirement Village.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health must take action and use his powers to prevent any more scandals of the kind that have beset the residents of Clonmannon retirement village in Ashford County Wicklow.  The saga is well known &mdash; the sorry sequence of events involving shoddy business practice, the harassment of elderly residents, the cutting off of essential services and other unacceptable actions taken against people who are elderly, frail and in certain cases ill.  Since the dispute began a number of the residents have died and others have been forced to move out.  A place which promised to provide safety, refuge and services for elderly people has become a nightmare.  Public lighting was cut off, electricity supply to the sewerage system was cut and, at one point, the water supply was cut off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in County Wicklow were shocked at the way these elderly residents could be terrorised with impunity. The situation is so grave that thousands of local people, supported by all the local churches, supported a petition to protect the residents.  For over a year the affair at Clonmannon was the subject of media comment.  There have been tribunal hearings in relation to the <Col N="828" /> workers gaining their legitimate rights. In February a deputation from the village met the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  There have been court hearings and Employment Appeals Tribunal hearings.  Eviction proceedings have begun against the residents.</P>
    <P>After a lengthy and sustained campaign on the part of residents and supporters the Minister for Enterprise and Employment finally sent in an inspector under the provisions of the Companies Act whose investigation continues.</P>
    <P>The single most shocking feature of this affair is the failure of existing legislation to protect the elderly residents. When they sought help from the State it was not forthcoming.  This is no criticism of staff working in the statutory bodies who did their best.  The needs of elderly people who might find themselves in the future in such a vulnerable position can be met only if the Minister for Health uses the powers granted him by this House.  The implementation of the provisions of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 made a major difference to standards in nursing homes but the elderly residents of Clonmannon are not protected even though many of them are old, sick, frail and vulnerable. Surely they are entitled to the same protection as their friends and relations living in nursing homes?  If they do not have that protection, we shall be looking at a very serious repetition of the Clonmannon saga elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Retirement villages are a growth industry and the world is full of unscrupulous businessmen who can and will exploit the opportunity that lack of regulation offers them.  The Minister has power, under section 2 (2) of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  If he becomes of opinion that the provisions of the Act should apply to a category of institution for the care and maintenance of persons he may, by regulation, amend the definition of &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; to bring them within the scope of the definition contained in the Act.  The Minister has an obligation to do so in <Col N="829" /> view of the cruel, vicious regime the Clonmannon residents have had to endure.  If he does not do so a clear signal will go out to every gangster and fly-by-night operator that there are easy pickings in the retirement village business in Ireland, in the exploitation of elderly people who deserve better and who are entitled to the protection of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the legal position first, the specific ambit of the relevant Act, and return to the specific position in Clonmannon.  Deputy McManus suggests that the Minister should use powers available under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 to extend the definition of a nursing home to include retirement home.  I do not agree with the Deputy that the Minister has the power under the Act to do what she suggests.  The long title of the Act is &ldquo;to make further provision in relation to nursing homes for dependent persons and for that purpose to provide for the registration by health boards of such homes&rdquo;.  A dependent person is defined in section 1 of the Act as</P>
      <P>a person who requires assistance with the activities of daily living such as dressing, eating, walking, washing, and bathing by reason of:</P>
      <P> (a)  physical infirmity or a physical injury, defect or disease, or</P>
      <P>(b)  mental infirmity. </P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Act defines a nursing home as &ldquo;an institution for the care and maintenance of two or more of dependent persons&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) of that section enables the Minister to amend the definition of &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; to include a class of institution for the care and maintenance of persons that it does not apply to.  The subsection must be read in the context of this section as a whole.  Subsection 1 specifies the institutions to be excluded from the scope of the Act.  Subsection (2)  permits the Minister to include <Col N="830" /> within the scope of the Act, by regulations, an institution which has been explicitly excluded, or he may bring a new category of institution within the definition of nursing homes.</P>
    <P>However, in bringing a new category of institution within the scope of the section, he is limited to institutions for dependent persons, as defined in section 1 of the Act.  By its nature, a retirement home could not be defined as an institution for dependent persons.  A retirement home is a place where older people, following retirement, choose to live.  They look after their own affairs and perform the activities of daily living without assistance.  The move to a retirement home or village is essentially a housing choice.  The health services have no greater involvement with the elderly residents than if they were living in their former homes.</P>
    <P>By contrast, people who need care in nursing homes depend on the nursing home to provide them with assistance with one or more of the activities of daily living such as dressing, eating, walking, washing and bathing.  They are a very vulnerable group of people and the quality of their lives depends on the quality of the nursing care they receive in the home.</P>
    <P>Only recently was the situation in Clonmannon brought to my attention by some of my colleagues in the Wicklow area.  It is not directly within my remit.  I was appalled at what is going on there.  As Deputy McManus rightly said, it is disgraceful that elderly people should be subjected to such a regime.</P>
    <P>A feature of the residents' contract was the provision of services such as might be provided to an individual's home.  Aspects of this contract became the subject of dispute between residents and the management company.  Following a series of allegations made in recent weeks to my colleague, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, regarding the operation of companies involved in Clonmannon, he appointed on 10 October an officer pursuant to section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990 to examine the books of these <Col N="831" /> companies.  The Minister is concerned to emphasise that this is a sensitive case, where allegations have been made concerning various areas of law.  He has sought the co-operation of everyone concerned in allowing the official inquiries to proceed in an objective and effective manner.</P>
    <P>My main concern as Minister of State at the Department of Health is that the current dispute over the residents' contract should not jeopardise the health of <Col N="832" /> the residents of Clonmannon.  The Eastern Health Board is monitoring the situation and has contingency plans in place to offer residents of Clonmannon accommodation in health board homes should they become sufficiently dependent to need nursing home care.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy McManus that I will maintain close contact with the health board about the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 October 1994.</P>

      <P>I want to reject the suggestion that the Garda is unable, or has failed, to have foot patrols carried out at the locations mentioned.  Foot patrols are carried out in these areas on an on-going basis.</P>
      <P>The areas referred to by the Deputy are policed from Store Street and Fitzgibbon Street Garda stations.  The Garda are aware of the problem of larcenies from vehicles in the areas referred to and have taken a number of measures to combat this problem, including the establishment of a special surveillance unit involving members in plain clothes.  The operation of this unit is, of course, in addition to the regular surveillance carried out by the District Detective Units.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that a uniform garda presence is maintained in these areas throughout the day and into the early hours of the morning. Since June of this year, special foot patrols have been introduced involving four uniformed gardaí from Store Street who are engaged full time on foot patrols in these areas.  These gardaí work in close co-operation with the Divisional Drugs Unit and the Garda authorities report that this initiative has significantly reduced the level of crime, disorder and loitering in this general area.</P>
      <P>A Special Task Force Unit based at Fitzgibbon Street was established last month and this unit also pays particular attention to the areas in question.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the current policing arrangements, including the level of foot patrols, for the areas in question are adequate and are satisfied that the new initiatives being taken by them to combat crime are proving successful.  These arrangements will be kept under continuing review and any changes considered necessary will be made.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána Complaints Board Annual Report for 1993, which I have submitted to the Government prior to its being laid before each House of the Oireachtas, does not show that a very high number of the complaints received are vexatious. The report shows a decrease both proportionately and in real terms in vexatious complaints over 1992.</P>
      <P>As I have stated on previous occasions, there is already statutory provision in section 12 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, making it an offence to make, knowingly, a false report or statement tending to show that an offence has been committed.  A complainant, therefore, who, for example, falsely accuses a member of the Garda Síochána of assaulting him is already liable to criminal sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its first triennial report covering the years 1987 to 1989, the board addressed the question of whether the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, should be amended to provide penalties for the making of a vexatious complaint.  The board was of the opinion that further criminalisation might deter more genuine complaints than truly malicious ones and that, in any event, it would be very difficult to successfully prosecute a vexatious complainant. Furthermore, the board felt that the introduction of penalties under the Act could have the opposite effect to that intended in that more vexatious complaints could enter the system if the <Col N="568" /> board's and the chief executive's decisions on such complaints were to be used as a basis for criminal prosecutions. The board, therefore, concluded that the existing provisions in the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act were adequate.</P>
    <P>In its 1993 annual report, the board has considered the matter again in some detail and concluded that while vexatious complaints are undoubtedly a cause for concern because of the waste of resources and the effect on the morale of those complained of, it should continue its present policies of ensuring that as few such complaints as possible get into the system and of pursuing the possible prosecution of complainants in those cases which emerge as vexatious only after the investigation process.  I will consider carefully any further recommendations which the board may choose to make in this matter.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are two gardaí assigned to Newport Garda station and two gardaí assigned to Louisburgh Garda station.  Both stations are sub-districts of Westport District. An additional Garda sergeant was assigned to Westport station in June of this year and he has been given responsibility for operational and administrative matters at Louisburgh.  A similar arrangement has existed for the Newport area since September 1991 whereby another sergeant based at Westport has specific responsibility for the Newport area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that, while they are not complacent about any level of crime in any rural <Col N="569" /> area, both of the areas in question have relatively low crime rates, with seven crimes reported to date this year in Louisburgh and six crimes in Newport. They consider that the current arrangements are working satisfactorily and that an adequate policing service is provided to the communities at Newport and Louisburgh.  These arrangements will be kept under continuing review and any changes considered necessary will be made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>Section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, empowers the Minister for Justice to provide by way of regulations for the issue of age cards on a voluntary basis to persons of or over 18 years of age.  I have no proposals at present to make such regulations.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the most acceptable and effective way of complementing the comprehensive set of provisions in the 1988 Act aimed at curbing under-age drinking is through the continued development of voluntary local age card schemes.  Such schemes, backed by vigorous community involvement and with continual monitoring are, I believe, capable of making a greater contribution to tackling under-age drinking than a single nationwide scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that more then 100 local schemes <Col N="570" /> are in operation throughout the country and that plans are under way to establish new schemes in other centres.  I am also informed that, overall, the schemes are considered to be reasonably successful and beneficial and that they have assisted in reducing the level of alcohol use by persons under the age of 18 years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 53, 79, 95, 153 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have undertaken extensive investigations into the issues raised by the Yorkshire Television programme on the Dublin and Monaghan bomb outrages.  As I have indicated previously to the House, my consideration of the initial Garda report of those investigations led me to ask for certain further inquiries to be made. Those inquiries have been completed and a further report was made available to me in June by the Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the relatives and the House have been waiting a considerable time for the outcome of those investigations. I want to assure both the relatives and the House that everything is <Col N="572" /> being done to bring the matter to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, the investigation is at this remove of its nature a complex affair. That and my concern to ensure that all avenues of investigation have been followed up has meant that the matter could not be brought to a speedier conclusion.</P>
    <P>My examination of the Garda reports to which I have already referred as continuing. That examination will form the basis for the public statement which I have previously undertaken to make. My intention is that that statement will be as comprehensive as possible consistent with the fact that the Garda investigation files on these outrages remain open.  The statement will also, for that reason, require the most careful preparation and I therefore intend to consult with both the Garda authorities and the Director of Public Prosecutions before finalising its terms.</P>
    <P>It has always been my intention to meet again with the families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings to advise them of the outcome of the investigations before issuing a public statement on the matter.  That remains my intention.</P>
    <P>It would not in all the circumstances be proper for me to say anything further on the subject at this stage beyond acknowledging, in response to Deputy Molloy's question, that I have received representations of the kind to which his question refers.  My views on the issue of a public inquiry remain the same as those which I indicated to this House on 7 July 1993 in the course of the Adjournment Debate on this matter.</P>

    <P>There was no undue delay in the disposal of criminal, civil or family law cases in the 1989-90 and 1990-91 legal years.  During those two years, cases in all categories which were listed for hearing were disposed of at the sitting of the court following their listing.  There was also no undue delay in the disposal of criminal cases in the 1991-92 and 1992-93 years.  There was, however, a four months delay in the disposal of civil and family law cases in 1991-92 which grew to between eight months and nine months in 1992-93.  In 1993-94, the delay in the disposal of criminal and family law cases was eight months while the delay in disposing of civil cases grew to 13 months.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1947, provides that the fixing of Circuit Court venues is a matter for the President of the Circuit Court.  There were 35 scheduled sitting days of the Circuit Court in County Louth in the 1990-91 legal year &mdash; the year the Circuit Court last sat in Drogheda.  The scheduled number of sitting days of the Circuit Court in County Louth increased to 40 and 38 in the 1991-92 and 1992-93 legal years, respectively.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the withdrawal of the Circuit Court from Drogheda has not reduced efficiency in the disposal of Circuit Court business in County Louth as the assignment of all County Louth cases to Dundalk allows a roll over of cases not dealt with on a particular day into the following day and that such system of listing all County Louth Circuit Court cases in Dundalk is the most effective way of administering the list of cases.</P>
    <P>I should add that there has been a significant increase in activity levels in <Col N="575" /> County Louth as in all Circuit Court areas in the county as a consequence of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and the Courts Act, 1991.  My Department has carried out a review of activity levels in the courts to assess the impact of the above Acts.  The results of this review have formed the basis of proposals for additional resources to eliminate arrears in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>In this administration we operate a fairly liberal regime for prisoners and there is a real risk that some visitors will abuse the regime by passing illegal drugs on visits, and that prisoners will abuse free association by passing drugs to one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would, of course, be possible to modify the regime for prisoners in such a way as to virtually eliminate the problem. The revised regime, however, would have to include severe restrictions on free association between prisoners, more frequent searches of cells and prisoners including strip-searches, the searching of all visitors to prisons, <Col N="576" /> the erection of barriers between prisoners and all visitors to prevent personal contact, even with children, and the introduction of more intrusive technology.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the drugs problem is a most serious one I am not satisfied that I would be justified in introducing so restrictive and inhumane a regime which would punish the innocent as well as the guilty and could cause irreparable harm to relationships with families including children.</P>
    <P>Steps which are being taken to keep drugs out of the prisons include a high level of staff vigilance, closed circuit video surveillance, screening of prisoners after visits and regular searches of the prisons.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the document <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan</i> which I published in June last which contains in Chapter 13 a discussion of the problem. The document indicated that it was planned, through the medium of the departmental steering committee which is in place to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases in Prisons, to carry out a full review to establish how best to manage the problems of both the access of drugs and the treatment-rehabilitation of drug-addicted offenders.</P>
    <P>There is already in the prisons a wide range of rehabilitative services, including medical, psychiatric, psychology, welfare, education, work-training and chaplaincy available to offenders to help them to cope with their sentences and to lead them, as far as practicable, to a more constructive life in the community on release.  These are, of course, available to drug abusers but in their case two specific initiatives are important i.e. the expansion of methadone maintenance programmes and the development of drug-free units.</P>
    <P>I know that there are difficulties about methadone maintenance strategies. Nonetheless, this is an issue that must be faced.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, has just issued a medical <Col N="577" /> protocol in this respect which should greatly clarify the issue for doctors in general practice, including prison doctors.  The Prison Medical Director is now conferring with prison doctors on the practical implications for the treatment of offenders.</P>
    <P>In regard to drug-free units I should say that the Prison Medical Director and other senior officials have visited drug-free units in England and a number of prisons in the Netherlands to review their method of operation and to see how they might be adopted here.  I am still considering their report but would sound a note of caution that for various reasons such models might be difficult to operate successfully in our system.</P>
    <P>In the wider community, the drug situation is monitored continuously and all strategies adopted by the Garda to deal with the problem are kept under continuous review.  This ensures that the problem is dealt with effectively and efficiently and that manpower and resources are utilised in the best possible way.</P>

      <P>In my response today to a number of questions on applications for naturalisation linked to investments, I have already referred to the issue raised by the Deputy.  The advisory group of departmental officials which I established some time ago to examine and to make recommendations on such applications will apply specific criteria, <Col N="579" /> including one to the effect that an applicant must furnish a certificate of character from the police authorities of any country in which the applicant has resided or carried out business, with express permission to the Irish authorities to inquire behind it.</P>
      <P>In addition, each application for naturalisation is required by law to be made on the form prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations, 1956.  The form requires that an applicant for naturalisation provide references from three Irish citizens to the effect that they are prepared to support the application from personal knowledge of, and intimate acquaintance with, the applicant and can vouch for good character.  The form contains a statement to the effect that a false statement on the form is punishable by a fine of up to £500 and-or imprisonment for up to six months.</P>
      <P>As well as that, an applicant is required to provide on the form particulars of any proceedings, civil and criminal, which have been taken against him or her in courts of law in the State or elsewhere.  An applicant is also required to make a statutory declaration before a notary public or a commissioner of oaths or a peace commissioner to the effect that the particulars stated in the application are true.  The question of considering an application does not arise unless the statutory declaration has first been made.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts for the revocation of certificates of naturalisation in a number of circumstances including where the certificate was procurred by fraud, misrepresentation whether innocent or fraudulent, or concealment of material facts or circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 45 Garda stations in the Donegal Division. Ten of these stations are open on a 24-hour basis, while the remaining 35 stations have limited opening hours. When these stations are unmanned, callers to the stations can make direct and immediate contact with a garda on duty at the district headquarters by using the direct communications link &mdash; Green Man &mdash; which is available at each station.  The gardaí at the district headquarters can then arrange for the nearest garda or mobile patrol unit to come to their assistance.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities continually review the policing needs of each individual area, with a view to providing the best possible policing service to the public. One important factor, which has to be taken into consideration in these reviews, is that an increase in the opening hours of stations would necessarily result in withdrawing gardaí from outdoor operational duties and would reduce the number of gardaí available for crime prevention, crime detection and patrolling duties in the community. The current Garda strength in the Donegal Division is 480.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the current Garda strength in Donegal and the opening hours of the Garda stations in the county are adequate to meet the policing needs of the county.  The Garda authorities keep the opening hours of the stations and the manpower allocation under continuing review to ensure that the optimum use is made of all available resources and that the best possible policing service is provided to the people of Donegal. In reviewing these matters they take account of expressions of public opinion in the division, such as the <Col N="581" /> debate referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>In my policy document <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan</i> which I published last June I outlined in Chapters 9 and 10 my plans for the further development of education and work-training in the prisons.  In regard to education the main elements are a continued emphasis on the delivery of a quality education service, with extra spaces provided in the context of the ongoing renovation programme, a review of curricula with special emphasis on the needs of particularly disadvantaged prisoners and those with personal problems such as alcoholism or drug dependency and the greater involvement of colleges in prison education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to work-training the main elements include an expansion by some <Col N="586" /> 500 of the number of work places currently available with a particular emphasis on providing suitable work for drug abusers.  They also include an improvement in the system of assessment and selection of offenders for particular work activities.  In addition, there will be a review, where necessary, of existing staffing structures in order to maintain satisfactory standards and evaluation of the programme on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that the various goals and objectives are being met and that realistic standards are being achieved.</P>
    <P>Both education and work-training are components of the strategy for positive sentence management which is a key feature of my plans.  The incentive for prisoners to participate in education and work-training will be the opportunity they provide for self-development and participation in programmes which may lead to planned and structured early release under supervision.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>One probation and welfare officer is assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Court to deal exclusively with civil work.  While the Probation and Welfare Service has not had a statutory role in relation to family law cases, probation and welfare officers have traditionally undertaken civil work at the request of the presiding judge.  However, the service's primary role relates to criminal law cases.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Probation and Welfare Service, having regard to the demands placed on it arising from its statutory role in the criminal law area, cannot always meet the increasing demands placed on it in the context of family law cases.  In the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, for example, hearings may often be adjourned for up to nine months with the consent of the parties to await a report.  I accept that this arrangement is not satisfactory and I am keeping the matter under review.</P>

      <P>There are currently 682 administrative civilian staff working with the Garda Síochána.  The number of civilians in the force has almost doubled since 1989, releasing gardaí from administrative duties to perform outdoor operational tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the measures included in my <Col N="591" /> law and order package, I announced plans to recruit a further 200 civilian staff to the Garda Síochána between now and the end of 1997.  These civilians will release more gardaí from administrative duties to perform operational duties, including the detection of crime.</P>
    <P>In addition, the implementation of the information technology plan for the Garda Síochána, which also forms part of my law and order package, should result in the release of a significant number of gardaí for operational work.</P>
    <P>As regards the enforcement of less serious offences such as parking violations, this is primarily carried out by traffic wardens.  There are currently 178 traffic wardens employed by the Garda Síochána.  As regards the more serious parking offences, a small number of gardaí are involved in the towing away of illegally parked vehicles.</P>
    <P>The position regarding more serious offences under the Road Traffic Acts, including failure to comply with compulsory insurance provisions, is that all prosecutions must be taken in the name of the DPP and the prosecuting garda must attend court to give evidence in support of any charge.</P>
    <P>In the context of ensuring the most effective deployment of Garda resources I have a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill under preparation in my Department at present.

      <P>I am aware of recent newspaper reports stating that parties to <Col N="594" /> several inquests have called for a widening of the statutory powers as exercised by coroners when conducting inquests. The role of the coroner in our law has long been of a very specific nature, that is, to ascertain the identity of the person who is the subject of the inquest and to establish how, when and where the death occurred.  Section 30 of the Coroners Act, 1962 prohibits consideration by the coroner of questions of civil and criminal liability.</P>
      <P>It is, I know, very difficult for those who have been bereaved to accept that these restrictions should apply, but it is a fundamental principle of our law that the only way in which issues of civil or criminal liability can be established is by means of the presentation of evidence and defence in a court of law.  My advice is that any law which provided for the determination of issues of this kind in a forum other than a court of law would not stand the test of constitutional challenge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to clarify the position of prisoners convicted of subversive offences in the light of the cessation of the campaign of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to begin with some general comments.  The management of sentences is a matter for my Department. The Minister for Justice has power, conferred by Statute, to grant early conditional releases to offenders and it is a power which is exercised on a daily basis.  In making a decision the Minister takes account of a number of factors including the nature of the offence; the length of sentence served; the offender's conduct while in prison, <Col N="595" /> and most importantly, the likely threat to the community if the offender were granted early release.</P>
    <P>In assessing these factors, the Minister takes advice from a variety of sources, for example, prison management, Garda authorities, Probation and Welfare Service, as well as officials of his or her Department.  Recommendations for early conditional release may also originate with the sentence review group whose terms of reference permit them to review all offenders who have served seven years of their sentence.</P>
    <P>That then is the general position.  The ending of the campaign of violence by the Provisional IRA has introduced a new dimension for offenders who claim membership of that organisation.  While the same criteria will be applied, when it comes to considering the question of temporary release for individual PIRA offenders, and while it remains the position that each case will fall to be considered on its own merits, it is to be expected that the advice which I will receive from the prisons, from my own Department and from other relevant sources will differ in one important respect from that which I would receive had the campaign not ended.  I am likely to be advised, in many cases, that the threat to the community which would be posed by the release of the individuals concerned has diminished, now that the violence campaign on the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; has ended.  I will still, as I say, look at each case on its own merits but I expect that the result of the examination of individual cases &mdash; which incidentally has already commenced &mdash; will be that some will be given release dates earlier than would have applied had the campaign not ended.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 104 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>The Urban Initiative will provide aid to a limited number of urban areas within cities and urban agglomerations, generally with a population of more than 100,000.  The target areas will be urban neighbourhoods, geographically defined, with a high level of unemployment, with a decayed urban fabric, bad housing conditions and lack of social amenities.  Priority will be given to innovative projects forming part of long term urban integration strategies being implemented by the cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final decision about the number of areas to be funded under Urban rests with the European Commission following negotiations between my Department and the Commission in the context of preparing the operational programme required under the initiative, which will be published.  The decision about the areas to be proposed <Col N="597" /> for funding will be taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>To assist in the consideration of the areas to be put forward to the Commission, my Department advertised for proposals in respect of the Urban Initiative on 16 September 1994, and asked that proposals be submitted before Friday 14 October 1994.  The advertisement specified that because of the stipulation that the initiative was intended for cities with a population of more than 100,000, with smaller cities being considered only in exceptional circumstances, only applications from Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway could expect to be considered.</P>
    <P>Follow-up briefing meetings with the relevant local authorities and with community groups and organisations who had expressed an interest in Urban were arranged by the Department.</P>
    <P>Forty-four proposals have been received in my Department from local authorities, other organisations, community groups and individuals as follows in respect of areas or projects:</P>

    <P>Many of the proposals received in respect of the Urban Initiative, especially those from community groups, comprise individual innovative projects which would form part of a wider and more long term strategy for development of urban areas.</P>
    <P>These proposals are being considered in the context of those specific geographic areas concerned, with a view to establishing the basis for a framework <Col N="598" /> strategy for the development of areas which are most likely to meet the Commission's criteria.</P>
    <P>As the Urban Initiative will be approved for an urban area rather than in terms of individual applicants it would not be appropriate, at this stage to provide details of the individual proposals. However, I can confirm that a joint application has been received from Dublin Corporation, the Ballymun, Finglas and Northside Partnerships and Dublin City Enterprise Board, and this will be considered as part of the process outlined above.  The Government will communicate its proposals to the Commission within the next three weeks.</P>

      <i>Notes:</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  Persons on &ldquo;three-day week&rdquo; systematic short-time working were excluded from the live register from January 1980.  The category was extended to incorporate persons on &ldquo;week-on/week-off&rdquo; working arrangements from May 1992.</P>
    <P>2.  Since the introduction of unemployment assistance for smallholders in January 1966, this group has been excluded from the live register.  Separate figures on the number of smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance have only been published by the CSO in respect of the period since January 1989.</P>
    <P>3. The self-employed category was excluded from the live register with effect from May 1992.</P>
    <P>4.  The pre-retirement allowance scheme (PRETA) was introduced in March 1990.  The qualifying age was reduced from 60 to 58 years with effect from April 1991 and from 58 years to 55 years with effect from May 1992.</P>
    <P>5.  The pre-retirement credit scheme (PRECS) was introduced in August 1990.  The qualifying age was reduced from 60 to 58 years with effect from June 1991 and from 58 to 55 years with effect from June 1992.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the base year figures for 1993 and the target levels for 1999 in respect of gross job creation, construction jobs, new business start-ups and the unemployment rate in designated disadvantaged areas as outlined on page 58 of the European Commission's Community Support Framework.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1822/94]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought relates to the local urban and rural development programme now being finalised with the European Commission. This programme comprises sub-programmes on local enterprise, integrated development of disadvantaged and other areas and urban and village renewal.  The objectives of the programme are based on the experience to date in a number of national and EC <Col N="603" /> funded socio-economic development projects which were largely of a pilot nature.  It is difficult, therefore, to draw from base line data and targets achieved in these pilots and apply them to a much more comprehensive and longer-term development plan.</P>
      <P>However, the CSF provides that &ldquo;the principal objectives relating to enterprise and employment are to achieve the following increases by 1999 as compared with the 1993 figures: an increase in gross job creation of 16,900, together with 3,000 work year jobs in construction; an increase of 5,900 in new business start-ups and an improvement from 25 to 50 per cent in the survival rate of new businesses.  The unemployment rate in designated disadvantaged areas will be monitored over the duration of the CSF.&rdquo;  These target levels provided in the CSF for activities under the programme are advance forecasts which will be revised in line with the completion of plans by County Enterprise Boards, partnerships and other communities and local authorities. This is in keeping with the &ldquo;bottom up' approach under this programme that priorities, programmes and targets for local development should be set at local level.  The base line data for 1993 provided in the plans will be reviewed by the monitoring committee of the programme to ensure uniformity of approach and the integrity of the data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job creation and business startup figures are based on the experience in area partnership and county enterprise boards to date, on forecasts <Col N="604" /> of expected activity in partnerships to be established, and in construction work based on a given level of investment. The question of the survival rate is very difficult to predict.  The Task Force on Small Businesses pointed out that the attrition rate of new small business is very high, in some cases over 50 per cent.  The specific nature of county enterprise boards and their counselling and mentoring role should substantially improve this rate.</P>
    <P>Ultimately the specific type of baseline data to be used and targets to be set will be agreed with the monitoring committee for the programme.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are the statutory authority charged with responsibility for arterial drainage pursuant to the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  Since the passing of the Act a number of schemes have been carried out in County Galway. However, as none of the rivers in the South Galway area is included in their programme and as the resources available for arterial drainage are fully committed, the Commissioners are not in a position to undertake works in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>South Galway is fairly unique in its geological formation.  Limestone in the areas has been subject to a process called Karstification with all its inherent <Col N="613" /> distinctive and unusual features such as swallow holes, sparse and intermittent streams, bare rock, large underground caves and springs and turloughs.  Most of the rainfall in this particular area disappears underground shortly after the numerous streams flowing down the Slieve Aughty reach the cavernous limestone where it must flow underground to Galway Bay as there is no surface outlet.</P>
    <P>Recent reports prepared by the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Office of Public Works indicate that flooding in the area results from a combination of this geological formation and exceptionally high rainfall.  They conclude that any solution to the flooding problem in the area would be likely to prove extremely costly, would have serious impact on the environment and would be difficult to undertake successfully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the level of tax evasion.  Its very nature makes it extremely difficult to estimate its extent.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners operate a wide range of programmes to detect evasion and increased resources are being devoted to this task.  Some 16,100 persons were detected by the Revenue Commissioners in the last five years as either not on record for tax purposes or having undisclosed sources of income. In the same period revenue's audit and investigation programmes produced tax settlements valued at almost £413 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> In the majority of cases the most effective way of dealing with evasion is by way of settlement.  The fact that the settlements are published and include interest and an amount to cover penalties is an effective deterrent to evasion. In line with the practice in most other jurisdictions only a limited number of cases are selected for prosecution in any one year.</P>
    <P>Since 1992, 13 cases were referred by the Revenue Commissioners to the Garda fraud squad for investigation with a view to obtaining the evidence needed for prosecution and the preparation of a report for the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to prosecution. The Director of Public Prosecutions has decided not to proceed in two of these cases.  The remaining cases are being pursued by the Garda fraud squad.</P>
    <P>Revenue have an active policy of prosecutions for tax offences outside of the tax evasion area as can be seen from the 448 cases published in the 1993 Revenue annual report in respect of which a fine or penalty was imposed.</P>

These activities, involving over 500 staff, will save the taxpayer over £100 million this year.  A study of fraud and abuse in unemployment and disability benefit payments carried out some years ago by consultants on behalf of my Department estimated that some 2 per cent of unemployment payments and 1 per cent of disability payments were fraudulently claimed.  A subsequent <Col N="616" /> study on the same basis by my Department indicated that these levels had decreased.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a Scheme of Grants to Voluntary Organisations under which &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; grants to assist with the cost of capital items such as equipment, transport and premises may be made to a range of voluntary and community organisations. Grants for ongoing running expenses other than salaries or wages may also be made, but only in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>I announced a special grant of £40,000 to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the 1994 budget towards the cost of employing two training officers to develop the social welfare advice role of their unemployed centres and a grant of £24,000 to the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed to employ a resource worker to co-ordinate the provision of advice and information to the unemployed through the centres affiliated to it.  Both organisations received similar grants in 1993.  This training will enable the centres involved to deal more and more with routine queries without the need to refer to the Department. Every effort is made to keep the costs of inquiries to my Department by members of the public and voluntary organisations to the minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department provides a comprehensive information service at local and <Col N="618" /> regional level through its extensive network of offices throughout the State. All local offices of my Department are now computerised with online access to the main central records data base.  This enables staff to deal with even the most complex inquiry without undue delay. In any case where the inquiry cannot be completed promptly, staff will return the call when the relevant information is to hand to avoid unnecessary delay or expense to the caller.</P>
    <P>A free-phone service is provided by my Department at certain times, for example, after each budget, to advise on the specific changes announced.  A free-phone service is also provided in conjunction with the launch of new schemes or significant changes to existing ones.</P>
    <P>Some of my Department's services have been decentralised in recent years and information can be obtained by either calling those offices directly or, if it is cheaper to do so, by calling the Department's main number in Dublin and having the call relayed without additional costs to the appropriate office.  The current arrangements offer a high level of service to the public throughout the country.  This service will be further improved as my programme of localising the Department's schemes and services develops further. The needs of organisations who provide information services will be further considered as my Department's computerisation and communications programmes develop.</P>

      <P>A social welfare recipient whose child dependant has a special dietary requirement, arising from a health condition, and whose means are <Col N="619" /> insufficient to meet this need, may qualify for an additional payment under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.</P>
      <P>The determination of entitlement under the SWA scheme is a matter for the health boards.  The person concerned applied to the Eastern Health Board for assistance with the cost of a specific baby food.  Her application was refused by the board on the grounds of need.  The board has been contacted and has advised that the application has been reviewed and that she has been awarded a diet supplement of £4.60 a week, backdated to 1 October 1994.  I understand that the board has now written to the client notifying her of the award.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of unemployment assistance, the weekly rate of which is in course of being reviewed.  Her husband has also been in receipt of unemployment assistance but moved to community employment at a higher weekly rate of payment.</P>
      <P>The review of the wife's unemployment assistance arises because her weekly rate of entitlement was calculated in relation to her husband's former weekly rate of entitlement which has now been increased.  This will result in a reduction of her entitlement. However the combined weekly income to the couple will still be in excess of their combined unemployment assistance payments.</P>

    <P>I am particularly concerned about the position of married women working in the home who now represent the largest single category of people excluded from social insurance cover.  Women who spend a significant part of their working lives working in the home do not, in general, qualify for Old Age (Contributory) Pension in their own right.  Instead, they rely on the means tested Old Age (Non-Contributory) Pension or are regarded as adult dependants of their husband.  Earlier this year.  I made regulations under which years spent working in the home caring for a child up to age six or for an incapacitated person are disregarded in <Col N="621" /> calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for the purposes of determining entitlement to Old Age (Contributory) Pension.  Up to 20 contribution years may be disregarded in this way.  These regulations, which give practical recognition to women working in the home, represent a major step in providing women in the home with an individual entitlement.</P>
    <P>Under present arrangements, people in respect of whom an adult dependant allowance is payable are entitled in certain circumstances to receive, in their own right, part of the social welfare payment payable to their spouse.  The question of extending these provisions to all spouses working in the home is currently being examined within my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>General guidelines on the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme were issued by my Department to the health boards in 1977.  Specific guidelines on the operation of rent and mortgage supplementation under the scheme were issued to the boards in 1988.  These guidelines are supplemented by Department circulars on specific issues as they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme guidelines are currently being reviewed by my Department in consultation with the health boards. <Col N="622" /> Arising from this review revised guidelines on rent and mortgage supplementation have been prepared and will be published shortly.  Guidance on exceptional needs payments and diet supplements are currently under review and will be published when this process is concluded.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment introduced regulations in relation to housing standards for rented houses which came into effect on 1 January 1994.  These regulations require landlords of rented houses, including flats and maisonettes, to ensure that such houses meet certain minimum standards.  The standards include the safety of electrical and gas installations.  The Fire Services Act, 1981, also put an onus on the person in charge of a premises, generally the landlord, to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire in the premises and to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable the safety of the persons on the premises, if a fire breaks out.</P>
    <P>The primary role for enforcement of planning law has been devolved from the Department of the Environment to the local authorities who have powers under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 to 1993 to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Acts.</P>
    <P>Guidelines do not require health boards to ensure compliance with fire, safety and planning requirements; however, should the board become aware that the accommodation is manifestly of an unacceptable standard the matter can be brought to the attention of the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>My Department will keep this issue under review in the light of the new regulations.  Up to 1993 the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was administered with minimal computer assistance which limited the amount and the quality of statistical material available on the scheme.  A new statistical system for the scheme was introduced on a phased basis in 1993 and has been fully operational in the Eastern Health Board only since the start of 1994. <Col N="623" /> Reliable data on expenditure on rent supplements in the Eastern Health Board for the last five years is not available; however, actual expenditure on rent supplements in the Eastern Health Board area from January to May 1994 is now available from the new statistical system.  Based on this information it is estimated that the outturn on rent supplements for the board will be in the region of £24 million in 1994.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance operated by my Department is available only to people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments and who are either living alone or only with people who could not get help in an emergency.  Such people are vulnerable in various respects and the main purpose of the scheme is to ensure that they, and particularly elderly recipients, have some way of getting help when it is needed.  In addition, the allowance enables them to keep in touch with relatives and friends and to continue to be involved in the life of the community generally.  This process has been greatly helped by the free telephone call unit allowance which I incorporated into the scheme last year.</P>
      <P>Improvements and enhancements to the free telephone rental allowance are considered in the light of perceived need among the target groups and the necessary resources being available.  In this context I will keep the Deputy's suggestions under review.</P>

      <P>The fuel scheme operated by my Department was introduced in 1988 when the then urban and national fuel schemes were amalgamated into one scheme.  The scheme assists householders who are on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  The rate of the fuel allowance in 1988 was £5 per week and was payable to eligible households from mid-October to mid-April.  The weekly rate of payment and the duration of the <Col N="625" /> scheme have remained the same since then.  Expenditure on the scheme has increased from £25.86 million in 1988 to an estimated £41 million in 1994.</P>
      <P>An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week, was introduced in October 1990, to assist people living in built up areas of Dublin with additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the fuel scheme is expected to be in the region of £41 million this year.  It is estimated that some 256,000 recipients will receive the £5 fuel allowance and some 80,000 recipients will qualify for the £3 smokeless fuel allowance in 1994.</P>
      <P>The smokeless fuel scheme will be extended to the Cork city area from the beginning of 1995 when the ban on the sale bituminous coal comes into effect. This will benefit some 20,000 households.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme covers some 440,000 people at an annual cost to my Department of £30 million.  In the case of city bus services for Dublin, Cork and Limerick provided by Bus Atha Cliath or Bus Eireann, free travel passes cannot be used between the hours of 7.00 a.m. and 9.45 a.m. in the morning and 4.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. in the evening on each day from Monday to Friday.  In the case of Bus Eireann long distance buses, the time restriction is limited to Fridays from 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. for up to 20 miles outside Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  These restrictions do not apply to certain disabled or blind people, mentally handicapped people and those attending long term rehabilitation courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> The necessity for these restrictions arises because the services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work or school at that time of the morning and evening.  Any easing of the present arrangements would have significant cost implications for the carriers involved who, in turn would seek compensation from my Department.</P>

      <P>Significant progress has been made in the efforts to agree the draft text of the Europol Convention under Title VI of the European Union Treaty.  A further round of discussions between officials of the member states of the Union took place in Brussels last week.  I am hopeful that progress will continue to be made so as to enable early signature of the Convention to take place.  The Europol Drugs Unit, set up by Ministerial agreement, is already operational and carrying out excellent work.</P>
      <P>The benefits of Europol will be of considerable importance to citizens of the Union arising as they will from the greater co-operation between police forces which will be brought about by implementation of the Convention, and in particular from the pooling of intelligence information from the various national central police units.  This co-operation and pooling of information will, it is hoped, prove effective especially in the combating of illegal drugs trafficking and organised crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I should add that the Government is committed to the concept of international co-operation and pooling of intelligence in the fight against criminality.  Drug traffickers and organised criminals do not have particular regard to international boundaries in their nefarious activities and it behoves governments of the Union to ensure <Col N="628" /> that the existence of such boundaries does not hinder the efforts of the Garda Síochána and their counterparts in Europe in their common action against wrongdoers.</P>

    <P>In June last I published a policy document <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan.</i>  In Chapter 10 my plans in relation to work and training are set as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Over the next five years the following measures will be implemented:</P>
    <P>(1)  Work places will be provided to cater for an additional 500 offenders.  Nearly half of these will be in the new prisons now planned (Chapter 3) and the remainder will be provided at a number of existing prisons (see paragraph 4.5).  In response to the increasing presence of drug abusers in prisons it is proposed that a significant proportion of the new work places will be devoted to meeting the special needs of these offenders through forms of occupational therapy</P>
    <P>(2)  The use of the more sophisticated training facilities (such as those at the Training Unit and Wheatfield) will be maximised by better assessment and selection of offenders.  A key issue to be resolved <Col N="633" /> is ensuring the optimum access to these facilities by offenders from throughout the Prison system.  To achieve this will require timely assessment of offenders and provision of adequate information about the choices available to them.  It will require that a substantial majority of staff in the Prison system actively encourage and support offenders in engaging in work and pursuing training and education. It will require that a responsive system of sentence management be put in place and its operation will need to be such as to encourage offenders to avail of facilities that have been set up for them to improve themselves.  Sentence management will also need to be discriminatory as between young offenders, older offenders, long term offenders etc. who have different needs.</P>
    <P>(3)  A formalised work and training staffing structure will be introduced to those prisons where it is not yet in place to ensure instructor continuity and the maintenance of adequate safety and training standards.</P>
    <P>(4)  Regime goals for each category of prison will be reviewed with the intention of striking a balance between the different needs of offenders, seeking greater complementarity between the various services provided for offenders and setting out reasonable agreed criteria or standards for regime performance.  So far as work and training is concerned these agreed criteria or standards will then be used for carrying our ongoing evaluation of the programme at both institution and Prison system level.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The following are the financial provisions for 1994:</P>

    <P>When a murder is reported, the gardaí put in place certain procedures for the investigation of the crime.  The aim of the investigation is to find the perpetrator and bring him or her before the courts.  If, at the end of this exhaustive and detailed procedure, there is insufficient evidence to support the institution of proceedings, the investigation is scaled down.  However, if further information becomes subsequently available, it is, of course, pursued with the aim of bringing the case to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <P>There never were regulations that required members of An Garda Síochána to reside in a specific location except, for example, where members were allocated to official accommodation, i.e. married quarters or agency houses.  This remains the position but the availability of official accommodation was significantly reduced in the late 1980's.</P>
      <P>The community policing scheme for rural areas was extended to 12 Garda Districts in September 1991 following the operation of a pilot scheme in two districts in the early 1980s.  The scheme provides for guaranteed opening times of Garda stations in these districts and through the pooling of resources a better police service is provided to each area and more time is spent by gardaí out and about in the local community. The latest proposals for the extension of the scheme are under examination in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>I should also say that crime prevention programmes such as &ldquo;Community Alert&rdquo; have been in operation in many rural areas for several years.  These schemes provide a means for persons living in rural areas to play an active part in crime prevention.  They also provide a channel of close communication between gardaí engaged on crime prevention duty and the community.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that there is no evidence of any diminution in the quantity or quality of information being received in recent times concerning crime in rural areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>In 1982 a pilot scheme of community policing in rural areas was introduced in Claremorris and Thomastown districts. On the basis of a detailed examination of its effectiveness, Garda management submitted a report on the matter to my Department in December 1990 and the scheme was extended to a further 12 Garda districts in September 1991.  It is not the practice to publish such reports because they deal with Garda operational matters.  I can say, however, that the report did not contain any recommendations to close Garda stations.</P>
      <P>Consideration is being given at present to extending the community policing scheme for rural areas to additional districts and I am in consultation with the Garda Commissioner regarding this latest review of the scheme.  I am anxious to ensure that there will be sufficient consultation with local interest groups before any decision is made to extend the scheme.  I am, also, taking a number of steps to ensure that more gardaí are available for patrolling duties in the districts.  These include: the recruitment of 1,457 gardaí during 1994 to 1997, so as to maintain the optimum level of the force at 11,000; the recruitment of over 200 civilians over the same period to release more gardaí from office work for policing duties on the streets; the implementation of an information technology plan for the force which, will also release a significant number of gardaí from administrative work for operational duties, including patrolling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where a Garda pension cheque is made payable to a person other than the pensioner in question, the administrative procedures in place require that a certificate must be submitted to the effect that the pensioner is alive on or after the first day of the relevant month.  It is normal practice for my Department to include the relevant blank certificate with each month's pension cheque.  This arrangement is normal in such cases and is applied in the case of the wider Civil Service Pension Scheme by the Pay Master General.  Indeed, my Department only took over the administration of this matter from the Paymaster General a few years ago.</P>
      <P>We have examined our records in this particular case and I am satisfied that there are no delays on the part of the Department in issuing the pension cheque.  Our records show that each monthly pension cheque was posted on the date the completed certificate was received.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, nevertheless, that in cases of long term illness no necessary bureaucratic burdens should be placed on the people who are involved in caring for members of their immediate family.  I have requested that our administrative practices be examined to see if some change could be made, for example, quarterly certification, provided this accords with proper audit and control requirements.  I shall communicate further with the Deputy in due course.</P>

      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy involved the release on bail of a prisoner in error through mistaken identity on 2 August 1994.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1,000 movements of prisoners in and out of Mountjoy every week.  These movements include committals from the courts, transfers to and from other institutions, discharges on temporary release, bail and expiry of sentence.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances the possibility of error is always present, though I do not suggest that it excuses an error of this kind.  I have had this particular incident fully investigated and while again not suggesting that it provides an excuse for what happened, it is clear that there was a high degree of collusion between certain offenders in securing the release of the wrong individual.

      <P>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal is independent in the exercise of its functions.

      <P>A wide range of controls <Col N="643" /> designed to tackle the problem of under-age drinking is included in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  The primary purpose of those statutory controls is to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to lawfully purchase alcohol, or to be in possession of it or to consume it other than in a private residence.</P>
      <P>However, legislation alone cannot be expected to solve the problem of underage drinking.  A broader approach, having regard to the social, cultural and economic factors involved, is required. It is for this reason that I promote and encourage the idea of community-based initiatives and I have encouraged the Garda Síochána to become involved in organising and assisting such initiatives. The gardaí in co-operation with community groups are playing a prominent role in organising local and schools programmes to deal with the abuse of alcohol and other substances by young people and they are willing to help with such local initiatives wherever these are contemplated.  In this context I understand that there is active Garda participation in over 100 existing voluntary age card schemes which by and large are operating successfully.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to codify and update the Licensing Acts.</P>

      <P>In the context of the law and order package which I announced last December and my Department's policy document &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; a Five Year Plan&rdquo; published last June, there are a number of measures aimed at bringing about improvements in this area.  One is the introduction of the concept of positive <Col N="645" /> sentence management which will facilitate a move to planned and programmed releases, where justified and earned, under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service. Another is the development of more community sanctions and measures at the court stage.  The Government agreed to increase substantially the number of staff in the Probation and Welfare Service for these purposes &mdash; a total of 50 additional staff have been approved.</P>
      <P>The following measures are also incorporated in the five year plan: the development of community based Probation and Welfare Service facilities to manage offenders on release from custody before the expiry of sentences; the development of a formalised aftercare service; the provision of an enhanced Probation and Welfare Service to offenders while in custody.</P>
      <P>The plan also proposes significant improvements in other specialist services for those in custody including medical and psychiatric, welfare, psychology, education, work/training and chaplaincy.  Such services are designed not only to preserve the physical and mental well-being of those in custody, but also to have a positive effect in leading them towards a constructive crime-free life in the community on release.</P>

      <P>The ratio of prison officers to prisoners over the entire prison system is roughly 1:1.  For reasons of security, the disclosure of the breakdown of this figure by individual prison would not be in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the ratio is high by international standards, it must be borne in mind that Irish prisons are small and, therefore, the economies of scale that apply in large institutions abroad would <Col N="646" /> not apply here.  Most of the prison buildings are old and do not easily allow for the installation of modern surveillance and automated security systems and so substantive manpower is needed. Prison regimes in Ireland are also relatively liberal and the ratio of officers to prisoners permits greater periods of unlock for prisoners who can therefore participate in more recreational and educational activities than would normally be available internationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the new Garda false alarm policy in September 1992, approximately 94 per cent of the well over 250,000 alarm activations notified to the gardaí annually were false.  Responding to these calls involved a very substantial waste of Garda time and resources and it diverted those resources away from genuine alarm calls and other calls for Garda assistance.  The new policy, which includes the withdrawal of Garda response from monitored alarm systems which show a consistently unacceptable <Col N="647" /> level of false activations, has the aim of getting the owners of premises to take the remedial action necessary to improve the operation of their system.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that, since the introduction of the policy, the number of false calls in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, where the problem was at its greatest, has fallen from a monthly average of 12,880 to 8,033.  This has occurred despite the fact that there has been a substantial increase in new alarm installations during the same period.  It is expected that the success already experienced in the Dublin area will be mirrored in rural Divisions within a reasonable time. While of course there exists room for further improvement, I am satisfied that the problem is being brought under control and that the situation, which had been deteriorating for some time, has now been reversed.  The policy is being kept under on-going review and I will examine carefully any further proposals the Garda authorities might put to me in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>in view of information to the effect that funding under the new programme entitled Leonardo De Vinci for the period 1995 to 1999 is approximately £484 million and that this is a reduction in the funding originally proposed by the European Commission, the amount of money the European Commission originally discussed with Irish officials; the amount of money included in the National Plan that was submitted by the Irish Government for funds; his views on whether this is the reason for the reduction; if it was based on Ireland receiving £8 billion or based on the fact that we would receive something in the region of £6 billion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The total funding agreed for the Leonardo vocational training programme for the period 1 January, 1995 to 31 December 1999 is <Col N="660" /> approximately £484 million, to be divided between all member states.  The Leonardo programme amalgamates four existing programmes in the vocational training field &mdash; PETRA, FORCE, EUROTECNET and COMETT &mdash; which will cease to operate at the end of this year.  The funding available under Leonardo, while down from the figure of approximately £635 million originally proposed by the Commission, should allow existing levels of activity to be maintained.  Ireland's allocation from the Leonardo programme will not be clear until we have some idea of the projects that will be submitted to the Commission in the early part of 1995. Ireland's share of the funds in 1994, between the four existing programmes, will be approximately £4 million and we would expect to obtain at least a similar amount in 1995.</P>
      <P>Funding for the Leonardo programme will come from the EU Task Force on Human Resources, Education, Training and Youth which reports directly to the EU Commission.  This task force was formed to give an increased emphasis to education and training policies and is responsible at European level for the implementation of EU programmes in the Human Resources, Education, Training and Youth domain.</P>
      <P>Programmes funded by the task force are separate from the initiatives funded by the European Social Fund (ESF). The ESF provides funding for mainline vocational training programmes and community initiatives in the vocational training field and is under the responsibility of DG V. Figures submitted in the National Development Plan in the vocational training area refer to programmes which require ESF funding.</P>

      <P>Under the Basic research awards scheme, Forbairt provides annual funding for PhDs in the science and engineering disciplines.  A grant of £1,000 per annum for three years is provided to each graduate.  At present, Forbairt is supporting 520 students, while a further 166 new students are being funded from October 1994.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Programme in Advanced Technology (PATs) fund some 200 post graduate students in targeted research areas of specific interest to the PATs and their clients.</P>
      <P>The issue of funding for PhD students in science and technology is being considered by the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council which was established by my colleague the Minister for Commerce and Technology, Deputy Seamus Brennan, earlier this year.  The council will report before the end of the year and my Department will, on receipt, examine the recommendations it makes in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Building Societies Act, 1989, contains provisions which have resulted in the disqualification of joint account owners from benefiting from the free share offer provided by the Irish Permanent PLC in that it defines only one of the named joint account holders as eligible to benefit, resulting in disqualification where the named account holder is since deceased; and if he intends to introduce legislation to address this matter.</Quest>

      <P>The conversion of a building society into a public limited company must be done under a scheme drawn up in accordance with the Building Societies Act, 1989, and the building society's rules.  The scheme must be approved by the Central Bank.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that its interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act, supported by legal advice, is that only the first named holder of a joint account is the person entitled to vote on a conversion resolution and receive free <Col N="666" /> shares, and that this right does not automatically pass to the next holder in a joint account.  I am having the matter further examined in consultation with the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have powers under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, to make arrangements with approved voluntary bodies to provide accommodation, including emergency and residential accommodation, for homeless persons. My Department recoups 90 per cent of expenditure of a non-capital nature incurred by local authorities in contributing to voluntary bodies towards the cost of providing or arranging accommodation for homeless persons.  In 1993, my Department recouped £901,888 to local authorities and a provision of £1.2 million is included in my Department's Vote for 1994 for such expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> In addition, grants are paid by the Department in respect of the administrative and general expenses of certain approved organisations with representative, advisory, information, training or research functions in the housing area. A number of these organisations also provide services to homeless persons. The amount available for the payment of such grants in 1994 is £373,000.  Funding for the provision of outreach services for homeless persons is not a matter for local authorities or my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): The US dioxin study is part of a reassessment process being conducted in relation to dioxins by the US Environmental Protection Agency.  This reassessment is not due for completion before late 1995.  The study is now being made available by the US Environmental Protection Agency for public comment and for review by the agency's science advisory board.  No policy decisions are yet being proposed by the US authorities in response to the study. The study, and response to it from the <Col N="672" /> consultative process now underway, will be examined in Ireland and at EU level.</P>
      <P>Within the EU, strict limits on dioxin emissions are being imposed under a proposed directive on hazardous waste incineration, already agreed by Environment Ministers, and a proposed directive on non-hazardous waste incineration which is also being considered. These requirements will cover emissions from all incineration sources.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency has already prepared a draft specification reflecting these strict dioxin limits, and this will guide its licensing of relevant industrial and waste plants.  The Environmental Protection Agency has recently announced its intention to conduct a national baseline survey on dioxin levels, so that changes can be monitored over time. The collection of data is expected to be completed by the end of next year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 208 and 209 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report referred to acknowledges that much of the Lough Carra-Lough <Col N="673" /> Mask system is of a relatively pristine condition.  This is also the assessment of the ERU Report &ldquo;Water Quality in Ireland 1987-1990&rdquo; which classified Lough Mask as oligotrophic and Lough Carra as mesotrophic; both these classifications indicate that the lakes do not have eutrophic status.  More recent monitoring results from Mayo County Council confirm the generally good water quality of the two lakes.</P>
    <P>The major sewage discharge to Lough Mask is being addressed by the Ballinrobe sewerage scheme now under construction and due for completion in 1995 at a cost of some £9 million.  This will provide secondary treatment with phosphate removal for a population equivalent of 8,000.  In addition, the Hollymount sewerage scheme is about to commence and the Claremorris sewerage scheme is in planning; both these schemes will also provide secondary treatment with phosphate removal for significant sewage discharge to the River Robe and Lough Mask.</P>
    <P>The results of recent extensive monitoring carried out under the European Communities (Quality of Surface Water Intended for the Abstraction of Drinking Water) Regulation, 1989, indicate a high quality of drinking water in the Lough Mask-Lough Carra catchment, with full compliance with national and EU standards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 217 and 221 together.</P>
      <P>All officers on Irish-flagged ships must hold Irish certificates of compentency or equivalent certificates issued by the UK and a number of former Commonwealth countries with which Ireland has reciprocal recognition arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> Ratings or seamen of all nationalities may serve on Irish-flagged ships provided they are qualified seamen and hold watchrating certificates as laid down in the International Convention on Standards of Training.  Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW).  I am aware that ECS have proposals to employ non-EU nationals as ratings on the company's Irish-flagged ships.  The company will be obliged to ensure that non-EU nationals so employed meet the qualification requirements of the STCW Convention. In addition, conditions of seagoing employment must be such as to ensure compliance with the International Labour Organisation's Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards) Convention.  Compliance with these standards are checked as part of the annual survey.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the safety standards on the company's Irish-flagged ships which have been surveyed this year are satisfactory.  Each of the vessels holds internationally recognised maritime safety certificates covering, <i>inter alia,</i> construction, stability, equipment to include life-saving applicances and radio installations, crew manning levels and certification.</P>
    <P>ECS ships can also be subject to inspection by foreign states under the Paris Memorandum on Port State Control. Inspection ensures compliance with the standards laid down in all the relevant international maritime conventions.</P>
    <P>The EU has recently agreed a Directive on the Minimum Level of Training for Seafarers.  The purpose is to improve the application and enforcement of international training standards for all seafarers, irrespective of nationality, on board EU-registered ships or foreign ships entering Union ports, as well as to improve communication among multilanguage crews.  Ireland is already in full compliance with the terms of the directive which comes into force at the end of 1995.</P>

      <P>I understand that payment by BIM under the &ldquo;bad weather&rdquo; package for the fishing fleet amount to £1.885 million to date.  Disbursements have been made as follows: 304 payments to vessel owners who incurred financial losses, £1.321,000; 112 payments for losses of gear, £336,000 and 263 payments to crew members, £228,000.  Further claims totalling £576,000 are currently being processed and will be cleared once outstanding information such as tax certificates or social welfare returns has been received.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that all reasonable claims for assistance under the package are positively considered and that the available funding be used to the maximum extent possible to relieve genuine hardship.  I have directed that all outstanding claims be dealt with speedily and that the mechanisms for assessing claims should be such as to ensure that eligible applicants receive their full entitlements.</P>

      <P>The matter is linked to the current negotiations on the detailed implementing measures under the new framework regulation on fisheries <Col N="679" /> accession.  This was formally adopted by Council on a majority basis in May of this year.  Ireland alone voted against adoption of the regulation because of a number of specific concerns and, also, to give the strongest possible signal of the importance which Ireland attaches to the issue.</P>
      <P>The Commission's subsequent proposals on the implementing measures proved unacceptable to the Fisheries Council in September and the Presidency invited alternative proposals from member states.  The Irish proposal, in response, addresses our particular concerns and is designed to ensure that the system to be adopted will provide for effective control and the necessary future safeguards.</P>
      <P>A key element of our proposal addresses the need to give continued priority and protection to sensitive zones such as the Irish Box, given the fragility of stocks, the need to preserve balance between resources and fishing effort and taking account of the socio-economic needs of coastal communities particularly dependent on fishing.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on this issue will be difficult but I am determined, given the crucial importance of this issue for the Irish fishing industry, to ensure that the best possible outcome is secured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Current EU legislation stipulates that only drift nets up to 2.5 km may be used when fishing for tuna with the exception of certain vessels which had previously benefited from a derogation to use drift nets up to 5 km.  No Irish fishing vessels benefited from the <Col N="680" /> previous derogation and consequently Irish fishing vessels, presently engaged in the tuna fishery, are subject to the 2.5 km limitation.  One prosecution has been brought to date in respect of breaches of the 2.5 km limit.  The case in question has yet to come before the court.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Commission presented a proposal regarding the future of drift netting, which has the following elements: all drift netting, for tuna, salmon, and certain other species, to be phased out over a period of four years; during this four year period, nets of up to 2.5 km may be used, but their use must be reduced each year and boats which previously held the derogation to fish with nets up to 5 km may continue to do so, for 1994 only.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy can appreciate, the proposal caused much concern to me and a great number of my colleagues. The proposed phasing out of all drift netting for tuna and other species would have very serious implications for Irish fishermen involved in these particular fisheries.</P>
      <P>At the Fisheries Council on 28 September 1994 it was agreed that the matter be referred back for scientific evaluation prior to its being reconsidered again in Council, possibly in December. There is, in my view, no basis on fisheries grounds for the banning of drift netting for tuna.  There are, however, serious concerns internationally about the impact of this method of fishing on other marine species, in particular dolphins.</P>
      <P>I have pushed Ireland's case strongly on this issue to date at Council of Fisheries Ministers' level and in correspondence and meetings with the Commissioner and other Ministers.  I am determined to ensure in future negotiations that the long term interests of the Irish fishing industry will be secured and safeguarded to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <P>Apart from about 60 query cases, all applications for quota from the 1993 national reserve have been processed.  The person named has been allocated five premium rights from the special reserve for small scale milk producers and a further one premium right from the main 1993 suckler cow reserve.  His quota is, therefore, six premium rights.  As he has sufficient quota to allow full payment for the six eligible suckler cows he applied for under the 1993 suckler cow premium scheme, he can not be allocated further quota from the 1993 reserve.</P>
      <P>He has, however, applied for 1994 suckler cow premium in respect of 12 cows and he may apply to be considered for an allocation of quota from the 1994 national reserve to cover those extra cows.  Application forms for this reserve are expected to be available in the next few weeks and I have arranged to have one sent to him then.</P>

Accordingly, I have no function in the allocation of funds for 1993 and 1994 in respect of either the first or final headings in the table by Deputy Liam Burke.</P>
      <P>I assume that the tourism and marketing Initiative North America heading refers to the US Marketing Initiative, which was co-funded by the private sector and included a contribution of £0.5 million, together with £1.5 million in European Regional Development Fund funds, from my Department's tourism promotion and development fund.  This initiative is a promotional campaign intended to secure an increase in the overall number of US tourists visiting Ireland.  No particular region or airport is promoted through the initiative.</P>
      <P>As Shannon Development is responsible for developing the tourism sector in the Mid-West Region.  I allocated £3 million to Shannon Development over the two-year period 1993-94 for the promotion and development of tourism in the Mid-West Region.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for developing the tourism industry in the Cork region rests with Bord Fáilte which received a total allocation of over £43 million in the two-year period 1993-94. The operational programme for tourism which I launched recently will make a major investment in marketing Irish tourism.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> One priority area will be the development of a wider range of air and sea access services to Ireland.

Special priority will be given to assisting the marketing of additional capacity on existing routes and the development of new routes.</P>

      <P>Cork Airport is a very successful operation with facilities which match those of similar airports internationally. In the last ten years traffic through Cork Airport has more than doubled from 334,000 in 1984 to almost 800,000 in 1994.</P>
      <P>There has been major development of the terminal and associated facilities at a total cost of £17 million.  A further £12 million investment in airport infrastructure is planned.  Aer Rianta are also planning to develop a major business park at the airport.  Cork Airport for its size has now got facilities second to none.  I am determined to ensure that there is a return on this investment and that Cork Airport achieves its full potential.  To his end I requested Aer Rianta to set up a marketing consultative committee for Cork Airport, representative of local airport, tourism and travel interests, for the purpose of reviewing the overall marketing and promotional strategy for Cork Airport.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Open heart surgery operations for adults, including coronary artery by-pass grafts &mdash; CABGs &mdash; are currently <Col N="697" /> performed for public patients at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit in the Mater Hospital.  Dublin and at Cork Regional Hospital.  I understand that services are available for private patients at the Mater Private Hospital and the Blackrock Clinic.  With regard to the information requested concerning the Mater Private Hospital and the Blackrock Clinic, I would like to inform the Deputy that I have no function in this matter as these hospitals are private institutions.  Open heart surgery procedures which are performed by a cardio-thoracic consultant in a private capacity in a private hospital are outside of that consultant's commitment under the common contract.  However, it is understood that the private hospitals carry out approximately 700 open heart operations per annum.</P>
    <P>The cost of a CABG procedure is influenced by the complexity of the case &mdash; whether or not a catheter or valve is required &mdash; and individual procedures are not costed on a routine basis.  In general, however, the average CABG costs approximately £8,500.</P>
    <P>The number of coronary artery by-pass (CABG) procedures performed in the public hospital sector is set out in the following table:</P>

    <P>I should point out that, in addition to the coronary artery by-pass graft procedures, the two hospitals in the public sector also perform other open heart procedures.</P>
    <P>The number of patients currently on the waiting list for all open heart surgery in these two hospitals is 1,657. Deputies will appreciate that the scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgement of the consultant concerned, is based solely on the patient's <Col N="698" /> condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority.  Admission for open heart surgery in the public hospital service is determined having regard to the medical condition of patients and not on the basis of whether they are classified as public or private patients.  The further information requested by Deputy Kenneally in relation to patients waiting since 1992, 1991, 1990 and prior to 1990 is not readily available.  I will forward it directly to him as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office I have been concerned to ensure the expansion of existing facilities for cardiac surgery in the public hospital sector.  In 1993, I allocated a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the annual throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000 &mdash; an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994, I have provided capital funds which will facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
    <P>I have allocated in excess of £2 million in 1994 to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments. The development, which was completed recently, includes additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme.  These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced.</P>
    <P>The developments at the Mater Hospital, together with the developments in progress for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 and 281 together.</P>
      <P>I presume that Deputy McManus is referring to recent media coverage regarding the level of provision of accommodation for young homeless in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a small number of homeless children, particularly in the older age groups, are being placed by the Eastern Health Board in bed and breakfast accommodation.  I have been assured by the board that the number of youngsters involved has decreased significantly in recent weeks to about 10-15 per night.  This must be considered in the context of the total number of children in the care of the Eastern Health Board.  The board currently has 1,500 children in its care and also has a wide range of supports in place to enable hundreds of families to cope with children in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless the board is anxious to discontinue the use of bed and breakfast accommodation as quickly as possible. The board is pursuing a number of initiatives to increase the level of accommodation available for the children concerned.  In particular, the board is in the process of recruiting 50 families who would be prepared to take such children into their homes to care for them.  In the short term the board has <Col N="700" /> developed a day centre which gives care and support to children referred to bed and breakfast accommodation.  This centre provides a structured programme, staffed by a social worker and child care worker who also liaise with bed and breakfast proprietors.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Allen's question it is only homeless children who commit an offence who are dealt with under the juvenile justice system.  Some of these children are committed by the courts to detention in the special schools which operate under the aegis of the Minister for Education.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the decisions taken by the courts to place children in the special schools where this is considered necessary. However I would like to assure the House that we will continue our efforts to improve the availability of accommodation and support services for children who are homeless.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this policy, I have designated the Health Promotion Unit of my Department as a national breastfeeding resource centre, in order to ensure that more widespread information is available to women on breastfeeding.

On average the waiting period for admittance to the unit is 4-6 weeks. However there are exceptions to this. Groups with special needs e.g. pregnant women, patients referred from general hospitals following treatment for specific complaints or particularly chaotic patients are admitted as priority patients.  The average length of stay in the unit has increased for a number of reasons.  Primarily this is as a result of HIV/AIDS issues and having to detoxify intravenous drug misusers off concurrent abuse of benzodiazepines which can take several weeks.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is on the in-patient waiting list for orthopaedic treatment at Merlin Park Regional Hospital but it is not possible at this stage for the hospital authorities to give an admission date.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of hospital admissions is a matter for the consultant concerned and each case is assessed to determine medical priority.  Should the patient feel concerned that his condition has detriorated, he should return to his general practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of his case directly to the consultant.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, under the 1994 waiting list initiative, a total of £850,000 has been allocated to the Western Health Board for the provision of 1,222 additional procedures, including 109 orthopaedic procedures.  This should help to reduce the overall waiting time for patients in the specialties targeted.</P>
      <P>In addition, development funds of £400,000 were provided to the board this year for the expansion of orthopaedic services at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  As a result, approval has issued to the Western Health Board to recruit a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and a consultant anaesthetist together with the necessary support staff.</P>

      <P>On the advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board, which advises me on all matters relating to the quality, safety and efficacy of medical preparations, paracetamol tablets may only be sold through non-pharmacy outlets in packs containing not more than twenty-five (25) tablets and through pharmacies in packs not exceeding fifty (50) tablets. Quantities in excess of this may only be supplied if prescribed by the registered medical practitioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>While my Department does not routinely collect information on waiting times for treatment, the number of patients on in-patient waiting lists is regularly monitored throughout the year.  On coming into office I voiced my concern that, in a number of specialities including ENT, the waiting times for in-patient treatment were excessive.  To address this problem, the Government made £20 million available last year to reduce in-patient waiting lists.  As a result of this investment, the public in-patient waiting list for ENT treatment was more than halved, falling from 6,843 at 30 June 1993 to 3,124 by 31 December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the success of the 1993 waiting list initiative the Government <Col N="710" /> has committed a further £10 million in 1994 to allow the progress made in 1993 to be consolidated and to further reduce waiting times in specialities where waiting times for in-patient services are considered excessive.  Under the 1994 initiative it is planned to carry out a total of 2,637 additional ENT procedures over and above the normal level of activity and I am confident that this activity will allow further progress to be made in reducing the waiting times for such treatment.</P>

      <P>It is the experience here and in most developed countries that demand for orthodontic treatment exceeds real need where the service is provided free of charge.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, my Department has asked health boards to apply certain objective criteria in assessing degrees of priority of need for specialist orthodontic treatment on the basis of degree of handicap and severity of malocclusion. I am satisfied that these criteria continue to be fair and relevant, and not in need of review at this stage.</P>

      <P>My Department monitors in-patients waiting lists, including those for general surgery, on a regular basis and, as the Deputy will be aware, £20 million was made available last year to reduce waiting times in those specialities where waiting times were considered excessive. As a result of last year's initiative, the number of patients on the in-patient waiting list for general surgery was reduced from 5,913 at 30 June 1993 to 3,342 at 31 December 1993.  A further £10 million has been provided this year to build on the success of the 1993 initiatives and 1,920 additional general surgical procedures over and above the normal level of activity will be carried out as a result of this investment, allowing further progress to be made towards reducing waiting times in this area.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific case raised by the Deputy, I understand that her name was placed on the routine waiting list for surgery on 1 February last, and has been given a number of provisional admission dates since that time.  Regrettably it has proved necessary to cancel the planned admission on each occasion as all beds were occupied by more urgent cases.  I understand that the patient has now been given a further provisional admission date for 9 November next and the hospital will make every effort to ensure that the patient's admission is not cancelled on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While every effort is made to ensure that provisional admission dates are adhered to, the Deputy will appreciate that the admission of a patient to hospital is a matter for the consultant <Col N="713" /> concerned and urgent cases must always be accorded priority.  Should the patient referred to by the Deputy be concerned about her position she should return to her gereral practitioner who will be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of the case directly to her consultant.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the subvention scheme provided for by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 is to ensure that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
      <P>I understand that the case referred to by the Deputy involves an individual who was resident in the nursing home prior to September 1993.  In such cases section 10.5 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 permits health boards to abate the subvention payable by reference to payments being made on the persons behalf on the day the Act came into force, 1 September 1993, regardless of the source.  These payments are not limited to immediate family members.</P>

      <P>The governing bodies of the NUI Colleges i.e., UCD, UCG and UCC, are appointed in accordance with their respective statutes.  These statutes do not provide for any function for the Minister for Education in relation to appointment.  However, there is provision, for the Government to nominate four out of 34 members in the case of UCD and three out of 28 in UCC and three out of 26 in UCG.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that, for historical reasons, the governing bodies or governing boards of the universities are appointed under various Acts and statutes I propose to <Col N="719" /> review the whole situation in the context of the forthcoming White Paper.</P>
    <P>With regard to the third-level grants, the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support reported to me on 11 November 1993.  Arising from my consideration of the committee's report I have already implemented a number of improvements in the student support arrangements such as: the abolition of the separate attainments for eligibility for a grant; this will ensure that all students who have secured a college place will now qualify for a grant subject to their meeting the means test; the introduction of new rules for second chance cases; this is to ensure students who did not complete their initial studies will be eligible to apply for grants for second chance courses after five years; the provision of a discretionary budget in 1994 so as to set up a hardship fund with the third-level institutions, and an increase in the income limits in line with the rise in the average industrial wage and in maintenance grants in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>Subject to resource constraints I intend to continue to develop the schemes of student support particularly with a view to rendering them as equitable as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 298 and 301 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's primary objective in any area is to ensure that there are sufficient pupil places available overall to meet the demand.  There are sufficient pupil places available in schools in the general area for all Cabra pupils seeking entry to postprimary education in September 1995.</P>
      <P>It is not possible for my Department to ensure that pupils will be enrolled in a particular school of their choice. Enrolment policy is essentially a matter for the managerial authorities of each post-primary school subject to the application of certain criteria. I am particularly concerned to ensure that academic ability should not be used as a determining factor for entry to schools and that schools disclose their enrolment policy and the criteria used in selecting pupils for entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> It has been established from the authorities of St. Dominic's College that the school is currently finalising enrolment for September 1995 and would hope to offer some places to pupils from Christ the King girls' national school.</P>
    <P>It is understood also that an application form issued last May to one of the pupils referred to in the details supplied by Deputy Mitchell and that the form has not been returned.  Another pupil's application was received after the closing date and, therefore, was not considered.  A further pupil was refused entry on the basis that her home address was outside the area catered for by the school.  No decision has been taken regarding the remaining applicant.</P>
    <P>The planning section of my Department has held meetings with the managerial authorities of Christ the King national school and the post-primary school in question.  My Department will be in contact with both managements shortly in the matter.</P>

      <P>The children concerned already have free transport on an existing service operating to Ballyweelin-Magharaw national school, coming from the Ballyconnell closed school area.</P>
      <P>The family is seeking an extension to this service which, if allowed, would give the children a home pick-up.  I am advised that the family in question live 0.9 miles from the current pick-up point. Therefore they are considered to have a reasonable and adequate standard of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main objectives of the primary school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live a long distance from school <Col N="725" /> and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly. Because of the cost, a door-to-door service cannot be a feature of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department met recently with representatives of the Kildare Teacher Centre and were presented with a submission on the <Col N="732" /> question of formal recognition for the centre as part of the national network of teacher centres.  The submission is being examined in the context of proposals on the future development and organisation of the overall network, and the responses to a discussion paper issued recently on the matter to the Association of Teacher Centres in Ireland.  No decisions will be made until the consultative process has been completed.</P>
      <P>In developing the overall network, the location of centres will be determined by reference to the need for all schools to have access to a centre within a reasonable distance; the cost effectiveness of the overall network, the spread of teacher/school population within catchment areas, teacher interest and local needs.  The strengthening of the network of teacher centres is a critical element in the strategy to enhance the quality and responsiveness of educational provision at the first and second levels of the system.</P>

      <P>My Department no longer sanctions permanent new caretaker posts in primary schools under the original scheme which provided for such posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of caretaking services in schools is now addressed by a scheme of additional capitation grants introduced on foot of a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provided for a <Col N="733" /> phased programme to expand the provision for caretaking and clerical services to all national schools with 100 pupils upwards.</P>
    <P>Phase 1 of this programme was introduced in September, 1992 and targeted schools with enrolments of 500 pupils or more which did not have caretaking and/or clerical services already.  Phase 2, implemented in September, 1993, using the same criteria, catered for schools with 400 plus pupils, as well as making provision for schools in designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>It is likely that the enrolment of St. Brigid's School will qualify the school for inclusion in the next phase due this autumn.  My Department will be in contact with the school authority shortly in that regard.</P>

      <P>As a result of these appointments, a total of 75 home school liaison co-ordinators are now in place and serve a total of 134 primary schools embracing 41,000 pupils.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> An additional ten post-primary schools came into the scheme in the 1993-94 school year and an additional fifteen schools were included in 1994-95. As a result, a total of fifty home school community liaison co-ordinators are currently in place at second level and serve a total of fifty post-primary schools embracing 29,000 pupils.</P>
    <P>The home school liaison scheme is targeted on schools in disadvantaged areas.  Schools are selected for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of priority of need as assessed by my Department's Inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The objective of the scheme is to address the problems of under-achievement and poor participation in the education system, by encouraging parents to become more interested and involved in their children's education and by encouraging closer links between parents and their local schools.</P>
