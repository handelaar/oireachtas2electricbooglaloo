      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, the ESRI Medium-Term Review 1994-2000 paints the brightest and most inspiring prospects for the Irish economy since the 1960s. We will have to work hard to realise some of the forecasts, and even harder to improve on the key one, that for unemployment. There are no grounds for complacency.</P>
      <P>The ESRI's principal positive projections are: an annual average growth rate of around 5 per cent from 1995 to 2000; a net rise in employment of 130,000 from 1,146,000 to reach the highest level in more than 40 years; steady low inflation at slightly over 2 per cent; a continuing balance of payments surplus, even after a period of high growth; a reduction of the debt-GDP ratio to less than 60 per cent by the year 2000, making our debt burden more sustainable; a substantial improvement in living standards and elimination of our current budget deficit by 1996 after 23 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only real downside in the review is its projection that, despite high economic growth and high employment growth, unemployment by the year 2000 will still be around 266,000 on a live register basis or 18 per cent of the workforce, even <Col N="718" /> though we are already experiencing the first significant drop in unemployment since 1990.  That figure is equivalent to about 200,000 or 13.4 per cent of the workforce on the internationally standard labour force basis of calculation.</P>
    <P>The ESRI expresses its bottom line in the following terms: &ldquo;The central forecast suggests a period of substantial progress in improving living standards over the next decade.  Ireland will have the capacity, if it has the will, to address its most basic problem, that of unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before discussing these projections, I would like to pay a warm tribute to the ESRI, to its director, Dr. Kieran Kennedy, to John FitzGerald, Sara Cantillon and John Curtis, who worked on the medium-term review, and their predecessors, for their remarkable contribution over many years to a better understanding of our economy.  Economics is not always viewed as a humane science.  It can be, and has sometimes been, the precise opposite.  The ESRI's reviews, however, always seem to be inspired by humane values, and by a real concern for the human consequences of economic policy.  They are remarkably free of any obvious ideological bias, either to the left or the right.</P>
    <P>As the ESRI would be the first to point out, it does not claim to be an infallible prophet.  There are far too many complex factors, some of them almost impossible to foresee, which may affect our economy over the next six years, to allow their projections to be regarded as offering any certainties.  This does not diminish the usefulness of the exercise, which is to project, on the basis of a reasonable assessment of present and forseeable trends, the most likely outcome.  It gives policy-makers the opportunity, where they are dissatisfied with projected results, to try to improve on them in reality.  We have done so in the recent past.</P>
    <P>Thus, it would be quite wrong to believe the ESRI is being generally overoptimistic. For instance, in the 1986-90 outlook, a public sector borrowing requirement of about £1.6 billion was <Col N="719" /> foreseen in 1990.  As the result of more rapid correction in the public finances from 1987 onwards, the 1990 PSBR was less than half that.  In the December 1987 review, employment was projected to stagnate for five years, because of the assumed deflationary effects of correcting the public finances.  Net employment grew by more than 50,000, leading to the discovery of a new economic paradox, called expansionary fiscal contraction.</P>
    <P>More recently, not foreseeing the depth of the international recession, the ESRI was more optimistic about unemployment post-1991 than events have justified. Perhaps, it is over-compensating in the other direction now.  In most respects, its recent mid-term reviews have given a reliable guide to economic development.  Its projections on employment growth have been remarkably accurate. Its view on inflation and the balance of payments has been vindicated.  It has been broadly right on the healthy condition of the public finances, if somewhat over-optimistic about when we would move into budget surplus.</P>
    <P>While the ESRI has a good track record, its real service is to help us to understand where we are, and where we are likely to be going, on present trends. By pointing up factors that need attention, its projections can act as a spur for an improved performance, which, if brought about, would invalidate its own projections.</P>
    <P>Keen observers will have noted that these latest ESRI medium-term projections, particularly on growth, employment, and the debt-GDP ratio, are more optimistic than those published in our National Development Plan last autumn. Employment would, depending on assumptions, be between 14,000 and 44,000 higher over the priod, and average annual growth would be more than 1 per cent higher.</P>
    <P>The intervening six months since September last have shown that the economy is performing better than anticipated. The 1993 budget outturn exceeded target.  Net growth in employment was <Col N="720" /> projected in this year's budget at 21,000 rather than the increase in non-agricultural employment of between 12 and 18,000 projected in the plan.  GDP growth in the budget was set at 4 per cent rather than 3.5 per cent.  This too is now likely to be exceeded.</P>
    <P>Recent statistics suggest that we are entering a period of buoyant growth.  In January and February of this year, the value of retail sales rose in terms of annual change by 12.9 per cent and 8.9 per cent respectively.  New car sales were up 70 per cent this January.  For the first time since 1980, growth over the next few years will be driven strongly by domestic consumer demand as well as by exports. In other words, we will have our economy firing on all cylinders.  This is bound to be good for jobs, especially in the domestic sector of the economy.  The trade figures for the first eight months of last year showed a surplus of £2.9 billion, which means that we were well on the way to a £4 billion plus trade surplus last year.</P>
    <P>In short, the ESRI is starting from a much stronger base than the plan last autumn.  Better results should assist us in finding the resources to implement the National Development Plan as fully as possible, with increased revenue buoyancy in parallel with continued progress on tax reductions, not net increases in tax rates as Opposition parties claim, helping to offset any shortfall in EU funding.</P>
    <P>The very positive outlook for the rest of the 1990s did not happen just by chance or some undeserved stroke of good fortune.  It is in my opinion attributable to three factors: first, the national consensus between the social partners maintained for over six years, and now into the third programme, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, with its particular impact on competitveness in the broadest sense; second, the Government's prudent and effective management of our economy through the recent international recession and the currency crisis; and, third, the dramatic improvement in our economic health, achieved by decisive Government action in the late 1980s.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> The ERSI repeats several times that the Irish economy has become more competitive. From 1960 to 1980, Ireland lost competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK, and in the 1970s and early 1980s <i>vis-à-vis</i> EU countries as well.  It states that between 1986 and 1989 the competitive position of Irish firms <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK improved significantly, and that this gain has been broadly retained.  It envisages a small but steady improvement in competitiveness over the rest of the decade.  They say that the underlying competitiveness of the economy has been masked by the fall-out from German unification and the related downturn in the EU economy.  The ESRI states:</P>
    <P>In our Central Forecast we have made quite a conservative assessment of the ability of the Irish manufacturing sector to take advantage of the position. It may well prove possible to expand output and employment more rapidly than we have suggested.</P>
    <P>The ESRI states that if wages can be kept in line with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, employment growth could be greater than projected. It positively assumes that wage bargaining behaviour will proceed much as it has in the last five or ten years, and not as it did before then, when all productivity gains were soaked up by wage increases.</P>
    <P>I know that some Deputies opposite, influenced by some right-wing commentators, are highly critical of our social partnership approach, but in my opinion, it is demonstrably one of the main factors which has totally transformed our economic prospects.</P>
    <P>The second factor underlying our improved prospects has been our prudent management of the economy during the recent recession.  Ireland is the only EU country to have maintained significant economic growth, despite Britain experiencing the deepest recession since the war.  We succeeded in maintaining previous employment gains.  The positive point made by the ESRI is that employment gains made in the 1990s should be sustainable, unlike those of the late <Col N="722" /> 1970s.  Also, we did not allow our public finances to deteriorate outside the 3 per cent Maastricht limit, in contrast to many other EU countries.</P>
    <P>The achievement of a dramatic fall in interest rates last year shows that the currency crisis and its aftermath were well handled.  The cautious budgetary policies of 1993 were amply vindicated. The benefits of the fall in interest rates far outweighed the 1 per cent levy.  Inflation, which was one obvious danger following devaluation, was successfully held down. Since last September, the Irish pound has been consistently the strongest currency in the ERM grid.  The <i>Financial Times</i> described our performance at the beginning of 1994 as &ldquo;one of the most attractive stories around&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the success of this partnership Government that, taking over in a difficult situation at the height of the currency crisis and with unemployment over 300,000, we stabilized the threat, we resumed economic progress and set Ireland en route for the most positive economic prospects in decades. As the ESRI points out the transformation of the public finances, and the steady reduction in the relative size of our debt will reduce our vulnerability to economic upsets in future years.</P>
    <P>We must never forget the lessons of the past 20 years.  We are still coping with the legacy of the mistakes made between 1973 and 1986.  We did not maintain a tight grip following EC entry in 1973, and the short-lived agriculture-led bonanza. There was a naïve belief in a crude version of Keynesian economics, with the new phenomenon of current budget deficits and foreign borrowing being greeted as if they were the discovery of Eldorado.  A large increase in public sector employment was never going to stimulate the private sector.  Subsequent efforts to maintain employment by counter-cyclical measures only exacerbated the problem.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, for a long time after we had identified our mistakes, we were totally ineffective in correcting them.  The policy of large tax increases, especially in indirect tax, in several budgets from July <Col N="723" /> 1981 on, in a vain attempt to avoid the hard choices of public expenditure cuts, destroyed confidence.  The country wasted four or five previous years floundering and without any clear direction, while other countries forged ahead.</P>
    <P>What Peter Bacon in the 1986 ESRI Medium-Term Outlook called &ldquo;a period of appalling economic performance in Ireland&rdquo;, was an aberration which must never be repeated.  Since we bit the bullet and cut public expenditure by over ten percentage points of GNP, we have never looked back.  Encouragingly, the ESRI foresee public expenditure as a percentage of GNP falling steadily to the year 2005, despite some modest growth in its volume.  Tax revenue is also a lesser proportion of GNP than some years ago.</P>
    <P>Better economic prospects do not entitle us to relax financial discipline in any major way.  There will be no public spending spree.  Tax cuts in the right places are just as effective a method of promoting economic justice among many of the lower income groups as increased State spending.  If we can reduce unproductive State spending, on servicing the national debt or unemployment payments, through more unemployed people getting jobs, then it is legitimate to switch part of those proceeds into improved public services.  That is what we have being doing over the recent past.  We also have a duty to see that pensioners and the less well off share in the benefits of growth and prosperity.  I am all in favour of doing more to help the most disadvantaged groups in our society, but not by a general rise in spending.  </P>
    <P>Extreme prudence is required, so that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past. One of those mistakes is to assume, even on as good authority as the ESRI, steady high growth into the indefinite future.  Economic cycles, external shocks are capable of disrupting progress for several years without notice, and we have to build that possibility into our policies.</P>
    <P>With 290,000 unemployed, we must do everything possible and sensible to reduce that number.  The clear definite <Col N="724" /> downward trend this year is encouraging and we have already been able to lower our forecast average number of unemployed this year by 4,000 since the budget.  What we need are well-targeted policy measures, not a general relaxation of spending controls and still less expansionary measures that would stoke an unsustainable boom.  The best way to prolong good economic conditions is for Governments to be prudent and restrained.</P>
    <P>In assessing any policy adjustments to be made all these realities must be taken into account.  I am determined that we will not blow it in the 1990s the way we did in the 1970s and for much of the 1980s as well.  This is the chance for Ireland to make a real economic breakthrough, if we play our cards right.</P>
    <P>Some critics of the National Development Plan, including the leader of the Progressive Democrats, have suggested we should use EU funding to pay off the national debt, something that we are not allowed to do directly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Interestingly, the ESRI conclude that is what we have been doing.  The rapid increase in the balance of payments surplus means that &ldquo;as a nation we have effectively saved the transfers and used them to pay off debts in order to increase the long term competitiveness of the economy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to two of the projections in the ESRI review we can do significantly better.  These are the anticipated degree of EU convergence, and the level of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the latest EU figures, Ireland's GDP per head has risen from 65 per cent of the EU average in 1985 to 71 per cent in 1990 and 77.4 per cent in 1993.  This is the EU's principal yardstick of economic performance which shows that we have clearly outperformed all other member states.  We have now overtaken Spain.  We have succeeded in maintaining progress not only in the good times of the late 1980s but through the international recession as well.  As the <Col N="725" /> 1994 annual report of the EU Commission points out: &ldquo;Of the four poorest Community countries only Ireland was able to achieve a positive growth rate of economic activity in 1993 and this improves its relative position&rdquo;.  Assuming an EU of 16 countries, the ESRI forecast that we will achieve a level of 82 per cent by the year 2000.  Given rapid progress to date the figure of 82 per cent is much too low.  I accept that GNP rather than GDP represents a more accurate measure of Irish living standards but GNP, too, shows the trend going in the same direction, starting from a lower base.</P>
    <P>We should also note the ESRI's view that &ldquo;if EU transfers are gradually phased out after the year 2000, this will not have a significant effect on current living standards, nor will it put at risk the increase in output that is taking place&rdquo;. While that is not a proposition I could easily subscribe to, it would be a remarkable tribute to the strength of our economy.</P>
    <P>The major policy issue arising from the ESRI review, undoubtedly, is how to further improve our performance in job creation and to tackle effectively the problem of long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made on tax reform in recent years with long term beneficial effects.  From my time as Minister for Finance we have successfully overseen the implementation of self-assessment and a large reduction of rates both of income tax and VAT as well as securing a much higher contribution from corporation tax, four times higher than in 1986.  We are phasing in a number of important reforms to broaden the revenue base: the reduction of mortgage interest and VHI relief to the standard rate on grounds of equity and the elimination already of relief on life assurance; the taxation of short term benefits, which will have a positive effect on employment and the extension of full PRSI to future public servants.</P>
    <P>All of this helps us to broaden the standard rate tax band, take more low earners out of the tax net altogether, reduce the tax burden generally and <Col N="726" /> PRSI on low-paid employments.  All of that is vital for pay moderation.  High economic growth will increase the scope both for tax reform and tax reduction. The ESRI envisage that direct tax revenue will fall by over 3 per cent as a percentage of GNP by the end of the century.  I want to see Ireland revert to being the low tax economy that it was up until the end of the 1960s.  Among the tasks that lie ahead are to integrate more closely the tax and social welfare systems and to further reduce the tax wedge.</P>
    <P>Tax reform has an important role to play in employment creation but it is not a panacea, as the ESRI points out.  Public debate has shown all too clearly that with regard to tax reform, the Opposition parties will the end but not the means. Disgraceful levels of political opportunism have been displayed by parties that want the Government to incur the political odium for controversial reforms that they themselves have advocated in their more intellectually honest moments in the past.  As of now, their tax reform credentials are non-existent.</P>
    <P>A second essential, not sufficiently emphasised in the ESRI review and one to which I am particularly attached is the creation of a positive enterprise-friendly environment for the formation and sustenance of small businesses whether in manufacturing or the services sector.  We went some distance in this year's budget to create a better business environment in line with many of the recommendations of the task force on services. We need to think through the implications of promoting growth in services which are much less favourably treated in the tax code than manufacturing, despite their often greater job-creating potential. Within the service sector we will particularly encourage tourism and international services.</P>
    <P>However, unemployment is far too high for us to contemplate scaling down our efforts to attract inward investment which can still make a bigger and more immediate impact than any other development in many parts of the country. The ESRI foresee a rise of nearly 28,000 in manufacturing over the next <Col N="727" /> four years, half of it in the traditional sectors and half in high-tech industry. At last, there will be balanced growth between them.</P>
    <P>We must improve the efficiency of our basic services.  We have taken tough but necessary decisions to rebalance telecommunications charges, about which little is heard today despite last year's political furore and An Post is back in profit without increasing charges.  We took decisions to secure the future of Aer Lingus and the transatlantic service, including the future of Shannon.</P>
    <P>We must take account of changes in the international competitive environment and we should do what is necessary to enable our State companies to thrive including entry into partnerships or strategic alliances.  Pragmatic consideration of the national interest and of the interest of companies and those who work in them must take precedence over other considerations.  While all proposals must be thoroughly examined, I have seen too often in the past, in the case of Irish Steel, for example, potentially valuable partnerships disappear into thin air because of dithering and a lack of understanding of business the essence of which is a willingness to undertake risk.</P>
    <P>We must make a huge effort to reintegrate the long term unemployed into the workforce and to end marginalisation of particular areas, both urban and rural, and disadvantaged groups.  The area partnerships developed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and now being expanded are a concentrated effort to tackle disadvantage. The concept is a distinctive contribution by the social partners strongly endorsed by the Government.  The Community Employment Programme which will provide participation for 40,000 this year is designed to gain the unemployed a chance to do worthwhile work and to give valuable work experience. Better education and training are necessary to ensure that we have a more fully qualified workforce and this is stressed by the ESRI.  We also need continuous retraining to renew and develop <Col N="728" /> the skills of workers.  The objective under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is to have 100,000 participants in the full range of work experience, education and training programmes who will be working to improve their prospect of access to sustainable employment and enterprise and, in the process, participating in the development of their own areas.</P>
    <P>We should be delighted that we have now given ourselves a clear run at making a major economic breakthrough by the end of the century.  It is already happening. We are now well placed to gather the fruits of economic restraint and sound economic management.  We are ready to start the large scale investment under the national plan, the biggest investment programme in the history of the State.  Confidence and consumer spending is rapidly improving.  We must make the most of our opportunity. Opportunity comes to pass and not to pause.</P>
    <P>We are now entering a period of reducing unemployment; reducing taxation; rising standards of living and better care for the disabled and the less well off.</P>
    <P>We will see out the remainder of the decade with a much stronger and more prosperous economy than anyone ever dreamt about in the past two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Taoiseach's response to the ESRI report.  His speech was self-congratulatory in tone and did not face up to the difficult strategic issues set out in Chapter V of the &ldquo;Medium Term Review.&rdquo;  If one was giving marks out of ten for the efforts being taken to deal with the issues raised in the ESRI report, the Taoiseach would get very low marks. This report raises many issues which need to be seriously addressed.  Although the ESRI points to a very good economic background against which policy decisions can be made in the coming years, it clearly points out that very serious policy decisions have to be addressed.  There is no indication that the Taoiseach has faced up to these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred briefly to what <Col N="729" /> needed to be done in the area of tax reform and gave no indication of what was envisaged.  The ESRI points out that conditions during the next five years will provide a marvellous opportunity to address tax reform issues, a point which seems to have been missed by the Taoiseach. The ESRI has set challenging targets on how to improve our debt-GNP ratio and achieve a zero borrowing requirement within five years.  The Taoiseach has given no indication as to whether the Government intends to take these targets on board or whether it believes this is the correct way to proceed.</P>
    <P>The ESRI challenges the Government to adopt a much more aggressive competition policy.  There has been a distinct unwillingness by the Government to address the area of competition.  We were promised in the Moriarty report that the Department of Enterprise and Employment would put forward proposals on competition in the non-traded sector of our economy by October 1993, but they have not yet emerged.  The Government is very strong on producing reports but very weak in addressing policy issues.</P>
    <P>It must be very disturbing for anyone reading the ESRI report to see how the Government has mistaken institutional change for policy change, particularly in the area of employment and enterprise. Since the Government's so-called programme of reform began approximately 12 months ago we have seen the spawning of new industrial agencies and county enteprise boards while the local enterprise and Leader programmes have remained intact.  The Taoiseach should have adverted to the section in the ESRI report which states: &ldquo;It looks like there has been a wasteful and destructive proliferation of grant giving bodies in the local development area&rdquo;.  This is a very important point.</P>
    <P>If we had three or four industrial bodies I believe the first cry by the Government would be that they should be consolidated into one body.  Instead of addressing the policy defects which have been manifest in the IDA's failure to help indigenous industry, the Government <Col N="730" /> has decided to split the IDA into three new bodies.  The crucial point is that no indication has been given of the policies to be pursued which will support indigenous industry.  The Government promised in the Moriarty report that it would bring forward proposals to create seed capital for Irish industry.  Yet there has been a deafening silence from the Government on this issue &mdash; there are no new policies.  On the question of the grants available to industry to take on technical graduates, the money for this purpose will have run out by June this year and companies looking for aid under those schemes are being told by the Department that no money is available. The Government seems to be unable to progress from the setting up of bodies to setting out the policy which must be pursued.  This could prove to be a major problem in the future.  The ESRI warnings in this regard must be taken very seriously.</P>
    <P>The ESRI points out that while the Government appears to have taken on board the warning by Culliton that we must move away from grant giving dependency it has failed to do so in the National Plan; instead of providing venture capital, which is much more cost effective, and reducing the need to provide direct grant aid, the National Plan gives no indication that the Culliton recommendations in this crucial area have been taken on board by the Government. The report gives a clear warning that the Government's pronouncements about policy are not reflected in what it is doing on the ground.  The Government seems to be bereft of ideas on how to achieve what Culliton said we must do, to move from dependence on foreign industry and provide more support for indigenous industry.  The Government appears to have decided not to pursue the strategy of developing our indigenous industry while squeezing the budgets available for foreign industry.  The decision has nothing to do with the fact that this is a high risk strategy &mdash; one must be willing to take risks and wait for returns &mdash; but with the fact that the <Col N="731" /> Government has no policies with which to back up this shift in direction.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report points out areas of opportunities.  In facing into an era of high economic growth we must reflect on what happened during the last period of high economic growth.  During the 1980s our level of economic growth was high compared to other EU countries.  For example, our level of GDP grew by 36 per cent between 1983-91, one and a half times the level of growth in the European Union.  However, during the same period the increase in employment here was only one-eighth of that achieved in the rest of the European Union.  We have a deplorable record in turning high economic growth into employment.  Our failure to address this issue is a fatal flaw.  The ESRI has issued a clear warning that if there is no change in policy the benefits of the next economic boom will accrue to those in safe and secure employment and will not trickle down to the unemployed.  The Taoiseach has not yet addressed this point.</P>
    <P>The ESRI points out that even after this period of exceptional growth up to the end of the decade, the number on the live register will have been reduced only by 36,000 while the level of unemployment will be approximately 260,000. Even worse, it indicates that, on present policies, there will be no change in the number of long term unemployed; in other words, the number of people unemployed for a year or longer will remain static until the end of the decade.  If we do not formulate policies which will get to grips with the crucial problem of long term unemployment we will have failed 21 per cent of the workforce.  We must implement new policies in this area.</P>
    <P>The ESRI makes other points in this regard.  It is highly critical in its &ldquo;Medium Term Review&rdquo; of our strategies to date in dealing with unemployment.  It points out specifically that the most important missing element in the human resources programme is a focus on targeted action in initial education to prevent early failure and drop out.  This is the critical issue facing many young people today.  Last <Col N="732" /> year 5,000 of our young people left school with no qualification and another 11,000 with qualifications plainly defective in the modern economy to which we aspire. That is 16,000 young people out of a cohort of 60,000.  Virtually a quarter of our young people are leaving school not equipped for the challenges facing a modern economy.  We are building up a problem for ourselves in this respect.</P>
    <P>The ESRI in its report has plainly pointed out that the National Plan failed to address this.  I should have expected the Taoiseach to have alerted us to the changes the Government perceive as necessary in the National Plan to deal with this critical problem.  If one takes an annual figure of 16,000 school leavers, over five years that amounts to almost 100,000 young people clearly at risk of becoming long term unemployed.  That is the challenge the Taoiseach failed to address in his response to this report.  We need proper strategies in place to head-off early school leavers with low qualfications. As the ESRI pointed out we need proper strategies to deal with people who become redundant so that they do not slide into periods of unemployment leading to long term unemployment. We do not have those stategies in place.</P>
    <P>The ESRI is critical of the overall way we have handled the human resources programme in so far as the community employment and FÁS programmes are concerned.  The Taoiseach spoke glowingly of the community employment programme. It appears he did not read the section of the ESRI report that states quite plainly there is insufficient improvement over the old social employment scheme in this new approach.  I predict that comment will be endorsed by the National Economic and Social Forum when they report on this issue.  The ESRI clearly recognises that what we are doing by way of these community employment programmes, though they are welcome, is locking people into a very low grade and intermittent employment.  If we want to address the issues facing the long term unemployed we must implement programmes that adequately raise their skill <Col N="733" /> levels, which produce opportunities for the long term unemployed to avail of conventional employment, not the intermittent, roll-over of various types of community employment schemes.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report also challenges us to face the changing demographics in our community.  They say quite plainly that we face into a period when we will have a growing, ageing population, with a rapidly declining child population.  They predict a decline of 23 per cent in the number of children under 15, which will be counter-balanced by a growing age dependency, and point out that we need to build up assets to deal with the pension requirements of that growing aged community. I should have expected some thinking from Government on how we could handle this issue.  It means we must set aside resources &mdash; particularly in the public sector where we do not fund our pensions &mdash; and think about how we shall fund those pensions in ensuing years,</P>
    <P>Equally, the report points to changes in the pattern of work generally.  We must embrace the overall concept of work sharing and flexible working hours, in a much more open way than we have done to date if we are to allow people to combine working and child rearing.</P>

      <P>To return to the ESRI report we are discussing, the Government's response, as enunciated by the Taoiseach, demonstrates little real commitment to examine the policy issued raised in the report, apart from the Taoiseach congratulating himself that we are now on the verge of a period of high growth.  That is a serious defect.</P>
      <P>I might return to the issue of youth employment since a very high number of young people leave our schools annually without adequate qualifications.  Few people realise the scale of unemployment those young school leavers face.  On the basis of the most recent figures it is estimated that five thousand young people who leave school each year with no qualification experience 62 per cent unemployment. We do not have a policy to get to grips with that issue.  Even those with intermediate and group certificates face almost 40 per cent unemployment.  That is the prospect for a quarter of our school leavers, with little hope of any improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> It is interesting that the ESRI in its report points to the Portuguese as having achieved convergence to European standards, not through very rapid growth in wages and rising unemployment, but through a much slower convergence of their wage rates, thus avoiding the problems of rising unemployment.  Perhaps we should ask the ESRI to explore the success of the Portuguese and how they achieved it.</P>
    <P>It is important also to look to the sectors in which we expect growth.  The ESRI predicts some employment growth in coming years, 1 to 1.5 per cent, which would translate into 10,000 to 15,000 new net jobs.  This would still fall short of the natural increase in our labour force, so it appears they are still banking on emigration as the safety valve.  Nonetheless it is important to look at job projections. It is predicted that in the first period, to the year 2000, growth will take place in market services.  It is predicted that the growth in service employment will be seven times that of manufacturing in the period 1990 to 1995 and somewhat less, two and a half times, in the second period.  That clearly points to the services sector as the major area of potential.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that, although the Taoiseach commissioned a Task Force on Services, in his remarks today he has shown no commitment to changing the tax deal for the services sector.  The overall position in the services sector is chronic.  They face 21 per cent PRSI, typically 21 per cent VAT and 40 per cent tax on their profits.  Many people struggling to keep a business together in the services sector find that of the £ they take in across the counter for the service they provide, they have left approximately three pence to keep their business going, the Government having gone off with 60 pence.  There is no way in which the golden goose of employment, namely the market services sector, can continue to realise its potential if we continue to impose that type of tax burden on them. That is an issue that has been faced by the Task Force on Services.  They have put it to us that we must reform the PRSI <Col N="736" /> and the corporate tax systems as they bear on services.  Sadly there has been no response from Government in this area.</P>
    <P>Recently when I questioned the Taoiseach on the European Commission decision that we must cut our employment taxes by 1 per cent to 2 per cent of GDP, i.e. 2 per cent to 4 per cent of the burden on the wage bill, he responded that the Government was not committed to that.  He refused to commit himself to what the European Commission has set as its target.  That is very disappointing because the Commission has shown in its document on growth and competitiveness that if we did that we could reduce our unemployment rate by up to 4 per cent.  That would be a major improvement.  Even after this bonanza of growth the ESRI note that we will not have achieved that 4 per cent reduction in unemployment.  It goes back to the net issue.  There are fundamental policy changes that we must make if we are to address the employment issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the issue of work sharing and the opening up of new employment opportunities.  In the Netherlands where work sharing has been a major plank of their employment strategy for many years they were unique in the period 1983-91 in that they achieved 40 per cent growth in employment at a time when we had static employment.  In large measure that was achieved through a policy of facilitating flexible working arrangements in every shape and form.  We must learn from their experience.  They set an ambitious target in the public sector where 30 per cent of all jobs were to become work sharing positions in future.  They pursued that target relentlessly and opened up employment to many people who had been denied it.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a grim record in job sharing. Only 1,500 people in the entire public sector are job sharing.  Generally, public sector managers are unwilling to facilitate it.  In the nursing sector there is a huge demand for flexible working hours and job sharing but it has not been made available to them.  One-third of women who are unemployed are seeking work <Col N="737" /> sharing opportunities.  Some of the older reports show that half the Irish employers did not see work sharing as presenting major financial or reorganisation problems. The potential is there if the Government is willing to get the concept of work sharing going.</P>
    <P>In France and Italy successful workplace agreements have been developed. They have come into force particularly where redundancies have been in prospect. Instead of redundancies on a wide scale they have maintained their numbers and have had reduced working hours with Government support.  Our tax system leans the other way.  We tell an employer and workers facing into redundancy that tax breaks and assistance will be available from Government only if they go down the traditional redundancy route of destroying jobs.  There is no future if that is the way we proceed.  We give all the tax breaks to redundancy lump sums but no break to more progressive agreements in the workplace that could maintain jobs or facilitate recruitment through reduced working hours.  The trade union movement is anxious to see reduced working hours.  Perhaps we could match the need for work with the desire for less work hours by facilitating such partnership agreements in the workplace.  We could have scope to trade less hours for more employment.</P>
    <P>Equally, we must look at the options for early retirement.  A substantial number of people in Ireland is between the ages of 55 and 65.  There are approximately 90,000 at work many of whom might be attracted, if a reasonable package was put together, to opt for reduced working hours and to facilitate recruitment to the workplace.  We will see an explosion in the number of young people in the workforce who will have ambitions to continue working and to raise a family. Clearly we should try to facilitate them.</P>
    <P>Sadly, in Ireland, there are huge levels of overtime working.  There is an onus on Government to provide schemes whereby, in collective bargaining, the option of reduced overtime working for more employment can become more attractive.  I urge the Government to look <Col N="738" /> seriously at work sharing and workplace agreements which have been a feature of some of the successful employment countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report is timely.  It points to the fact that we are on the brink of a period of economic growth.  The key issue set by the ESRI is whether the benefits of this economic growth will be shared equally in our community.  Do we have the policies and the conviction to ensure a fair share out of the benefits of this growth or &mdash; as we did in the past &mdash; will we go through a period of high economic growth and come through with the problems of high structural unemployment virtually untouched?  If we are to judge from the Taoiseach's statement to the House today the Government has not got to grips with the strategic issues pointed out in the ESRI report.  It continues to believe that continuing with policies that have failed in the past will, in some way, alter our experience.  We have an unique opportunity &mdash; perhaps lasting no more than five years &mdash; when we will have the benefit of low interest rates, the benefit of 3.5 per cent of GDP being transferred to us as Structural Funds, and a period of falling dependency ratios to facilitiate the reforms we need.  This is a unique opportunity for policy change, not an opportunity for continuing on in the age old way of spending money.</P>
    <P>The ESRI say we must be more selective and must have more open questioning of the priorities chosen by Government, with proper appraisal and competition for the use of these moneys. They ask us to reform to make our economy hungry to use the scarce resources we will have to the benefit of our community, particularly the unemployed. It is a major challenge and I hope successive speakers from the Government benches will show that they have squared up more courageously than the Taoiseach to the challenges set out by the ESRI.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased we are having this debate.  I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business some weeks ago if he would allow time for a debate on <Col N="739" /> the ESRI report and on the task force report.  It is important that our national Parliament should debate important economic reports.  The report by the Commission on Taxation &mdash; a comprehensive blueprint for radical reform of our taxation system &mdash; was never debated in the Dáil, was never officially responded to by the Government and there was no White Paper.  It is regrettable that the good work done by that commission has been lost.  Often, we are so busy with day to day work or urgent work that we omit what is important.  It is important to think ahead and to reflect on what the ESRI is telling us.  It is important that we learn from the lessons of the past and that we do not repeat the mistakes.  While there were huge increases in growth in the period 1980-92 the unemployment level increased by 40 per cent.  There are lessons to be learned and we are more likely to learn if we debate the report when it is current rather than leaving it on the shelf to wither.  This is a valuable report.  The ESRI is patted on the back but all too often its work is ignored in day to day policy making in which the Government engages.</P>
      <P>I very much regret that the Taoiseach was selective in what he chose to take from the ESRI medium-term review.  I too pay tribute to the Director of the ESRI, Dr. Kieran Kennedy, and the senior staff who compiled this report. Recently I was briefed by senior ESRI staff on the future trends in the economy and other matters and I was very impressed by the level of commitment, expertise and sheer dedication that I witnessed during my visit to the ESRI office.  We need to listen to them.  The Taoiseach, rightly, says they are not infallible but nobody is infallible and we all make assumptions based on certain criteria.  Nevertheless these people are committed to the country and in particular to the marginalised.  The review and the eight back-up papers draw attention, in particular, to the plight of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that such reports are not just noted but that we learn from <Col N="740" /> them.  Today is given over to statements in which the report will be noted.  I will not summarise the ESRI's findings, the Taoiseach did that albeit on a selective basis.  I will deal with the essential medicine that we need to administer if we are to remedy the ills of the past.  Sometimes we deal with economic problems in the way we deal with potholes: we fill the pothole, we deal with the symptoms but not with underlying causes.</P>
    <P>The ESRI draws attention to our attitude to the national plan and is critical of certain matters in it.  We have a very high dependency ratio.  For every ten people at work there are 22 people dependent, that is the fundamental reason for taxation being high: the sheer numbers dependent on social welfare account for its high cost.  Unless we change the dependency ratio, with more at work and fewer dependants we will not provide the economic opportunities and improved living standards we seek.  We have to make choices, and hard decisions.  We cannot continue to increase public spending and at the same time look for lower levels of taxation.  The two are inconsistent, but, unfortunately, many Members want both.  They want higher Government spending and more tax cuts. Taxation is the key to kick-starting the economy.  We have not created the number of jobs we require in any decade, with the exception of the 1960s, since the foundation of the State.  What was it about the 1960s that accounted for high levels of employment?  We had low taxation and a zero budget deficit, people with a pioneering spirit were able to modernise and keep up-to-date with the economic international trends.  We have lost that pioneering spirit and tended to pander to everybody who comes before us.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach clapped himself on the back for the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> I presume he was referring to me when he said that some members of this House have been influenced by &ldquo;right wing economists&rdquo; who would not wish to see the Government engaged in pay deals of that kind.  To the best of my knowledge I am the only <Col N="741" /> Member who has criticised this pay deal, but I have done so for very good reasons. The pay deals agreed in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> are not sustainable or in the interests of the unemployed who were not involved in the negotiations.  I was disappointed again yesterday when I asked the Taoiseach to give a commitment that the one organisation whose sole agenda is to look after the interests of the unemployed would be involved in negotiations of a programme of this kind or in the central review committee.  I find it very hard to understand that anyone committed to dealing with the problem of unemployment can justify keeping that organisation away from the negotiating table. The reason is that the pay deals being agreed are not in the interests of employment, they are putting people out of work.</P>
    <P>A recent report indicated that for every 1 per cent interest in wage costs, we loose 4,000 jobs.  Instead of an 8.5 per cent increase in wage rates over the three year period of the programme would it not have been better to have held present wage rates and to have gone for massive tax reductions?  The single choice would have generated over 40,000 jobs.  That is the policy we require.  When the Taoiseach paid tribute to Dr. Kieran Kennedy he did not draw attention to his submission to the forum before the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was negotiated.  Dr. Kennedy wondered what level of pay cuts we could afford and he drew attention to the fact that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was bad for employment. He believed pay cuts were required to generate employment.  I agree with him.  I am disappointed that the social partners, in particular the employer organisations, were so keen to go along with the cosy consensus, which is not responsive to market trends.  For example, during the currency crisis in early 1992, the public sector pay bill had to be honoured and ability to pay was not a criterion.  In the unsheltered private sector many companies had to negotiate <Col N="742" /> pay reductions with their workers and if there had not been a devaluation, the reductions would have taken effect.  Central pay bargaining of that kind does not take account of ability to pay and certainly the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> does not take account of ability to pay.  It is assumed that the taxpayer and the State, a major employer, will have enough resources which it can raise through tax or borrowing. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The ESRI tell us that taxes on income and wealth are projected to fall from 24.6 per cent of GNP in 1994 to 21.4 per cent by the year 2000.  This fall of 3.2 per cent is worth £950 million in 1994 terms, which is enough to cut income tax by 25 per cent, to cut all employers' and employees PRSI by 40 per cent.  If we were to choose either of those routes we would give a massive kick-start to the economy and encourage enterprise.  We would make it worthwhile for companies to employ more people instead of seeking ways to try to replace manpower with technologies. That is the reality of our economic climate.  On top of these tax reductions, taxes on expenditure are projected to fall from 16.5 per cent of GNP to 15.2 per cent by the year 2000.  I believe that those indicators give us an enormous opportunity to radically reform the taxation system.  We ignored the report of the Commission on Taxation, which was not debated in this House and the Government of the day, which I accept had changed, did not respond to it.  There is no commitment on a serious level of tax reform.  The Taoiseach made a passing reference to it, he accused Opposition parties of not being able to take the big step forward.  If he is suggesting that seeking to raise £5 million from home owners by an unfair property tax is tax reform, he will give tax reform a bad name.  He needs to look again.  Taking £5 million from home owners, the amount allocated in the budget to a single organisation, gives tax reform a bad name, discredits those who pursue it and does a disservice to efforts to reform the taxation system.</P>
    <P>We need a five year plan to reduce tax. We also need to know the targets the <Col N="743" /> Government wishes to achieve during its term of office.  The previous Government, of which my party was a member, set targets for tax reform.  We set a target of a standard rate of 25 per cent and a higher rate of 40 per cent.  When we left Government the higher rate had been reduced from 54 per cent to 48 per cent and the standard rate to 27 per cent.  If that Government had lasted those rates would have been reduced even further and reached the targets set.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from a book &mdash; I have quoted from it before and it is relevant &mdash; by Cedric Sanford who carried out a comparative study of the tax system in six English speaking countries.  In regard to our tax system and our capacity to reform it he stated:</P>
    <P>Despite a comprehensive blueprint provided by a Commission on Taxation the Republic of Ireland saw less reform of the structure of its tax system than many other English speaking countries. However, it has been to the forefront of administrative reform, including the introduction and extension of schemes of self-assessment.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that if we had shown half the commitment to reforming the tax structure as we had to reforming the administration of the tax system this would be a much better place.  He said, about the previous Government:</P>
    <P>The tax reform movement quickened very remarkably from 1989 when the Progressive Democrats joined in a coalition with Fianna Fáil and promised a complete overhaul of the tax code.  This Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition was responsible for the biggest ever reductions in personal income tax, the phasing out of tax relief on life insurance premiums, the attack on fringe benefits, the reduction in corporation tax from 43 per cent to 40 per cent, the phasing out of accelerated appreciation and for most of the reforms on VAT and excise duties.</P>
    <P>That was the position after a mere three <Col N="744" /> years in Government, albeit three difficult years in which we had to convince our partners of the need for tax reform.</P>
    <P>The tax wedge is the difference between what it costs an employer to take on an employee and what the employee takes home.  It costs an employer £3 to give an extra £1 to an employee in wages and is destroying the incentive to work in the economy.  I said recently at the Leinster branch of the Institute of Chartered Accountants that the tax system was a bit like the Irish psyche &mdash; it was negative, begrudging and obstructionist. It is also anti-enterprise, business and jobs, particularly small businesses which account for 90 per cent of companies in the economy.  These are the real losers. Patrick Campbell, one of the successful Irish entrepreneurs, said recently that the business person was the real suspect in the economy, that the Revenue Commissioners had more powers to pursue business people than the Garda Síochána had to pursue criminals.  He wondered who the real suspects were and if we really wanted to encourage enterprise and initiative in the economy.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress often enough the importance of tax reform.  There is no point telling people that next year they will lose certain reliefs; tax reform has such a bad name that people are genuinely worried.  I favour a system where householders pay for services; no one would object to this.  What frightens ordinary people who are trying hard to pay for a house and educate their children is that the Government does not understand their plight, assumes that they have money and are a wealthy class when they are finding it hard to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>A property tax, whereby two householders living in houses of equal value are charged the same amount, is not fair. One could have a mortgage of £70,000 and an income of £30,000 while the other could have no mortgage and an income of £200,000; yet both will pay the same amount if their properties are the same value.  If that is what the Taoiseach calls tax reform he does not understand what is required in changing the tax system.</P>
    <P>Even with tax reform I accept that we <Col N="745" /> have a major unemployment problem. The ESRI report states that by the year 2000 18 per cent of the live register, or 13.4 per cent of the labour force, will be unemployed.  This is a frightening indictment of politics, the Government and public policy.  This is not sustainable; that we will cast aside so many people, like a human setaside, and say to them that we will give them social welfare on condition they do not work.  It is not as if there is no work to be done; we will pay them social welfare to stay at home and do nothing.  This is wrong and the reason I am such a strong advocate of the concept of workfare.</P>
    <P>I am aware that people will tell me this is right wing, it is not, it is sensible.  There is no alternative for so many people.  The State should be compelled to offer work, particularly to the 85,000 young people under the age of 25, currently unemployed. In return for working three days each week &mdash; it should be a combination of work and training &mdash; they should be given their welfare payment plus a premium of, say, £20.  If we fail to do this many people in my constituency and other parts of the country will never know what it is like to work.  The most enterprising and highly educated young people &mdash; the people we can least afford to lose &mdash; will emigrate to capitalist economies, some of which have introduced workfare schemes where they will respond to incentives.  Why is it so many of our people do better when they go abroad? Often they are more appreciated.</P>
    <P>We have to think seriously about the concept of workfare instead of dismissing it because of some ideological hang-up. If we fail to do this the level of unemployment &mdash; the human setaside to which I have referred, the equivalent of the Common Agricultural Policy so far as agriculture is concerned, whereby compensation is paid to set people aside &mdash; will haunt us as the number at work, the ten people at work who maintain nine dependants, continues to decrease.  We face increasing competition from countries in Central and Eastern Europe.  The multinational sector accounts for 50 per cent of jobs in manufacturing.  This is a <Col N="746" /> dynamic sector and has provided enormous job opportunities but it is mobile and is not committed to Ireland.  Like every other business, it is committed to making money.  It could move quickly to the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe where a highly educated post-graduate &mdash; many of these countries have a good system of education &mdash; could be employed for as little as £5,000 a year. That is the reason we have to look to our own resources and tackle the problems in the economy.</P>
    <P>In chapter 4 of the back-up document to the ESRI report Patrick Honohan said about the national economic plan: &ldquo;It is thus, by definition, only one element of an overall strategy&rdquo;.  The Government seems to think it has all the answers.  He was critical of the fact that the Government seemed to be placing too much emphasis on the need to deal with the symptoms, what he described as type one scenarios.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Of the weaknesses in the economy which result in Ireland's economic development still falling behind other EU countries, some, like climate, may be taken as more or less permanent and irredeemable; susceptible only to compensatory measures whereas others, like physical infrastructure, can be corrected by appropriate action...  The plan emphasises type one weaknesses [in other words, the symptoms] the peripheral location, the small domestic market, the low population density, the widely dispersed pattern of settlement . . . Such an approach does nothing to make the economy more competitive and, indeed, may damage competitiveness (for instance, by encouraging persistence of dispersed settlement).</P>
    <P>He drew attention to the need to look more carefully at projects which will be supported such as telecommunications and water and sewage treatment projects. He wondered if grant aiding or giving decent capital allocations to projects such as telecommunications or water and sewage treatment plants would delay the evil day when we would have <Col N="747" /> to confront the real problems.  The Taoiseach referred to telephone charges and seems to believe that following the hullabaloo last year there is no problem. There is a problem in that regard.  We have the highest telecommunications costs in the European Union.  Telecom Éireann is overmanned and is not able to deal with the modern telecommunications explosion.  International charges had to be reduced because Telecom Éireann faced competition internationally.</P>
    <P>Rather than dealing with the fundamental problem, namely, the cost of supplying telecommunications services because of overmanning and so on, it simply switched the cost structure from international calls where it faced competition to the domestic user.  As a result business people and the ordinary users of telephones have to pay for the failure of Telecom Éireann &mdash; and the failure of the Government to force it &mdash; to deal with the fundamental problem that confronts the country.  In respect of the State sector generally, I hope the Government does not become paralysed because of ideology. A State company that is not providing an essential public utility should be disposed of subject to the market conditions being right.  I accept that only a certain amount of capital can be raised at any one time and that a number of companies could not be floated together, but we should examine them on a project by project basis.  I do not have a problem in regard to the disposal of the Trustee Savings Bank but I do have a problem with the manner in which the Government set out to dispose of it.  It should be disposed of on the basis of fair and open competition, not on the basis of a sweetheart deal.</P>
    <P>The State's involvement in our economy distorts the real market.  The State, with its permanent workforce and guaranteed income levels seeks to compete with many private sector companies in areas where it need not become involved.  Why do State companies in competition with private ones have huge marketing budgets?  Why can a person <Col N="748" /> not run a private bus service in Dublin? An unemployed person wishing to run such a service is legally prohibited from doing so.  Is that sensible in this day and age?  I do not believe we need all this State monopoly, and that matter should be addressed.  The monopolistic position of the State in many sectors has led to higher costs and charges, and in sectors in which it sought to compete, where the private sector is more than doing an adequate job, it sought to use huge marketing budgets.  It does not seem to have a problem getting money to put private companies out of business.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the problems in respect of unemployment.  One of the most disturbing aspects of the ESRI report is that we will continue to have a major unemployment problem with more than 200,000 unemployed in the year 2000.  That is regrettable and it is even more regrettable that many of them will be long term unemployed.  Patrick Honohan in chapter 4 of his back-up document, referring to the &ldquo;educational drop-out&rdquo;, stated:</P>
    <P>The relatively high proportion of children who leave school with no qualifications or low qualifications reveals a structural weakness in the educational system at initial, primary and secondary level.</P>
    <P>I support that view.  Why is the real debate on education here about who controls the school and who does the teaching? That is not the issue.  It does not matter who controls the schools.  There is hardly any religious left in either the control or teaching of education.  The issue is about what is taught in our schools and the output from our educational system.  By that I do not mean the results one receives on a piece of paper, but the attitude and confidence instilled in those that come through our education system. Dr. O'Hare, the President of DCU, recently referred to the need for an enterprising spirit.  He was not referring to it in a Thatcherite manner but to the need for instilling confidence and determination in our people, in other words, encouraging them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> Our education system does not do that because we have not reflected on the output, role and value of education. Talking about who controls our schools or who teaches in them is similar to Jack Charlton saying he will concentrate on who drives the bus in which his team travels or about what colour the seats are rather than on the strategy or methods he will use to make the players play better football.  That type of attitude does not make sense.  We get ourselves into a national tizzy every time the ethos comes up for discussion and major arguments occur about who will control this and that.  At the end of the day that is not what is important.  It is not what the public, parents, students or teachers want.</P>
    <P>We need to examine our education system because it is turning out many young people of 15 and 16 years of age who are virtually illiterate.  I am frequently surprised at the standard of literacy in letters I receive from people with good second level qualifications.  Has what was called in my day the &ldquo;three Rs&rdquo; been taken off the agenda or are they not taught in the same way?  The system today does not seem to be having a similar effect.  Besides the need to change, revamp and re-evaluate the role of our education system and the output from it, the demographic changes to which John Fitzgerald referred in the introduction to the back-up report must be taken into account.  With a projected fall in birth rates there will be fewer people at school and fewer teachers will be needed.  This provides us with a unique opportunity to examine the education system, plan for the future and not get involved in a meaningless debate.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the need to radically reform our tax system.  Higher growth rates bring in increased revenue which can be frittered away in higher spending.  There will be many demands on the Government to spend more whether on education, health, social welfare or the environment.  If we choose the spending route there will be more people unemployed, the economy will be less competitive and we will be less encouraging to entrepreneurs who have an <Col N="750" /> enterprising spirit.  Many of them will go elsewhere.  People respond to incentives. Money will not be invested in business if it does not make money.</P>
    <P>The past few years have shown that money invested in non-business activities has been far more lucrative than money invested in business.  The distortion in our tax system so far as the services sector is concerned has been damaging.  It is interesting to note that most of the additional jobs predicted by the ESRI will be provided in the services sector, for example, in distribution, transport and tourism.  That sector is subject to a 40 per cent corporation tax regime whereas the manufacturing sector is subject to 10 per cent.  It is interesting that the two service areas where the 10 per cent tax rate applies, software development and the international financial services sector, are extremely successful. Money can be transferred around the world in seconds by electronic means. Money is price and tax sensitive.  If it is not lucrative to invest here, money will not be invested here.  Despite political difficulties and the recession in the financial services sector in 1989-90, that sector has been very successful and has generated 1,500 jobs.  I hope the Minister will be able to extend the deadline date beyond December for companies seeking permission to apply for a permit or licence to trade there.  Obviously, that will require EU approval, which I hope will be forthcoming.  The services sector has an enormous capacity to create jobs and it is labour-intensive.  We must examine the level of tax applied to that sector <i>vis-à-vis</i> the manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate and hope it is the start of many such debates.  It requires discussion such as this to force people to read these reports, reflect on them and adopt their provisions in making policy at every opportunity.  I want the Government to respond to the report and not to shelve it.  The Taoiseach seemed to take the view that the report highlighted good progress, that the Government had done a great job and will continue to do its work as before.  The only commitment he gave, and I was pleased about it, was <Col N="751" /> that there would be no public spending spree.  That small reassurance is welcome from a Government that has increased spending by 17 per cent &mdash; four and a half times the rate of inflation &mdash; over the period of its first two budgets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Taoiseach used the opportunity of this report to congratulate himself and the Government on a seemingly good job because that is not what the report says. While the report is remarkably optimistic the Taoiseach chose to avoid all the policy issues raised in it and conveniently made no reference to the summary on page 79.  It states:</P>
      <P>Ireland will thus have the capacity, if it has the will, to address its most basic problem, unemployment. However, solutions will not be found if the economy is left on autopilot.</P>
      <P>That is the report's conclusion.  If the economy is left on autopilot, those challenges, and the main one of unemployment, will not be addressed.  It is regrettable that the Taoiseach should use the opportunity of the limited debate on this important ESRI report as an occasion for self-congratulations and clapping the Government on the back for achievements which the report indicates is not due to domestic Government performance or the handling of our economy.  In so far as this House provides for relevant debate of pressing issues confronting our people, it is regrettable that the debate on this report consists of a series of statements and a speech drafted for the Taoiseach, presented with rose-tinted spectacles, with the thorny issues referred to in it glided over.  In so far as he referred to those issues at all, he made a passing reference to taxation and the role of small business, which I will come back to later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many, if not the majority, of my constituents and many members of the public if they were in the public gallery or if RTE were permitted to broadcast this debate in its entirety would be mesmerised by the mood of optimism coming <Col N="752" /> from the Government benches while discussing the most optimistic report of the economy in years, having regard to the reality of their lives.  That shows there is a real economy where people live and one of booming indicators where economists and Government spokespersons live, and the twain never meets. Many of my constituents who have been unemployed for a number of years and who are concentrated in black spots where there is up to 75 per cent unemployment, those living on low incomes and oppressed by taxation, trying to make ends meet, must be bemused by the sentiments in the Taoiseach's speech that people never had it so good, that we are living in prosperous times and can look forward to boom and bloom, and that all the indicators and fundamentals are sound.  There is no comparison between that and the real economy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach came up with a fantastic new economic maxim today when explaining public service cutbacks of post-1987 and especially post-1989 and the expectations of economists at that time of the implications for unemployment. He described the phenomenon as &ldquo;expansionary fiscal contraction&rdquo;.  The students to whom Deputy Harney referred should reflect on that.  What in heaven's name is expansionary fiscal contraction?  There is a great ability among speech writers for Government Ministers to come up with such phrases that have no meaning for the public; and if the opposite phenomenon was detected in the economy over the next ten years they would come up with a new maxim, equally meaningless. It reminds me of the concept of hysteresis to which the former Senator Brendan Ryan, who I believe is an engineer, introduced us when the all-party committee on unemployment was set up in the dying day of the last Dáil to examine the unemployment crisis.  He explained that hysteresis is an engineering term that describes how something goes up and stays up despite all the common phenomena indicating it should come down, and he applied that to unemployment.  The Taoiseach, then as now, said that all the <Col N="753" /> fundamentals are sound, that we are performing better than any of our European partners, growth is exceptionally and consistently high and despite those indicators unemployment is going up and staying up.  It is probable for people in the real economy that the concept of hysteresis imported into economics is at least as relevant as the Taoiseach's one of expansionary fiscal contraction.</P>
    <P>The ESRI's medium-term review is remarkably optimistic.  It projects the biggest rise in living standards, for those at work, and the best economic growth rate since the 1960s, low inflation, a falling tax burden, low interest rates, a falling national debt, a falling proportion of children and a significant reduction in and eventual elimination of the current budget deficit.  It is almost too good to be true.  Is it possible for the ESRI or any institute or economist to forecast in the present climate that interest rates will remain stable and low?  I suggest it is not. Having regard to the phenomenon we experienced towards the end of 1992 and early 1993, it is not impossible that we would be confronted with a version of that again; and having regard to the direction Britain is taking within the European Community, it is not impossible that we would be confronted with difficult situations for our companies trading in Britain.</P>
    <P>I am not here to second guess the ESRI's conclusions.  Let us take those conclusions within parameters set out, that the prospects for our economic growth appear more optimistic than they have been since the 1960s, and the implications that has for the main problem confronting us, namely, unemployment. Contrary to the softly, softly catchee monkey approach of the Taoiseach, I argue those optimistic forecasts require a radical new departure in our economic policy to transform the benefits of the optimistic economic prospects into a major drive for jobs.</P>
    <P>Questions must be asked about the Government's policy on low inflation, high balance of payments surplus, high saving ratio and low borrowing, when Ireland has such high unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> The Taoiseach virtually denied us the opportunity to question any of these matters, but I question them.  It is ridiculous to have an inflation rate of 1.5 per cent when unemployment is just under 300,000 and expected to remain high well into the next century.  Is it not equally ridiculous to have a staggeringly high balance of payments surplus, a characteristic of an economy in good health, when there is such high unemployment? Is it not questionable to have such a high savings ratio at a time when there is a desperate need for investment in the economy?</P>
    <P>The ESRI report is so optimistic that the authors are in danger of being sacked as members of the dismal science.  It is 30 years since we had such a remarkably favourable outlook for the economy.  All the excellent economic indicators must be channelled into dealing with the historic failure of the Irish State: mass unemployment.  We must challenge the conservatism of Irish policy-makers and those with power to come to grips with this scandal.</P>
    <P>The ESRI forecast that unemployment, while falling somewhat, will remain at 200,000 at the end of the century.  I would be interested to hear in the reply to this debate the precise difference between the calculation on the basis of the live register, which is 266,000, or more than 18 per cent, that will remain unemployed at the end of this decade and the calculation on standard labour force techniques, which is 200,000.  In either event the level of unemployment is frightening and our major challenge.  The long term unemployed will not gain from the booming economy and high emigration will continue.  Since the foundation of the State in 1922 those in power have neglected the unemployed, forcing too many to emigrate.</P>
    <P>What is different today is what we have the opportunity within our grasp to do something about mass unemployment and emigration.  It is time we ignored the self-seeking warnings of the economic elite.  They warned about the evils of boosting inflation, reducing the balance of payments surplus, more effectively <Col N="755" /> taxing the massive outflows of profit, utilising low interest rates, encouraging investment from high domestic savings, encouraging Irish firms to invest more in Ireland and changing Government policy from capital intensive investments such as road building to labour intensive investments.  I unashamedly argue for all these matters.  Only the most right wing economist would object if inflation doubled to, say, 3 per cent.  If the effect of inflation rising to 3 per cent was that it helped to create thousands of jobs in the process, which is likely in the context of the indicators in this report, I see no reason to follow the Conservative Ministers in the Tory Cabinet in Britain by throwing our hands in the air in alarm at the prospect.</P>
    <P>Few would object to running down the balance of payments surplus, which is a false indicator of the state of the economy &mdash; an NESC report dealt with that matter.  It has been estimated that if the personal savings rate was cut by even 1 per cent it would create 3,000 extra jobs in a couple of years, particularly in indigenous industry and services.  It would also boost taxes and reduce Exchequer borrowing.  The national debt-GNP ratio is rapidly declining and is already within the Maastricht criteria. It must be remembered that the national debt was run up by the profligacy of successive Governments, including Fianna Fáil &mdash; the Taoiseach was very selective in the years he chose.  Interest rates are down and the Government must use this opportunity to boost investment in the economy.  A fall in the Government's borrowing requirement and a projected fall in a public expenditure as a percentage of GNP means there is room for increased public spending.  If it is targeted, and it should be, at the long term unemployed, that is justified, and I do not agree with running away from it, which has been characteristic of this debate so far.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in public spending for its own sake, but like most economists in the past I have long argued that capital spending is generally welcome. <Col N="756" /> However, I am in favour of rigorous assessment and in this context I am not satisfied that public spending on massive road programmes is the appropriate way forward.  Many other infrastructural and environmental spending projects should be considered as investments, because EU money is regarded by the Government as being free.</P>
    <P>The medium term projections of the ESRI provide our policy-makers with a set of unprecedented opportunities.  The high rate of growth forecast will make possible a significant improvement in living standards and will lead to significant employment creation.  The Government faces a crucial policy option between chugging along and keeping things ticking over, or making a decisive shift in public policy which might tackle the twin problems of unemployment and poverty.  Up to now Irish Governments have not shown the slightest inclination to do anything about unemployment.  It appears the official mind believes there are no intellectually respectable arguments that high unemployment is not inevitable given primary commitments to fiscal discipline.</P>
    <P>The Government has shown no reforming instinct in running the economy. The last two budgets have been neutral, there is little sign of new thinking and as long as the much vaunted fundamentals are right, nothing else matters, or nothing can be done anyway.  One gets the strong impression that the only strategy is to keep the lid on things and wait for our demographic structure to change in ten or 20 years, thus eliminating the unemployment problem. The worst scenario presented by the ESRI projections would lead to the development of an unbridgeable gulf between the haves and have nots, between the contented, to use the term of John Kenneth Galbraith, and the poor and marginal.</P>
    <P>The fundamental challenge presented by these projections is to ensure that economic growth benefits the poor and unemployed and leads to a permanent shift in their marginalised position.  It is vital to develop policy instruments that <Col N="757" /> can translate economic growth into jobs. Growth has produced relatively few jobs in the last 20 years because the fruits of that growth have been largely seized by those already in work.  There is a chapter in the ESRI report on this phenomenon. The NESC published a special report on our unique ability to translate apparently healthy growth rates into employment. That is the major challenge confronting this economy.  If our growth rates are projected at 5 per cent consistently for the next five years, it is even more important to focus on that question.</P>
    <P>Projected growth will generate more than 130,000 jobs by the year 2001, but with the annual inflow into our labour market still on the increase as a result of the rise in the birth rate up to 1980, these extra jobs are unlikely to reduce the present level of unemployment by more than 35,000.  Most of these extra jobs will go to those leaving the education system in the years ahead but many of the older unemployed who are married with families and who do not have the desired marketable skills here or abroad will be unaffected by this employment growth.</P>
    <P>Approximately 70,000 people aged over 35 years have been unemployed for over a year.  This group of unemployed must be targeted by specific policy measures.  The ESRI report makes much of the need to maintain competitive labour costs.  This usually means keeping wages low.  The answer to our unemployment problem is definitely not one based on dismantling employees' protection and creating a pool of cheap labour.  If we try to compete with other countries on this basis we will be cutting our own throats.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report advocates the intensification of such supply side measures, for example, education and training. Obviously that is right but it must not become the sole focus of job creation policy.  The world is constantly changing. Education and training on a vastly larger scale will be the most important element in meeting this challenge.  Permanent employment is no longer a reality for many, but we must develop a concept <Col N="758" /> of steady employability and make it a reality.</P>
    <P>We must not, however, neglect the demand side of job creation policy.  There is not a fixed amount of work to go round. Any cursory examination of the state of our public services and the poverty in our towns and cities and, to some extent, in our countryside, makes it only too obvious that much useful work needs to be done.  Serious consideration should be given to the creation of a new third sector or social economy to provide support for working mothers and the elderly, repair damage to the environment and renovate our inner cities.  A version of such plans was being argued within European Commission circles and, specifically, by the outgoing President, Jacques Delors. Unfortunately and regrettably such plans did not form a significant component of the Commission's recent White Paper on Competitiveness and Growth.  Instead, the paper emphasises competitive disciplines which translates as the dismantling of pay elements in our European welfare system.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech was disappointing in that he confined himself to regurgitating the optimistic conclusions in this report without indicating what he will do to give effect to the prospects held out by the report in terms of job creation. The two areas to which he referred were taxation and the role of small business. I cannot understand why the Taoiseach continues to believe that this Government has ushered in radical tax reform. He spelled out three headings to demonstrate this tax reform.  They include (a) the reduction of mortgage interest and VHI relief to the standard rate; (b) the taxation of short term benefits which will have a positive effect on employment &mdash; let us understand that the Taoiseach is talking about the taxation of unemployment and disability benefit &mdash; and (c) the extension of full PRSI to future public servants.  These are the three elements of the Taoiseach's tax reform achievements.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to believe that those measures are seriously being advanced in this House as a contribution to broadening the tax base.  In ideal tax circumstances <Col N="759" /> where there is genuine equity in the tax structure, there may be an argument for tackling the question of reducing mortgage interest relief to the standard rate, but in the context of the manifestly inequitable tax system that we continue to have, reducing mortgage interest relief for home owners, who are the people paying tax in this economy, is by no means a progressive development and does nothing to contribute to broadening the tax base.</P>
    <P>It is fantastic that the Taoiseach should argue that taxing the unemployed and the sick is a contribution to broadening the tax base.  There is no reference in the Taoiseach's speech or in the debate on the Finance Bill, which is continuing in another room of this House, to broadening the tax base in terms of taxing wealth, taxing land or tackling evasion more effectively so that those who have contrived to avoid paying their fair share through the years will be more likely to be required to pay their fair share in the future.</P>
    <P>A levy of £50 million from the sick and the unemployed is only a little more than the amount of money paid by all the farmers of Ireland, and the Taoiseach presents that as a contribution to broadening the tax base.  It is a nonsense and Deputy Harney did not improve my temper on the matter by her contribution. Her quoting of this book, which I also heard from her finance spokesperson for 12 hours yesterday during the debate on the Finance Bill about the tremendous contribution of the Progressive Democrats in Government, is not as I recall it.  There were significant reductions under the Progressive Democrats for the high earners but there was no genuine tax reform.  Tax reductions are not the same as tax reform.  Tax reform involves broadening the tax base, getting a fair yield from those who own property and wealth in this economy and spreading the burden that we saw graphically demonstrated last Monday during the centenary celebrations of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, when the enormous burden was pulled through <Col N="760" /> O'Connell Street by the PAYE &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; who have paid the main share of taxation since the Taoiseach's heyday of 1960 to which he wants to bring us back.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach boasts about the 1960s. On his recent trip to the United States, he stated that those were the days when he had such a casual acquaintance with the taxman that he was not required to make any tax returns.  He said that when he was approached by the taxman he told him that he would &ldquo;fix it up&rdquo;.  He did not fix it up and, according to his own story, the taxman said that he would get him on his death bed, to which the Taoiseach replied that if he left it with him until then, that was fair enough.  That was the tax climate of the 1960s.  The Taoiseach told that story with far greater panache but it is a good story and it tells a great deal about the tax regime that obtained here in the 1960s.  It is not a regime I would wish to return to because the only people who paid tax in the 1960s were the PAYE workers.  We must not go back to that.</P>
    <P>I admit there have been some improvements since that time.  The present Minister has made some improvements but we are still a long way from having a fair system.  Last weekend, the Minister for Finance delivered to me by courier a series of amendments, one of which is to give more favourable treatment to tax exiles.  The effect of this amendment, which came out of the blue last week, is to relax the minimal requirement for the super rich to pay in this jurisdiction.  Up to now if you had a residence in this country and spent one day here you were liable for tax in this jurisdiction but now the residence requirement has been abolished.  This is not unconnected with the announcement by prominent individuals that they were leaving this country and an oppressive tax regime.  Anyone who read the report of the Telecom inquiry knows some of them paid virtually no tax.  We are now making provision for them to come back after a year and they will no longer pay tax in this jurisdiction.  You can have a residence here &mdash; a castle &mdash; and spend 140 days in this country if you wish without paying <Col N="761" /> tax.  That is not tax reform and is an issue which must be addressed if we are to create jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be too much to expect Deputy Rabbitte to give any credit to the Taoiseach or the Government for the improvement in the economy but when things go wrong he is quick enough to stand up and blame them for it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the comprehensive and timely report of the ESRI.  The authors are to be congratulated on their work. The message conveyed by the report is positive and encouraging and confirms that the economy has recovered strongly from the serious situation which existed in the 1980s.  As a result, we can look to the future with realistic confidence that the well-being of each section of society can benefit from the improvement in the economy.  It should not be forgotten that this undoubted upturn in the state of our finances did not happen by chance. Extremely difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions were taken by successive Governments to restore the nation's financial well-being.  The courage and foresight of Ministers for Finance is to be commended.</P>
      <P>The same type of courage will continue to be required over the coming decade if the final stage of recovery is to be successfully achieved.  At a time when intense media attention tends to magnify out of all proportion each difficult financial decision, it is vital that occasional negative reaction should not be allowed to hinder the development of responsible economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An unwelcome development in society is the tendency for certain people within the media to respond in a cynical manner to the work and efforts of others.  While anyone involved in political life is only too well aware of this development, it is not the only profession singled out for negative attention.  Economists have been the target of much cynical comment. While there is little doubt that they sometimes fail to analyse matters correctly it is grossly unfair to berate the profession as a whole.  It is important to realise that the difficult nature of the <Col N="762" /> discipline itself makes them vulnerable to attack when they take a public position on any given matter.</P>
    <P>There are two lessons to be learned from the performance of economists in the past.  The profession must accept that its findings and reports deserve to be treated with respect rather than recognised as the ultimate truth.  This involves an increasing acceptance by economists of the validity of other inputs to the information and implementation of economic policy.  It is interesting to note the recent comments of a Nobel prize winning economists, Dr. Douglas North, who stated: &ldquo;Most modern economics does not address real problems, it makes assumptions about a world that does not exist&rdquo;. These comments by such a distinguished researcher give the profession grounds for reflection.  In return for a less dogmatic approach by certain economists I hope that the tendency among many to immediately dismiss the comments of any economists should not be a feature of financial debates in future.  Economists have a major role to play in assisting our increased understanding of the factors which influence our financial well-being. As we continue to tackle difficult economic issues it is vital that each relevant sector of society is encouraged to make every possible contribution.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the authors of the report should address a central concern of many at an early stage in their document, the problem of reconciling the various reports of an improvement in our economic well-being with the fact that many people remain extremely disadvantaged. The authors note that in the early 1980s the nation was living beyond its means.  The standard of living indicators most commonly used abroad is GDP but this is not suitable for us because it includes the profits of foreign owned companies and fails to exclude payments of debt interest abroad.  They also deal with the influence exerted by practices such as transfer pricing and differences between apparent and actual economic growth.</P>
    <P>From reading the report's evaluation of various factors influencing our economic <Col N="763" /> well-being, two key issues are worth stressing &mdash; it is clear the influence of major Government policy change remains for a number of years after its implementation.  Poor policy decisions have a long legacy but, on the positive side, a similar effect follows the implementation of excellent policy.  It is encouraging to note the conclusions of the ESRI.  The impact of the turn around in Irish growth performance has not yet been fully felt by the private sector. Output growth during the last decade has not been fully matched by a comparative growth in the purchasing power of available national resources.  A growing share of available resources has been channelled to improve the balance of payments at the expense of consumption and investment.</P>
    <P>This effect was part and parcel of the successful efforts since the early 1980s to stabilise fiscal and international payments. This correction will not be needed in the years ahead although reversion to irresponsible fiscal management must be avoided.  In addition, an increasing share of output growth will be available to satisfy domestic demand and have a higher employment content.  These comments are encouraging and indicate that the strong measures taken in recent years should have a positive impact on all sectors of society in the near future.</P>
    <P>The second issue worth stressing is the high level of exposure of an open economy such as ours to international developments.  While international trade is exerting an increasing influence on every country we are particularly dependent on financial developments largely outside our control.  Therefore, any significant trend towards protective policies by any of our main trading partners would have a serious effect on our economy.  As we saw on more than one occasion, external changes in interest rates and exchange rates can cause severe problems on our domestic markets.</P>
    <P>The message conveyed by this is twofold: first, our information gathering systems must be continually developed so that we can react as quickly and effectively <Col N="764" /> as possible to international developments and, second, we must develop our ability to anticipate external financial developments.  In this way alternative strategies can be implemented as early as possible.  In the past we were inclined to regard research and development as mainly the responsibility of external agencies such as universities and professional research institutions such as the ESRI.</P>
    <P>The complexity of economic and policy issues, which are increasingly becoming a routine part of political life, means we must place much greater emphasis on including research facilities in Government Departments.  Such facilities should become a standard component of the services available to public representatives. The international market place is extremely competitive and we can only reach our full potential in that market if we are all informed to the greatest possible extent.  Increasing our level of commitment to focused research and providing the necessary resources for such work must be made a priority in the future.</P>
    <P>The second impression formed from reading this report is that the quality of life in Ireland during the 21st century will be determined to a large degree by the decisions we make during the coming years.  This message must be made clear to everyone if we are to make substantial progress in dealing with the more difficult problems facing us as a society.  Our goal must be to develop the structures necessary to enable each individual to play a meaningful and satisfying role in society. While such aspirations might seem unrealistic, substantial progress can be made if we focus on two key inter-related requirements.  First, we must place a premium on the creation of an atmosphere which will encourage both economic and personal development.  Second, it is vital for the common good that the importance of responsible behaviour is fully recognised. The ongoing improvements in our taxation system have already had a significant impact on our economy.  As excessive taxation is the single greatest obstacle to the growth of a spirit of enterprise <Col N="765" /> and investment, it is vital that the process of reform is continued.</P>
    <P>Another immediate goal must be the encouragement of students to avail fully of opportunities for educational development. A succession of reports confirms that an early school leaving age and a lack of specific skill are the most accurate predictors of long term unemployment. Opportunities for second chance education and industrial training must also be increased.</P>
    <P>The development of these facilities is influenced to a certain degree by the economic realities of the day.  State-sponsored training programmes must be clearly focused on areas which have realistic prospects of creating employment. The lack of such a focus has two negative consequences: first, State resources are not utilised to the full and, second and more important, it is extremely discouraging for people who have undertaken difficult and time consuming courses not to be able to gain employment at the end of the day.  These people will not be easily encouraged to follow further courses or avail of other educational opportunities.  It is very important, therefore, that we develop adequate audit or monotoring systems which will ensure that investment in education and training is properly utilised. We must also ensure that the institutions and bodies providing such educational facilities are sensitive to the changing needs of society.</P>
    <P>The report refers in some detail to the dangers of excessive demands for pay increases.  While it is only natural for people to endeavour to improve their standard of living, it is vital that pay increases remain at a realistic level.  The highly responsible attitude of the social partners and the trade unions to pay restraint has been a major factor in the dramatic recovery of our finances in recent years.</P>
    <P>There are four other factors which I consider highly relevant in terms of the performance of our economy up to the end of the decade.  First, there is an urgent need to reintegrate fully the activities of the various State agencies involved <Col N="766" /> either directly or indirectly in economic development.  All too often we have seen examples of duplication of services or inadequate communication between various agencies.  There is substantial scope for a more streamlined approach in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Second, I wish to deal with the likely effects of the major changes in our population during the coming years.  The ESRI report notes that our birth rate has fallen dramatically since 1980.  As a consequence, our population will become older during the next 20 years.  While this is likely to result in a decrease in the level of unemployment it also means that we will have to increase services in areas such as health and training.  It is vital that our economic development policies take the impact of such changes fully into account.</P>
    <P>My third point deals with the need to encourage major development of the exporting activities of Irish-owned companies. As foreign markets become more competitive and, despite international and EU trading regulations, more protected, it is vital that our companies develop positions of strength in some of these countries.  This has already taken place to some degree through the expanded activities of major food companies such as Dairygold, the Kerry Group, Avonmore, the Waterford Group and Golden Vale.  This pattern needs to be continued and deserves our full support.</P>
    <P>My final point deals with the need for a substantial increase in the availability of venture capital for new businesses and the expansion of existing enterprises. While Government policy has led to a definite improvement in the availability of such funds during the past year or two there is major scope for an improved performance in this area by the banks and other financial institutions.  There is no shortage of ideas, skills and energy among our excellent workforce and well educated young population.  If companies are encouraged and properly advised, particularly during the early stages of development, I have no doubt that any <Col N="767" /> investment will yield an excellent dividend in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the authors of this excellent report.  It is heartening to read such an encouraging overview of our economic prospects for the remainder of the decade.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the ESRI and Dr. Kieran Kennedy on the publication of this and other excellent reports.</P>
      <P>The ESRI states that Ireland will experience a period of rapid growth during the next five years and significant growth in employment.  It also states that this rapid growth could lead to a substantial increase in total employment. However, it warns that the rapid rise in the labour force means that the growth in employment will not be sufficient to absorb all labour market entrants.  It goes on to say that the combined effects of employment growth and the increases in the labour force and net emigration will lead to a slow reduction in the unemployment rate from its current high level to approximately 13.4 per cent by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>This is welcome news indeed; it is a very optimistic report in many ways.  We must note that its authors say that this could leave Ireland with one of the highest unemployment rates in the European Union.  One of the most significant phrases in this document is that &ldquo;Ireland will have the capacity, if it has the will, to address its most basic problem, that of unemployment&rdquo;.  We are also told that solutions will not be found if the economy is left on auto-pilot, that they will be dependent as much on changing attitudes among those at work &mdash; that is very significant and has implications for some recent agreements &mdash; as on Government policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> Three issues are identified if we are to make the most of this window of opportunity. The economy must not be left on auto-pilot and there must be changed attitudes among those at work.  A critical factor is the kind of Government policies to be pursued in this period.  The picture is not quite as rosy as was painted by the Taoiseach this morning.  I regret he did not avail of this opportunity to spell out some of the hard policy decisions that must be taken over the next few years or some of the key issues surrounding tax reform.  I have to agree with Deputy Rabbitte that, for the Taoiseach to come into this House and identify three areas as constituting serious tax reform is extraordinary and really must be questioned. He must be asked if what this Government means by tax reform is reduction in mortgage interest and VHI relief and taxing unemployment benefit?</P>
    <P>The report contends that competitiveness in labour costs must be maintained if high levels of unemployment are to be avoided.  It is also clear from this report that huge public policy changes will be necessary in relation to education and social welfare since demand in both areas will change dramatically.  We have not begun to debate the economic implications for our universities of the changing structure of our population.  We had better do so soon or there will be a crisis in many of those areas within the next couple of years because we will not have engaged in the type of long term planning that is essential given our changed population structure.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a quality, long term approach to be adopted by the Government, as opposed to the type of <i>ad hoc</i> changes we have often seen in relation to economic and social measures.  It is clear from the report that, from a public finances perspective &mdash; I have used the phrase already and repeat it &mdash; this is a window of opportunity.  We should be careful because there have been windows of opportunity before.  Making the most of this window of opportunity is dependent on high quality Government, on transparent, accountable public decision-making &mdash; the recent debacle on European <Col N="769" /> Union funding does not augur well in that respect &mdash; on placing at the top of the list of priorities an absolute, determined approach to tackle the problem of unemployment, particularly long term unemployment here.  If this opportunity is not grasped the consequences for the quality of life of our people, for our crime rate, for the creation of a society of &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;, a two-tier society, will be catastrophic.</P>
    <P>Probably this is the most critical period in terms of the kind of Ireland we want to see in the year 2000 and beyond.  The responsibility on Government, the social partners and the country as a whole to get it right is enormous.  It is simply unacceptable that the majority should have an increase in their living standards while simultaneously long term unemployment shows little change.  This is the cutting edge issue which will determine a great deal about Irish life in the years ahead.  I have not the slightest doubt that, as a society, over the next five years we must have the political will to adopt policies to tackle long term unemployment. We must move away from the prevailing belief that long term unemployment is a problem but not one about which we can do anything.  We must begin to create an atmosphere of confidence that this problem can be tackled.  It is very clear that the preceding two Government programmes failed miserably to tackle this issue.  It was not inevitable that the issue would not be tackled, but the correct policies were not adopted.  My colleagues, Deputies Richard Bruton and Yates, have clearly spelled out the failure of economic policies over the past four years in tackling this issue.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the report should say we have steady progress in most areas of economic life with the notable exception of unemployment.  I am very glad they used the word &ldquo;notable&rdquo; because it appears to be almost a misuse of terms to talk of economic progress while at the same time talking about our present high levels of unemployment.  The oft-quoted phrase, already used in the House this morning, is &ldquo;getting the fundamentals right.&rdquo; We do not have the fundamentals <Col N="770" /> right while we still have thousands of people condemned to a life of long term unemployment.  The next step clearly must be to ensure that we tackle that issue.</P>
    <P>The title of Chapter II of this report &ldquo;Where did all the growth go?&rdquo; is a damning indictment of the policies of this and the previous Government.  The common factor has been Fianna Fáil participation in both Governments.  We continue to have too high a level of Government indebtedness.  Current Government spending figures are worrying.  I pointed to that when I contributed to the budget debate.  The real reason the Government cannot deal seriously with economic or tax reform is simply that the public spending explosion has not been stopped or assessed sufficiently carefully.</P>
    <P>In a few years time, when the present growth cycle has slowed down.  I hope we will not be asking where did all this economic growth go.  The real danger is that the fruits of growth will be absorbed by extra public expenditure and the people will realise just how seriously the economy has been mismanaged.  Of course, that is the real reason for the imposition of inappropriate taxes, including the taxing of the widow's pension which, thanks to Fine Gael opposition, has been dropped.  Why do we need residential property tax and a reduction in income tax relief on VHI premia and mortgage interest?  It is clear that we have a free spending, reckless administration, not looking carefully at the fruits of growth.  The point has already been made this morning that the ordinary citizen does not feel the beneficial effects of the growth we are meant to be experiencing in our economy, according to the rosy picture the Taoiseach painted this morning. The ordinary citizen is feeling ever more pressurised by growing taxation and lack of tax reform.  I do hope the Minister for Finance pays attention to what is said in this report.  I note that the Taoiseach commented on the dangers of public spending in his remarks this morning.</P>
    <P>The report says that a reversal to irresponsible fiscal management must be <Col N="771" /> avoided.  We must also remember that international events and the world economy can throw up very unexpected challenges. There is no doubt that Europe overall faces the very severe challenge of dealing with unemployment.  Asia, the USA and China are taking trade from Europe, placing Europe in a vulnerable position overall, with no guarantee that that challenge will not increase.  The stringency required in public spending cannot be over-emphasised because the overall position in Europe presents us with such a crisis.</P>
    <P>Ireland is suffering from an exceptionally high level of long term unemployment and in 1991 we had the highest unemployment rate among the OECD member states.  In 1992 there were 92,000 women on the live register, an additional 44,000 in receipt of lone parents allowance and 70,000 women classified as dependent adults.  It must be recognised increasingly in public and financial policies that these people and others, who may not be eligible to register, share many of the characteristics of the long term unemployed in terms of their exclusion from the labour force.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the costs of not tackling unemployment.  The White Paper issued by the European Union recently stated that the economic and social costs of unemployment were enormous. These are comprised not only of the direct expenditure incurred in social security support for the unemployed but the loss of tax revenue the unemployed would contribute were they working, the increased burden on social services, rising poverty, crime, health costs and the rising levels of educational under-achievement.</P>
    <P>One really must look at the numbers of young people leaving school without the skills needed to enter or remain in the workforce.  There is a major challenge for public policy to ensure that young people leave school with greater skills.  It is clear that the most effective way to tackle the long term unemployment problem is to prevent the unemployed from drifting into long term unemployment. <Col N="772" /> This is where we must put our efforts.  There are some very disturbing statistics on the training offered by Government.  In 1992, the adult long term unemployed accounted for just 7 per cent of the beneficiaries of State assisted training.  That is an appalling indictment of the efforts we have made in training to help the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I counsel against complacency despite the optimistic picture in this report.  One cannot foretell what will happen economically or socially and the worldwide changes which are taking place in trade are unpredictable.</P>
    <P>The depth and seriousness of unemployment does not merit any complacency, rather it merits prioritisation and serious commitment and political will at the highest level across the social partnership and the political spectrum.  One cannot overemphasise the importance of tax reform.  The difference in costs for Irish employers employing one person, as opposed to English employers employing one person must be examined and we must have reform in this area, otherwise we will not create jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the ESRI report and acknowledge its optimistic outlook for the economy.  For the sake of this country I hope the forecasts will materialise.  Despite the optimistic outlook it is important that we do not become complacent.  The main Opposition party must ensure that the Government is kept on its toes and that it will not become complacent, that it will not misuse the obvious economic benefits which will come on stream not only with the improvements in the economy but with the extra money from Europe. Unlike what we did in the mid-seventies, late eighties and early nineties we must not miss this opportunity.  We have to learn from the lessons of the past when we had strong economic growth but did not capitalise on those advantages.  At this stage all sectors of society are beginning to realise it is difficult to run an economy and that one must have the co-operation <Col N="773" /> of all sectors to achieve the desired results.</P>
      <P>Despite the forecasts in the report there is no guarantee that interest rates will remain low.  We were optimistic about rates in the late eighties and early nineties but, owing to circumstances outside our control, they got totally out of control throughout Europe.  Interest rates are a major influence on investment and consumption levels.  Despite the present low level people are cautious. Rates will have to remain steady for some time before people have confidence to invest and borrow heavily.  They have learned from experiences in the past when they borrowed heavily on the grounds that interest rates would remain consistent.  Also, the currency markets may not remain calm.  As late as this week, the weakness in sterling caused major concern for several Irish exporters especially in the food, furniture and clothing sectors.  The Irish Exporters Association voiced their concern in the national media.  Were it not for the improvement in sterling yesterday, through the intervention of the banks, another crisis could be looming for Irish exporters.  We depend heavily on the English market where one-third of our products are exported.  It is important that sterling remains strong and that the Irish pound does not lose its competitiveness <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling.  A repeat of 1992 was feared if this trend continued. The English purchaser is aware of the strength of the Irish pound against sterling. This emphasises the importance of a single currency in Europe.  I understand that only 2 per cent of transactions in Europe are carried out using the ECU. It is important that we move rapidly towards a single currency especially for exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald referred to Ireland's attractiveness for mobile international investment.  I spoke with people from the Silicon Valley area last night who are looking increasingly towards the Pacific rim.  That company which had an interest in Europe and in Ireland in the early eighties and early nineties is now opening an office in Vietnam.  They see marvellous <Col N="774" /> opportunities in that whole area. That will present a major threat and provide major competition for mobile international investment.  One of the reasons so much mobile international industry came to Ireland in the late eighties and early nineties was the fear that American and other foreign investors would be excluded from the Single Market.  Now that the Single Market has come about they see it is not affecting them and that they can come into the Single Market with their products.  They are not as concerned now about exclusion and are looking to other markets and areas which would be cheaper as regards labour and other costs.</P>
    <P>The major problem facing us is unemployment. We will still have one of the highest rates of unemployment by the year 2000.  I appeal to the Government to focus its efforts on solving that problem. Delinquency, drug abuse, lawlessness and crime all stem from unemployment, having nothing to do, being disillusioned and marginalised.  Unless we can turn our good economic performance to advantage by creating a more equitable and contented society, all the progress we make will be useless.  We will have a divided society.  People who are working will do well and those who are unemployed will become increasingly less well off.  It is important that we avoid marginalising various sections of our people.</P>
    <P>This report examines the macro rather than the micro environment.  Our economic performance is reflected in rural areas.  It is predicted that there will be a decline in pupil numbers and that schools will close.  Rural Ireland is being ignored.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that I have not more time as I wished to refer to the relevance of costs in the tourism industry. However, the opportunity to contribute to this debate is welcome.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the ESRI Medium-Term Review 1994-2000 and echo the Taoiseach's comment that politicans from time to time are quick to criticise economists' reports for their lack of soul but the ESRI, always maintains a human touch whether their reports make cheerful reading or not. That is refreshing.  They always manage to link the economic and social dimensions. The authors of this report manage to keep the social agenda linked to the economic agenda.  That is an important point because economists are concerned with the bottom line, which is understandable, because everyone needs to know how much money they have to carry out their programmes.  Clearly the financial health of a nation is reflected in Government Departments which have to function within financial parameters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ESRI medium-term forecasts in the main have been accurate.  I welcome the ESRI report and, in particular, its forecasts of increased living standards and reduced unemployment.  These forecasts point to the success of this Government's policies in dealing with the problems facing us.  I agree with Deputy Frances Fitzgerald that it could lead to the belief that we no longer need to make special efforts to deal with the problem of unemployment, and in particular long term unemployment.  I am concerned also that this report could lead to the false belief that all our problems are over and that we no longer need to keep a tight rein on public expenditure.  We need to keep those two factors to the forefront as we simply cannot allow the financial rewards from the pain the community bore from 1987, when we successfully tightened our belts, to be dissipated by the whiff of good news.  We cannot allow expenditure to get out of hand and allow ourselves to indulge in our latest fantasy.  To do so would be to renege on the unemployed as there would be less finance available for them.  Deputy Fitzgerald and others echoed the Taoiseach's emphasis on the <Col N="776" /> need to be parsimonious with public expenditure.  I share that view as we cannot forget the number of long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the forcasted fall in the number of people out of work but we must remember that what we are talking about is a modest decline from a very high starting point.  It is forecast that over 250,000 people will be out of work in the year 2000 and that is not something to be complacent about.  The major task facing all of us is to reduce this figure consistently.  I do not need to detail the policies introduced by this Government to address the unemployment problem, such as the implementation of the Culliton and Moriarty reports, the work being done to improve the environment for small businesses and the overall improvement in taxation levels.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of the ESRI report is that while unemployment is set to fall, the rate of long term unemployment will fall much more slowly with the consequence that the long term unemployed as a proportion of the unemployed will grow constantly.  We must pay special attention to this.  The recently announced community employment &mdash; an amalgamation of the social employment scheme, team work and CEDP &mdash; will go some way towards addressing the problems of the long term unemployed but it is clearly not enough. Earlier I described community employment as a &ldquo;pact&rdquo; between the unemployed and their community.  I want to broaden that pack to take on board all those at local level who can help us build community employment and through it provide pathways to further progression opportunities, to education, training and, of course, jobs.</P>
    <P>Local area development programmes and community employment offer a real chance to get to grips with unemployment. FAS responded to the political imperative to become more involved in project work and much worthwhile work was done and continues to be done through the social employment scheme but I have stated publicly that projects need to have training and education <Col N="777" /> opportunities and, most importantly, trainees need vocational guidance to help them link up with employment opportunities. This is where the local area partnership offer people a real opportunity. There are now 12 local area partnerships and the number will be increased to 33 in accordance with an arrangement reached in the Taoiseach's office.  Local area partnerships comprise business people, the social partners and those who want to see their local community thrive. Often the business people are able to unlock doors for the unemployed.  I welcome the extension of this partnership and I aim to work closely with them. Community employment is a hands-on interventionist exercise.  The ESRI says on page 61 of its report:</P>
    <P>Even if employment growth were greater than forecast it is likely that many of the jobs would require skills which those who are unemployed do not have.  This highlights the importance of labour market policies aimed at increasing the skills and education of the unemployed, especially of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>To those who suggest that we leave it to the market to adjust matters I say that that simply cannot be done.  We need to achieve a balance between proper market forces and pro-active labour market initiatives so that the unemployed get a chance to return to the labour market.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about participation, citizenship, democracy and other fine ideals which we hold as public representatives but the greatest test of citizenship is whether a citizen has the right to participate in the local community, in other words, whether they have the opportunity to take up a job.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that we have not concentrated enough on the progression from the community employment programme, formerly the social employment scheme, where education and training are linked, to a thorough search by job placement officers for a job and placement for participants.  The reason the community employment programme will be more effective is that provision is <Col N="778" /> made for a longer training period.  If, after a period of one year, a person is progressing well, requires more training and no one else is waiting to take their place they will have an opportunity to remain on to gain more skills which would give them a better chance to gain employment.</P>
    <P>Community employment is a first step on the path; it introduces the participant to the world of work and its routine and it starts the process of rebuilding lost or dormant skills.  Community employment is a positive end in itself and community sector employers are well placed to provide work opportunities.  When looking for work one of the greatest problems the long term unemployed face is the attitude of employers.  Our experience to date demonstrates clearly the reluctance of employers to hire people who have been long term unemployed, even when generous subsidies are provided.  I ask employers to look at this issue again as we must foster a sense of kinship between those who can provide employment, those who are in employment and the unemployed.  The ESRI report state that special measures are needed to improve the skills of the long term unemployed as well as those in employment.  We need to foster a sense of solidarity which is reflected in the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and jobs.</P>
    <P>Another group on which I propose to concentrate my efforts in the coming months is those in danger of becoming long term unemployed, in particular those between 18 and 21 years.  It is unacceptable that young people should go straight from school on to the live register without having acquired some work-related skills.  The finest of young people have said to me &mdash; we have all met them in our clinics &mdash; they do not want to sign on the live register.  I am now examining all the schemes provided to such young people with a view to rationalising them into a new programme which I propose to call Youthstart and which will work in tandem with the EU Youthstart programme being devised by Commissioner Flynn in Brussels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> One of the bluntest messages from this ERSI report &mdash; I have spoken about its positive aspects; a humane approach is always adopted &mdash; is that &ldquo;a rising tide does not lift all boats&rdquo;.  The heady message of Seán Lemass in the 1960s was &ldquo;that a rising boat does lift all boats&rdquo;.  Despite the optimistic, although careful assumptions made by the ERSI and others there is still a need to take pro-active measures to deal with the high level of long term unemployment.  This can best be done in the local development areas which are set to increase from 12 to 33.  There is a need to promote a sense of solidarity within these areas between those in employment, the unemployed and those who can give them a start in life to unlock the door to opportunities at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for sharing her time with me and giving me an opportunity to speak to the ESRI report and focus on the question of intervention in the labour market.  As the Minister of State outlined, even though we will enjoy significant economic growth and prosperity in the years ahead we will continue to have a high level of long term unemployment.  There is a clear need for intervention in the labour market and introduce policies which target specifically the long term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many ways this ESRI report endorses the policies outlined in the National Development Plan under which significant resources will be allocated for training and education.  The report states that &ldquo;the proposed increase in public investment in this area in the medium to long term is very important&rdquo;.  I am delighted that the Minister of State proposes to introduce a Youthstart programme as no young student should have to join the dole queue automatically when they finish their leaving certificate. That is an appalling introduction to life. That is the reason I welcome the students' summer job scheme and the fact that increased resources are to be allocated for the community employment programme <Col N="780" /> which is to replace the social employment scheme.</P>
    <P>We need to offer our young people much more.  For far too long we have under-estimated the damage life on the dole can do to a young person's sense of self-esteem, confidence and belief.  We should try to eliminate the range of negatives attached to their first experience of having to sign on the dole.  We can begin to do this by introducing schemes such as Youthstart and allocating greater resources for programmes such as the community employment programme.  It is essential that we invest more and more in education and training.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report suggests that we are only now beginning to reap the benefits of the investment made in the eighties in education, in terms of increased skills, which has aided economic recovery.  In other words, there is a long term return, not short term.  It is important therefore that there be forward planning.  I was surprised that certain Opposition spokespersons ridiculed the National Development Plan because emphasis was placed on human resources and on the need to allocate resources for training and education. I fail to understand this and I would defend strongly and tenaciously this approach.  There is a need for unity in this House given that we have no option but to provide resources in these areas.</P>
    <P>While the rising tide did lift many boats in the sixties the jobs were not as highly skilled as they will be towards the end of this decade and into the next century. A high degree of skill and educational qualifications will be required.  Unfortunately, the statistics show that many of the long term unemployed do not possess these skills.  It is important therefore that we intervene to prevent children from leaving school too early.  In this regard I welcome the introduction of the six year school cycle.  We also need specific employment policies to prevent people from drifting into long term unemployment, to provide the long term unemployed with the necessary training to acquire the skills they need and enable <Col N="781" /> them re-enter the labour market with some confidence.</P>

It provides a great basis for discussion and there is much political content and thought involved in many of the implications in its recommendations. What type of speech would the Taoiseach have made if he had written it himself? Much of what he read out to the House this morning was drafted for him by his staff.  I would like to have heard his contribution had he drafted it himself, based on his business background.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The main aspect of this report is that at the end of the decade we will still be faced with more than 200,000 people out of work.  What is wrong with the mechanics or ability of Government that it cannot translate into jobs the potential of our young people, the potential inherent in our education system and the legislation passed in this House relating to financial mechanisms and so on?  Why are people's initiatives stifled when it is <Col N="782" /> projected that at the end of the decade we will still have 200,000 people unemployed?</P>
    <P>The report also predicts a decline of up to one-quarter in the school-going population in the next ten years which will give rise to great savings for the Government in power.  With the extra savings that will accrue to the Department of Education and with a surplus of teachers because of the decline in the school-going population, why can we not do some forward planning and provide extra tuition for children who need it? The resources which have been put into the training of teachers should not be lost because of a fall in the natural birth rate.</P>
    <P>The projected increase in the number of people between 50 and 65 years is proportionately huge and will mean additional costs for the Government.  In many rural areas people are moving from their houses to nearby towns and villages both for safety reasons and for comfort in later years.  Huge tracts of rural Ireland are dying.  In a parish on the western seacoast which I visited last week there are 110 houses, 49 of which are occupied by either one or two people all of whom are pensioners.  It is unlikely that children will ever live in those houses again.  Parishes such as that are literally dying by the week.  The Government's response to the Bishop's document, a Crusade for Survival, could have been drafted by anybody in three to four hours.  It is simply not a response and is filled with words such as &ldquo;should&rdquo; and &ldquo;would be&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the area of the marine, which was referred to as having great inportance, the recommendations of the task force stated that coastal zone management should be developed as a priority; that the protection and promotion of the sea fishing industry requires sustained and determined effort; the commitment to further well regulated development of the aquaculture sector based on local consultation should be enhanced; emphasis should be given to realising the potential of a local community-based approach to shellfish development; the Department of the Marine should bring forward, before the end of 1994, proposals <Col N="783" /> for a new licensing and planning framework and the development potential of angling tourism should be supported.  They were merely recommendations in the context of forthcoming electoral contests.  None of them is a commitment or contract by Government to deal with the problems with which people will be faced every day of the week.  The Government does not have the capacity to deal with the central problem emerging from this well written report, namely, that we will still have 200,000 people unemployed at the end of the decade, many of whom are currently attending school.  On leaving school some of them will go to college, attend third level courses, find jobs in the private sector or set up businesses because of their initiatives, but thousands will not fall into any of those categories.  Those are the people on which the State must concentrate.  It must provide them with a high standard of education and incentives to do what they can with their ability.  It must also provide well throught-out and regulated State-backed opportunities that will allow them to better themselves and remain in their local areas.</P>
    <P>I never cease to be amazed at people who see an initiative and develop it.  I had occasion to visit a printer's unit last week which started business with two employees less than 20 years ago.  Today that business employs more than 110 people and deals with very sophisticated printing facilities.  This is the result of one person's initiative.  We have great capacity as a people.  When our people are faced with a competitive instinct abroad they respond very favourably.  It is regrettable that our bureaucracy and the constraints placed on people by State Departments weigh down and block many people from using their initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Government's response by setting up county enterprise boards and regional authorities is not the answer.  The regional authority set up to deal with Galway, Roscommon, and Mayo is already £60,000 short in funding.  Why should a regional authority vested with particular responsibilities and terms of <Col N="784" /> reference be short of funds to do its job properly after only a few months in operation? Why should quangos or semi-Government bodies such as this be set up to give the perception that the problems of unemployment and others are being dealt with when they are not?  Why is the Government spending more than £2.5 million to project its view by public relations companies given that it has the largest majority in the history of the State and that most of the economic forecasts are good in terms of a low inflation rate, an economic boom and growth, an increase in living standards and improved lifestyles?</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputy's point about anti-tobacco legislation, but huge contracts are being given to public relations companies, programme managers and others to put forward the Government's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report is well written and contains much decent material, but the Government does not have the vision or capacity to tear away the layers of bureaucracy constraining business people from expanding, promoting exports, recruiting additional staff.  Not enough is being done in respect of education or providing opportunities at the appropriate level for those who have fallen into the category of depending on State assistance for the remainder of their lives.  The schemes that have been set up are only temporary, short term measures.  We will have to wait to see the implications of the Government's action in this regard but I do not hold out great hope for them in dealing with the central point identified by the ESRI report, namely, that at the <Col N="785" /> end of this century we will still be faced with an appalling unemployment rate of more than 200,000 people.  That prediction reflects a pathetic realisation of the Government's inability to cope with the fundamental problem of dealing with unemployment.</P>

      <P>At this time of the year many groups of primary and secondary school children visit this House.  They should be asked to study this document. Much of the indications in it provide good news for them, particularly for the primary school children who will be coming out of colleges onto the jobs market after the year 2000.  The message for them in the report is that they should stay in the education system for as long as possible. This message should be noted by those who will be seeking jobs in the near future: because of demographic factors the number of people coming onto the jobs market for the year 2000 will decrease substantially.  That has been a bedevilling factor of our economic and social policies.  In comparison with competitor countries we have had a steady and additional demand for jobs during the past ten to 15 years because of the population boom working its way through the educational system.  The predicted radical reversal of that pattern from the year 2000 provides an opportunity for us to reconsider many policies.</P>
      <P>I listened to much of this debate on the monitor in my office, and in the light of that radical new opportunity to analyse, assess and reconsider policies, I was disappointed that the Progressive Democrats proposed the same old formulae for cutbacks, a reduction in direct taxation and an attack on the public service.  Those proposals may have had a validity in the past decade but in the light of this report I would have expected a new approach. Its line of policy will be seen to have little value in the changing face of economic policy and, hopefully, social policy in the years ahead.  My approach is closer to that of Deputy Rabbitte who called for an improved social policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to a relative of the Minister and I will refer to another, <Col N="786" /> namely her father-in-law.  My approach to this matter is similar to that of our former Taoiseach and party leader.  The central challenge he sees arising from opportunities and cautions sounded in the report relates to a topic of which many people have referred, namely the huge number of unemployed.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16 April he is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>There are today almost 70,000 people who are aged over 35 and have been unemployed for over a year.  Very many of these &mdash; as well as some younger unemployed people &mdash; are now unlikely to get jobs here or elsewhere and, unless their plight is addressed in a far more radical manner than has yet been contemplated, they will remain in indefinite poverty and their children will be brought up in conditions of severe deprivation.</P>
    <P>We must face up to the prospect of growth not being one of controlled growth.  We will have people in employment, a large section of our community living better than they have ever lived, while a large minority will live in comparative conditions of severe deprivation. The majority of people employed would enjoy an unprecedented improvement in living standards.</P>
    <P>We have only to recall the uncontrolled expansion of consumerism, individualism and an unhealthy self-interest in England under Margaret Thatcher.  None of us would like to recreate the type of society created in the latter end of the Thatcher era.  That is the prospect if this growth is not controlled and used intelligently and sensitively.  If that were to happen it would indicate a gross failure on our part as politicians as we will be responsible for many of the decisions in distributing resources.</P>
    <P>The central forecast of the report suggests a period of substantial progress and improved living standards over the next decade.  It states in its introduction that Ireland will have the capacity, if it has the will, to address its most basic problem, that of unemployment.  However, it will not be found if the economy is left <Col N="787" /> on autopilot, it will require a change in attitude.</P>
    <P>We have all watched with interest the position in South Africa in the past few weeks.  I have had an interest in it for the past seven to eight years.  The South Africans have identified their lost generation. To some degree our unemployed are our equivalent of their lost generation of people who by virtue of their protest about the apartheid style education received no education.  Major problems are faced by young people in their early twenties who have been engaged in the struggle and received no education.  It is admirable that they had the foresight to identify those problems some years ago and established a programme to target that lost generation.</P>
    <P>This report does not have good news for our long term unemployed.  Their children may be able to look forward to a good future and to job opportunities if we intervene and advise them not to leave school too early.  There is no future for the unemployed unless we intervene.  The report, in its final section on interventions in the education area, identifies education and training as being important. Education is doubly valuable because it gives people a way out of becoming a long term drain on the social welfare system and provides valuable work in education and training areas.  From my experience of areas of a high level of social deprivation in my constituency, the schemes to date have been extremely effective.</P>
    <P>We have learned much about local programmes. Of all the schemes, the one that impresses me most and which is under-invested in is that providing an opportunity for the long-term unemployed to return to full-time education. There are only 3,000 places available on this scheme.  As Deputies on all sides of the House, including Deputy Martin who spoke a few minutes ago, said, this matter should be a priority.</P>
    <P>I regret there is not more time to discuss this important document which, if properly applied, could change the tone and emphasis of Irish politics, which has <Col N="788" /> moved to the right, and I include in that the parties who are traditionally of the left and whose policies are little different from those of the right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Mary Flaherty on her speech. It is important that we emphasise the commitment to public service, public values and social values and address the drift to the right that we have seen in recent years.  We have the best forecasts for our economy for 30 years.  Our economic performance is top of the European league.  There is a strong growth rate, roughly three times the European average, low inflation, a balance of payments surplus and a radical improvement in public finances.  Since the Government took office we have seen a resurgence of confidence in the economy, a growth in the numbers at work and a fall in unemployment figures.  We have delivered a stable fiscal environment, with falling interest rates and a return to buoyant economic growth.</P>
      <P>I am delighted, as a Labour Party Minister in the Department of Finance, we have delivered these tangible improvements in our economic performance.  Our management of the economy has shown that responsible fiscal policy and a commitment to quality public services can be compatible objectives.  I note that the ESRI forecasts, which envisage that we will reach the Maastricht debt-GNP ratio target of 60 per cent by the year 2000, also envisage continuing modest improvements, building on what we have already achieved in public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year there was a growth of 16,000 net non-agricultural jobs.  We were the only EU country, apart from Luxembourg, to record jobs growth last year. This year we expect jobs growth to rise to 24,000.  We have concluded a national pay deal which will maintain and improve international competitiveness and will deliver stability for business to plan ahead.  If we are to achieve the targets which the ESRI says we can achieve, it will be critically dependent on maintaining that level of competitiveness and <Col N="789" /> not choosing to pay so much to people in work that we cannot reduce the numbers out of work.  If new and small enterprises respond positively to the better markets, lower interest rates and new business incentives, the jobs forecasts will be even better.</P>
    <P>The reduction in interest rates is very important in that it makes much more sense to invest money rather than leave it sitting in the bank.  We have had a very high savings ratio but a very low investment ratio.  I would tell Irish business that, as the jobs potential is there, the market is there, there is confidence in the economy, interest rates are low and the opportunities are there, they should go out and invest.  We must ensure there is investment in the real economy rather than in a property boom, with a growth in house and other property prices and no worthwhile improvement in job numbers.  There should be genuine productive investment rather than investment in financial assets and land speculation.</P>
    <P>The IDA is attracting a record number of new jobs at present and, from what has been announced and what we know is in the pipeline, we expect that the multinational sector will deliver an extra 9,000 industrial jobs in 1994.  This year has been the best for many years for the IDA in attracting jobs and that is a measure of confidence in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Creating sustainable employment was our central concern in framing this year's budget.  We set about shifting the burden of taxation away from income in a package that will lower personal income taxation in a full year by £330 million.  People such as the Progressive Democrats talk about tax reform, but real tax reform involves restructuring the tax system away from property and in favour of work and of reducing taxes on income.  In its brief period in Government, the Progressive Democrats did not deliver on tax reform on such a scale.  A reduction of £330 million in personal income taxation is real tax reform.  The budget had a particular focus on the low paid.  Again, that is real tax reform rather than simply <Col N="790" /> concentrating on the people at the top. The budget focused on those most likely to become trapped in unemployment if they lose their jobs and gave an employment boost to vulnerable sectors by reductions in employer PRSI in the lower income range.</P>
    <P>The national plan will give a major boost to jobs, investment and long term growth potential.  The plan has been virtually finalised with Brussels and my officials are tidying up the small print prior to its circulation and translation. We expect the formal launch to take place in mid-June, following which we will be in a position to draw down substantial funds for investment in Ireland's economic potential.  The Department of Finance is preparing new guidelines on project evaluation and management: Patrick Honohan, in the medium-term prospectus report, makes very good points on this matter, to ensure that we get the maximum value from the investment of EU and Irish funds under the plan so that not a single ecu is wasted.</P>
    <P>As the ESRI review points out, one effect of a strongly growing economy, out-performing our European partners, is that we are likely to exceed 75 per cent of European GDP within the next couple of years.  It will clearly be more difficult in 1999 to negotiate funding on the scale we have been receiving, although we intend to be around and to carry out that negotiation.  It is critical that we get value for money from investment under the national plan.  In the longer term, as Ireland's economy and output per head converges to the European average, we must look forward and plan for the day when we are no longer net recipients in Europe but become net contributors. With European transfers now amounting to more than 3 per cent of GDP there is a danger that certain economic sectors will become long term dependent on transfers of money from outside.  We must use these transfers to build up our economic capacity for self-sustaining growth for the time when transfers on this scale are no longer available to us.</P>
    <P>The forecast of substantial improvement in Ireland's economic performance <Col N="791" /> provides a unique opportunity to tackle hardcore unemployment.  As the conclusion to the ESRI report states: &ldquo;Ireland will have the capacity, if it has the will, to address its most basic problem &mdash; unemployment&rdquo;.  Good economic news must be translated into a concentration on the areas of disadvantage, particularly in tackling long term unemployment. The fruits of growth must not be confined to those already in work, enhancing the living standards of the comfortably off or generating a property boom.  They must be distributed to make a real difference to communities at risk, to the disadvantaged and the long term unemployed, even though that may involve lower growth in living standards for those already in jobs.  As the residential property tax has shown, the voices of the comfortable are much louder in society than are the voices of the excluded.  Our task is to show that the leadership which will ensure that the fruits of growth are used to bring the excluded in from the margins and overcome the barriers to their participation in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Rising tides do not lift all boats, and economic growth is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for tackling unemployment. The new jobs created when our economy grows are most likely to go to the well educated, to returning emigrants and to increasing numbers of women participating in the workforce.  It is interesting that between 1987 and 1993 there was an increase of 55,000 women in employment an no change in the total number of men in employment.  Without special measures the jobs market leaves the unqualified, early school leavers and the long term unemployed last in the queue, or more likely, outside the jobs market altogether.  The improvement in the economic outlook and, from the late 1990s, in the balance between those retiring and those coming on the jobs market for the first time, will make it easier for young people with education and skills to get jobs.  However, those who leave without any qualification are likely to add to the 60 per cent-plus unemployment <Col N="792" /> rate and to form the next generation of long term unemployed unless the extra resources generated by economic growth are targeted effectively to breaking that cycle.</P>
    <P>The pattern of people becoming trapped in long term unemployment has been remarkably stable and reductions in the flow into unemployment will not address the problem of the stock of long term unemployed, 130,000 of whom are currently out of work for a year or more. Past figures show that less than 20 per cent of those out of work a year or longer get back into the workforce.  Breaking that cycle and the problem of hardcore unemployment is a crucial task.</P>
    <P>I have allocated a substantial share of the resources in our national plan to rebuilding the economic potential of the long term unemployed to bring them back into the economic mainstream.  The Local Development Programme will reach into unemployment blackspots and offer an imaginative and integrated development programme.  The Community Employment Programme, which is a significant improvement on the old SES, will offer 40,000 places this year, a major change in the scale of public action on unemployment.  None of these proposals is cast in stone: it is important that we constantly improve our response in the light of experience and realise that it is as important for us to learn from failure as it is to learn from success.</P>
    <P>Training and education are part of the process of rebuilding economic potential, as well as community action and genuine devolution of power and resources to local communities to help them devise programmes reflecting their local needs. A community which believes in its potential is in a good position to unlock that potential and to offer hope to its young people growing up.  In many of the community development or partnership programmes there have been practical and tangible examples of that work in areas such as Ballymun and Finglas, to which Deputy Flaherty referred, Moyross and Southill in Limerick and in other areas. There have been unemployment blackspots but the communities have come <Col N="793" /> together in a targeted way to tackle disadvantage and to unlock and rebuild their economic potential.  They are achieving major success.  We want to resource and increase that development and ensure that rebuilding the potential of the unemployed becomes a core feature of Government policy, that unemployed people will no longer be on the margins but brought back into the system.  No economy can operate if it leaves one tenth of its workforce, the present figure for long term unemployed, outside the economic picture and not in a position to contribute of their talents to society.  We must bring those people back into the economic system.  That is the clear intention of the Local Development Programme to which we have allocated approximately £1,000 million of resources under the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>Left to their own devices, private employers are simply not interested in hiring the long term unemployed when they have their pick of school leavers. An interesting survey of employers was carried out recently by the Tallaght partnership. There has been notable success in the efforts of the area partnership companies in drawing up inventories of the talents and skills of the unemployed workforce in their communities and in persuading private employers to take people from their registers.  We need positive discrimination to ensure that a share of the vacancies are filled by people from the long term unemployment register. We must use our training budgets creatively, anticipate skill shortages and ensure that the long term unemployed have the ability to slot into vacancies as they arise.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, even with very optimistic economic forecasts, we know that the private sector alone will not come up with the answers and there will remain a substantial role for community employment, bringing the talents and enthusiasm of people now out of work to bear in delivering new services to the community. One of the most exciting and imaginative programmes I have seen in action in the area of community employment <Col N="794" /> has been the arts squads, which bring vision and imagination to the whole area of community arts.  Wonderful work is being done in those areas.  There are jobs to be done around the country in caring for the elderly and the ill, improving the environment and providing community services.  We can find and are finding better ways of bringing talents and potential of unemployed people to work thereby improving the quality of life for the community.</P>
    <P>Looking at the whole area of community employment, there is to some degree a tension between the quantity of what we do and the quality of what we are able to do.  The clear message I am hearing from unemployed people is that the quality of programmes is preferable to spending resources too thinly.  That confronts us with choices; whether we opt for 40,000 places on a community employment programme or 20,000 places on a more intensive and higher quality community employment programme offering longer duration employment to the participants.  Those are the real and difficult choices we have to face.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the report of the National Economic and Social Forum on how we can improve our response to long term unemployment and improve community employment programmes.  I look forward also to the practical results of the pilot programme involving 1,000 places this year on the CMRS's imaginative work option.</P>
    <P>There has been a fall of one-third in the birth rate since 1980 and the total child population under 15 will have fallen by a quarter by the year 2005.  One of the major policy choices we face as a society is how we use the opportunities and resources freed up by this major demographic change to focus particularly on the hardcore unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Last year, all the teachers released as a result of the fall in primary school numbers where redeployed in remedial education or in disadvantaged schools.  There is a clear choice to be faced between reducing class sizes generally &mdash; and reaping whatever marginal difference there is between teaching a class of 29 or one of <Col N="795" /> 28 &mdash; or targeting sources where they can really make a difference in preventing another generation of early school leavers from being destined to become tomorrow's long term unemployed.  I would much prefer to see those extra resources used in Headstart programmes, in remedial education, in targeting disadvantage and in second-chance education for those who lost out first time around than to see them deliver less perceptible improvement when spread over the population as a whole.</P>
    <P>I note that one of the Progressive Democrats spokespersons calls the Minister for Education the minister for disadvantage and intends it as an insult.  The Minister for Education bears that title with a badge of pride.</P>
    <P>At second level, reaping the demographic dividend will take more time, first, because of the welcome increase in participation levels post junior certificate and, second, because of the decision taken under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to add a compulsory extra year for second level schools precisely at the top of the demographic peak when today's 14 year olds, children of the 1980 boom year, complete their junior certificate.  It will take longer for us to be in a position to use a demographic dividend and to put more resources into second level to help disadvantaged communities.  Again, we face the choice at second level of whether we spread resources thinly among schools around the country to reduce marginal class sizes or whether we use it in a targeted way to prevent a new generation of early school leavers who are likely to become tomorrow's long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Managing the changes caused by falling numbers in our education system is a major task.  In a society where publicly funded education comes under a variety of different ownership and management structures, it is critical to have interschool co-operation, and indeed proper regional structures, rather than rivalry, to ensure that competition for falling numbers does not further marginalise disadvantaged <Col N="796" /> pupils.  We would ill-serve the pupils who most need our help if certain schools cream off the more academically able pupils, leaving other schools to become the dump schools in an area.  That would not serve anybody in our community.  Whatever the legalities of ownership, where public money is allocated to a school, it is important to effect a result that is of benefit to the whole community.  In County Clare, for example, the whole area of managing a declining population and school amalgamations was well run with the co-operation of the Church authorities, the vocational education committee and so on.  That serves as a model for how these issues should be managed.</P>
    <P>Falling child numbers lead in the long term to a problem of larger old age dependency with a small population at work.  This raises issues of long term funding for pensions and setting aside resources in time against that eventuality. The opportunity offered by a more favourable demographic picture is, therefore, transient and there is a limited window of opportunity which frees up extra resources in our society to tackle hardcore unemployment.</P>
    <P>The prospects for growth as outlined in the ESRI report present us with tremendous opportunities but we need to grasp them on behalf of the least advantaged in society rather than using them simply to make the well off more comfortable.</P>

      <P>The message from the ESRI report is clear.  Even if the relatively optimistic forecasts are fully realised, there is still no scope for complacency. This report and the information it contains should be important for the Government and our policy makers generally in the way they form public policy for the remainder of this decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> On the face of it the report seems to give grounds for optimism.  However, on deeper examination the news is far from good.  The prospects for the long term unemployed are dire and the predicted increase in emigration is alarming.  The effects of projected demographic trends allied to increased emigration will inevitably drain the country of our youth, energy and creativity and sap the spirit of the nation.  Emigration not only inflicts hardship on families but affects communities. I know communities which cannot field a football team.  It also affects consumer purchasing power which, in turn, affects the economy.</P>
    <P>This is too high a price to pay for an increased standard of living.  We have been warned and now is the time for action.  The challenge for the Government is to forge policy in such a way that all citizens benefit from the projected improvement.</P>
    <P>The single most alarming prediction in the report is that the level of unemployment will be about 200,000 at the end of the decade.  This figure is unacceptably high.  No country can sustain such unemployment. The economic effects are disastrous. The ugly social side-effects are even more alarming.  Government policy must take on board the moral necessity to ensure everyone benefits from the fruits of our prosperity.  We cannot exclude the long term unemployed and their children.</P>
    <P>If the report does nothing else my hope is it will put job creation at the top of the Government's agenda and that the Government will use its energies to tackle the unemployment crisis.  Unemployment has been remarkably absent from the top of the Government agenda for the past few months.  The Progressive Democrats have argued for radical pro-jobs tax reform since their formation. While in Government for a short period we strove systematically to bring that about.  Our record in that regard stands no matter what anyone in the House suggests. In Opposition we offered to be part of an all-party group to work towards consensus on how radical tax reform can be brought about.  As a party we pledged <Col N="798" /> our support to any initiative in that direction.</P>
    <P>A programme of pro-jobs tax reform cannot be achieved over one or two budgets but must be brought about through a coherent series of steps spread over as many as five budgets.  If ever a Government was well positioned to carry out such an exercise it is this one.  It has the biggest majority since the foundation of the State and also stands to have the longest term of office of any Government in recent times.  If pro-jobs tax reform is on the agenda nothing can stand in its way.  What has it done to date?  Two budgets were introduced.  The first, with the ill-fated 1 per cent levy, was nothing more than a weak holding operation.  The second attempted to reduce employers PRSI but it was reduced at the lower end of the scale and increased at the upper level.  This represented a scoreless draw for employment prospects.  While we all appreciate the decrease at the lower level it is not radical PRSI reform.  It merely pushes the limits around and does not improve the overall position.  This approach would be fine if it were the intention to create a low scale, low pay economy, but if it is the policy to stem the brain drain, this measure will be counterproductive.  I took a rain check of the various pharmaceutical industries and co-operatives around Cork harbour and in the Munster region.  I was told that this measure would militate against the creation of additional jobs.  The money that could be used to employ highly skilled workers will now go to the Government coffers in the form of increased PRSI payments.  That is the effect it will have on the employment of graduates.</P>
    <P>We are told that the key to our future is competitiveness.  How can we compete if we create a tax regime which forces our brightest, brainiest and best people to emigrate?  We educate our top graduates to the highest level and export them to work for our competitors.  Highly skilled Irish born and educated workers are employed abroad, working against our economy.  If it is the Government's intention to stem the brain drain they must look in the next budget at the impact <Col N="799" /> employers' PRSI at the higher level has on the employment of graduates.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are deeply concerned about the long term prospects for the unemployed.  We must not create a two-tiered nation.  The long term unemployed cannot be left behind.  There is a strong onus on the Government to introduce an education/training programme which will bring them on board.  There would be plenty of work to be done if through our taxation system and other measures we could unleash the potential for job creation in the small industry sector, the services sector and the food processing sector.  With proper planning and budgetary provision 200,000 people will not be unemployed by the year 2000 as is predicted in the report.  If it happens it will be as a direct result of the failure of Government policy and the Government will stand condemned.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to embark on a five-year programme of radical pro-jobs tax reform and examine our training and education programmes to ensure nobody is left without a job because they do not have the necessary skills as is the case for many long term unemployed.  We must create an enterprise culture which will ensure that people will not only be employed but will create jobs for others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 43 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, last winter saw a period of particularly bad weather which had a severe effect on the Irish fishing industry.  A report presented to me by BIM indicated that the number of bad weather days during the months of November to January had increased from 37 in 1992-93 to 43 in 1993-94.  Given that 1992-93 was also a poor year in terms of bad weather, a more realistic comparison would be with the winter of 1991-92, when the number of bad weather days between November and January was 16.</P>
      <P>The BIM report also indicated that the value of landings for the period November 1993 to January 1994 by the whitefish fleet was down by 30 per cent compared to the corresponding period in 1992-93, and by 40 per cent compared to 1991-92.  I am aware that the poor weather persisted into February and March of this year and I am continuing to monitor the situation.</P>
      <P>It was against this background that I recently announced the details of an aid scheme to alleviate the hardship that had been caused in the fishing industry.  While the total amount of aid will ultimately depend on the take-up by the industry, up to £5 million has been provisionally earmarked for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> As I explained to the House on 20 April, the scheme will be administered by BIM and will focus in particular on relieving the hardship suffered by owners and crews of boats that were restricted from undertaking normal winter fishing activity because of the extreme weather. In determining hardship, the scheme will also take account, as appropriate, of the loan servicing difficulties of boats that had been inactive due to the bad weather. In addition, a limited assistance will be made available to shellfish fishermen towards the replacement of gear lost or damaged.  Payments to crews will be based broadly on the rate of support available under social welfare unemployment schemes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all fishermen who have been affected by the extreme weather will be eligible for aid under this scheme and, therefore, totally reject Deputy Bradford's suggestion to the contrary. As I indicated, aid will be available to crews as well as boat owners.  In addition, fishermen from all areas will be eligible for aid subject to the criteria I have set out.  The scheme is an indication of the Government's underlying commitment to the fishing industry and its desire to react positively to the difficulties confronting it.  This is the first time a scheme of this nature has been put in place by any Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and concede that this is the first time such a scheme has been put in place.  However, the weather has been so bad in recent months that some aid had to be given to coastal communities if boat owners and fishermen were to remain in operation.  I am glad to learn that the aid will not simply be confined to boat owners.  Will the Minister outline the criteria under which skippers who do not own boats, deckhands and other crew members will be able to qualify for aid?  Under the social welfare code some of these people qualify for limited assistance.  Will this assistance be taken into account in determining eligibility for aid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="802" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Having indicated in the public domain my intention to introduce an aid package, Deputy Deasy subsequently raised the matter in the House. Eligibility for aid will be determined by reference to substantial losses of income from landings as a result of the bad weather <i>vis-à-vis</i> the corresponding periods for the previous two years. Claims must be supported by log sheets, sailing notes, losses-difficulties which are significant in the context of the total annual income-outgoings of the boat and any other payments or incomes received by the applicant from other sources, for example, the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The payments will be determined on the basis of the circumstances in each case.  I would like to think &mdash; it has been suggested otherwise &mdash; that the aid package will be administered urgently and efficiently.  I would also like to think that any applicant who thinks that his or her application has not been dealt with fairly by BIM will be able to make an appeal to the Minister.  In any event, I hope there will not be too many appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully the Minister envisages that the aid package will be fairly widespread.  However, funding will remain a problem.  While I welcome the £5 million compensation package, does the Minister's request to the EU for £10 million for this purpose indicate that he does not think that the aid package is sufficient?  When the matter was raised in the House three or four weeks ago it was pointed out that the IFO and other fishermen organisations had sought £13 million in aid.  The Minister said in reply that that figure had been plucked out of the air.  Detailed records for the past few years indicate that the figure of £13 million was a reasonable estimate of the losses suffered by fishermen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Brevity, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that this amount would be necessary to respond to the crisis.  While I welcome the £5 <Col N="803" /> million aid package, is it a sufficient response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new aid package, to which the Minister for Finance generously agreed.  Organisations other than the IFO felt that the figure of £5 million was reasonable.  This is a very fair response to a serious problem.  The weather in recent months has been horrendous and when I was in the west at Easter I saw the difficulties under which fishermen are operating.  For those and other socially just reasons the Government in its wisdom supported this package. The total amount of aid will ultimately depend on the take up by the industry.  Based on the information available about the extent of the hardship being experienced by fishermen I am satisfied that the aid package of £5 million will be sufficient to compensate those fishermen whose livelihoods have been affected by the bad weather.</P>
      <P>I wish to put on the record the position in regard to tax clearance.  Normal Government tax clearance procedures require that any applicant receiving a payment of between £500 and £5,000 must indicate their tax district, furnish their tax reference number and indicate that their tax affairs are in order.  Any applicant receiving a payment in excess of £5,000 is required to furnish a current tax clearance certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 42 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise Deputies that the final report of the sea trout task force was presented to me on 28 March last by its Chairman, Dr. T. K. Whitaker, and has been published.  I am glad to have this opportunity to record my appreciation of the whole-hearted dedication of the Chairman and all members of the task force to fulfil their remit so comprehensively and within such a short period of time.</P>
      <P>Members will recall that I established the sea trout task force in July 1993 with one item only on the agenda, which was to address the survival of this heritage of ours, sea trout, and to advise on additional strategies needed to combat sea trout declines.  The membership of the task force represented all interested parties including fishery owners, fishery boards and salmon farmers as well as An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and departmental officials.  It is interesting to note &mdash; and I addressed the issue on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; on television the other evening &mdash; that all participants signed the report, right across the broad spectrum.  This report is now in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warmly welcome the report of the task force as constituting a positive and timely contribution to understanding and tackling the complex issues involved.  As a consensus report, the outcome of wide-ranging analysis and constructive debate by all concerned, its findings and recommendations offer a practical framework for action and I am now proceeding on that basis.  I am also proceeding on the basis of consensus.  The approach to this very serious position in that agreement <Col N="805" /> must be reached as a matter of urgency by fin fish farmers, salmon fish farmers and those people espousing the cause of the &ldquo;save our sea trout&rdquo; campaign, is fundamental to the heritage we and subsequent generations hope to enjoy.</P>
    <P>Implementation by the Department of the various task force recommendations, therefore, is already under way.  The necessary adjustments to the 1994 sea trout action programme on conservation, management rehabilitation and research are being finalised as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>The short and long term corrective measures on sea lice control recommended by the task force &mdash; there are 33 recommendations &mdash; are incorporated in the ongoing sea lice management programme which has been enhanced to ensure the highest level of monitoring, control and reporting arrangements recommended in this excellent report. Ongoing results form lice monitoring programmes show that lice levels are being controlled at satisfactorily low levels.  Fish farm management, fallowing strategies and lice monitoring programmes are being overseen and co-ordinated by the senior scientist of the Fisheries Research Centre &mdash; a man of considerable reputation &mdash; now based in the west to ensure a proper regional approach, who will report regularly to the Department and to the successor body of the task force.  The work of the task force will not cease now since there will be a successor body to it &mdash; that is how seriously I perceive the problem &mdash; until there is a solution to the problem we all seek to resolve in the national interest.</P>
    <P>In line with the task force's recommendation, sea trout conservation by-laws have been renewed for 1994.  The additional refinements to these by-laws, as recommended in the report, were also finalised this week.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that it should be replaced by a continuing body, representing the same interests as the task force, which will monitor the results of inspections and research, maintain the process of communications and dialogue and advise on further action as necessary.  I assure Deputies that the <Col N="806" /> necessary arrangements for this body are being put in place as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>The task force has endorsed fallowing regimes and single bay management as sound fish farm management practices and as effective long term means of controlling sea lice and other pathogens.  Fallowing strategies will be further developed and co-ordinated at regional level in line with the task force recommendations.</P>
    <P>The task force has advised that, for pressing economic and social reasons, the national objective must be to combine the commercial development of sea farming with the preservation of the sea trout as an important contribution to local income and employment.  The task force also advises that it is important to ensure the compatible progress of both sea trout angling and sea farming as sources of jobs and income in disadvantaged areas.  We are talking about peripherality here, about the translation of a philosophy into political practice.  In line with the thrust and emphasis of the report, I am confident that implementation of the recommendations of the task force will enable the objective of compatible and complementary development to be achieved in the interests of our rural communities</P>

      <P>I express my sincere satisfaction and thanks to the Minister for his wide-ranging reply, since this saga or difference of opinion has continued for some time and the position had not improved up to the very recent past.  I very much welcome the establishment of this task force, bringing all interested parties together, who should be able to work more successfully in the future.  As all Members representing constituencies bordering the seas around our coast will know, fishing for sea trout was a tremendous tourist attraction.  I have been informed by people in the fishing industry that sea trout had become scarce because of infestation by sea lice.  With the establishment of this task force I hope that public relations between all the relevant bodies will improve.</P>

      <P>In relation to the decline of the sea trout, the fact that the task force reported what is described as a casual link, or what scientists described as anecdotal evidence of the existence of the sea lice on salmon and its infestation of the white trout, the Deputy will be aware that numbers of sea lice get around the fins of salmon trout, which is where the damage is caused.  I should like to think that, as a direct result of this new regime, the problem that has obtained for some years past, first identified in 1987-88, will be addressed in a really positive manner for the first time resulting in a decline in the presence of sea lice on salmon farms.</P>

      <P>The application of the terms of the European Economic Area Agreement in so far as fisheries is concerned is limited by Article 20 of the agreement which provides that the,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provisions and arrangements that <Col N="808" /> apply to fish and other marine products are set out in Protocol 9&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Thus, the remainder of the agreement, including Article 31 which provides for the right of establishment does not apply to the fisheries sector.</P>
    <P>Norway currently has limited access to the Irish zone for a very small number of non-quota species.  This access will not change under the EEA.  Iceland currently has no access to the Irish zone.  There is no provision in the agreement for Icelandic vessels to have such access in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the &ldquo;freedom of establishment&rdquo; clause constitutes a legal figleaf permitting Spanish vessels to register in Britain or Ireland and fish against British or Irish quotas with the blessing of the European Union?  Article 31 permits the Norwegian and Icelandic vessels to avail of the same concessions.  If the freedom of establishment was unable to curb the Spanish and Portuguese invasion how will it curb the Norwegian and Icelandic invasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not concede that the Spanish Armada has landed in the Irish jurisdiction.  As the Deputy is aware, until 1 January 1996 the Spanish and Portuguese, under the Iberian Accession of 1986, are bound to stay outside the 50 mile zone &mdash; the 72,000 square miles &mdash; but after that date they will have access to it.  I am trying to limit their access on a number of grounds on which I cannot dwell because it would take too long.  To reply specifically to the Deputy's question, the negotiations allowed the Norwegians to fish for a non-quota species, such as blue whiting, dogfish, basking shark and porbeagle.  None of these fish is subject to a quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Norwegians pass the referendum &mdash; the opinion polls are giving a strange message in that regard &mdash; and join the European Union we will have an entitlement for the first time to go into their waters to pursue mackerel.  That will become a matter of regulation; at present <Col N="809" /> it is a matter of practice with their permission. From any point of view the balance of advantage in relation to Norwegian accession lies with us rather than with the Norwegians.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the framing of the EA agreement, there is a distinct possibility that Norwegian and Icelandic fishing interests may decide to exercise their newly acquired freedom of establishment rights.  As well as that it is clear that Iceland, which has now suffered a severe reduction in its cod quota, may have immediate rights to fish in Irish waters by virtue of the fact that it is establishing rights to Rockall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy and I will visit Rockall some day and address that problem.  Article 31 of the European Area Agreement provides for the freedom of establishment of nationalism in an EU member state or in an EFTA country in the territory of any other free State.  Freedom of establishment includes the right to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons and to set up and manage undertakings.  Annexes 8 to 11, referred to in Article 31, relate to matters such as insurance, telecommunications, carriage of goods, bar people, by road, sea or air.  The EA provisions relate to provisions contained in Article 20 of the agreement which provides that &ldquo;provisions and arrangements that apply to fish and other marine products are set out in Protocol 9&rdquo;.  We have dealt in detail with Protocol 9 on a number of occasions in the past but if the Deputy wants the full reference to that Protocol I can give it to him.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to amend the Defence Forces (Amendment) Act, 1933, to revert to the position operating prior to its enactment, that Irish troops could only participate in United Nations peace-keeping, as distinct from peace-enforcement operations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amending legislation &mdash; Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993 &mdash; enacted last year was an essential prerequisite to sending Irish troops to Somalia.  Without the amendment of the Act they could not have participated in the UN mission in Somalia.  Neither peacekeeping nor peace-enforcement is referred to in the legislation.  Irish troops in Somalia are serving there as a transport unit in a logistics role.  This has been the position since they first went to Somalia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My question to the Minister clearly asks if the Minister has any intention of amending the Defence Forces (Amendment) Act, 1993.  Does he intend to amend that Act, particularly as his stated view is that it is wrong for Irish troops to be involved in peace enforcement duties?  How can he reconcile that view with the fact that he brought amending legislation before this House specifically to enable Irish troops to become involved in such activities? Does he not see this as a breach of collective responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see it as a breach of collective responsibility.  I realise there are two persona &mdash; private and public &mdash; in a Minister and that the public person takes precedence.  I will not be constrained, nor do I feel in danger of shifting responsibility for decisions taken by Government or running away from my <Col N="811" /> responsibilities.  On the other hand I have always, even before I became a Minister, expressed the view that the role of the United Nations and that of its members should primarily be peacekeeping.  The Deputy asked a number of questions in relation to the legislation I introduced, first whether there is any intention of repealing the Defence Forces (Amendment) Act, 1993.  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  As stated in the reply neither peacekeeping nor peace enforcement is referred to in the legislation.  Under the legislation as it stands no new armed overseas missions, involving more than 12 Irish troops, may be undertaken without the specific approval by way of a resolution of Dáil Éireann.  My attitude to peace enforcement is well known.  I regard it as counterproductive. It is too simplistic to link directly peace enforcement with the legislation enacted last year.  That legislation was essential if Ireland was to send troops to Somalia.  In that regard Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter specifically provides for peace enforcement.  Under that Chapter legislation was brought in as a vehicle to allow our troops to go into Somalia.  We responded to the request from the United Nations.  Our troops are in Baidoa.  The function of our 81 troops, men and women, is in a logistics context. They are serving in the name of peace, Ireland and the international community in Somalia doing an excellent job courageously in difficult circumstances, carrying supplies from Baidoa and Mogadishu in difficult terrain.  I do not have too many excuses to offer the Deputy in relation to my stated public and private positions.  If there is a conflict between my private and public position, the public position must take pre-eminence.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Minister in his assumption that I am asking him to make excuses for his actions; I am not.  I am asking him to explain them because there is a very serious question at issue.  The Minister for Defence brought legislation before the House which he admits today, and which <Col N="812" /> was obvious at the time, specifically enabled Irish troops to engage in peace enforcement duties, albeit in a transport form on this occasion.  I presume that was a compromise the Minister managed to extract because of his position on peace enforcement.  The question is whether the Minister was right to bring forward legislation enabling Irish troops to become involved in a situation where clearly life was at risk and while he disagreed &mdash; and continues to disagree &mdash; with peace enforcement?  If the Minister continues to be the Minister for Defence is he prepared to stand over further Government decisions to send Irish troops on peace enforcement duties when he clearly is opposed to that kind of role for our Defence Forces?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of £3.5 million has already been spent on maintaining and upgrading the facilities at the naval base between 1987 and 1993.  On the specific question of using the naval base as a centre for controlling importation of drugs, that quite frankly had not occurred to me and the Deputy's suggestion is helpful.  I would imagine that the Naval Service would act in aid of the civil power and in the context of drug trafficking that there would be close co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Naval Service to prevent drugs coming into the country.  I understand the Departments of Defence and Justice are discussing the matter of ongoing co-operation <Col N="817" /> in dealing with drug trafficking. There is a common cause between the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána to prevent this obscene traffic.</P>

If the Navy in the course of carrying out a search discover drugs and not a fish in a secret hold I am sure they would not pat the captain on the back and say &ldquo;carry on&rdquo;, rather they would apprehend the boat.  That is the way the scheme operates.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos 8, 17, 20 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I can sympathise with the views expressed in these questions.  On a number of occasions I have met widow's organisations to consider the position of widows who have suffered as a result of the actions taken by their husbands. Provision for the payment of pensions to the widows and children of deceased soldiers was first made in 1978 when a contributory pensions scheme for such dependants was introduced.  Soldiers serving at the time were included as members of the scheme unless they made a positive option in writing not to become members.  A second opportunity to make provision for their dependants was granted in 1985 when all soldiers who had opted out of the scheme in 1978 were invited to reconsider their decisions and to join the scheme.</P>
      <P>The number of widows whose husbands chose not to become members and who are outside the ambit of the scheme, is currently estimated at 180.  I am having the position of these widows who find themselves disadvantaged because their husbands made this decision without consulting them reviewed to see if any concession is possible.</P>
      <P>Membership of the contributory spouses' and children's pension scheme is compulsory in the case of all officers appointed since January 1971 and all soldiers enlisted since February 1978.  The spouses and children of such personnel would qualify for pensions in the event of their husbands pre-deceasing them.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister shares my concern and sympathy for these widows who, unfortunately, because their husbands decided to opt out of the pension scheme, are not in receipt of any pension from the Department of Defence.  While it is welcome <Col N="819" /> that the Minister is having the position of these widows reviewed I have a file in front of me which contains correspondence dating back to 1990 addressed to his predecessors.  I will depend on the Minister to provide these widows with some consolation.  Will the Minister consider providing an <i>ex gratia</i> payment given that the number of widows involved is only 180?  I understand that provision was made for such a payment when the pension scheme was introduced.  In the question I asked the Minister if he would make it mandatory for all members of the Defence Forces to inform their spouses.  I understand from the responses I have received from the Department that almost 2,000 Army personnel currently serving have opted out of the scheme. What steps is the Minister going to take to rectify this?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that of a strength of some 13,100 enlisted personnel in 1978 about 7,700 opted out of membership of the contributory scheme. A total of 1,850 soldiers who are currently serving are not members of the scheme.  On the question of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, the scheme applies to personnel who died either in service with not less than five years service or who retired on pension prior to 1 June 1977 and who were not afforded the opportunity to join the contributory scheme.  The benefits under the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme are the same as those available under the contributory scheme.  Initially, the <i>ex gratia</i> benefits <Col N="820" /> were half the contributory rates but over the years they were raised to achieve parity.  On the question of whether it should be made mandatory for Army personnel to inform their wives, I am not certain that this could be done or that it would be a good practice.  I would have thought that people would do this in the ordinary way.  I am not certain that legislation would be of help.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Minister on the question of whether it should be made mandatory for Army personnel to inform their spouses about this decision.  If we are serious about protecting widows we will have to show courage and take this step.  It is not too much to ask members of the Defence Forces to obtain the signature of their spouses before they opt out of the pension scheme.  As this decision will affect spouses it should be taken by both partners. I ask the Minister to seriously consider making it mandatory for Army personnel to inform their spouses given that it is the only way we can protect them.</P>

I imagine the report will be published next year.  The board submitted an interim report in May 1993 and that, together with the detailed requirements of the Department of the Marine, is being considered by a working group which is preparing proposals for Government.

      <P>I am not aware of the involvement of Canadian consultants but I understand that in February 1992 the Quarter Master General established a board for the purposes of recommending the most suitable helicopter and associated equipment for the provision of the medium range search and rescue service on our Atlantic seaboard.  An interim report was prepared in May 1993.  I cannot say when a final report will be furnished but I hope it will be in the near future because the Sikorsky contract expires in five years from February 1991. I am grateful to the Deputy for paying tribute to the Air Corps who did significant work in very difficult circumstances in probably one of the worst winters in living memory.  As Minister for Defence, I commend those men and women for the courage they have shown on a regular basis, but particularly in the horrendous weather conditions of the past winter.  I am sure that view is unanimous here.  I have no doubt the views of Deputy McGinley will be brought to the attention of the general in charge of the Air Corps.

I express my deep appreciation to the RAF for its assistance until a number of years ago.  It was always <Col N="824" /> willing to assist when we needed assistance and it will be willing to do so in the future if necessary.  In the past number of years the roles have been reversed, we have been assisting the RAF.  That is a significant achievement on our part but is in no way a diminution of the help it has given us when we wanted it.  When it needs us we will come to its assistance. The input from the British authorities has not been diminished as a result of the relocation of our sea and air rescue services.</P>

      <P>Research into the area of fish stock assessment is multifaceted, and covers not only the location of fish stocks but also the relative abundance of the fish, their migratory habits, age structure and their seasonality, among other factors.  Research facilities are not just deployed therefore to pinpoint locations, but must encompasss this entire range of relevant factors.  International co-operation is particularly important not least because of the migratory nature of many of our fish resources.  Ireland plays its full role in such international efforts and benefits in turn from the research undertaken by such bodies as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.</P>
      <P>The main fisheries research facilities in Ireland are located at the Fisheries Research Centre of the Department in Abbotstown, County Dublin.  Nearly 50 per cent of the centre's budget is spent on such fish stock assessment programmes and, together with research funding under the EU STRIDE programme, some £738,000 will be expended on fish stock assessment in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national research vessel, the r.v. <i>Lough Beltra</i> has been substantially upgraded with the benefit of EU STRIDE funding.  The STRIDE investment, <Col N="825" /> totalling some £0.7 million, has facilitated necessary structural alterations, the purchase of state of the art sampling and monitoring equipment and a computerised data acquisition system, and has enhanced the vessel's overall data gathering capability.</P>
    <P>Use of the <i>Lough Beltra,</i> which has a limited range as a 21 metre sized vessel, is augmented by chartering Irish fishing vessels and participation in foreign vessel cruises.  Research vessel requirements and the range of possible options for meeting industry needs in the future are being assessed at present under the auspices of the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>BIM, in conjunction with the Fisheries Research Centre, carries out experimental fishing programmes into less traditional species off the west coast. Currently, research into non-quota species such as redfish, orange roughy and grenadier is being undertaken with a view to evaluating their commercial possibilities.</P>
    <P>In addition to these ongoing programmes of stock assessment, provision has been made in the National Plan for the funding of further new research into fish stocks including non-quota and non-traditional species, and the selective upgrading of research facilities to support this work.  This additional investment will be critical to achieving our objective of bringing about a sustainable balance between available fish resources and their exploitation, in particular through the take-up of under-exploited fishing opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I read in the excellent national daily newspaper, the <i>Cork Examiner</i>&mdash; alas there is no one in the press gallery &mdash; that French fishing vessels make approximately £70,000 per trip from the catches of non-quota fish in our waters.  Does that not send a strong signal that our research to date has been insufficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  Our research has been very good and the Fisheries Research Centre in Abbotstown does extremely good work.  Its staffing <Col N="826" /> complement is 14 involved in fish stock assessment including seven scientists and seven technicians.  In addition ten contract staff are employed on such work under the EU STRIDE initiative.  The FRC is set to become an integral part of the Marine Institute and discussions have been successfully concluded with the trade unions to facilitate the transfer of staff and secondment initially, pending finalised arrangements for definitive transfer.  BIM also undertakes research into experimental fishing and gear technology in conjunction with the FRC. Ireland also benefits from research undertaken in respect of all species carried out under the auspices of the International Council for Exploration of the Sea.  Fisheries research staff do a first class job.  The Irish marine research operational programme, submitted to the EU Commission as part of the overall National Development Plan, contains provision for a significant research programme for fish stock assessment, including new species.  That research will result in a more comprehensive knowledge of stock assessment for non-traditional and non-quota species.  The programme will be co-ordinated on a national basis by the Marine Institute.</P>

    <P>Such holds are frequently found to contain illegal nets of undersize mesh or undersize fish which have not been entered in the log book.  At present the maximum fine which the court may impose for having a concealed hold is £10,000.  On 13 April 1994, during the Second Stage debate on the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, I announced my intention to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage which would increase the maximum fine for hidden holds to £50,000.  Some Deputies are of the view that fine is not sufficient, they may table amendments to have it increased and I undertake to consider them.  Having illegal undersize nets on board will in future also attract a maximum fine of £50,000 while the possession <Col N="828" /> of undersize fish will be subject to a maximum fine of £20,000, double the present level.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill provides for the confiscation of vessels where an offence or combination of offences is considered by the courts to constitute a serious abuse of conservation measures.</P>
    <P>The practice of having concealed holds would constitute a serious abuse as envisaged under the new legislation since it represents a premeditated violation of the law and demonstrates a serious disregard for the conservation of fisheries resources.</P>
    <P>These increased penalties which will be introduced into the Bill reflect the serious view which the Government takes of such abuses and its determination to stamp out this practice.</P>

      <P>Will it be mandatory to confiscate boats with concealed holds at the time of seizure?  The Minister seemed doubtful about the implementation of that provision in the new legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be instant justice.  The boat would be seized, the case would go through the due process of law and it would be a matter for the courts to interpret the confiscation provision in the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill when it is enacted.  I hope the wishes of the Deputy will apply and that boats involved in a first offence of a serious nature will be confiscated.</P>

      <P>I understand that when a boat is finally confiscated there is difficulty in deciding what to do with it.  Has a decision been taken about what will happen to a yacht involved in a recent drugs haul that is in the process of confiscation? Will the Minister agree that science has been found to be ineffective in respect of Spaniards who violate our fishing rights as they have a substantial fund, can afford to pay fines and will fish in the waters again?  Will he also agree that confiscation may be the only option available to curtail such illegal fishing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention of the Legislature that the courts interpret the law in a manner which would allow confiscation for the first offence.  The Deputy is aware of the history in this area where in many cases the name of the boat and the boat owner's name may be changed and, consequently, offenders slip through the net of the courts.  The yacht to which the Deputy referred is the <i>Brime</i> and is subject to court proceedings.  Two individuals, allegedly caught drug smuggling, have appealed to the Supreme Court and the yacht cannot be released until the case is concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the disposal of the yacht, presumably after these people have been convicted &mdash; I am not certain that will happen, nor should I comment on it &mdash; if the yacht is released by the courts to the State, the State will have a number of options open to it.  There is the possibility of the naval service retaining it, of it being made available to the Garda Síochána or &mdash; I favour this proposition which was put to me by a very prominent member of the fishing community &mdash; that it be made available to Asgard, the excellent committee that does so much work on <Col N="830" /> behalf of deprived children.  Many young people are trying to get on Asgard annually, but, unfortunately, they cannot all be accommodated.  Perhaps this will be the solution to the problem.  These good options are being examined and a case can be made for each one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 47 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>In line with the Programme for Government, I am reviewing ways in which the operating climate for the shipping sector can be enhanced to support the objectives of improved services, standards, modernisation and the ability to compete of the Irish-registered fleet.  The strategic objective is to enable Irish shipping companies to meet international competition under comparable cost conditions but without compromising on safety.  The intention is to ensure the maintenance and creation of employment in the sector and to facilitate productive investment to modernise and expand the fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review is being conducted in full consultation with the industry.  However, to further inform this process the Department plans to commission an economic evaluation of the sector shortly which <Col N="831" /> will also address the case for additional support measures conducive to an efficient and competitive shipping industry. In that context the various incentives currently available to shipping sectors in certain other EU member states are being examined.  These can lead to a distortion of competition between EU carriers themselves, but it is the case that considerable differentials in operating and manning costs place European shipowners generally at a distinct competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> flags of convenience. The pressures on European, including Irish, shipowners to move such registries which offer liberal tax and operating regimes are considerable and growing.</P>
    <P>There is recognition at EU level of the need for positive measures to assist European shipowners in a harmonised way in order to meet the competition challenge and maintain employment while ensuring the highest safety standards. Commission proposals on this issue are being actively discussed with a view to identifying and, more importantly, agreeing possible ways forward. Our policy review is being undertaken with full regard for EU shipping policy trends and objectievs.</P>
    <P>I am determined to ensure the continued viability and growth of the Irish shipping industry to service the needs of Irish importers and exporters and as an employer and revenue earner in its own right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister's objective is growth of the shipping sector and the creation and maintenance of employment.  They are very noble objectives, but Government policy is resulting in a loss of employment.  For example, in the sell-off of the B &amp; I line to Irish Continental Group promises were made and commitments given that employment would be protected, that it was in the best interests of workers, and employment, and that it would allow the company to become more suitable to attract EU investment for mobile assets. However, since then up to 400 jobs have been lost.  The Minister and his Department <Col N="832" /> have shown disregard for the unions involved by not meeting them to discuss these issues and honour the commitments given at that time?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious the Deputy, like others, is extremely well briefed on this matter and I have no objection to that; it is a very important part of the democratic process.  However, pressure does not work with me.  As the Deputy is aware, I meet four or five deputations each day.  I am very well versed on all the issues raised.  It is my intention, and that of the Taoiseach and the Government, to address as a matter of urgency the need for competition on the central and southern corridors and I will continue to implement Government policy in that regard.</P>
      <P>The policy objective, in line with overall European Union objectives, is to ensure that Irish shipping companies meet international competition under comparable cost conditions and to stem flagging out from the Irish register to flags of convenience where costs are considerably less.  The corollary of this is the need for a strategy to ensure that the Irish register becomes more competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> international and European registers without compromising on safety, including manning standards.  The benefits of such a strategy include direct and indirect gains to the national economy through shipping activities, maintenance and creation of employment in the indigenous shipping sector, new productive investment in the fleet, assurance of indigenous maritime expertise and maintenance of safety standards.  Direct employment in the Irish shipping sector amounts to 1,581, of which 1,259 are nationals and 322 non-nationals &mdash; the source of that information is the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's comments about the support available for shipping fleets of our EU neighbours, what proposals has the Minister for progress <Col N="833" /> in that regard?  In our efforts to be super-Europeans we are extremely reluctant to offer to the Irish similar incentives to those available to industries in other countries.  In the excellent brief we received this morning from SIPTU it was pointed out that in the Netherlands, France, Germany, Greece and Portugal subsidies are available to the shipping industry.  What progress is the Minister making to ensure that similar grants and subsidies are available here?  This is one area in which we must try to keep up with the Jones's if we are to maintain jobs and create further job opportunities.  Since our competitors are given grants and subsidies without breaking EU rules and regulations, what will the Minister do to ensure that similar grants and subsidies are available here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I keep in contact with the industry.  On the incentives or positive measures which are acknowledged as necessary for the maintenance of the Irish and EU fleets, the Commission has made a number of successive proposals aimed at promoting attractive and harmonised conditions to enhance the competitive position of member state fleets. These include income tax exemption for seafarers, alleviation of social security contributions, company tax measures and manning in the context of a European ship register, EUROS.  Agreement has not yet been reached on these measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime member states have continued to provide incentives to varying degrees to their own shipping industries, as the Deputy properly stated. These include a variety of financial and operational support measures.  Ireland lags behind a number of member states in the level of direct and indirect assistance available to this sector.  Production and operational costs are seen by the industry as essential if it is to improve competitively <Col N="834" /><i>vis-à-vis</i> other operators.  The differences in manning costs is only one of the reasons that operating costs for ships under the Irish flag are higher than on the open register flags and certain EU flags, many of which now operate a second register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, who is well briefed on the issues affecting the industry, give an undertaking to the House &mdash; a similar request has been made to him on many occasions in recent months &mdash; to discuss with the group of unions involved the issues raised today and the commitments entered into some time ago?  Will he give a commitment that he will meet them at the earliest opportunity to tease out the issues and to give the necessary assurances to that group of people who are worried about their future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This economic review has received many favourable reports and indeed it has encouraged people to use flowery language about the economic prospects for the next five years.  The good news has been highlighted effectively in the media and the spin doctors have been busy trying to obtain the best possible image from this review.  Should the Irish people be given all of the good news without spelling out the bad news also?  We have tried this good news policy since 1987 and each year we have been told that the economy is on the rise.  The favourite phrase of the Taoiseach is that the fundamentals are right, that the Irish economy was never in a better position than it is now and that a rising tide will lift all boats, yet we still have 300,000 people unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who produced this report should have mentioned the pain involved in trying to remove 300,000 people from the live register.  The targets set in this report require zero borrowing on the one hand and no increase in Government spending.  Speakers on the other side of the House, however, have not referred to that aspect of it although the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, referred to the fact that sacrifices would have to be made.  She referred to the <Col N="887" /> disadvantaged and spoke in clear economic terms about how we should tackle these immediate problems.</P>
    <P>We must have a Government that will set targets.  The ESRI review should have set out guidelines to reduce the numbers of unemployed by approximately 30,000 in each year this Government will be in office.  That would be a reasonable target and would reduce the present number of 300,000 to 150,000 in the lifetime of this Government.  The ordinary man in the street would understand that.  The present climate, however, is a total turnoff, despite the good news from these people in the ESRI and being preached by Ministers on a daily basis.  The media seem to have gone lame on this issue; they do not seem to have any interest in providing some kind of a platform for the people who would like to see this huge problem resolved.  They seem to be going along with what I regard as the political will of the day.</P>
    <P>People here accept that there is no real solution to this major difficulty.  I do not accept that that is the case and the Taoiseach should not be saying this either.  The Taoiseach often asks Members of the Opposition for their solution to the problem.  He has no solution. The ESRI in its medium-term review refers to a figure of 280,000 unemployed at the end of five years.  We do not seem to have the will to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>This problem existed when the new partnership Programme for Government was drawn up.  The most disappointing aspect is that all the key elements of society, the trade unions, the employers, the farmers and the Government could not come up with was an economic plan such as that put forward by the late Seán Lemass in the 1960s.  Although that plan was not as productive as it was claimed to be, at least it was a guideline which people could follow.</P>
    <P>Where are the targets from Fianna Fáil or Labour to tackle this problem?  Where are the targets from the trade unions? Why is Mr. Cassells, the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, not giving a lead by calling on the Government <Col N="888" /> to create 30,000 more jobs?  What about those in the banking sector, the people who need investment to sustain this country?  They seem to be happy with the prospect of the huge wave of emigration forecast by the ESRI over the next five years.  Must Fianna Fáil be in Opposition before it becomes concerned about this matter?  Must the Labour Party be on this side of the House before it becomes concerned about the need to resolve this major problem?  Have the Deputies in those parties any sense of responsibility to their children in this regard?  Will their children have jobs in this country or are they satisfied to provide education in the various third level institutions here and export the best?  It seems they are.</P>
    <P>The attitude to this optimistic economic report is one of more and more complacency.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is present in the House.  He went along with those in his Department who suggested last year that farmers should be given only 60 per cent of their grants before Christmas and the remaining 40 per cent after Christmas.  I cannot understand why the Minister of State allowed the Department to implement such a proposal. He should have insisted on full payment of the grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an EC requirement that the grant be phased in.  The Deputy knows the Department did not make that provision and he should be honest enough to acknowledge it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government could have decided to pay the full grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it is all about. If there is huge growth in departmental expenditure money will not be available to pay grants.  I do not blame Deputy Hyland for paying 40 per cent of the grant to farmers.  He will face them on the <Col N="889" /> hustings and will be made aware of their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he will give them his version of it.  We are prepared to accept without criticism an unemployment figure of 300,000 and a projected figure of 200,000 by the end of the decade.  The ESRI may have been erring on the side of optimism when they arrived at this figure.  Instead of doing something constructive we look at programmes such as &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; and see Gay Byrne promoting small industry.  The IDA and Shannon Development are supposed to promote small industry. However, the high cost of taxation and PRSI militates against job creation.</P>
      <P>In Australia the Labour Party gave themselves five years in which to tackle the problem.  The programme they drew up caused pain to many but they succeeded in reducing unemployment.  We live from day to day on the pragmatism of Fianna Fáil.  I am puzzled by the Labour Party because they are supposed to defend those who want to work.  The Minister for Finance brought in two budgets in which he could have done something about the problem but he fluffed it on each occasion.  The ESRI stated the borrowing rate should be zero but the Taoiseach did not commit the Government to this.  However, such guidelines must be followed if we are to succeed in reducing the unemployment figure.  The main ESRI criticisms were in the areas of taxation reform and education.</P>
      <P>We should have a Minister for the West and the Government had an opportunity to appoint one in response to the bishops' plea.  The Minister of State is well aware of the ravages of emigration and is interested in rural development.  He would be interested in the notion of such an appointment.  The country is facing the problem of huge emigration.  Such a Minister could co-ordinate western development in the face of superstructures being developed in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new report from the ESRI which substantially endorses the Government's management of the economy over the past seven years during which time we have achieved considerable economic growth and managed to escape from the dangerous spiral of escalating public expenditure and taxation in a stagnating economy.  It should also be noted that this success has continued despite recessions first, in the United Kingdom and the United States, and then in many European countries. Now with the economies of the UK and the US expanding and Europe beginning to emerge from recession, we are poised for a period of sustained growth in our economy which will result in better living standards for us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the ESRI report points out, this improvement will be achieved only by prudent management of the national economy and by continuing the impressive growth in productivity which we have seen in many sectors of the economy &mdash; including the agriculture and food sectors &mdash; over the past seven years.  This has been the backbone of our recovery from the doldrums of the early eighties and is substantially due to the consensus approach to Government which has included the social partners in a series of national programmes starting with the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> then the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and continued this year with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The strategy underlying these programmes requires consensus between the Government and the social partners &mdash; employees and farmers.  The result has been six years of economic growth with practically all economic indicators showing substantial improvements, especially when compared with the mid-eighties. GNP has increased by over 25 per cent in real terms in the past six years; inflation was only 1.5 per cent in 1993, well below the EU average of 3.25 per cent; interest rates have been reduced, with Irish rates falling sharply since devaluation last year to the point where they are now in line <Col N="891" /> with German rates &mdash; something we aspired to for a long time; the balance of payments moved from a deficit of 3.5 per cent of GNP in 1986 to a surplus of 6 per cent of GNP in 1993; the national debt has been reduced from 126 per cent of GNP in 1987 to just over 100 per cent and the top rate of tax on personal income has been reduced from 60 per cent to 48 per cent and the standard rate reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>Even in the past couple of years of low economic growth and recession in many OECD countries, Ireland has performed better than average in most areas of economic activity.  Despite the currency turmoil at the end of 1992 and into 1993 we still managed to achieve 2 per cent growth in GNP last year with an estimated 3.7 per cent for 1994.  This is against an international background of poor economic performance by many of our EU partners and despite the very open nature of our economy, with our exports accounting for 56 per cent of GDP.</P>
    <P>With the improving economic climate, the ESRI rightly points out that we are now poised to improve our position and living standards, provided we make the most of our opportunities and continue to improve our competitiveness compared to our major trading partners.</P>
    <P>The report rightly devotes considerable attention to the question of unemployment and it is here that the outlook is darkest.  Despite the generally satisfactory performance of the economy over the past few years it is clear that employment growth has not been sufficient for our growing working population. Although employment, in contrast to many European countries, has remained stable at approximately 1.125 million and the ESRI predicts that strong employment growth will resume this year, it is still not enough for the increasing number of young people coming onto our jobs market.  In the recent past we have been unable, with our main trading partners in recession and with only weak economic growth, to offer sufficient employment opportunities in our trade dependent economy. <Col N="892" /> The result has been rising unemployment which now stands at approximately 17 per cent of the labour force, second only to Spain in the OECD.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that jobs are at the centre of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> This programme, with the help of the National Development Plan, will significantly reduce unemployment over the next three years. This process is already beginning to bear fruit, with some economic commentators predicting unemployment to decline this year.  The policies we are developing, which are designed specifically for the unemployed, will enable us to achieve employment growth greater than predicted by the ESRI.</P>
    <P>Despite the gradual decline in the relative importance of agriculture in the past couple of decades, this industry still remains far more important to the Irish economy than it is to the economy of most other OECD and EU countries. Agriculture directly accounts for approximately 10 per cent of GDP, 13 per cent of jobs and 16 per cent of exports, compared to an EU average of 3 per cent of GDP, 6 per cent employment and 8.5 per cent of exports.  The combined agri-food sector in Ireland contributes about 17 per cent of jobs and 25 per cent of exports.</P>
    <P>The importance to our foreign exchange earnings is even greater. Because of the high level of foreign-based manufacturing in Ireland, profit repatriations are high while the food sector is largely Irish owned and most of the raw materials are produced here as well.  As a result agriculture and food exports contribute more to our foreign exchange earnings than the level of exports would suggest.</P>
    <P>In most rural areas direct employment in agriculture or food processing is the principal source of jobs and practically all economic activity in many rural areas depends on agriculture.  Regardless of the changes in the national and international economy agriculture and food will remain absolutely vital to this country. Anything that adversely affects agriculture to a significant degree will also <Col N="893" /> impact adversely on the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In its &ldquo;Economic Perspective for the Medium Term&rdquo; the ESRI outlines its assessment of the impact of the GATT on Ireland and Irish agriculture.  While it estimates that the GATT will have a negative impact on agricultural output it also clearly points out that failure to reach an agreement could have led to greater problems than any which may arise from the agreement.  The outlook is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty although with the completion of the GATT talks and the implementation of the CAP reform measures, the external environment for the agriculture and food sectors is now reasonably well defined.</P>
    <P>The agriculture sector is now moving to a more open trading environment with lower sale prices and limits on production which are compensated to some extent by the CAP reform direct payments and accompanying measures.  In addition, from 1996 onwards the GATT will lead to increased competition from outside the European Union while at the same time export opportunities will be restricted with reductions in export refunds and the volume of subsidised exports.</P>
    <P>The new environment means increased competition and, as the NESC recommended, requires effective policies in the areas of education, research and structural reforms.  These policies must be implemented now in order to enable the agriculture and food sectors to compete successfully in the new environment.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> details these policies and commits the Government to pursuing them.</P>
    <P>The ESRI's projections of the impact of the GATT on agricultural income do not include the substantial amounts which will be payable to farmers under the accompanying measures of CAP reform.  The early retirement scheme, the rural environment protection scheme and the forestry scheme will contribute significantly to maintaining incomes and employment in rural areas, although they may fall outside the definition of agricultural income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> The early retirement scheme will have a dual impact: first, it will allow older farmers the chance to retire on a reasonable pension and, second, it will make their land available to younger farmers. Although there has been some criticism of the enlargement provision in this scheme it is vital if we are to avoid the position of younger farmers taking over non-viable farms and perpetuating a cycle of low incomes.</P>
    <P>The rural environment protection scheme will provide farmers with compensation for using farming practices which are less efficient but which protect the countryside both visually and environmentally.  Over the longer term this measure will contribute significantly to rural tourism as it will help farmers to maintain the rural landscape and add to the other measures designed to reduce pollution.</P>
    <P>The forestry scheme will encourage farmers to undertake afforestation by providing annual premia payments. Given the current controversy surrounding forestry it should be noted that this scheme is directed at farmers and is intended to compensate them for the loss of agricultural production during the years a forest is not producing income. For this reason, our proposals to Brussels, which were formally agreed by the European Commission yesterday, recommended higher grants for better quality land.  Furthermore, we are going to offer higher rates of payments for broad leaf forests in order to encourage diversification in tree species.  I do not anticipate any move towards the planting of trees on good agricultural land.  This undesirable trend can be addressed in the context of the programme we have announced.  These three schemes will contribute significantly to maintaining farmer incomes and in the longer term will contribute significantly to the development of our rural economy.</P>
    <P>In addition to these the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry is now in its final stages of preparation before formal submission to the European Commission. This programme will provide <Col N="895" /> considerable assistance towards the investment many farmers will need to undertake to meet the new dairy hygiene and animal welfare standards, towards encouraging diversification and to the investment needed to reduce pollution. It will also contribute to afforestation and will enable Teagasc to improve its training and advisory service and research and development.</P>
    <P>The ESRI's review predicts that agricultural employment will sadly continue to decline.  Unfortunately, that view is probably correct.  However, what is more important than the number of people working in agriculture is the development of opportunities for work and enterprise in rural areas.  The clear implication of the developments which have taken place in the agriculture industry over recent years and which will take place in the future is that policy must be based on quality and diversified on-farm production, with an emphasis on value-added products in the food industry and on a coherent and active rural development policy.</P>
    <P>Traditional farming will remain central to the viability of most rural areas but, without broader based rural development policies, will not be enough to sustain many rural communities. Diversification of on-farm activities is a priority for Ireland.  The Operational Programme will continue the support now available for a whole variety of alternative farm enterprises and for rural tourism.</P>
    <P>The Leader programme is the EU's initiative for rural development under the first round of Structural Funds which provided a role for rural communities to involve themselves directly in their development.  Sixteen groups were selected in Ireland for funding of about £35 million matched pound for pound by local funds to implement local business plans they drew up.  The best aspect of the programme is that decision-making in relation to the local group strategy, identifying potential for development and grant-aiding local projects rests with the group itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> Leader has proven to be an excellent addition to the other measures under the Community Support Framework.  It has demonstrated that, given the opportunity and resources, the rural community is more than willing to contribute to its development.  I was delighted, therefore, to see the European Commission decide to introduce Leader II under the new round of Structural Funds.  I look forward to seeing the process which began in the first programme continued for the next five to six years.</P>
    <P>Public policy for the economy is outlined in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> agreed earlier this year between the Government and the social partners, including the farm organisations.</P>
    <P>From what I have said about the various schemes and programmes it is clear that there are many different components of policy in the agriculture, food and rural development areas.  Some of these are decided at EU level, like the Common Agricultural Policy's market and income support measures, others are decided at national level, like taxation, and others internationally such as the GATT.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> brought together these different strands and set out the national policies we intend to pursue over the coming years.  These policies will contribute significantly to creating a competitive agri-food sector which, in turn, will contribute to the national economy and will go a long way towards achieving the ESRI's projections.</P>
    <P>The overall aims of policy in agriculture and rural development are clearly set out in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> They are: to maximise the contribution of the farming, food and forestry sectors to the national economy, in terms of employment and value-added; and to maximise the number of viable farms and farm households in rural Ireland, at sustainable living standards in line with those in other sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>Within the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> a programme for competitiveness and rural development <Col N="897" /> is outlined.  The latter is based on the absolute necessity to prepare Irish agriculture and the food sector for the more liberal international trading regime which will arise from Common Agricultural Policy reform and the GATT agreement, the effects of which are outlined by the ESRI.  This will require greater competitiveness in the core sectors while encouragement will be given for diversification within agriculture as well as into different sectors.</P>
    <P>In the light of the GATT agreement it is of particular importance to ensure that the budgetary provision for the reformed Common Agricultural Policy is adequate for the increase in direct payments, for acceptable levels of market support and for the accompanying measures.  As well as the budgetary concerns there is the question of quotas or production rights. We are opposed to further restrictions which could possibly arise as a result of the GATT agreement and which would be in addition to the agreed Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>
    <P>The main challenge facing the industry is the need to intensify the trend towards market-led production.  There is a pressing need for greater reliance on consumer preferences to decide what products should be produced and for the industry to respond by becoming more flexible.  To achieve this it will be necessary to place a greater emphasis on improving production and processing technology in the agri-food sector to ensure that Ireland becomes an increasingly low cost, high quality producer of food.  We must exploit our distinct marketing advantage on the acknowledged and unquestionable fact that production here is in a clean and pollution-free environment.</P>
    <P>The programme for competitiveness and rural development will help farmers and the food sector develop their strength so that they can compete in the more open market brought on by the Common Agricultural Policy reform and the GATT agreement.  Part of this development will require structural change.  This programme, together with the National Development Plan, 1994-99 aims to <Col N="898" /> develop a strong, vibrant rural society with farming and the food industry as its base which can offer sustainable standards of living comparable with other areas of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss the recently published ESRI medium-term review for the years 1994 to 2000, a valuable contribution to the debate on the future prospects of our economy.  This is one of a series of such reviews published in recent years which have provided the Government, politicians and the public alike with an extremely useful base from which to examine the current thrust of our economic and social policies and future challenges that face our society at large.</P>
      <P>The ESRI presents a very positive view of the economic outlook to the year 2000 and beyond with GNP expected to increase at an annual average rate of about 5 per cent over the second half of this decade.  It envisages a surge in domestic demand fuelled by tax cuts, increasing public employment and a vigorous spurt in investor confidence.  After the disappointment of the 1980s, jobs will be added to the workforce at a much faster pace in the 1990s.  In its review, the ESRI projects that the total number at work will increase by 130,000, an increase in the six-year period of 11 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the services sector is expected to provide significant employment growth, industry is also scheduled to contribute to the expansion of the national workforce in the years ahead.  Construction is expected to deliver the biggest absolute increase in industrial employment with 20,000 jobs.  Employment in traditional-type industries is expected to grow by 17,000 just ahead of job growth in high technology industries which is forecast to increase by 14,000.  The anticipated turn-around in the employment growth potential of Irish indigenous firms is based on such firms retaining competitive advantage and the projected growth in domestic demand, which in the period to the end of the decade, will account for a <Col N="899" /> higher proportion of economic growth than in the past.</P>
    <P>Present indicators confirm the significant turn-around in the economy's fortunes that has taken place in the 16 months since this Government took office.  When we formed this partnership Government the underlying sentiment for the economy was strongly negative. The onslaught on our currency brought with it lost competitiveness and crippling interest rates.  Following the realignment of the IR£ within the ERM in January 1993, the thrust of this Government's first budget in February 1993 was to restore confidence and, thereby, investment and jobs.</P>
    <P>Economic indicators have greatly improved since the 1993 budget.  Irish interest rates fell both rapidly and substantially. Inflation at 1.5 per cent in 1993 is at its lowest level since the 1960s and is set to remain low.  The decline in investment, evident in both 1991 and 1992, was overturned in the new climate of optimism in 1993.  The recent Central Bank report predicts a substantial boost to investment of the order of 5 per cent in volume terms this year.  The ESRI review forecasts that substantial growth in investment will be the vital factor in our improved output and employment growth prospects to the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>The real fundamental problem of our economy is of course employment.  The current indicators are all very positive. Let us briefly, look at what has been happening.  First, the rise in the live register which started in 1991 and continued unabated in 1992 was halted in 1993 and is now falling.  Second, further evidence of improvement is emerging from the statistics on redundancy notifications which had risen in 1991 and 1992 but were contained in 1993 and are now falling. The numbers notified in the first three months of this year also shows a reduction of almost 14 per cent over the first quarter of 1993.  Notified redundancies in the last quarter of 1993 were 21 per cent less than the number notified in the corresponding months of 1992. <Col N="900" /> Third, the preliminary estimates from the 1993 labour force survey reveal that despite a loss of 25,000 jobs between 1990 and 1993 in agriculture, the number at work in the economy has increased by 12,000 over this period.  This figure masks the extent of the recovery in 1993 where nearly 60 per cent of this increase in jobs occurred.</P>
    <P>These recent indicators support the positive employment forecasts in the medium term review.  Positive projections alone will not create jobs.  As the review notes employment growth is dependent on increased investment and this is itself dependent on the attitudes of investors to perceived opportunities.</P>
    <P>Business confidence depends on a positive macroeconomic framework and the Government is strongly committed to maintaining and building such a framework. Ireland, more than most member states, has adhered to the requirements for creating such a positive business environment.  In 1993, we achieved output growth of 2.25 per cent compared with a 0.5 per cent decline of GDP in the EU.  Our inflation, at 1.5 per cent was, and continues to be, amongst the lowest in the EU.  The balance of payments remains in substantial surplus.  Our low interest rates, despite the currency difficulties at the end of 1992, reflect the confidence that the markets have in our economic management and in the prospects for the medium term.</P>
    <P>The continued restraint in Government borrowing and our adherence to the fiscal guidelines in the Maastricht Treaty have proven to the financial markets and industrial investors that Ireland's long term outlook is very promising.  This is because we now have a competent programme and a proven track record of good management.  The renewed confidence in the economy leading to improved consumer confidence &mdash; as was evidenced in the second half of 1993 &mdash; is continuing this year and, most importantly, is forecast by the ESRI to rise substantially over the next number of years.  This growth is vital for economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>At a recent conference in Dublin <Col N="901" /> Castle to discuss the EU White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, I indicated that I was struck by the gap that appears to exist between the perception created by some Irish business people and the actual evidence when it comes to the use to which reduced costs and presumably, correspondingly increased company profits are put by Irish firms.  Many people in business assure us that given the chance to reduce their labour costs in particular, they would use the resultant savings to reinvest and take on additional staff.  I am sure that all of us in this House would like to see some more substantial evidence of this happening.  To this end I note that the ESRI is predicting a substantial pickup in investment.</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement in this House, in the trade union movement and in the business community that we cannot hope to create more jobs unless Irish firms become more competitive.  To be competitive means never to be complacent but always to be alert to the shifts and changes in market requirements and to the vital importance of improving the internal capability of firms to meet these requirements.  It is this kind of vigilance which must continue to inform both policy-making and implementation within the Administration and the approach taken by each firm which wishes to succeed in the market-place.</P>
    <P>The progress report on the implementation of the Culliton and Moriarty recommendations which I will be publishing tomorrow will demonstrate the commitment of Government to press forward with its contribution of creating the most favourable environment across a wide range of policy areas within which Irish business can operate competitively.</P>
    <P>In terms of firm-specific assistance, the establishment of an agency &mdash; Forbairt &mdash; dedicated to redressing the undeniable imbalance in the performance of indigenous firms <i>vis-à-vis</i> others which are controlled effectively in other countries, should help to bring about a new impetus to our industrial policy.  Only the development of a strong and enterprising indigenous industrial base can secure a <Col N="902" /> substantial increase in employment and sustainable economic growth.</P>
    <P>The fact that most of these measures are geared to bring about long term improvements must always be borne in mind.  It will take time before we begin to feel the full beneficial effects of more relevant training programmes, of more competitive commercial State companies, of developing the internal capacity of individual firms to cope with changing processes and requirements. My primary concern is to ensure that we are not deflected from the need to stay the course in pursuing this kind of strategy which is necessary if we are to bring about the kind of radical structural reform which is essential in competitive terms.  Establishing the appropriate macroeconomic framework combined with policies at the micro level will produce results.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the special contribution on future employment that the successful conclusion of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> with its moderation in wage rate growth should have.  The ESRI predicts that if wage rate growth exceeded their central projection by just 1 per cent per year that employment in the year 2005 would be 30,000 less than they forecast.  Clearly the long term benefit of maintaining competitive wage rates will be increased employment.  By negotiating and agreeing moderation in this area the social partners are making a very substantial contribution to the generation of employment. This is real partnership.  Similarly the Government in its pro enterprise budget and by reducing tax on jobs has made a further contribution to encourage enterprise and increased employment.</P>
    <P>What is needed now if we are to achieve and surpass the potential growth in output and employment outlined in the review is the energetic implementation of public policy, the focused use of Community funding as outlined in the National Development Plan 1994-2000, and increased private sector enterprise and investment.</P>
    <P>The ESRI review is timely.  It reinforces the major challenges and priorities <Col N="903" /> which face our society.  The task for us all, private and public, political and administrative, is to mobilise and deploy our resources in ways that contribute to the enhancement of economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a forecast and as such is liable to the normal difficulties in predicting ahead based on past experience and assumptions about future projections at a time of rapid change.  While I do not wish to dwell on this point, it is essential that due cognisance is taken of the rapid change in, not alone Irish, but other industrialised societies worldwide. Changes arise particularly from increased globalisation and rapid technical innovation which demands that our economies have to adjust quickly and adapt in order to remain competitive, create jobs and generate wealth while at the same time protecting the most vulnerable in society.  More importantly it is a forecast based on current policies.  It is within our ability to deliver growth levels which exceed this forecast if we adopt and refine our existing policies and deliver a more competitive economy.  Our future is not cast in stone &mdash; it is for us to shape.</P>
    <P>The success of public policy cannot be assessed solely on the basis of lowering the numbers on the live register.  This is essentially a negative approach which, if adopted, as the key measure of success is fraught with very serious policy dangers. There are many hidden forms of unemployment which do not appear on the live register.  Similarly, there are some who sign-on who are effectively not looking for work, but simply to qualify for other benefits and cannot be said to be unemployed.</P>
    <P>In an improving economy, as is being forecast, it is clear that new employment opportunities will be taken up by, for example, returning emigrants who had left Ireland to find work or develop new skills; the welcome increase in the participation of women in the workforce, which is being actively encouraged through measures being promoted by my colleague in Government, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, and others <Col N="904" /> who had been discouraged from active participation in the formal labour force.</P>
    <P>When such people take up new jobs the impact on the live register may not be great, as there is no one for one link between increased employment and a reduced live register figure.  However, such an increase in employment is of real benefit.  The policies of Government must be focused on the creation of employment opportunities for all citizens.</P>
    <P>Most importantly we must not pursue policies whose main goal is reducing the live register rather than boosting employment. For example, we could not pursue policies which aim to reduce the participation rates of women, or older workers, to reduce unemployment.  Similarly, we must not adopt the essentially nihilist approach of encouraging emigration to reduce the live register.  The reduction of &ldquo;hidden forms&rdquo; of unemployment must be addressed with measures aimed at assisting, among others, the long term unemployed.  This is why the mission statement of my Department speaks positively of generating employment growth with due regard to social cohesion.  The ESRI report correctly focuses on the need for firms in Ireland to remain competitive. As I mentioned earlier, a major contribution to facing the challenge of increased competition has been made in recent years by employers, trade unions and farmers working together at national level with the Government towards common goals.</P>
    <P>I endorse this approach in our society, of moving from conflict to consensus.  In particular, in the area of wage competitiveness, the adoption of a consensus rather than an adversarial approach will assist firms retain competitiveness which has been crucially won since 1987 &mdash; as described in the ESRI report &mdash; and which is an essential feature of future progress on increasing employment and wealth in our economy.  The lack of management of costs, including wage costs, has been a feature in the loss of competitiveness of Irish firms which has resulted in a significant loss in jobs in <Col N="905" /> the past.  This was particularly so in the traditional, employment intensive, Irish firms which suffered significant competitive disadvantages from the early 1960s to the mid-1980s as highlighted by the ESRI review.</P>
    <P>Upgrading the skill level of the workforce is a key element in securing the future competitiveness and prosperity of the country.  Various recent reports have indicated that in Ireland, training of those at work is low relative to competitor countries.  It is essential, therefore, that sufficient attention and resources are focused on achieving an improvement in the levels of skill of those in employment.</P>
    <P>Government commitment to increasing the skill levels of the employed is manifested in the support measures provided for in the National Development Plan and in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> In pursuance of the Culliton recommendations, a new industry division has been established in FÁS to focus on the training needs of the employed and the key elements of its support measures are as follows: (1) the identification of key skill deficiencies by means of a strategic review of the various sectors of economic activity; (2) exposure of firms to best international practice by support for visits, seminars and training programmes; (3) services to be given an equal focus with manufacturing and (4) a particular focus to be given to the needs of small businesses.</P>
    <P>A process is being put in train to formulate a focused strategic programme to meet the training needs of the employed embodying the elements I have just mentioned and indeed others, and I expect to see this finalised by the autumn.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the positive forecasts of the ESRI report, the fact remains that its projections indicate that unemployment will remain a major social and economic problem for the rest of the decade.  Of particular concern in this regard is not just the overall level of unemployment but in particular that of long term unemployment.  As the Delors White Paper points out training has a key role to play in this regard as an instrument of active labour market policy, making it <Col N="906" /> easier for young people to enter the labour market and promoting the reemployment of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>There must be two complementary dimensions to our response to the needs of the unemployed in terms of reintegrating them into the labour market. These comprise focused measures aimed at preventing a drift from short term unemployment to long term unemployment; measures aimed at meeting the specific needs of the long term unemployed and designed to reintegrate them in the active workforce.</P>
    <P>I have given a comprehensive review of the Government's assessment of the ESRI forecast.  However, that forecast itself presupposes a sound and efficient management of the economy.  This Government unlike any other, has demonstrated in the last 16 months that it is the best equipped administration to undertake this task.  The Programme for Government, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the national plan, taken together, are the best foundation stones that any administration has ever had in this country.  The political maturity and the quality of leadership between the coalition parties together in Government is the best guarantee to ensure that the optimistic forecasts by the ESRI become a reality.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for coming in to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a world where our sense of outrage has become dulled by the endless cycle of death and destruction portrayed on our television screens: sectarian murders on our own doorstep in Northern Ireland, ethnic cleansing and countless local regional conflicts in Bosnia, the sheer scale and viciousness of the killings in Rwanda still chills the heart.  The murder of 21 children and 13 Red Cross volunteers <Col N="907" /> at the weekend is part of the much wider and more horrifying picture.</P>
    <P>Since the present phase of violence erupted after the death of the President of Rwanda in a mysterious plane crash on 6 April 1994, some 200,000 people have been killed, many in the most appallingly cruel circumstances.  Close to 500,000 have been forced to leave the country and almost two million people have been left homeless.  It has been described by the international aid agency OXFAM as the worst humanitarian crisis since the killing fields of Cambodia in the 1970s.  The people of Cambodia were largely abandoned by the international community and left to their terrible fate and the same cannot be allowed to happen to the people of Rwanda.  The international community, through the United Nations, must act to stop further violence and provide aid for those who are suffering.</P>
    <P>The roots of the conflict are complex. It is not simply a tribal conflict as suggested in the European media.  It has more to do with politics and grinding poverty than with tribal allegiance.  There is no doubt, however, that the principal victims on this occasion are the minority Tutsi tribe who have suffered most of the casualties and comprise the majority of the refugees.</P>
    <P>There has been an unfortunate history of violent conflict in this central African country of eight million people.  When the violence escalated at the beginning of April there was already a small UN force, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda, UNAMIR.  The UN had 2,000 troops which operated a very limited mandate, but astonishingly in spite of the slaughter in the country the Security Council decided to reduce troop strength to 270.  The UN troops had been providing protection for approximately 16,000 people who had taken refuge in special sites and such a drastically reduced force could not continue to provide protection, never mind offer hope to the hundreds of thousands at risk.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Secretary General is due to report to the Security Council by tomorrow.  It is essential that <Col N="908" /> Ireland exerts all possible pressure on the United Nations to act.  The fact that the genocide is thousands of miles away and that the colour of the victims' skin is black does not lessen our moral obligation to act.  I know in calling for United Nations intervention we may be asked to back this up by providing Irish troops.  Given the scale of the violence we should be prepared to make this commitment although it may be more appropriate to have a peacekeeping force comprising troops from other African countries. Irish troops served with distinction more than 30 years ago in the then Congo and helped to end the violence there.  In spite of the clear risks involved I am sure there will be no shortage of volunteers in the Defence Forces who will be prepared to serve with the UN in Rwanda, if this is considered necessary.  If we are to halt the violence, the United Nations Security Council under the authority of Chapter 7 of the Charter must immediately increase the mandate and strength of UNAMIR and bring all possible pressure to bear on the combatants to meet to negotiate a ceasefire, to provide for the free passage of relief supplies, to provide safety guarantees for both the international and national humanitarian efforts and provide for the free movement of citizens who seek refuge in neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>There is also an urgent need to provide financial and humanitarian aid to neighbouring countries such as Tanzania and Burundi which have to cope with the huge influx of refugees and are in danger of being overwhelmed by the scale of the problem.  The Dáil should be asked, if necessary, to agree to a Supplementary Estimate to increase the allocation for overseas development aid so that we can provide some of the assistance that is badly needed.</P>
    <P>There is also an urgent need to address the question of how outbreaks of violence such as this can be prevented.  We need to address the policies that are being pursued by international financial agencies and world trading policies which, in many instances, are driving states such as Rwanda into abject poverty which is the breeding ground for this kind of violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this matter.  The reports of the conflict and associated atrocities in Rwanda are among the most horrific I have seen.  Since the killings of the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi on 6 April almost 200,000 have been reported killed and more than 400,000 have fled to neighbouring countries, mainly to Tanzania.  The flight of refugees from Rwanda is the largest and fastest that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has ever seen.</P>
      <P>The United Nations has informed us that the capital city, Kigali, is effectively divided into sectors controlled by the Rwandan Government forces and the Rwandan Patriotic Front, with frequent exchanges of artillery and mortar fire between the two sides.  Attacks on defenceless civilians have occurred throughout the country especially in areas under the control of the members or supporters of the armed forces of the interim Government of Rwanda.  Some of these have been the work of uncontrolled military personnel but most have been perpetrated by armed groups of civilians taking advantage of the complete breakdown of law and order.  The United Nations force in Rwanda, UNAMIR, reports strong evidence of preparations for further massacres of civilians in the city and that there are several large concentrations of civilians who fear for their lives but enjoy little effective protection.</P>
      <P>The Government is appalled at the fighting and at the continuing reports of the slaughter of innocent civilians in Kigali and other parts of Rwanda.  The killings and atrocities are an affront to everything we stand for and to the international system of order and justice for which we work.  The situation calls for the highest level of co-ordinated action by the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN Security Council is already seized of the matter.  On Saturday, in calling for an immediate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities, it demanded that the interim Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front take effective measures to prevent any attacks on <Col N="910" /> civilians in areas under their control.  It called on the leadership of both parties to commit themselves to ensuring that persons who instigate or participate in such attacks are prosecuted and punished. It condemned all breaches of international humanitarian law in Rwanda and recalled that persons who instigate or participate in such acts are individually responsible.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports these demands by the Security Council and the efforts of the UN Secretary General to bring an end to the conflict.  Civil war of the kind we are witnessing in Rwanda is among the most difficult and complex for the international community to deal with.  Nonetheless there is an urgent need for intensified action by the international community to bring the killings to an end and to promote the restoration of civil order.</P>
    <P>First, the UN must step up its efforts to bring about a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities.  The UN's Special Representative in Rwanda and the commander of UNAMIR have a key mediation role here, but so too does the Organisation of African Unity and we expect that the OAU and the countries in the region will use their influence with the parties.</P>
    <P>Second, the Security Council should review the role of UNAMIR to establish the contribution that a larger force with a new mandate could make.  We must recognise that in conditions of civil strife, and in a situation where the parties to the conflict cannot agree on a UN role, the Security Council has no easy task.  Already the UN Secretary-General has pointed to the complications arising from the fact that in recent days both sides have begun to express lack of confidence in UNAMIR's impartiality.  I believe that renewed efforts must concentrate on persuading the parties to accept an increased UN presence to protect the civilian population.</P>
    <P>Third, the international community must increase its humanitarian aid, particularly for the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled to neighbouring countries.  The Government is <Col N="911" /> ready to play its part.  We have already allocated £200,000 to Trócaire and the Red Cross and we are making available a further £300,000 for urgent needs. Beyond this Ireland will, at tomorrow's Development Council in Brussels, propose that the European Union send an urgent mission to the neighbouring countries to discuss the situation with the authorities there and to assess the immediate needs of the refugees.</P>
    <P>Fourth, we support a visit to the area by the newly-appointed UN Commissioner for Human Rights and an early meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.  Among the issues that should be considered is the establishment of a human rights presence in the area through the sending of human rights monitors.</P>
    <P>Fifth, the international community must act to prevent the supply of arms to the parties.  Already the Security Council has appealed to all states to refrain from providing arms or military assistance to the parties to the conflict.  The Security Council should now consider the application of an arms embargo to Rwanda.</P>
    <P>Rwanda is a small country, distant from us, but we cannot ignore the suffering of its people.  The proposals I have outlined are designed to create a framework within which a political solution to the crisis can be found.  We will be pursuing these aims with our partners in the European Union and with the relevant international organisations in the days ahead.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  In this age of modern technology it is ridiculous that people have to wait for up to 12 weeks for a passport if they apply through the post.  Most people living outside Dublin are forced to apply in this way. Applications received on 22 March are being opened today and the applicants may not receive their passports until the end of the month.  This is unacceptable <Col N="912" /> and is causing considerable distress and inconvenience to a large number of people, especially the elderly.</P>
      <P>An individual was in contact with me today to inform me that four and a half weeks ago his 80-year-old father and 72-year-old mother applied to have their passports renewed so that they could visit their son in the United States.  They are due to leave on 20 May.  They have yet to apply to the American Embassy for a visa.  They cannot confirm their flights because they are not sure if they will have their passports by that date.  As a result the cost of the flights will be increased. The only way they will be able to get a passport on time is to queue up at the Passport Office with new documentation. This is unacceptable.</P>

      <P>It is now almost impossible to make contact with the Passport Office in Dublin or Cork by telephone. Queues and delays are nothing new.  This matter has been raised on a number of occasions in the House.  Despite the promises and commitments the position has not improved; the opposite is the case.  No initiatives have been taken to alleviate the problem.</P>

      <P>Temporary offices have been opened this week in Blackrock, Coolock and Tallaght.  These will be closed at the end of the summer.  I understand that staff at these offices will receive applications, check that documents are in order and forward them to the Passport Office.  In other words, they will provide a courier service only and the process will not be speeded up.  No new staff are being employed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Staff from other offices have been deployed.  Despite this there will still be a two week delay.  While this may be of help to some people it will not <Col N="913" /> be of help to those who are most affected, those living outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>It should be possible to employ more staff in the Passport Office given that, at £45 a passport, this is a major revenue generator. Could staff not be redeployed from other Government offices, if necessary?  I compliment the existing dedicated and hard working staff who are working to full capacity and who face an impossible task.  To facilitate applicants from the country, will the Minister consider opening the Passport Office at weekends?  People who are unable to travel to Dublin on week days because of work would gladly present themselves at the Passport Office at the weekend if such a service was provided.  Also, the office could remain open for longer hours.  The Dublin office is open to the public from 9.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  Each morning the queue begins to form at approximately 7.30.  I was astonished to see a queue of approximately 100 people outside that office at 9 o'clock this morning.  That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Minister should examine the British system where special visitor passports, valid for one year, are issued at main post offices.  Those passports allow holders to visit any EU country in the year of issue.  Such a system, if introduced here, would relieve the workload of staff in the passport offices in Dublin and Cork and speed up considerably the issuing of passports.</P>
      <P>In recent months there have been long delays in receiving information from the Land Registry, particularly its mapping section.  There are also delays in the Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry, in its headage and premia payments section, and there are delays in the Passport Office.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government promised a more efficient service for the public from Government Departments and agencies, but the <Col N="914" /> experience to date is a total contradiction of that commitment.  The Minister is probably being asked by some of his constituents to take applications to the Passport Office in Dublin.  We should not have to do that type of work.  If we had a proper system whereby people could apply for a passport and receive it in one or two weeks they would not have to ask their public representatives to act as messenger boys for them.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure enough staff are employed in the Passport Office to process the applications received by post as efficiently and as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need to reduce the time taken in issuing passports.  Since taking office, I have given high priority to improving the capacity of the Passport Office to respond in a timely manner to the ever increasing public demand for passports.</P>
      <P>A combination of factors has given rise to the current difficulties.  The most significant of these problems are the cyclical nature of demand and difficulties in predicting levels of demand from one year to the next.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most important factor inhibiting accurate forward-planning is the unpredictability of the level of demand for passports.  In the period 1987-91, the demand for passports was reasonably stable at around 160,000.  In 1992, there was an incrase of almost 20 per cent in demand.  A further increase of 5 per cent in the level of applications occurred in 1993.  However, the level of increase has been exceptionally high this year.  By the end of last month, the number of applications which the Passport Office had to process was up by about 32 per cent compared with the corresponding period in 1993 &mdash; in volume terms, up from 65,000 in January-April 1993 to 86,000 in January-April 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There appear to be a variety of factors contributing to this increase including World Cup-related travel and a general increase in holiday bookings.  We understand from the travel trade that there has been an unprecedented rise in the level of foreign holiday reservations this year. <Col N="915" /> This level of increase is causing huge pressure on the Passport Office this year and every effort is being made to address the problems arising.</P>
    <P>The staffing situation in the Passport Office is obviously crucial.  I requested the Department of Finance to review the staffing structure of the office and its recommendations are being urgently implemented.  These involve a substantial increase in the permanent staff from 48 to 82.  Temporary staff have also been recruited for the peak season in line with the normal practice of the office.</P>
    <P>In view of the exceptional current demand, additional measures are also being taken as a matter of urgency.  These include redeployment of extra staff from other areas of my Department and evening and weekend overtime in the Passport Office.</P>
    <P>Approximately 50 per cent of the applications currently being processed by the Passport Office are being presented by personal callers.  Accommodation for the public in the main Passport Office in Molesworth Street has been greatly expanded and improved.  Currently this office is dealing with up to 700 counter applications a day, with a significant reduction in the average waiting period for service compared with last year.  For personal callers, passports are normally produced within two weeks; in cases of urgency, they are produced in a shorter period.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the average waiting period for postal applicants is considerably longer than for personal callers, although it does not come close to the 12 week period mentioned by the Deputy. As I have already said, additional steps are being taken as a matter of urgency to accelerate processing of postal applications and to help identify applications which have not yet been processed on the computer system.</P>
    <P>In addition to the expansion of the facilities in Molesworth Street, we have opened three temporary offices in Dublin suburban areas this week.  These offices <Col N="916" /> are located in Blackrock, Coolock and Tallaght.  They are designed to further improve the accessibility of the service and bring it closer to the public.  I also envisage that the Passport Office in Cork will be expanded and upgraded to the status of a full issuing office for the Munster area by the end of 1994.</P>
    <P>Special emphasis has also been placed on efforts to overcome the problems associated with seasonality of demand. The House will recall the introduction in 1992, and the continuation in 1993, of a special low season fee for passport applications received during the months of October and November.  The campaign was well received by the public and was reasonably successful in its objective. This was an experimental initiative which I would hope to continue this year.</P>
    <P>The Department has over the past few years also conducted a publicity campaign with the aim of encouraging people to apply for their passports in good time. As part of this campaign, the Passport Office has participated in holiday fairs in Dublin, Cork and Galway at which it has dealt with several thousand inquiries.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Passport Office has run advertising campaigns in the national press aimed specifically at urging those intending to travel abroad to check that they have an up-to-date passport and, if not, to apply in good time.</P>
    <P>A major upgrading of the computer system has now been completed.  This is helping to improve the service to the public by enhancing our ability to track applications and increasing our capacity in information storage and retrieval.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that some members of the public have encountered difficulties in getting through to the Passport Office by telephone.  We have experienced certain technical problems with our present telephone system which is not capable of dealing with the increased number of calls currently being made to the Passport Office.  We have sought and are currently examining tenders for the total replacement of our existing system with a new <Col N="917" /> expanded telephone network.  We envisage that the new system will be operational within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>I would like, in concluding, to assure the House that it remains the objective of the Passport Office to provide a prompt, courteous and efficient service to the public.  Every effort is being made to put the staffing and infrastructure in place to achieve this objective.  The staff in the Passport Office are highly motivated and hard working, as acknowledged by the Deputy.  I am confident that the measures which I have taken and those which are planned will lead to a significantly improved service when fully implemented.  In the meantime, as I have indicated, a range of special steps are being urgently taken with a view to addressing the immediate difficulties.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Rathmines (Dublin) Crime Levels.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a serious escalation in the level of crime in Rathmines, Dublin.  A recent letter which I received from a trader in the area stated:</P>
      <P>We are approaching in Rathmines an almost complete breakdown of law and order.  Burglaries and housebreaking are rampant.  Criminals are released on bail to go out and commit more crime.  In Rathmines for the first three months of the year we have already exceeded the total crime rate for 1993.  In Rathmines most of the shops have been broken into at least once &mdash; many of them several times. There is very little physical police presence on the street.  The stock answer is that there is a shortage of manpower. Can the law not be changed?  Can we have more policemen?  Is it a problem of management?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the questions that a trader in the Rathmines area has asked because of the level of crime he and his colleagues are experiencing in the area.  I cite that letter to illustrate to the Minister the <Col N="918" /> depth of feeling and the concern being expressed not only by traders in Rathmines but also by residents.  The problem is continuously raised with me.  A letter from another resident in my constituency states:</P>
    <P>Our road has become the target for a systematic series of burglaries.  Four houses have been burgled in the last few weeks.  Most of the houses on this road have burglar alarms.  We have set up a Neighbourhood Watch scheme for the road.  Effectively, as citizens we have taken all the appropriate steps to protect the road &mdash; short of forming vigilante patrols.</P>
    <P>One would not like to see this position developing but it is interesting that a law-abiding citizen makes this statement. This resident asks for additional patrols, even for a temporary period, to counter crime and to make resources available so that alarm calls can be promptly attended to.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the efforts which the gardaí are making in the area to deal with the problem.  My impression is that they are under-resourced to deal with the problem in the area and are doing as much as possible with mobile patrols, both uniformed and plain clothes gardaí, but it is difficult to do that and make it compatible with the many other demands on their resources.</P>
    <P>In the case of the citizen whom I mentioned, the criminal charged with crime, a drug addict, was granted bail and committed further crimes on the same road while on bail awaiting trial.  How can the residents on that road have confidence in the system in light of this experience?</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the implications of this position which is common throughout the city and the Bill put forward by the Fine Gael spokesperson on Justice, Deputy Gay Mitchell, in relation to bail.  A recent editorial in a Garda magazine states:</P>
    <P>Bail for serious crimes for the current breed of organised criminals is <Col N="919" /> simply an opportunity to build up a nest-egg for the time when they come out of prison.</P>
    <P>Detaining persons while on bail will require additional prison space, but this issue must be considered in the context of prison reform.  The Minister should consider the recently published Fine Gael document on prison reform and give it priority.  We do not have a national bureau of crime statistics, so precise data in relation to offences committed while on bail is not available and this should be addressed.  It is critical that a law-abiding community should feel protected.  There is no freedom if people do not experience personal safety.  This is especially true for the vulnerable members of our community, such as the elderly, who feel imprisoned in their homes in Rathmines. I know of one elderly lady who has been burgled eight times over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I have passed to the Minister a letter another constituent wrote to me.  It states:</P>
    <P>I wish to inform you that as a result of mugging and handbag snatching I have at my own expense collected 1,032 names and addresses in a petition for greater policing in the suburbs.</P>
    <P>She went on to state her concern about the collapse of law and order and her vulnerable position.  The Minister should analyse the crime trend in the Rathmines area on an ongoing basis.  I would like to know the results of such an analysis.  Will any of the new Garda recruits be deployed in this area?  Have civilian staff been recruited to release gardaí from administrative duties to outdoor duties? Is it intended to install closed circuit television in this area or will that facility be confined to the city centre?</P>
    <P>The results of a recent crime survey undertaken by Fine Gael in the Rathmines, Rathgar, Donnybrook, Sandymount, Ballsbridge and Ranelagh areas revealed 60 per cent of respondents or <Col N="920" /> someone in their home, had been a victim of crime in recent years, with some households experiencing more than one crime during that time.  My car window was smashed on two occasions while stopped at traffic lights in the past two years. In that survey many people made the important point that they considered they were not kept informed by the Garda of the progress of cases which had come to the attention of the Garda and only 10 per cent knew of charges made.  I am not blaming the Garda for this position as it is a matter of resources.  However, if people are to have confidence in the Garda they need to know they are responding to such cases and the details of the response.</P>
    <P>The question of truancy is a critical issue and it is the high road to delinquency. It is regrettable that a national programme to deal with it has not been put in place.  The 1908 legislation needs to be updated.  I hope it will come before the Dáil in the near future.  I look forward to the Minister's response to the issues I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Frances Fitzgerald for raising this issue.  The Minister for Justice is, of course, concerned at any level of crime in Rathmines or indeed in any part of the country and I can assure the Deputy that the Minister, with the full backing of the Government, is committed to dealing with the problem. Before dealing specifically with the Rathmines area it is necessary to deal with the general issue of crime, as it affects our society.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that crime is, unfortunately, an unpleasant aspect of modern life throughout most countries in the world.  It would be misleading and unfair to suggest that the crime situation in Ireland is as bad as, or indeed worse than, many of our European neighbours, many of whom have far greater resources available to them to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> It is also misleading to suggest that the solution to crime is simply a matter of pouring more and more resources into the law and order system.  Crime in modern day society is a broad and complex issue.  Extra resources for the law and order system, on their own, will not provide all the answers.  However, many Deputies will be aware that the operational strength of the Garda Síochána &mdash; that is the number of gardaí engaged on policing duties &mdash; is now at its highest level ever.  In addition, this House will be aware of the law and order package which the Minister for Justice announced last December, which amounts to the biggest initiative by a Government against crime for many years.  The package contains measures which reflect the Government's commitment to maintaining the strength of the force while at the same time reflecting the realisation that the response to crime must be a considered and comprehensive one.  The House will also be aware of the various criminal law measures which the Minister for Justice has implemented since taking office and which are playing an essential part in the Government's heightened campaign against crime.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn specifically to Deputy Fitzgerald's concern at crime in the Rathmines area.  A number of measures have been taken by the Garda authorities to deal with crime in the area including closer co-ordination and use of foot and mobile patrols and increased targeting of Garda resources to meet specific anti-crime needs in particular areas.  The role to be played by the community is, of course, also vital.  In this respect, the Garda authorities are continuing to promote the Neighbourhood Watch programme which encourages the community to be vigilant to the danger of crime, to work closely with the Garda and to take appropriate measures to protect their homes and their property. There are now 39 neighbourhood watch schemes in the Rathmines area.  In addition, I am informed that the number <Col N="922" /> of community police has been increased significantly in the last year and that they keep in regular contact with neighbourhood groups and visit victims of crime, particularly of burglary and robbery, to discuss the situation with them and offer crime prevention advice.  The Minister has been assured by the Garda authorities that they will take any further appropriate measures that may be necessary to deal with problems in the area.</P>
    <P>In relation to manpower levels, the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda manpower to individual areas, have informed the Minister for Justice that the current Garda strength at Rathmines station is 74.  The Garda are satisfied that the current policing arrangements for the Rathmines area are adequate to meet the needs of the area, but they are keeping the situation under continuing review.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently received a letter from Deputy Fitzgerald in relation to specific incidents in the Rathmines and adjoining areas.  The Minister has now received a report from the Garda authorities in relation to these and will be responding in detail to the Deputy within the next few days.  I do not, therefore, propose to deal with those issues now.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Minister for Justice recently attended a seminar on crime in the south inner city, including the Rathmines area, organised by Deputy Eoin Ryan.  This was a very well attended seminar and the Minister listened and responded to a large number of contributions from the floor.  She was advised of the community's concerns about crime and undertook to take action in a number of specific areas in response to these.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Ashbourne (Meath) Water Supply.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the problems concerning the augmentation of the water supply in Ashbourne, County Meath.  Ashbourne has had a bad water supply for a number of years.  There have <Col N="923" /> been instances of it being cut off and frequently it has been dirty.  I am aware of cases where clothes were destroyed in washing machines because dirty water entered the machines.  That is the standard of service for which the people of Ashbourne are paying Meath County Council a service charge of £105 a year.</P>
      <P>Meath County Council has proposed works to remedy the position.  It estimated the necessary remedial works to provide a proper water supply to Ashbourne residents and to allow it expand will cost £2.9 million, or more.  In a letter of 28 March to Meath County Council, the Minister for the Environment announced he will allocate only £2.61 million towards the cost of the £2.9 million scheme.  The shortfall of £300,000 is a departure from the previous practice of funding capital projects in full from the Exchequer on the basis of accepted costings. Meath County Council is of the view that the Minister's letter raises serious fundamental issues not only for Meath County Council but all local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister's letter appears to indicate a major change of policy on funding of capital sanitary service schemes, which would have very serious financial implications for County Meath and all local authorities.  Phase 2 of the proposed east Meath regional water supply scheme, which was to extend and augment water supply to Dunshaughlin, Rathoath and Dunboyne, has already been dropped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in referring to the £300,000 shortfall, said that &ldquo;additional costs must be borne locally&rdquo;.  If the £300,000 shortfall is to be met by the residents of Ashbourne it would mean a one-off payment of approximately £200 per household on top of the existing annual service charge of £105.  If the shortfall is to be met by all the residents of Meath, it would mean a once-off payment of £25 or £30 by all the residents of Meath, including those living perhaps 60 miles from Ashbourne.  Where does the Minister believe Meath County Council <Col N="924" /> should find the money?  Is he suggesting it should cut back on the already inadequate allocation for the maintenance of county roads?  If he intends to find the money in Ashbourne by a £200 once-off charge on the residents there, I draw his attention to the fact that 95 per cent of the houses in Ashbourne are already mortgaged to the hilt and that these residents cannot afford such a change.  The people who live in Ashbourne have been hard hit already by the Government's changes in mortgage interest relief, voluntary health insurance relief and so on. Are they now to be hit by an additional capital charge for a decent water supply, for which they are already paying an annual charge?</P>
    <P>There is massive resistance in Ashbourne to this alarming precedent being set by the Minister for the Environment. It seems to be an attempt by him to introduce by the back door the super service charge to which the Taoiseach referred in his off-the-cuff but disarmingly honest remarks in Killarney when he indicated the true long term intentions of the partnership Government in this area.  Does the precedent set by the Minister mean that all capital projects will be 10 per cent short of funding? Will a 10 per cent capital contribution have to be collected by local authorities in all counties where capital works are necessary?</P>
    <P>As well as the need for a decent water supply in Ashbourne, there is a need for a sewage treatment works which would cost £4 million.  Will that project also be 10 per cent short of funding and will the residents have to pay a further &mdash; perhaps £400 per household &mdash; for sewage augmentation works?  If the precedent is accepted in this case, that would obviously be on the cards.</P>
    <P>After the very controversial Dunboyne second level school issue, one is beginning to wonder whether Meath is being used as the testing ground for some of the Government's hare-brained policy solutions.  The Meath people deeply <Col N="925" /> resent being used as guinea pigs for some of the less considered ideas of the Government to extend central Government control and strangle local democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Bruton for raising this matter. The Minister's reply to Parliamentary Question No. 117 of 19 April from Deputy Bruton set out as clearly as is feasible at this stage the basis on which the Ashbourne water supply scheme should be financed.  A maximum budget of £2.61 million is to be provided by my Department from Exchequer sources for the scheme; the final cost of this scheme cannot, however, be known until the tender process has been completed.  It follows that it is premature to speculate on the detailed means by which expenditure additional to this sum, if any, would be met from local sources.</P>
      <P>The Ashbourne water supply was also raised in a Seanad Adjournment Debate of 27 April 1994.  In my contribution to that debate I outlined the background and the present position on the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is aware of the problems associated with the existing water supply to Ashbourne.  The town has in the past suffered water shortages as a result of being located at the extreme end of the east Meath regional water supply scheme.  In response to this problem, Meath County Council developed a borehole source at Curragha, which was to serve Ashbourne and the surrounding areas.  However, the yield from the Curragha borehole source, while adequate in quantity, was not of an acceptable standard for drinking water.  This groundwater source has a high iron and manganese content which caused frequent discoloration of the Ashbourne water supply.  Consequently my Department approved in November 1993, at a cost of £100,000, the installation of a filtration plant and chlorine residual unit; the purpose of this is to reduce iron and manganese levels in the water supply below the <Col N="926" /> maximum admissible concentrations, as required by the European Union regulations, and reduce the amount of sediment from these elements which was getting into the system.</P>
    <P>This work was completed in March 1994 and became operational recently; I understand the water quality has improved significantly.  I stress that these works were carried out as an interim measure to effect an immediate improvement in the quality of the Ashbourne water supply pending consideration of the quantity difficulties-distribution network by Meath County Council and my Department.</P>
    <P>Meath County Council has submitted a proposal to my Department to deal with the distribution difficulties.  As I said, the council has been advised that the Minister is prepared to provide a maximum budget of £2.61 million for these works, on condition that any additional costs involved would be borne locally.  This offer was made to Meath County Council by the Minister, Deputy Smith, following representations to him by a deputation of concerned local people.  This scheme was not on my Department's national priorty list, but the Minister considered that a way forward could be found either through stringent cost control or by local contribution to reduce Exchequer outlay.  The alternative would be simply to refuse any approval to the scheme or to put it on hold, as unfortunately, has to be done for many schemes around the country given the excess of demands over finance available.</P>
    <P>If Meath County Council agrees to this arrangement the scheme can then proceed to contract document stage.  It is, however, a matter for Meath County Council to determine how the scheme can be managed within the specified budget or, failing this, how any balance of cost should be met.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton will appreciate there are many well justified water service proposals competing for funds around the <Col N="927" /> country.  Innovative approaches may help us to ease some of this pressure and to enable some schemes to progress ahead of schedule.  Public representatives need to consider well the advantages of these approaches in terms of bringing services forward, rather than automatically objecting to them.</P>

      <P>No licence is required to fish for trout or coarse fish.  To fish for trout and/or coarse fish in the Shannon Fisheries Region north of Banagher and in the Northern Region it is necessary to hold a share certificate.

      <P>I am advised that there is no single definitive answer to the Deputy's question.  Biological loadings and capacities are variable and localised, being primarily determined by the specific characteristics of the bay or basin concerned.</P>
      <P>A combination of site evaluation, baseline survey and ongoing monitoring is used in the assessment of the ecological impact of fish farming in our coastal waters.  The initial site evaluation is undertaken as part of the licensing process to identify the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the waterbody concerned, and to identify the potential effects of a fish farm on the particular marine environment.  Baseline surveys are also undertaken to obtain reference data on all the relevant parameters, such as nutrients, the seabed and water quality, which subsequently must be monitored at monthly intervals. This mandatory assessment and water quality monitoring strategy is among the most stringent anywhere and has been endorsed by an internationally recognised expert in the field.  The results of the ongoing monitoring programme confirm that water quality in Irish coastal waters has not been adversely affected by the presence of fish farming.</P>

      <P>&mdash;during this four year period, nets of up to 2.5 km may be used, but their use must be reduced each year;</P>
      <P>&mdash;boats which previously held the derogation to fish with nets up to 5 km may continue to do so, for 1994 only.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Commission has indicated that funding may be made available to assist fishermen who fish with drift nets to change over to an alternative method of fishing.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the proposal caused much concern among Ministers at the April Council.  The Council decided that the proposal should be examined in detail prior to the next Council in June, when decisions on the proposal will be discussed further.</P>
      <P>I have pushed Ireland's case strongly on this issue to date, at Council of Fisheries Ministers' level, and in correspondence and meetings with the Commissioner and other Ministers, and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>There is, in my view, no basis on fisheries grounds for the banning of drift netting for tuna.  There are, however, serious concerns internationally about the impact of this method of fishing on other marine species, in particular dolphins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to ensure at the June Council that the long term interests of the Irish fishing industry will be secured <Col N="843" /> and safeguarded to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <P>In so far as port projects are concerned, the Department has identified portal requirements and is now in the process of identifying projects to meet those requirements.  This process will be concluded as soon as possible.  Final proposals will then have to be submitted to the EU for approval.

      <P>Under the national development plan a sum of £12 million is being made available by the Government towards the improvement of facilities, including the ice plant network, at fishery harbours.  In order to optimise the benefits of harbour investment projects, the Department is formulating a fishery harbour development plan to be implemented over the next six years. Given the total costs of the projects submitted to the Department for consideration and possible inclusion in the plan far exceed the money available, only the projects considered most strategically or economically benefical will be included in the final plan.  No development works will be undertaken unless the costs can be justified by reference to the economic benefits arising.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy might be interested to know that the Ardmore Fishermen's Association were in contact with the Department late last year, requesting among other things, advice on the development of the harbour.  On 24 February, 1994, one of the Department's engineers met with a number of local interests in Ardmore and advised on the types of studies that would be required in advance of any development works. The engineer further advised that local <Col N="845" /> interests should liaise and consult closely with Waterford County Council who are responsible for the harbour.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that any development which might be undertaken in the fishery interest be co-ordinated with other developments, such as recreational facilities, to ensure compatibility and to maximise the gain from carrying them out together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of experience to date in the prosecution of serious fishing offences, I am of the view that effective legislative provisions allowing for the confiscation of vessels are essential if the illegal fishing activities of persistent offenders are to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Last month I published the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1994 which extends the scope of the confiscation of fishing vessels convicted of fisheries offences. This penalty was originally provided for in the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1983. In practice, however, following first convictions, owners have contrived to avoid the possibility of confiscation in the event of subsequent convictions by transferring the ownership of boats to new companies. The amendment contained in the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill will allow a court to order the forfeiture of a boat where an offence or a combination of offences is considered by the court to constitute a serious abuse of conservation measures and where conviction on a second or subsequent conviction for an offence is committed on board the same ship within three years of the date of the commission of the previous offence.</P>
      <P>Where it is suspected that a change of ownership has been effected in order to evade the risk of forfeiture, the onus of proving to the satisfaction of the court that the change of ownership was bona fide will rest with the defendant.</P>
      <P>I have given consideration to the argument that the confiscation of fishing vessels should be mandatory.  I have come to the conclusion, however, that the imposition of penalties should be left to the courts.  I am satisfied that the amendments being brought forward will close the loophole that exists in the present law and will empower the courts to order the confiscation of vessels where they deem it appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, during the Second Stage debate on the Bill I announced my intention to bring forward amendments at the Committee Stage which will increase the level of fines for serious fisheries offences.  In particular, I propose to increase the fines for having a hidden <Col N="847" /> hold or undersized nets from £10,000 to £50,000.  I am satisfied that these penalties will give the courts the powers they need to deal with illegal fishing and will give a clear indication of the seriousness we attach to this matter.  I also noted the comments made by some Deputies on this subject during that debate and signalled my willingness to consider very seriously any amendments which they might bring forward which would improve the proposed legislation.</P>

      <P>In line with Article 3 of the Regulation, Ireland is required to present to the Commission a sectoral plan for the fisheries sector for the period of the national plan, 1994-99.  The sectoral plan contains the detailed fisheries planning underlying the national plan.</P>
      <P>In line with the Government's policy as set out in the national plan, the Department of the Marine has prepared a fully-integrated sectoral plan for the fishing industry, covering not only the fleet, aquaculture and fish processing and marketing, but also fisheries harbours, training and marine research.  I should point out that this is the first occasion on which such a fully-integrated plan for the fisheries sector has been drawn-up.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, provision for a voluntary fishing vessel decommissioning scheme has been included in the fisheries programme of the national plan for the period 1994-99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> The objective of the scheme is to remove up to 4,000 gross registered tonnage from the fleet and so to enable Ireland to meet its fleet targets while at the same time assisting in the long term development of the fleet by facilitating the entry of more modern vessels.</P>
    <P>Without such a scheme, Ireland would have extreme difficulty in meeting its fleet capacity targets.  This could have serious implications for European Union Structural Funding for the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>While the details of the scheme are currently being worked out in the Department, I can say that, in outline, the conditions of the scheme will be as follows: only vessels currently and correctly entered on the Register of Sea Fishing Vessels and actively fishing will be eligible for a decommissioning grant; in order to qualify for a grant, a vessel must be removed from the Register of Sea Fishing Vessels and must be scrapped; boats so scrapped will not be accepted as replacement capacity and the scheme will be administered by BIM.</P>
    <P>The scheme will also operate in line with the guidelines for decommissioning schemes set in the new Fisheries Structural Funds Regulation agreed by the Council last December.  This will mean, for example, that vessels decommissioned will have to have proven track records of fishing and must satisfy certain age conditions.</P>
    <P>The levels of grant-aid for decommissioning have not yet been decided. However, I can inform the Deputy that up to some £6 million has been earmarked for the scheme and that funding for the scheme will be available from the European Union at rates between 50 per cent and 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>Given that it is envisaged that vessels likely to be decommissioned will generally be the smaller, older and less efficient boats in the fleet, the reduction in full-time jobs should not be significant. Moreover, losses in employment as a consequence of decommissioning should, to a large extent, be balanced by gains in employment resulting from investment in vessel modernisation.</P>

      <P>While I would accept that fish stocks in the Irish Sea are seriously depleted, I can assure the Deputy that the need to address this problem is being given a high priority.  The Department of the Marine has been working closely with the UK fishery authorities on the introduction of conservation measures to safeguard and regenerate Irish Sea stocks in order to preserve a sustainable livelihood for the fishermen who fish in those waters.</P>
      <P>Most recently both the Irish and UK authorities have introduced a requirement that all prawn trawls must have square mesh panels which allows immature white fish to escape.  This will eliminate discards in the prawn fishery, which for the Irish fleet alone, were estimated to be of the order of 5,000 tonnes per annum.  In addition the Irish and UK authorities have retained a minimum landing size for Irish Sea Whiting 17 per cent above the approved norm of 23cm. These measures will help to ensure that young fish survive to spawn.</P>
      <P>New legislation to increase and extend the powers of sea fishery protection officers which will enable them to seek the confiscation of illegal nets irrespective of whether they are found on board a vessel or ashore is currently going through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, the second stage of which was taken on 13 April last, will also increase the prospect that persistent offenders may have their vessels confiscated by the courts.  In addition, I intend to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage which will increase the maximum fine for having on board undersize nets, from £10,000 to £50,000.  In addition, over the past year the Department has more than doubled <Col N="851" /> the number of fishery protection officers based on the east coast.</P>
    <P>These deterrents combined with the other conservation measures, either planned or already in place, will help to address the ongoing problem of fish stocks both in the Irish Sea and in other Irish waters.</P>

      <P>By way of background, I will outline the training and educational facilities available in the fishing sector. An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, is the main agency undertaking State-funded fisheries and aquaculture training of a vocational nature.  BIM also provides training in health, hygiene and quality in the fisheries area.  Training is carried out at the National Fisheries Training Centre at Greencastle, County Donegal and at fishery ports around the coast through the use of a mobile training unit.</P>
      <P>The objective of BIM's training programme is to provide training to ensure the efficiency, safety, quality and business skills necessary to support the maintenance and expansion of employment in fishing.  BIM's training programmes, many of which prepare participants for professional examinations, are of a very high quality.  Most of the training programme participants either obtain gainful employment in the fisheries area, or return to better employment in the area, on completion of training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out to the Deputy that, under the new sectoral plan for fisheries, fishing training will become part of a fully-integrated development programme for the fisheries sector, with the enhanced commitment and suppert for the training programme that this will <Col N="852" /> give.  This is a very important development which will allow us to take a long term review of all of the aspects of the industry and to develop each individual aspect as a part of the whole industry.</P>
    <P>BIM is not, however, the only agency involved in training in the fisheries sector. There are, in addition, in excess of 35 educational establishments around the country which also provide training and research in the fisheries area.  I can, if it would be of assistance, arrange to make available a list of these institutions to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy will agree that the training and educational facilities available to those interested in a fishing career are very substantial and appear to meet the needs of all of those interested in such a career.  A full assessment of the training requirements for the fishing sector will be undertaken as part of the present review of BIM.</P>

      <P>Wicklow County Council in their submission in respect of the Department of the Marine's coast protection programme identified a number of local coastal protection needs.  However, a scheme at Bray was listed as their No. 1 priority. This will certainly influence the final decision as to which projects are to be included in the programme.</P>
      <P>Under the national plan it is envisaged that £5.5 million will be spent over the 1994 to 1999 period on coast protection projects with the support of Structural Fund aid.  In order to maximise the return from this spending it is intended to identify priority projects for inclusion in the programme.  As I am sure the Deputy can imagine, the cost of the proposals submitted to the Department of the Marine far exceeds the moneys available for this purpose under the national plan. The proposals submitted by Wicklow County Council alone came to £11.5 million. Finalisation of a list of priority projects and the nature of the works to be undertaken is subject to further detailed discussion with the coastal local authorities. In this regard discussions have recently been held with Wicklow County Council and Bray Urban District Council. In addition, the agreement of an operational programme must be reached with the Commission of the European Communities, which will subvent the programme's implementation.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of these exercises it is not possible to identify which projects will be included in the finalised programme. That being said, I am familiar with the particular problem at Bray and am giving full consideration to its inclusion in the programme.</P>

      <P>The potential for eel development has been and is being studied by the Fisheries Research Centre, the ESB and Forbairt.  Preliminary results of these studies indicate that there is considerable potential for development of this fishery; in particular, if a comprehensive elver stocking programme were introduced in selected river systems the catch of eels could be increased to approximately 1,500 tonnes.  This increased catch would create both direct and indirect jobs in catching, processing and exporting eels. As this would be a self-sustaining resource the benefits accruing would be ongoing.  Eels are a high value, much sought after species attracting around £3,000 to £5,000 per tonne at first sale. Increased production could lead to the processing of eels on a commercial basis, thus further increasing their jobscreation potential and economic value with a projected turnover of £15 million per annum.</P>
      <P>At present there are less than ten full-time jobs and approximately 100 part-time ones in the industry.  If catches in the region of 1,500 tonnes per annum were achieved up to 350 extra full-time jobs could be created over a period of ten to 15 years.</P>
      <P>The ESB has just completed a major research and development programme aimed at attaining the maximum possible exploitation of eels in the Shannon.  They have at present provided 80 part-time jobs as a result of this and will shortly be providing 20 further jobs.</P>
      <P>In the Erne catchment Forbairt have completed a feasibility study on developing the eel industry.  It is expected that this will be followed by a research and development phase similar to that being carried out by the ESB.</P>
      <P>A project to develop this industry is being prepared and will be considered for funding under the European Union Structural Funds Programme 1994-1999.</P>

      <P>In order to draw up a national coastal protection plan, all maritime local authorities were invited to submit proposals for addressing serious erosion problems in their administrative areas.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 63 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>The PESCA programme is a European Union funding initiative aimed specifically at the fisheries sector.  The programme was launched in February as part of the Union's response to the structural changes in the fishing industry brought about as a consequence of a number of factors, including global fleet reductions, the ongoing instability on the markets and the possible enlargement of the Union.  These factors have serious implications for regions which are predominantly or entirely dependent on fisheries to support their local economy.</P>
      <P>The aims of PESCA are to help the fishing industry overcome these difficulties and so contribute to the socio-economic survival of regions dependent on fisheries through the development of job-creating measures.  Some ECU250 million have been set aside for PESCA over the period 1994-1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific elements of the programme have not yet been ironed out but I understand that aid will be available for a range of measures, including diversification into other activities such as tourism, setting up new businesses, employment measures, including training, <Col N="858" /> facilitation of access to capital for new enterprises and projects in fisheries management, promotions and marketing.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the programme will be finalised and published sometime in June this year.  In the meantime, the Commission is consulting with member states in regard to the detailed guidelines and funding allocations under the initiative.</P>
    <P>No decisions have yet been taken on the allocation of the funding to member states.  I can assure Deputies that Ireland is pressing for the highest possible allocation under the programme.</P>
    <P>In order to generate interest and encourage the submission of concrete and innovative projects for implementation at local level, the European Commission will give widespread publicity to the initiative and in particular, will organise a series of information presentations in coastal regions over the next month or two.</P>
    <P>It is expected that applications for assistance will be sought during the autumn of 1994.  The Department will consider applications from all interested parties, in particular from island and coastal communities.</P>

      <P>There were a number of reasons for my recent visit to Iran.  In particular my visit was intended to follow up on the Second Commission for Economic, Industrial, Scientific and Technical Co-operation between Ireland and Iran with particular emphasis on fisheries; to assess at first hand with the various Ministries and companies the market opportunities in Iran for Ireland related to the fisheries sector; to set a solid foundation to enable exporters in Ireland to deal quickly and efficiently with Iranian companies; to enhance Iranian/Irish relationships to the economic benefit of Ireland and to establish, if possible, a precise and wide-ranging Memorandum of Understanding on fisheries.</P>

    <P>During a meeting with Mr Natege Nouri, the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, we discussed the need for a better balance in trade between Ireland and Iran.  Mr Nouri also accepted an invitation from the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil to visit Ireland.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with Mr Gholamreza Faroozesh, Iran's most senior Minister for Economic Development, a formal Memorandum of Understanding was agreed between Ireland and Iran.</P>
    <P>The main areas identified in the memorandum for possible future agreements include exports of Irish fish to Iran, sales of fishing vessels and gear, training of Iranian skippers and crews and major opportunities in airport construction and management, as well as the supply of equipment for seaports.</P>
    <P>As far as fisheries in particular are concerned, the Iranians agreed to consider purchasing up to 10,000 tonnes of horse mackerel from Ireland and to consider the possibility of importing mackerel, herring, fresh and smoked salmon and tuna; the Iranians expressed interest in purchasing fishing gear and nets from Ireland; there was agreement to explore the possibility of Irish firms selling small fibre-glass fishing vessels to Iran and the possibility of an Irish company providing development and training programmes in Iranian fisheries was discussed.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive national ports policy is in place.  The strategy which underpins this policy is focused on improving competitiveness and expanding the capacity of the internationallytraded sectors of the Irish economy.  The policy is directed at supply side factors and offers significant potential to influence the rate of growth of the productive sectors of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>The two primary objectives of our port policy are as follows: to facilitate the expansion of industry and agriculture and facilitate the expansion of tourism.</P>
      <P>The third objective is to assist local sub-regional development.</P>
      <P>The operational objectives of our port policy programme are as follows: ensuring that there is adequate safe capacity for passenger and freight traffic; improving access to international export and tourism markets; reducing costs to industry, tourism and agriculture by encouraging investments which reduce direct user costs, reduce transit times and encourage competition in shipping with resultant cost advantages.</P>
      <P>Achievement of these objectives entails the ongoing pursuit of the following complementary policies: (a) restructuring of the management framework for port authorities through the early introduction of commercial semi-State enterprises to manage the 12 bigger ports and (b) a major programme of investment, supported by Community funds, in port infrastructure and facilities, the emphasis being on investment in strategic corridors so as to increase frequency of service and benefit economies of scale.  The major programme of investment is in line with the Government's stated aim in the Programme for a Partnership Government of ensuring that our commercial seaports have appropriate capacity and high quality infrastructure, strategically located in relation to sea corridors and main internal transport arteries, having regard to the upcoming opening of the Channel Tunnel and also to facilitate the introduction of new ship handling and shipping technology.</P>

In addition, the privately financed advance factory of 10,000 sq. ft. at Poolboy, which is now let on a short term lease, will continue to be promoted for a long term project.</P>
      <P>As everything possible is being done by the agencies in full co-operation with local business groups to attract new investment to Ballinasloe and to develop and promote facilities in the area for this purpose, I am not at all convinced that a task force would necessarily bring about any better or faster results.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 to 79 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The original proposal for the Macroom water supply scheme involved the development of a new abstraction source and treatment facility, the laying of an extensive distribution system and the provision of storage reservoirs.  The latest estimate of cost for this proposal was £4.9 million.</P>
      <P>The revised proposal for the scheme provides for the enlargement and improvement of the existing abstraction and treatment facility, together with improvements to the distribution and storage systems.  The estimated cost is £2.3 million, towards which a substantial contribution is to be made by a benefiting local industry; details of this contribution are being finalised between the local authority and the industry.  The revised scheme will cater for increased industrial requirements and provide an additional 50,000 gallons per day to the town of Macroom.</P>
      <P>My Department has paid £155,000 to Macroom UDC in respect of preliminary expenditure on the scheme, and this amount forms part of the cost estimates mentioned above.  Other preliminary expenditures will be examined in the context of the further development of the revised scheme.</P>

      <P>In the past five years there has been one incident where it was established that a submarine was involved with an Irish vessel.  The incident, which involved a fishing vessel, occurred in 1989.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the dangers posed by submarines to shipping and fishing vessels and their crews.  As Minister with responsibility for safety of life at sea as well as for the shipping and fishing sectors I am committed to taking every possible opportunity to focus the attention of the international maritime community on the hazards posed by submarines and to highlight the need for constant vigilance on the part of those who operate such vessels.</P>
      <P>Under international law submarines travelling on the surface have the right of innocent passage, without notification, through territorial waters.  They may, on the other hand, pass freely through international waters whether on the surface or submerged.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Ireland continues to make her concerns at the dangers posed by submarines known at the appropriate international fora notably the United Nations and the International Maritime Organisation, IMO.  At the Irish Government's initiative a Resolution on the avoidance by submerged submarines of fishing vessels and their fishing gear was passed by the General Assembly of the IMO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Resolution urges IMO member states first, to ensure that submarines navigating through areas where vessels are known to fish use all available means for determining the presence of such vessels and their fishing gear; second, to <Col N="870" /> ensure that a submerged submarine, if information on the presence of a fishing vessel and its fishing gear is available, will avoid that fishing vessel and any fishing gear connected to it.</P>

      <P>In line with this policy objective, the Department is devoting considerable resources to bringing all shellfish aquaculture operations in Bantry Bay under an effective licensing and monitoring regime.</P>
      <P>While the existing salmon farming operation in Bantry Bay is fully licensed, a number of individual applications for licensing of scallop and mussel farming operations at specific sites in the bay are currently being considered under fisheries Acts and the Foreshore Act, 1933. These applications, which are at an advanced stage are being assessed by the Department from all relevant technical and scientific perspectives.  A public consultative process, which includes advertisement of proposals in the local press, will form part of the licensing process. The procedure also involves consultation with Cork County Council who have jurisdiction over the bay from a planning perspective, and consultation with local fisheries interests, as well as other relevant statutory bodies such as Bord Failte and the Bantry Harbour Commissioners. It is the Department's intention to finalise these licensing applications as a priority.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) monitors the levels of radioactivity in Irish waters to study the distribution of contaminating radio-nuclides, identify trends and assess the risk to public health.  In relation to the <Col N="876" /> Irish Sea, the monitoring programme involves the routine sampling and analysis of seawater, seaweed, sediments, fish and shellfish along the east coast.  Samples of seawater and sediments are also collected from the Irish Sea from an area south of Dublin extending northwards to Dundalk Bay.</P>
      <P>The RPII publishes the results of its monitoring programme and results for the period 1988-90 are available.  If the Deputy so requires, I can forward him a copy of this report.  The report for the period 1991-92 is in the course of publication. In general, results of this programme show that concentrations of radionuclides in the Irish Sea have shown a decrease in recent years.  This has been due to the significant decrease in the Sellafield discharges.  In addition, the RPII's monitoring programme shows that there is no significant risk to health from the consumption of marine produce from the Irish Sea.  There should be no concern about frequenting beaches or enjoying the facilities of the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>Concerns have been expressed on occasions about the presence of plutonium in the Irish marine environment. The RPII has measured its concentrations and found them to be very low.  It is, of course, keeping the plutonium concentrations under continuing review.</P>
      <P>Whilst the RPII's monitoring programme provides a reassurance that there is no significant risk to the health of the Irish public as a consequence of the Sellafield discharges, the discharges cause contamination of the Irish Sea. This contamination is not welcomed and I would like to see all discharges progressively reduced and ultimately eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to discharges from the Sellafield-THORP plant, which is only now going into operation, I would like to reiterate the Government's total opposition to the continued operation of all nuclear activities carried out at Sellafield and to any expansion of these activities. I have asked the RPII to extend its monitoring programme to take account of the THORP plant.  New sampling equipment <Col N="877" /> has been installed to measure emissions particular to that plant.  The results of such monitoring will be scrutinised by the RPII on an ongoing basis and I can reassure the Deputy that the results will be communicated to the Irish public in realistic terms.</P>

      <P>The issue in question relates to the operation of a redeployment scheme for lay teachers in Catholic secondary schools under religious-clerical management and in particular to the supplementary panel for temporary teachers associated with the scheme.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of a direct inquiry by the person concerned.  However, representations have been made on his behalf.  It has been represented that the operation of the supplementary panel contravenes Article 44 of the Constitution and Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Rules for the payment of incremental salary, made under the Intermediate Education Act, 1914 by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance, set out the basis for the payment of incremental salary grant to a quota of recognised teachers in a secondary school that is recognised by the Minister.  The Department, at a particular stage each year and on the basis of information available at the time regarding pupil enrolment, advises the managerial authorities of secondary schools as to their authorised incremental salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a condition of recognition from the Minister, the management authority <Col N="881" /> must provide a programme of instruction as laid down in the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools.  The management authority may employ such numbers of teachers as it deems necessary to provide an adequate teaching staff to impart efficient instruction in the subjects of the curriculum prescribed in these rules.  The management authority may, if it so wishes, employ teachers in addition to its authorised quota at its own expense.</P>
    <P>To ensure continuity of employment for lay teachers in Catholic secondary schools under religious-clerical management, a redeployment scheme was agreed between the religious and clerical authorities of those schools and the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland.  This scheme, which was introduced in 1988, provides for the filling by the school authority, through a process facilitated by an independent administrator, of vacancies arising in the authorised quota through: (a) the redeployment of permanent wholetime teachers whose posts would be in excess of the authorised quota for their schools or who made voluntary application for redeployment; (b) the appointment of eligible temporary teachers.  Eligible temporary teachers are temporary teachers who have taught for a minimum of 18 hours per week for at least two years in schools which are participating in the scheme.  Teaching service in a school which is not participating in the redeployment scheme is not reckoned for supplementary panel purposes.</P>
    <P>Vacancies remaining unfilled following the redeployment process are filled by the school authority.</P>
    <P>The management authority of a secondary school, which is a private institution, is the employer of teachers in that school.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the questions raised in relation to the operation of the supplementary panel are essentially matters for the parties to the redeployment scheme, i.e. the managerial authorities of Catholic secondary schools under <Col N="882" /> religious-clerical management and the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland.</P>

      <P>At the primary level, the Department of Education reserves to itself the right to sanction textbooks for use in national schools.  To this purpose <i>Guidelines for Publishers of History Textbooks</i> were issued in 1981.  The guidelines ensure the promotion in the textbooks of the philosophy and principles embodied in Curaclam na Bunscoile, 1971, namely: &ldquo;Care should also be taken that in the presentation of facts there is no distortion or suppression of any truth which might seem to hurt national pride.  The picture of events which the child carries with him/her from the classroom should be true to the facts and unspoiled by special pleading of any kind.  It should, in particular, represent fairly the contribution of all creeds and classes to the evolution of modern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When history textbooks are in preparation, draft manuscripts are submitted to the Department where they are carefully scrutinised by the inspectorate.  In the case of any lack of balance or objectivity, amendments to the text are sought before publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary curriculum is now under review by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  While no major changes are expected in the history programme, there will undoubtedly be further clarification of the need for balance <Col N="883" /> and objectivity in the presentation of historical facts to pupils.</P>
    <P>The textbooks used as aids in the teaching of history in post-primary schools are chosen by the teachers themselves and are not prescribed by my Department.  An objective of the education process of teachers of history, at both initial and inservice training, is the development of special sensitivity in the selection of textbooks with a view to ensuring that their content is deemed suitable both for the history syllabuses being taught and also for the students in the context of the aims and objectives of the specific syllabuses.</P>
    <P>My Department does not seek to promote a particular point of view on any aspect of Irish or world history.  It seeks to promote the teaching of the subject in a manner consonant with the discipline of history itself.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any cause for concern in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that, in view of its significance in the context of the search for peace in our country, I arranged for copies of the Joint Declaration to be sent to all primary and post-primary schools to ensure that teachers and pupils are made fully aware of its terms and objectives.</P>

      <Quest>if she has received representations from Fahy national school, Newport, County Mayo, in respect of the development of the playground adjoining the school; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that this playground is currently unsafe for the numbers of children using it and that the proper development of this playground would involve the levelling and draining of the field and also an improvement in the fencing of the area in view of the fact that it adjoins the Newport/Fahy road and can be quite dangerous; if she will consider the provision of funds which might be of assistance to the board of management and parents association in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied for a concessionary teaching post under the disadvantaged areas scheme and that the school has expressed concern at the possible loss of a teaching post due to falling enrolments.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> As I recently announced in the context of the 1994 education budget, I intend that a further 50 primary schools will be designated as disadvantaged for capitation grant purpose in the current year. I am also allocating an additional 150 teaching posts in the current year to improve staffing levels in the primary sector.</P>
    <P>Schools will be selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators. Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned. Account is also taken of the views of the Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between applicant schools.</P>
    <P>The position of the school in question will be considered in the context of the proposed extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to concerns at a possible loss of teaching staff due to falling enrolments, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that following recently introduced improvements in the 1994-95 staffing schedule, the school in question will be retaining its full staffing complement.</P>
