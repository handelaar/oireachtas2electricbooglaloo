      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 30 from Deputies John Bruton and Pat Rabbitte.  I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I call first Deputy John Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek, under Standing Order 30, a debate on the changes that will now have to made to the Government's medium term plans as approved by the Dáil last year for taxation and for spending on non-EU aided services to make up the £1 billion shortfall in EU funding under the Community Support Framework, in light of the Government's stated intention of continuing with all projects regardless of the £1 billion EU funding shortfall.  The Government has been persistently economic and tardy with the truth in this matter and it is time we had the full truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may only convey to the House the message he conveyed to me.  He has slightly elaborated thereon.  I now call on Deputy <Col N="1702" /> Rabbitte to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I wish to advise you that at the commencement of public business today I intend to request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest, namely: the confirmation that the European Union funding for the National Development Plan will be £1 billion less than promised by the Government and that there will be substantial cutbacks in projects listed in the plan and the consequences for economic and social development in the country especially in regard to unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matters fully I do not consider them to be contemplated by Standing Order 30 and, therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motions.  These issues are unlikely to develop significantly before the Dáil will, in practice, have an opportunity of discussing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, Sir, have you received information which the rest of the House has not as to the actual date of publication of this document formally and its debate here and also as to the date of the adjournment of the Dáil? Without that information it is impossible to come to that conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>You have made a different point.  You said that the House will, in the normal way, come to debate this matter before it develops further.  What is the basis for that assumption?</P>

      <P>On the same point, if it is the case that this document is available to journalists surely it is absurd that it is not available to Members of this House.

      <P>The four agreements we are considering today are similar in content to the Europe Agreements with Poland and Hungary which were approved by the Dáil on 30 October 1992 and came into effect on 1 February this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1989 revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe created the opportunity and the challenge for these countries to establish viable democracies and market economies which would be open to international trade and investment.  After decades of enforced isolation this part of the continent looked to the European Community as an anchor of stability and a source of inspiration for the necessary political and economic changes that had to be put in place.  The Community responded rapidly to support the political <Col N="1719" /> and economic reforms which were instituted in the countries of the region.</P>
    <P>It did this initially by providing emergency assistance, where necessary, and more importantly by providing through the Phare programme, the experience and expertise necessary for economic reconstruction.  The Commission also played an important role in co-ordinating aid from the industralised countries through the G-24, notably in the form of macro-economic assistance.  Assistance was also provided through the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in which the EU collectively is the largest shareholder.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Community sought to foster the sense of belonging to the wider Eurpean family of democratic peoples by creating new political and economic ties.</P>
    <P>At the European Council in Dublin in April 1990 a decision was taken to negotiate wide-ranging association agreements with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe on the understanding that basic conditions with regard to democratic principles and transition towards a market economy were fulfilled. These agreements, which subsequently became known as Europe Agreements, have now been concluded with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Romania and Bulgaria.</P>
    <P>Other Europe Agreements are in prospect &mdash; for example, a mandate for negotiations with Slovenia is currently under discussion in the Council.</P>
    <P>The Europe Agreements negotiated with six Central and East European countries aim at establishing close and lasting relations between the parties and at supporting the completion of the process towards market economies in the associated countries.  They reflect their wish for ever closer ties with the European Union and acknowledge their desire for eventual membership.  The agreements provide for phased movement towards free trade in goods and services, continuing economic assistance and regular political dialogue in an institutionalised <Col N="1720" /> framework.  They are concluded for an unlimited period of time with a maximum transition period of ten years.  Their full implementation is linked to the actual accomplishment of political, economic and legal reforms.</P>
    <P>The Europe Agreements provide for the establishment of a free trade area over a maximum period of ten years. However, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have longer periods in which to phase out trade barriers &mdash; up to nine years &mdash; than the EU &mdash; up to five years.  Special arrangements have been made for sensitive products.  For textiles, coal and steel trade barriers are eliminated according to special schedules. For agricultural and processed agricultural products the parties have agreed to grant each other mutual concessions on a reciprocal basis.  Although the Europe Agreements with Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech and Slovak Republics are not yet in force, the trade provisions of these agreements entered into force almost immediately on signature, by means of interim agreements.</P>
    <P>In a short time the EU has become the main trading partner of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  From 1989 to 1992 exports to the Community from this region grew by 83 per cent while imports from the Community went up by 120 per cent over the same period.  With the entry into force of the trade provisions of the Europe Agreements this massive expansion of exports towards the EU market has continued.  I hope that in due course improved market opportunities will emerge among the Central and East Europeans themselves.</P>
    <P>However, despite the trade concessions offered by the EU so far, EU exports to Central and Eastern Europe have increased by more than EU imports from the region to the extent that the EU had a 3.8 billion ECU trade surplus in the first eight months of 1993.  This situation is also reflected in our own trade with these countries which though still small in absolute terms, has shown significant growth in exports to each of the associated countries, particularly to <Col N="1721" /> Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.</P>
    <P>In recognition of this imbalance and in an effort to respond to the criticism of the provisions of the Europe Agreements in the sensitive sectors, the EU agreed at the European Council in Copenhagen to accelerate the liberalisation timetable for industrial products including the sensitive textile and steel sectors.  Additional Protocols to the Interim Agreements formally giving effect to these trade concessions, were concluded on 20 December 1993.  However, they had been operating on an informal basis since the previous July.</P>
    <P>Because of the sensitive nature of agriculture, a more restrictive regime was applied than for trade in industrial products. Ireland, in common with a number of other EU member states, had some concerns during the negotiations regarding the concessions to be included for this sector.  Our concerns related in particular to beef, sheepmeat and live cattle.  As a result, concessions for these products are limited and subject to safeguard clauses which allow trade protection measures in the event of serious injury to EU producers or serious disturbances in any sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>In the event, these countries experienced a severe fall in agricultural output in the past few years, due partly to drought, but also to difficulties encountered in the transition from the old system to the new and the loss of traditional markets.  It is generally recognised however, that these countries have significant long-term agricultural potential. As far as Ireland is concerned, utilisation of this potential cannot be at the expense of the CAP, not least in the light of recent concessions made by Europe's agriculture in the Uruguay Round.</P>
    <P>The Europe Agreements also cover the conditions attached to the movement of workers from the associated countries within the Union.  The agreements provide for non-discrimination for workers legally employed and for the co-ordination of social security systems.</P>
    <P>As a result of this, extra costs could arise to the Exchequer through the provision <Col N="1722" /> of old age, invalidity and death benefits and for medical care purposes. It is considered however, that such costs will be negligible.</P>
    <P>The approximation of the laws in the associated countries to those applicable in the Union, is recognised as a major pre-condition for their economic integration into the EU.  To that end they have undertaken to ensure compatibility of their future laws with EU law and the EU will provide technical assistance for this purpose.  This was one of the issues highlighted by the Copenhagen European Council which recommended that a task force should be established to co-ordinate training in Community law and practice.  Laws relating to distortion of competition and the protection of workers, the environment and consumers are to be given priority.</P>
    <P>Economic co-operation accounts for a substantial part of the agreements and covers a wide range of sectors including industrial standards, investment promotion, education, training, agriculture, energy and nuclear safety, financial services tourism and public administration.</P>
    <P>In the area of financial co-operation the agreements provide for the continuation of the Phare project aid programme, for the possibility of EIB loans and the possibility in defined circumstances of balance of payments type assistance.  In accordance with the decisions taken at Copenhagen and to respond to the changing needs of the association countries, Phare has been adapted to enable part of the funding to be devoted to infrastructure development and other investment needs.  The technical assistance element has been correspondingly reduced, although it remains crucial in certain countries and sectors.  Irish consultancies, which are particularly well attuned to circumstances in Central and Eastern Europe, should continue to play a signficant role.  Association Councils at ministerial level are to oversee the implementation of these agreements. Parliamentary co-operation is also envisaged through a committee composed of members of the European Parliament <Col N="1723" /> and the Parliaments of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.</P>
    <P>The agreements with the Czech and Slovak Republics and with Romania and Bulgaria also contain a human rights clause in line with the Council's decision of May 1992 that it would henceforth include human rights linked suspension clauses in all future agreements with third countries.</P>
    <P>An important dimension of the Europe Agreements is that they provide a framework for political dialogue between the two sides.  This is intended to support reforms and to bring about increasing covergence of positions on international issues among others through meetings at the highest level, meetings between officials and the use of existing diplomatic channels.  The enhancement of the security and stability of Europe is defined as a major objective of political dialogue.</P>
    <P>A further step to meet the desire of these countries for a closer political relationship with the Union was taken at the General Affairs Council in March when Ministers agreed a package of measures to reinforce political dialogue. This gives effect to the Copenhagen European Council conclusions which proposed a structured relationship with the institutions of the Union.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe that the transition to new forms of government and the introduction of market-based economic reforms have been accomplished in conditions which on the whole have been relatively untroubled.  The Czechs and Slovaks have demonstrated that the emergence of new states can be achieved peaceably.  Minorities questions are being addressed in the context of a special Conference on Stability launched in Paris at the end of May.</P>
    <P>The associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe have indicated clearly that their ultimate objective is full membership of the European Union.  The Europe Agreements acknowledge this aspiration.  The Heads of State and Government meeting at the Copenhagen <Col N="1724" /> European Council last year formally endorsed this goal when they agreed that these countries could become members of the Union when they are able to fulfil the conditions required.  The Union's capacity to absorb new members while maintaining the momentum of integration is also an important consideration.</P>
    <P>In April, two of these countries, Hungary and Poland, applied for membership of the European Union.  Their applications have been referred in the normal way to the Commission and we look forward to receiving the Commission's opinions in due course.  In the meantime, and possibly until after the 1996 inter-governmental conference, the satisfactory functioning and full implementation of the Europe Agreements is the cornerstone of EU relations with the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>I am confident that all Members of this House will agree that it is in all our interests to do everything we can to contribute to the building of a stable, prosperous and peaceful Europe.  Indeed the success of the European Union will to a large extent depend on the degree to which it can be a positive factor for our fellow Europeans throughout the Continent who face challenges of historic proportions. The Europe Agreements make an important contribution in this regard. They provide an appropriate framework for partnership, an accelerated opening of markets and a programme of practical assistance.  In short, they will facilitate the all important interaction between the European Union and the countries concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I would like to be associated with the ratification of the association agreements with these four countries.  The debate highlights once again the speed with which changes came about in Central and Eastern Europe.  I do not think anybody who has been in the Dáil for eight or ten years could have imagined that we would be ratifying close association agreements with countries such as Romania and Bulgaria which were involved in the horror <Col N="1725" /> stories behind the Iron Curtain.  The fact that we are ratifying these agreements is very heartening.</P>
      <P>The association agreements that were ratified in October 1992 with Hungary and Poland were a clear indication, and almost the trigger mechanism, that those two countries would become members of the EU.  At that time agreement was also made with Czechoslovakia, which was then one country, but we did not ratify that agreement because Czechoslovakia was in the throes of negotiations about forming two separate states, which came about in January 1993.  The agreement was a signal to Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic and Slovakia, that they were starting on the path to membership of the EU.  Enlargement of the EU is a matter which will be debated further in this House and when the Tánaiste brings forward the White Paper I am sure we will have a chance to consider the implications of enlargement for Ireland and other EU members.</P>
      <P>It is important that when entering agreements we should not do so begrudgingly but open-handedly, without giving the countries concerned a second class role in their association with Europe. Special facilities have been made regarding agricultural products.  When one considers the dependency of these four countries on agricultural production, it is important that sooner rather than later we look again at the arrangements on policies to protect agricultural products in the EU.  I recognise that many current EU members depend on agricultural products, but it is important that we do not create a second tier in Europe.  We should be sufficiently competitive to welcome products from those countries that are joining with us.</P>
      <P>All of us agree with the strong principles of democracy.  Having experienced what for some people has been a very bruising democratic election, we were all warmed by the elections in many of these countries.  They were very troubled elections and it was very difficult for the people to accept the changes, welcome as they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the elements of <Col N="1726" /> the association agreements that allow for political dialogue, which is crucial.  This was introduced in the agreements with Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia in 1991 and 1992.  These are new democracies and at times democracy can be very troublesome.  Sometimes it is easier to have a dictator to make the rules. Democracy means dialogue and accepting the other person's point of view.  It means accepting half a loaf when you are looking for a whole loaf.  The elements of political dialogue in the agreements are very welcome.</P>
    <P>Agreements are set up to create lasting arrangements and closer ties between parties.  I welcome the fact that the Tánaiste highlighted some of the areas of agreement.  There are a number of Irish companies and enterpreneurs who, as a result of closer unions with these countries, are gaining business opportunities. These opportunities will not only benefit us but hopefully the transfer of technology, expertise and information will allow the countries concerned to grow and develop.</P>
    <P>It is important that we remind ourselves of the criteria that have been set down for future members of the EU. These countries have a long way to go before they reach many of these criteria. The criteria require that an applicant must be fully functioning democracy with a clear respect for human rights &mdash; I again welcome the human rights element in these association agreements.  The applicant must accept the overall view of the European Union as well as the constraints imposed by its gradual creation. It must also accept the <i>acquit communitaire</i> that is the entire corpus of Community law and policy which has been put in place, before they become members.  They cannot dine <i>á la carte</i> at the European Union table when they become members; they must be ready to adopt existing legislation, to fit into the Community system or to have the clear potential to do so within the terms of an agreed programme of adaptation and development.  They must also be able to contribute positively to the maintenance <Col N="1727" /> and advancement of the European identity.</P>
    <P>There is a lead-in time for many of these countries to fulfil criteria for membership. When we consider the profiles of the countries concerned we recognise how far some of them have to go before becoming part of the European Union club.  For example, in Romania most of us are aware of the horrific aftermath of the exposure of the Ceaucescu regime, having seen horrific pictures of the way the people, particularly children, suffered, a number of Irish people were moved to adopt Romanian children.  That was the public manifestation of that horrific regime.</P>
    <P>It is known now that statistics and production figures were totally falsified during the Ceaucescu regime.  When Romania began to move towards democracy it had to start from scratch because of the misappropriation from the national treasury.  The rulers of that country had accumulated vast investments and had substantial assets in foreign banks.  The country had literally nothing and found that its hands and feet were tied.</P>
    <P>We know also that Romania and Bulgaria suffered as a result of sanctions placed on countries such as Serbia and Montenegro.  It is estimated that the sanctions cost Romania approximately $200 million.  Although the target of the sanctions was Serbia and other such countries, the neighbouring countries which traded with them also suffered drastically. Although we recognised that this would be a downside of the sanctions it was still necessary to impose them.</P>
    <P>In Romania 29 per cent of the civilian labour force is involved in agriculture. The products produced in countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are very similar to those produced in Ireland although Romania and Bulgaria are very large grape producers and are trying to build up a wine industry.  In that regard they will be in competition with Germany, Italy and Spain and will have difficulty exporting their products to the European <Col N="1728" /> Union.  In mid-1992 Romania experienced severe drought and agricultural output declined by an estimated 10.3 per cent.  This illustrates the difficulties they have had to face.  The severe economic problems that these countries experienced should not be ignored.</P>
    <P>The break-up of Czechoslovakia has resulted in two states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  The Czech Republic is wealthier and has gained the advantage in the break-up, it has an unemployment rate of 2.5 per cent whereas the rate of unemployment in Slovakia is 12 per cent.  The unemployment level of 11 and 12 per cent is causing great fear. What struck me was their concern about the dangers of unemployment, when I compared their level of unemployment with ours it made me focus on the dangers of our high level of unemployment and the fact that we too could face the kinds of problems &mdash; which in some instances we are &mdash; that these countries face.  The government of the Czech Republic decided that it would cut out the development of military equipment but as most of the military equipment was manufactured in Slovakia 40,000 jobs were lost there.  I am not advocating a rebirth of the military armaments industry but the decision of the Czech Republic, resulting in the overnight collapse of the industry with the loss of 40,000 jobs, devastated their economy.</P>
    <P>Agricultural output is increasing in the Czech Republic.  So too is industrial output and in the early 1990s Czechoslovakia expanded its trade considerably with the European countries, by 1992 EU countries accounted for about 50 per cent of total Czech exports.  Clearly the Czech Republic has a better chance of fast tracking into the EU.  The other three countries have a bit further to go to reach the entry level standard.</P>
    <P>In the late 1980s and early 1990s the Bulgarian economy declined sharply. Output in most sectors was considerably down and there was a sharp rise in the rates of unemployment &mdash; although its rate of unemployment is still below ours. Most of Bulgaria's trading partners were former USSR countries but their capacity <Col N="1729" /> to import goods from Bulgaria has declined.  It is essential that under these agreements European countries provide markets for their export products. However, it must be remembered that they export the type of products we export to the EU and, therefore, the element of protectionism will continue for EU countries so that the market will not be flooded by products from Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Our welcome of these agreements must not be marred by grudging acceptance but marked by a true sense of partnership so that these countries will recognise that we want to increase our trade with them and give them an opportunity to export to EU countries.  We want to see their democracy strengthened and to assist them.  The way to do that is in the area of education by establishing exchange programmes for civil and public servants and local authority staff to assist them in allowing democracy to flourish. I hope that before too long we will have a debate in this House on allowing some of these countries to take the next step to membership of the European Union as countries such as Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria have done.</P>
    <P>I welcome these association agreements and I hope that the speed with which these countries have moved to democracy will be mirrored by the speed with which they move to greater partnership with Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said about these European agreements with four of the former COMECON countries.  I share Deputy Owen's enthusiasm but on an occasion such as this one has to be realistic and somewhat sceptical of the more high-minded idealism of incorporating the former Warsaw Pact countries in the European Union.  It seems that a fundamental decision has to be made, and this Chamber has never discussed it, about whether the European Union can transform itself politically into a democratic union of citizens and countries which will have a real democratic soul.  On the one hand we have the federalist <Col N="1730" /> thesis that we are often told about or whether a different model of the European Union is emerging by degrees, a loose confederalist approach to Europe. In that context the question of expansion beyond where the former Iron Curtain stood is of crucial significance.  It has not been sufficiently thought about, in Irish political circles at any rate.  It is not being discussed in depth whether Eastern Europe &mdash; or large portions of it &mdash; are to be incorporated into the European Union over the next ten to 20 years and the implications of it for the nature of the union itself and for its capacity to deepen in terms of its democratic and cohesive elements.</P>
      <P>I do not want to place myself among the Euro sceptics but I am sceptical that Bulgaria and Romania and Ireland who are at opposite ends of the potential area of an enlarged Europe are ready to be put together in a new democratic collection of states in Europe.  I do not believe there is the cultural dynamic yet in Europe to sustain such a movement and to retain cohesion.  It is not that I am some kind of &ldquo;Slavophobe&rdquo;, if such a thing exists, but I do not believe there is a sufficient dynamic to unite the entire area in one cohesive political and economic entity.  If we are talking about, for instance, a common currency in the next five or ten years &mdash; that proposition sometimes seems to falter &mdash; are we talking about a Central Bank with responsibility from the Black Sea to Rockall, or is it seriously contended that the economies of Eastern Europe are in any position, even with the most optimistic outlook for their development, to join in a group economy which would have its pace set by the German and the more successful western European economies?  I wonder if that is the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These agreements are welcome, and it is right that Europe should be engaging with the former Warsaw Pact countries with a view to deepening trading relations with them, but I am sceptical of the proposition that we are anywhere near a threshold of convergence, economically or politically, with these states.  I do not believe that history will permit them. <Col N="1731" /> Deputy Owen was correct in saying that seven years ago Members of this House would never have anticipated what we have seen thus far but there is a certain dynamic to history.  The recent election of the former Communists to office in a number of these countries shows that within those countries the transformation process is bound to be difficult and that a glib acceptance that one can suddenly switch on political liberalism in a centralised economy was never a viable proposition.</P>
    <P>I advance the thesis that we must consider, as a member state of the European Union, where our priorities lie.  Do they lie in expansion into the COMECON region or in a strengthening of the European Union?  There is a conflict in that it may be that those two conflicting interests of this country and of the EU will have to be reconciled but they can only be reconciled by a conscious debate and not by an unconscious process such as appears to be unfolding before us at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that these agreements are tabled for debate in this House in circumstances such as this with virtually no notice.  That underlines another point I raised on several occasions and which I wish to reiterate today &mdash; it is a point that bears repetition until something is done about it.  This House is not taking its connection with the European Union seriously.  We have a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am happy to be a member because it is a successful committee in many of its enterprises, but it was given the function of superintending EU secondary legislation as it is applied here against the wishes of most of the Members on this side of the House and against my voluble protests at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it had nothing to do with foreign affairs whether EU insurance regulations are translated one way or another into Irish domestic law. Somebody somewhere thought it was <Col N="1732" /> convenient to merge these two functions and the result is that not one EU directive, regulation or Irish statutory instrument under the European Communities Act has been considered by this House in the lifetime of this Dáil or by any committee of it.  That is to our shame.</P>
      <P>That would be sufficiently sad if it was the entirety of the story but it is worse than that.  Unlike the Danes whose parliament takes Europe seriously and consider in advance what the agenda is in Europe, who look at draft regulations and directives and examine the agendas for Council of Ministers meetings in order to engage their political process on a rational basis with the European agenda, this House does nothing of the sort.  There is no consideration in advance, on a democratic basis, of the substance of European legislation.  There is no mechanism in this House for considering draft EU regulations or directives which are of crucial significance to this country.  All of that is delegated to the public service and to the Executive branch of the State, the Government.  If there is a draft directive on, for instance, conditions of employment or another part of the Social Chapter, there is no pre-emptive method for any elected representative in Ireland to have a say in relation to it.  That is a huge problem and today's debate is only one instance of the usual pattern of this House's engagement in the affairs of the European Union in that we are considering something that has been done in circumstances where nothing can be done about it &mdash; we are locking the stable door without even inquiring whether the horse is inside or out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come for those on this side of the House to rattle the bars of their respective cages and to protest that there should be more engagement with the affairs of the European Union at a time when it makes sense to do so.  There is no point in our discussing this motion today.  There might have been some point if the agriculture content of these agreements, which are obviously of some significant to Ireland, had been discussed in advance.  There might have been some <Col N="1733" /> point to be made about the political rights clause, which I welcome, or about any aspect of this if it had been considered in advance by this House.  A discussion of this kind is futile and redundant and there is little point in codding ourselves that it serves a useful purpose, other than to allow Opposition Members make points which are slightly off-point in relation to these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a lenient Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The real issue is whether we are serious in our analysis and consideration of the development of the European Union or whether this House intends to play any part in the development or the expansion, if necessary, of the EU.  I know the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has bespoken a report by Dr. Brigid Laffan on expansion of the European Union and its implications. That is useful work and it could be of some assistance to this House but this type of exercise has very little weight.</P>
      <P>In the past few days there has been considerabe craw-thumping by the media about how the politicians had not made Europe relevant to the Irish people.  To some extent that was slightly annoying because personality issues seemed to attract the media far more than anyone who tried to make serious points about substantial matters of European interest or policy.  In one area at least the political establishment, as represented in this House, has turned its back on Europe. The democratic deficit does not just exist in other parts of Europe but in Ireland also as regards European affairs.  We have abdicated the role which the Danes, as a small democracy and member of the European Union, take seriously.  We do not give serious consideration to what is happening in Europe on an ongoing basis or have a democratic scrutiny of the trends, developments and proposals for change in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the sad plight of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and its utter failure to carry out the minimal function given to it regarding European legislation.  This shows there is <Col N="1734" /> a democratic deficit and Members of the House are primarily responsible for that. It may suit the Executive to spend less time debating these matters and to have less controversy surrounding European laws, regulations and directives, but it does not suit the people or Irish democracy. In the last analysis the people do not understand the issues.  Is it any wonder they show a remarkable indifference to whether they participate in any aspect of European Union affairs when the House shown similar indifference?  Is it any wonder they feel there is nothing that can be done about most of the things that happen in Europe if the House takes the same attitude?  It does not want to know about draft directives or regulations; it does not want to be consulted and does not have any opinion to offer. It prefers to abdicate that to members of the Government who arrive home with the result ready for ratification in debates of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The many important points raised by Deputy McDowell regading the democratic deficit from this end of the spectrum need to be debated at length in the House.  We cannot do that today as we are allowed ten minutes to contribute on the issue before the House.  However, if the Government finally agrees to a debate on the National Development Plan it may be possible to address some of the fundamental issues which need to be addressed regarding our membership of the EU.</P>
      <P>The flurry of apathy surrounding the recent European elections is in marked and ironic contrast to the enthusiasm with which the European Union is viewed by those European states currently outside it.  This enthusiasm displayed so resoundingly by the Austrians over the weekend, is based more on shadow than on substance &mdash; the shadow of presumed prosperity and stability versus the substance of 17 million unemployed and 52 million living below the poverty line in the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union, the Union of Maastricht, is currently in crisis.  Last week European voters registered their protest by staying home.  They voted with <Col N="1735" /> the feet but there is no sign as yet that the leaders of Europe heard the message.</P>
    <P>When viewed together with the EU's recent enlargement, the association agreements concluded with the Czech and Slovak Republics, Bulgaria and Romania point the way to a new construction. It is now up to the EU's member states and those who aspire to membership to determine the shape of that construction.</P>
    <P>The association agreements, the Europe Agreements, provide a broad framework for relations between the EU and the Associates in the political and economic arenas.  Handled properly, these agreements could form the basis of a common European home stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals.  Alternatively, they could lay the foundations for an exclusive club in which the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; will be increasingly squeezed by the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; to the detriment of all.</P>
    <P>What is clear is that the Association Agreements are a stepping stone on the way to a further enlargement of the European Union.  The Visegrad countries in particular have made it clear that membership of the European Union forms their most urgent foreign policy objective.</P>
    <P>The face of Europe changed irrevocably in 1989.  While the fledgling democracies of Central and Eastern Europe share common domestic challenges in establishing new political and economic orders, they must also ensure regional security while protecting ethnic and minority rights.  One of the questions which now has to be addressed is whether these aims can best be achieved within the context of the European Union or whether we should encourage the development of regional organisations based on the <i>ad hoc</i> interest groups which have already emerged since 1989.</P>
    <P>While it is obviously in all our interests that the European Union should play a pivotal role in the development of the wider European region, I question the EU's suitability as Europe's sole anchor. Although membership of the EU is seen by many in Central and Eastern Europe <Col N="1736" /> as a form of insurance policy guaranteeing against the reversal of reforms already undertaken, that insurance policy rests on shaky foundations.</P>
    <P>From an Irish point of view, the further enlargement of the Europan Union poses both dangers and opportunities.  The various existing coalitions within the Union will be fundamentally altered by the accession of the EFTA states and would be further altered by the accession of applicants such as Bulgaria, Romania and the Czech and Slovak Republics.  It is already clear that regional cores will form around Germany on specific economic and trade issues paralleled by a Northern and Eastern and Southern grouping on budgetary matters.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, Ireland will inevitably be forced to reconsider its strategic alliances.  In particular, we will have to balance our ties with the UK, which continues to maintain an ambivalent position on Europe, with our other European interests.  Enlargement challenges us all to rethink our role in the EU and to make the transition from mendicant to full participant.  Given the dismal record of this Government it will not be an easy transition.</P>
    <P>Last year's GATT negotiations demonstrated a frightening failure to look beyond the narrow demands of vocal vested interests.  While clinging blindly to France's farming coat tails in an effort to appease the IFA, we failed to join the Italians in their bid to protect textiles; nor did we look to the potential of new industries and technologies &mdash; developments which will be vital in the European Union of the coming decades.</P>
    <P>As we face into a post-enlargement era of new coalition building there are few signs that this Government has learnt anything from the GATT experience. Ireland's European policy remains firmly located in the begging bowl.  We are, as ever, one step behind events.  The days of our being a net beneficiary of the EU are numbered.  In future, we will have to share the post-enlargement cake with our Central and Eastern European neighbours.</P>
    <P>Just what will enlargement mean for <Col N="1737" /> Ireland in hard figures?  While the accession of the EFTA countries will mean a small net contribution to the Union budget, it has been estimated that the eventual accession of Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and the Czech and Slovak Republics will mean a net outflow in Structural Funds and CAP of over 12 billion ECUs.  At the same time, we will have to meet the challenge of increased competition not only in the agricultural sector but also in the vulnerable textiles and footwear industries. There are as yet no signs that this Government is prepared to meet these challenges, or to look beyond the end of the current round of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Membership of the Union means more than streams of ECUs and narrow self-interest. Membership of the EU means signing up for a basket of economic criteria which could prove an unsustainable burden on the fragile economies of Central and Eastern Europe.  Indeed, the very stringent IMF criteria imposed on Bulgaria and Romania in the context of the standby arrangements and the systemic transformation facilities are already being felt by the citizens of those countries.</P>
    <P>Of the four new associates, three are economically vulnerable.  The inequities within the European Union to which I adverted are mirrored by the inequities amongst the aspirant members.  These inequities, unless tackled, could prove a source of long-term political, social and economic instability.</P>
    <P>The economic prospects of Slovakia have already been damaged by the Czechoslovak breakup, while Bulgaria has found itself an unwitting victim of the economic sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro.  Romania has still not recovered from the economic depradations of the Ceaucescu regime and there are few signs that the EU aid package will turn the situation around in the short term.</P>
    <P>While our neighbours struggle to find their feet in a new economic and political order, the European Union is currently in a phase of considerable flux.  European political union and European Monetary <Col N="1738" /> Union have effectively been put on the back burner while the concept of a social Europe espoused so energetically by Jacques Delors and the European Commission is under constant threat from the Council.  The White Paper on Employment, Competitiveness and Growth, which could have provided a blue print not just for the European Union member states but also for the aspirant members in Central and Eastern Europe, has been watered down to the point where it is unrecognisable.</P>
    <P>The sweatshop economics of the Right are gaining increasing sway as was demonstrated at the recent OECD meeting.  Terms such as &ldquo;labour market flexibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;reform of social protection&rdquo; are increasingly being bandied about as code words for the right wing Darwinian policies which, as the British Institute of Fiscal Studies pointed out only last week, have already wreaked havoc in Britain.  The fact that those policies have wreaked havoc in Ireland is not yet recognised to the extent that it should be.  Some time ago we pointed out the growing gap between the rich and the poor in this country, a fact which was confirmed by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors in a report which stated that the kind of economics being pursued in Ireland in tandem with other EU countries was creating a growing gap between rich and poor and that the levels of increased income of those who are worse off in Irish society is way behind those who are better off.</P>
    <P>There is a grave danger that the European Union may degenerate into little more than a free trade zone.  Against that background the conclusions of association agreements with certain states in Eastern and Central Europe could leave other states literally out in the cold, adding fuel to what is already a volatile situation.  Last week EU citizens gave their verdict on these developments, a verdict expressed in disinterest and protest, and one which the aspirant members may endorse in the years to come.  This House needs to debate and consider that position as it will have wide ranging implications <Col N="1739" /> for the health and prosperity of this country.  I urge the Minister of State, who is currently holding fort for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, to ensure that time is provided in the foreseeable future for an adequate and wide ranging debate on all aspects of the European Union.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last day we dealt with questions to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs I made the point that it was about time a number of major debates took place on the evolving situation in Central and Eastern Europe and, in particular, on the application for membership from a number of countries such as Poland and Hungary.  As we have seen today, there are associated membership applications from four countries, Czechoslovakia, <Col N="1740" /> Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. Acceptance of these applications will have enormous consequences for Ireland.  I may not agree with all the points made by Deputy De Rossa but many of the statistics and background information he gave are accurate. However, I disagree with the slant of his remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>If those countries I have mentioned join the European Union within the next five to ten years, Ireland will suffer a massive reduction in its income from the EU.  Deputy De Rossa seems to believe that might not be a bad thing if it would only affect large farmers. It would also gravely affect our economy; every man, woman and child would be affected regardless of whether they are farmers, unemployed or social welfare beneficiaries.  Where will we find the money to replace that massive reduction in income?  As of now we do not have the capability to find it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point and will not argue it.  All of us want to suss out the situation and I am merely pointing out the seriousness of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three weeks ago a parliamentary delegation from Poland visited this country. Poland, an applicant for membership of the European Union, has 2.2 million small underdeveloped farmers, while there are approximately the same number of farmers in Romania.  The number of farmers in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Slovakia is almost the same <Col N="1741" /> as the number of farmers in the EU at present, approximately six million.  All these farmers need massive financial handouts if they are to be brought up to the same level of efficiency as farmers in member states of the union.  That money can only be provided in one way, that is, taken from countries like Ireland which are receiving it at present.  As Deputy De Rossa rightly said, instead of being net beneficiaries we will become contributors to EU funds.  Has anyone given serious consideration to this point?  This is why I say we need a series of major debates on this matter in this House.</P>
    <P>People in these other countries are grossly underprivileged and we have an obligation to improve their standard of living.  This will severely affect us and we had better be prepared to face up to that situation instead of crying when the decisions have been made.  There is a huge conflict between what is good for us and what is necessary for these people who are living in dreadful conditions.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed on the last occasion we mentioned this matter that we should have such a debate.  The sooner that takes place the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to the human rights situation in some of the countries I have mentioned.  The human rights situation in Romania and Bulgaria is not too clear.  We do not know whether it is satisfactory.  For example, it is not clear who controls these countries or whether the security forces, the army, the police force and the secret police are autonomous, and they operate as they wish irrespective of what the politicians would like to see done.  I suspect that is still the case particularly in Romania and Bulgaria.  If we are to have associate membership with these countries we must be sure that human rights are being protected there and that the change in Romania is not just a change in leadership or in name but a change in the system.  We are not sure if this has been the case.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Council of Europe I have visited Romania twice in the past 15 months.  I have also visited Hungary <Col N="1742" /> as a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and recently visited Poland as a member of the Council of Europe.  It is absolutely frightening to see the poverty in those countries.  What the people need is a massive injection of capital from the West.  While what is contained in the Tánaiste's report is all very well, we are merely fiddling around with the problem. Each of them needs tens of billions of pounds to build up a structure which could compete within the European Union.  Who is going to give it to them? How will it be done?  It will have to be done because the probable alternative is that there will build up a massive resentment within those countries towards the West and who knows how that would end up.  I do not want to engage in scare-mongering but it could lead to a third world war.  When there is deprivation on that scale, accompanied by access to Western television, when those people see Western standards, tourists and visitors and observe the difference, inevitably that will lead to enormous ill feeling which can be very disturbing and cause major problems.</P>
    <P>I should like the Tánaiste to examine particularly the human rights position in those countries, for instance, the rights of minorities in Romania and whether they are getting a fair shake-out.  They maintain they are not.  For example, there is a Hungarian minority of 1.7 million people, located right in the centre of that country, who complain consistently they are not being properly treated, that their language and educational system is being dismantled.</P>
    <P>This is a huge question.  A limited debate in this House is not sufficient.  I would prefer a major debate or a series of major debates because the implications for this country are tremendous, as they are for those countries.  Undoubtedly we shall have to give a certain amount.  Let us work out our contribution in advance.  Let us not be rushed into any hasty decisions which would affect the standard of living here generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo; `the Irish thoroughbred horse' means <Col N="1744" /> a horse eligible for entry into Weatherby's Thoroughbred Stud Book;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I made the point very strongly that, in the definitions section of this Bill, there is need for a definition of the Irish thoroughbred horse.  I do not accept the Minister's prevarication on this, nor the excuses he gave for not accepting a definition.  Given that he told us yesterday it is likely to be 50 years before we are back in the House and that he is in a frame of mind to insert &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; provisions, in case there is ever a debate on what is an Irish thoroughbred horse when it comes to legislation, or in a court of law, it would render this Bill complete to have this definition included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh) Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The thoroughbred horse is an internationally recognised breed.  Thoroughbred horses bred in Ireland or in the United Kingdom are registered in a General Stud Book covering both countries.  This has been the case since 1791.  The General Stud Book is maintained by Wetherbys and the registration process for Irish breeders is carried out by the subsidiary, Wetherbys Ireland.</P>
      <P>The definition proposed but Deputy Doyle is incorrect in so far as the General Stud Book maintained by Wetherbys would include horses which are not Irish thoroughbreds but are bred in the United Kingdom.  I oppose the amendment on the basis that it is not necessary.  The phrase &ldquo;Irish thoroughbred horse&rdquo; is used once only in the Bill in a general way.  It is generally recognised what we are talking about.  There is no advantage to be gained in giving the term some precise definition in this Bill.  However, if the Authority sees the need to define the Irish thoroughbred at some stage in the future for the purposes of the promotion function given it in this Bill, of course it may do so.  Such a definition could be changed easily if circumstances such as stud book arrangements changed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 1 to 21 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;(1) The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order confer on the Authority, in relation to the development and promotion of horseracing, such additional functions connected with the functions for the time being of the Authority, or the services or the activities that the Authority is authorised for the time being to provide or carry on (including functions of the Minister in relation to any directive, regulation or other act adopted by an institution of the European Union in relation to horseracing) as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>(2)  No order made under subsection (1) shall have effect until it has been laid before and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1746" /> (3)  No order varying or revoking an order made under this section (including an order under this subsection) shall have effect until it has been laid before and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister may make such provision as he considers necessary or expedient in relation to matters ancillary to or arising out of the conferral on the Authority of functions under this section, or the performance of functions so conferred (including provision for the transfer to the Authority of any property held by the Minister for the purposes of functions conferred on the Authority under this section).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the section that confers additional functions on the Authority.  Had I been more alert yesterday I should have referred the Minister back to this section when he included his &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; provisions.  This section is the Minister's &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; section because its provisions allow the Authority additional functions.  This is a very generous amendment to allow the Authority extend its functions if deemed to be necessary at any point in the future in the best interests of the industry.  Surely the later provisions allowing the Authority set up as a bookmaker, either individually or with others, could be covered by the provisions of this section?  I feel very strongly about the later section where we allow the new racing Authority function with others, or as a subsidiary company, as a bookmaker, and to compete with the private sector bookmaking industry generally.  Do we need the later section allowing the Authority to function as a bookmaker when we have this generous section 10 conferring additional functions on the Authority?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept our amendment, in particular the point we made strongly on Committee Stage, that if and when additional functions are being conferred on this new racing Authority we need an affirmative motion, not just a regulation which can be annulled within 21 days.  We need to do it by way of an affirmative resolution, to have a discussion, <Col N="1747" /> reach agreement and have a democratic input into any additional functions given this new Authority.  We have experienced major problems with legislation in recent years &mdash; I know it arises because of our being a member of the European Union &mdash; in that more and more legislation is being enacted by way of directive or regulation without any democratic input by these Houses.  We do not want to compound the difficulty in this area, or the democratic deficit, by including the procedure when it is not necessary.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept our amendment which seeks a stronger democrative input into any change of the functions of this proposed Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Doyle proposes to substantially amend section 11 which deals with the power of the Minister to confer additional functions on the Authority by order.  In the present draft this order would be subject to the provisions of section 7.  That means that the order would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and either House would have power to annual that order within the next 21 days on which they sit.  The amendment proposes to amend section 11 so that an order under this section would not have effect until approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That would defeat the purpose of the section since it has been included to cater for urgent circumstances that might arise when it would be appropriate that additional functions be conferred on the Authority at relatively short notice.  The safeguards are that those functions must be connected with the functions for the time being of the Authority, or the services or activities that the Authority is already authorised to provide.  The consent of the Minister for Finance is also a requirement. If the order is required to be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas this could delay providing for some technicality that would allow the Authority to react quickly to some new circumstances which might arise.  The Dáil might not be sitting when the problem <Col N="1748" /> arises.  There are sufficient safeguards in the Bill, as drafted, and on that basis I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, if the Dáil was not sitting and changes of the order suggested by the Minister had to be made, how could an annulling resolution be tabled by the Opposition? How would the procedure work?  The Minister may as well allow the Authority to do as it wishes because, effectively, during the long summer recess it can make whatever change it likes without any democratic input or debate in this House and no opportunity to annul the resolution, even under the existing minimum procedures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> It is interesting that this amendment is in order but I will grab the opportunity and say nothing about that.  Amendment No. 10 covers the same point in amendment No. 9 which was ruled out of order.  On Committee Stage there was a long debate on this point.  There is an excellent procedure in this legislation for setting up the race fixtures committee and, under section 20, there is a separate procedure for setting up the race programme committee. It defeats the intelligence of most people who are concerned about the industry to understand the necessity for two separate committees for two important functions that must be done separately but I contend that a race fixtures committee as proposed would also be well able to act as the race programme committee.  The functions of the race fixtures committee should include race programming. The race fixtures committee is at arm's length from the Authority and could include outside members, other than members of the Authority.  It will have an independent chairperson and have a great deal of independence of the main Authority.  It is felt in racing circles that the same terms of reference should apply to the race programme committee.</P>
    <P>Race programming, race fixtures and financing are the key to the future of Irish racecourses and the racing industry generally.  There must be impartiality, integrity and transparency in arranging programmes and major fixtures.  If the Minister cannot take it on board now I ask him to look again at the unnecessary duplication in terms of these two committes before the Bill goes to the Seanad. These are two important and separate functions, both of which could be done by the race fixtures committee which will be seen to be at arm's length from the Authority and have no vested interest in either a racecourse or a particular sponsored race at any race fixture.  The schedule removes much of the integrity and transparency from the new Authority due to the over-politicisation of the appointments. The race fixtures committee will consist of the chairman who will be both a member of the Authority and a steward of the racing regulatory body, one steward <Col N="1751" /> of the racing regulatory body, two representatives of authorised racecourses and three other representatives of the horseracing industry.  Given the structure of the race fixtures committee and the fact that it will be at arm's length from the Authority &mdash; the politicised racing Authority &mdash; I urge that race programming be part of the functions of the race fixtures committee.  That is critical to the future of many racecourses in the country.</P>
    <P>Having read out the structure of the race fixtures committee I wish to point out that I understood on Committee Stage that the Minister agreed to amend section 19 (2) (c) to read: &ldquo;two representatives nominated by the representatives of authorised racecourses&rdquo;, or words to that effect, in other words that the Minister was accepting the nomination of the racecourse representative association.  Will the Minister confirm that under paragraph (c), line 19, page 14 of the Bill, he is accepting the nominations of the racecourse association to fill those two places on the race fixtures committee?  That was my understanding on Committee Stage.  I do not see the change in the Bill, as amended on Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister between now and the Bill going to the Seanad to rationalise the committees to ensure that the race fixtures committee &mdash; the structure of which I thoroughly approve &mdash; also deals with race programming.  Let us call a spade a spade because there will be vested interests in the new racing Authority of 14 members, ten of whom are political appointments.  There will be vested interests in major companies, in major sponsorship and in the placing of major races at certain racecourses.  If it is not done at arm's length from the Authority there will again be a question of the integrity of the Authority.  I urge the Minister to please allow race programming to be done by the race fixtures committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 19 are being taken together.  These amendments propose transferring the <Col N="1752" /> race fixture and race programme committee back to the regulatory body.  It is also proposed that the regulatory body should authorise racecourses.  Amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 19 propose that the race-programmes should be set by the fixtures committee of the Authority.</P>
      <P>The Authority will have the principal role in regard to the development of Irish racing, particularly in regard to its current funding.  Fixtures are central to this and it is logical that the fixtures committee be appointed by the Authority. The establishment of the fixtures list is a sensitive issue and it is important that there is a careful balance in the composition of the committee charged with deciding the fixtures.  We have provided for this balance in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The programmes committee is also important and requires the participation of a number of people with specialist knowledge and expertise.  It is sensible that it be left to the Authority to call on such expertise as required without constraining its options in this regard through tight legislative provisions.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that the work of the Authority in this and many other areas covers the industry on the whole island, not just this State, and it is critical that its potential on the whole island is tapped to the full.  I will be formally asking the Authority to have special regard in all its activities to the development of the industry in Northern Ireland.  In particular, I will be asking it to include the need to provide for that development in the terms of reference of the fixtures committee and the remit of the programmes committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in amendment No. 19 to allocate the function of licensing jockeys and trainers to the regulatory body is not necessary as this is one of its functions under the Rules of Racing and is already covered by section 39 (b).  Deputies may wonder why I have gone to the trouble of specifying its function of licensing racecourses which is also provided for under the Rules of Racing.  I, as well as others in the industry, felt that some people may misinterpret the provisions in section 59 relating to the authorisation of racecourses <Col N="1753" /> by the Authority as dispensing with the regulatory body's function of licensing racecourses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is making important points and I would like to be in a position to respond but if I do I will be ruled out of order.  The Minister is dealing with section 59; I thought we were discussing sections 19 and 20.</P>

      <P>I am discussing amendment No. 10. I am making the point that the proposal in that amendment to allocate the function of licensing jockeys and trainers to the regulatory body is not necessary as this is one of its functions under the Rules of Racing and is already covered by section 39 (b).  Deputies may wonder why I have gone to the trouble of specifying its functions of licensing racecourses which is also provided for under the Rules of Racing.  I am giving an explanation because many people in the industry felt that some people may misinterpret the provisions in section 59 relating to the authorisation of racecourses by the Authority as dispensing with the regulatory body's function of licensing racecourses but this is not the case.  The licensing function of the regulatory body relates to the condition of the track, obstacles etc., for racing while the authorisation relates to all the facilities at the racecourse, including accommodation for bookmakers, betting offices and punters.  It is clearly a matter for the Authority to decide on authorisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Deputy asked if I would consider the possibility of amending section 19 to state that the two representatives of the authorised racecourses on the fixtures committee may be nominated by the authorised racecourses' representative body or should be the two representatives on the Authority. This may well turn out to be the case but it is a matter for the Authority.  As the <Col N="1754" /> Authority will establish the committee it would not be appropriate for the Minister to interfere.  The exact wording used in the Bill was agreed with the industry as the appropriate framework to enable the committee to be established.  It will be a matter for the Authority to decide how the legislation should be implemented when enacted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I retabled this amendment thinking I was on a promise from the Minister on Committee Stage but there is no evidence that he will deliver on it.  Although I may appear jocose a serious point is being made in the amendment.  Given the politicisation of the Authority and the avenue <Col N="1755" /> the Minister has chosen in structuring it, there is great concern in many of the component parts of the industry that vested interests might rule the day.  I ask the Minister to include in the Bill a section insisting on fair play and to accept the amendment which relates to applications to the new Authority for funds.</P>
    <P>There is a fear that there will be favoured sons or daughters when it comes to the distribution or allocation of funds. The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he was not prepared to accept the amendment because it was being implied that the Authority might not act in a fair manner in considering applications. I understood him to say, however, that he would consider including before Report Stage a general requirement to act in a fair and impartial manner.  Has the Minister considered this possibility?  Where is that amendment? Will he point to where that requirement will be included in the Bill?  Does he accept the principle, if not the amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In amendment No. 13 to section 25 which deals with the application of funds of the Authority Deputy Doyle proposes that the Authority should be required specifically to act in a fair and impartial manner when considering requests from racecourses for funding and allocating such funds.  I stated on Committee Stage that this would be unnecessary as one must assume that the Authority will act in a far and impartial way in performing all its functions under the Bill.  The rules of natural justice would require it to do so. It was also my firm contention at the time that it would be unfair to write into the Bill a statement such as the one suggested which applies to only one or two of the Authority's functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As promised, I considered the possibility of inserting a general statement on fairness and impartiality which would apply to the Authority in performing all its functions.  I have run into difficulty and been advised by the parliamentary draftsman's office that it would not be <Col N="1756" /> appropriate to include such a statement in the Bill on the basis that provisions of this nature are not used in other enactments in relation to bodies set up under statute.  It is implied in the Bill that the Authority will act always in a fair and impartial manner.  There are provisions in the Bill that may be used against any member of the Authority who does not act fairly and impartially.  Under the Bill a member or members may be removed from the Authority.  It could be argued that a provision such as the one proposed could be used by a person who vexatiously feels aggrieved with the Authority. Any person who feels legitimately aggrieved by the Authority can use the judicial review procedure.  Such a provision, particularly if it was inserted on Committee or Report Stages, would imply that there might be a reason not to have full confidence in the Authority with regard to fairness and impartiality in the performance of its functions.  I am confident the Authority will work harmoniously with all sections of the industry and treat them fairly in the best interests of the horseracing industry.  I assume the Authority will act as an executive or board to direct and develop this important industry.  I therefore regret that I have no option but to oppose the amendment on the insertion of specific statements relating to fairness and impartiality.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with the Minister in this regard because this is a pious aspiration and there are many pious aspirations in the world of racing. The Minister assumes the board will act in a fair and impartial manner and I accept his difficulty in that regard.  We can only hope it will.  However, there is a perception among the smaller tracks that there has not been a fair allocation, not only of prize money but of lucrative and attractive race dates.  The Minister is hopeful, but can he not give us a more concrete assurance that the Authority will give a fair allocation to lesser known tracks?  What change has he proposed? Who will decide whether the allocation <Col N="1757" /> is fair and proper?  How will it be monitored? That is where the difficulty arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will formally reply as we cannot hear the Minister's thinking on Deputy McGahon's contribution.  There are major concerns about the new Authority operating fairly and impartially in relation to funding applications and other areas.  The reason for those concerns stems from the Minister's decision to politicise ten of the 14 appointments to the Authority.  He must accept the reason for those concerns.  I had hoped the Minister might allay some of the concerns by inserting an overall clause requiring due care in relation to fairness and impartiality. He chose to make this a political Authority and to operate the old pals act, even as far as having school pals on the Authority.  Perhaps the best authorities on Irish racing attended the same school as the Minister.  This matter can be discussed in detail on the Schedule, but the Minister knows what I am talking about. Because the nominations to the board are not a well kept secret and because of concerns in respect of the vested interests of some of those appointed to the Authority, there is concern about it operating fairly and impartially in regard to funding <Col N="1758" /> applications, particularly from small racecourses.</P>
      <P>This mechanism could choke to death and cull some of our racecourses.  Small racecourses are concerned that this Authority will use procedures, such as the application for funding, to squeeze them to death.  In a later section the Minister has provided for the Authority to run or lease such racecourses.  The Authority might want to get its mitts on racecourses or get rid of them altogether if it considers them uneconomic.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Minister realises the concerns about the operations of the new Authority being fair and impartial in respect of fixtures, funding and all other areas.  Major concerns have arisen because the Minister politicised the Authority with his cronies and school pals.  He must accept that the structure he has chosen to select members of the Authority is a major cause of the concerns. There is a question mark about the integrity of the Authority even before it gets off the ground.  This is a political patsy, a political Authority.  It will be a mere coincidence if its members are the best people to run Irish horseracing.  I hope the Minister is right.  It would be interesting to see the expertise that would remain if one were to weed through the cumann cardholders or contributors to the major party in Government who are on the Authority.  The Minister knows the nomination procedure he has adopted is wrong.  Will he make a name for himself in Irish racing and sort out the nomination procedure before we come to the Schedule to this Bill?  If the nomination procedure was seen to be fair and if component parts of the industry could nominate their representatives to the Authority, there would not be such concern about the lack of fairness and impartiality, particularly in regard to funding. The Minister has brought on his head these major concerns and he can blame nobody but himself.  The nomination procedure of politicising ten of the 14 members of the new Authority is the main cause for those concerns.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 20, to delete lines 9 to 11.</P>
      <P>We dealt comprehensively with this matter yesterday.  This amendment relates to section 35 which allows a company of the Authority established for the sole purpose of carrying on the business of a bookmaker to apply for and hold a bookmaker's licence within the meaning of the Betting Act, 1931.  We are allowing the new Authority to get into the bookmaking business.  That is unnecessary; it has not been requested.  The Minister stated yesterday on Committee Stage that the Dowling Committee apparently received requests from component parts of the industry, including racecourses and the Truf Club, in this regard, but he did not say why the Authority should want to get into the business of bookmaking and go into direct competition with private sector bookmakers.  At the end of the discussion on this matter yesterday we squeezed out of the Minister that it might be an avenue to secure additional funding for the Authority in the future. Will the Minister elaborate on why we should allow the racing Authority to get into the business of bookmaking?  We deserve to know the real reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quotes the Dowling Committee when it suits him and drops chunks <Col N="1760" /> of its recommendations, blaming the Attorney General, when it does not suit him to accept them.  Why was the Dowling Committee persuaded by certain sectors of racing that the new Authority needed the facility to set up in the bookmaking business as a direct subsidiary company, alone or with others?</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 proposes the deletion of line 19 which allows the establishment of companies by the Authority for the sole purpose of carrying on business as a bookmaker.  I suggest that line should be deleted as well as section 35. Section 11 which allows the conferring of additional functions on the Authority would be sufficient if at some stage over the next 50 years the Authority needed to operate as a bookmaker or get into the bookmaking business.  Section 11 would be sufficient to facilitate that and it would enable it to do so by way of an order laid before the House for 21 days &mdash; probably in mid-August when we would not be able to annul the motion having regard to how things operate.</P>
    <P>Why do we need specific provision for the Authority to operate a bookmaker's licence?  The Minister has not justified his case.  He should leave the bookmaking business to the private sector, few of whom can make a success of it.  Most bookmakers are struggling and many are hungry.  The public sector does not need to get into the business of bookmaking licences.  Section 11 is an enabling section which provides that additional functions can be conferred on the Authority in the event of that being necessary over the next 50 years.</P>

      <P>I repeat my response to the question on section 35 yesterday.  I said it would be possible at some stage in the future for the Authority to derive funds for the industry from this source and to lead the betting industry in the development of new and improved betting facilities.  It is arrant nonsense to say something was squeezed out of me at the end of the discussion.  That is on the <Col N="1761" /> record and the Deputy can check the Official Report.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 propose to delete the provisions which would allow a company of the Authority to operate as a bookmaker.  I reiterate it is not intended in sections 35 and 36 to allow the Authority to operate as a bookmaker.  Section 35 will merely allow a subsidiary of the authority to operate as a bookmaker.  That is qualified further in section 36 which states that such a company could only be established with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Deputies may be concerned about the risks involved in a State board operating as a bookmaker and I understand those concerns.  I know Deputies may not wish to hear the argument again that it may be a long time before such a major change as this to horseracing legislation is carried through.  I continue to argue that this Bill provides for as many eventualities as possible, including this one.  As I said on Committee Stage, this provision was recommended by the Dowling Committee and I am not aware of any opposition to it in the industry.  It may prove to be a potential revenue earner for the Authority.</P>

It may be possible at some stage in the future for the Authority to derive funds for the industry from this source and to lead the betting industry in the development of new and improved betting facilities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation is ambivalent.  While I do not share my colleague's angst about the composition of the board as long as the members are genuinely involved in horseracing activity, I agree with her that it would be undesirable for the State to compete with bookmakers for such a colourful part of racing.  That may be the real reason it is envisaged the totalisator may be abolished in the future.  If that is the case it would be understandable and it may be a useful option in the future. However, it would be a draconian step to introduce a direct threat to the bookmakers who are part and parcel of the colour at race meetings.  Has the Minister had consultations, however informal, with the Irish bookmakers association about that possibility in the future?  Can the Minister be more forthcoming about the real purpose behind this section?  Is it proposed to scrap the tote at some stage in the future and perhaps replace it with a more modern or upgraded version? I would like to know that as it is in the interests of horseracing which we are here to serve.</P>

      <P>I would rather the Minister replied.  Will he indicate if he proposes to scrap the tote?  I think we can take it he does not.  Perhaps the Authority would like to scrap it, but that is another matter.  I gather it will not be the Minister's decision once the legislation has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I think we have made our point.  I consider it totally unnecessary, superfluous and, as common parlance would have it, previous, to include section 35 in the Bill. <Col N="1763" /> An earlier enabling section provides that additional functions can be conferred on the Authority and that should be sufficient. Unless the Minister has a hidden agenda, of which he has given little inkling and given that he has not discussed this matter with the bookmakers association and we cannot glean the real reasons that certain parts of the industry consider this requirement would be beneficial, we must reject section 35.</P>

      <P>We have retabled this amendment to obtain further views from the Minister in this area.  On a later section Deputy McManus and others, including members of our party, discussed appealing decisions or charges levied by the Racing Regulatory Body.  There are strong arguments in the industry on both sides about the need for a right to appeal or to establish an independent appeals tribunal in respect of charges levied or disclipinary decisions made by the Racing Regulatory Body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1764" /> This section deals only with the levying of charges.  The case for natural justice was made yesterday on Committee Stage and I ask the Minister to consider whether in natural justice, and I know the view is not unanimous, those in the industry who feel they need the right to appeal to another body against decisions or charges levied by the Racing Regulatory Body should have that right.  In other words, is there a case for setting up a tribunal or an appeals committee to adjudicate on decisions and charges made by the RRB?  Would it be possible to have sufficient expertise on a so-called independent appeals body for it to make sense?  That is my concern and yet I know many who have fallen foul of the RRB who feel very strongly that there should be an independent appeals procedure chaired, perhaps, by a retired High Court judge or someone with experience in this area.  On the assumption that he does not intend to accept my amendment &mdash; he did not do so on Committee Stage &mdash; we should hear the Minister's views on whether an independent appeal procedure against any decision of the RRB, including the setting on charges, should be in place.  If such an appeals procedure is not to be put in place, what are the Minister's reasons for feeling that all the rules of natural justice are sufficiently taken care of under the present procedure?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Doyle's submission is a fair one.  Natural justice demands that an appeals procedure be initiated.  It is essential to the success of this new racing body that an appeals structure should be set in place and there is a ready made candidate for such a body in the person of Judge Frank Roe who knows racing intimately.  To balance that, why not include Judge Desmond O'Hagen who also has a knowledge of racing?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 20 is seeking a right of appeal for individuals against the level of charges imposed by the regulatory body as against the authority. <Col N="1765" /> The Turf Club has been imposing charges for 200 years, as have many other bodies in similar circumstances, without reference to legislation, and the two honourable gentlemen mentioned are members of that club.  There will always be disagreement on charges but we must not create such a protective system as would prevent it from working.  The representative bodies and their interests in the industry are capable of making their case to the regulatory body if penal charges are made in exceptional circumstances the normal system of redress through a judicial review would be employed.

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The funds referred to in subsection (1) exclude those funds which properly belong to the Turf Club and are under the direct control of the trustees of the Turf Club.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister to consider points I made on Committee Stage yesterday.  We were not a million miles apart in what we wanted from this section which deals with the funds of the Racing Regulatory Body and the transfer of these funds to the new authorities.  The Minister had extensive consultation with the Racing Regulatory Body representatives and his amendment yesterday was an agreed one.  However, the legal advice to what we still refer to as the Turf Club suggests that there may be some ambiguity in the wording that will now be in the Bill.  The reference to funds in subsection (1) of the Minister's amendment excludes funds which properly belong to the Turf Club and which are under the direct control of its trustees. The difficulty is that if there were any argument or legal challenge the words are still slightly ambiguous.  My suggestion is to add to the Minister's amendment another subsection which <Col N="1766" /> would clarify legally beyond doubt what both the Minister and I are agreed should happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment on Committee Stage was to the effect that all revenue from the management of funds held by the Racing Regulatory Body collected or acquired in the course of performing its functions under this Act and all revenue from the funds held by that body on the establishment day on behalf of racehorse owners or persons licensed by the Racing Regulatory Body under the Rules of Racing shall be taken into account determining any charges made by it under section 40.  I want to add: &ldquo;The funds referred to in subsection (1) exclude those funds which properly belong to the Turf Club and are under the direct control of the Trustees of the Truf Club.&rdquo;  The only reason the Minister gave for not accepting the amendment on Committee Stage was that it was superfluous.  However, the legal advice available to those who have concerns in this area is that it is not superfluous, that the wording could be ambiguous if it were open to legal interpretation or judicial review of some kind.  It is to put the interpretation beyond doubt that I ask the Minister to accept my amendment. If my amendment is nothing more than superfluous I cannot understand why he will not accept it.  It is not just my own experience I bring to bear on this because that is limited.  My request that the Minister accepts my amendment is based on legal advice.</P>

      <P>There has been a great deal of consultation about this matter. My amendment was put down in the most helpful way to clarify this matter with the agreement of the body concerned. Deputy Doyle's amendment proposes the insertion of a specific statement to the effect that the revenue from the management of funds which the regulatory body must take into account when determining its charges and which is referred to in section 41 does not include funds which properly belong to the Turf Club and are under the direct control of the trustee of the Turf Club.  This is unnecessary <Col N="1767" /> as section 41(1) as amended on Committee Stage, is clear about what funds are to be taken into account.  As I promised, I checked this matter, and I am advised by the Office of the Attorney General&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there is no doubt that all other funds, such as the private funds of the Turf Club, are excluded.  It would be a duplication in drafting terms to include a full list of any funds which are not included.  I must, therefore, oppose amendment No. 21.  I went to the trouble of tabling my own amendment to make it clear, in agreement with the Turf Club, that their private funds were excluded.  That is abundantly clear here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 22, line 21, after &ldquo;manner.&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This procedure shall be based on a tribunal which shall be presided over by a chairman who shall be independent of the Racing Regulatory Body, and of which a majority of the members shall also be independent of that Body.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to section 45 which deals with appeals against sanctions to the Racing Regulatory Body.  I rehearsed my argument on the previous amendment dealing with charges levied by the Racing Regulatory Body.  The same arguments on natural justice apply.  Some sections of the racing industry have strong views on this matter.  Those who <Col N="1768" /> believe passionately that there should be an appeals system have gone to much trouble to express their views and those views should be aired.  We should be very clear as to the reason the Minister will not accept my amendment and that of other Members on an appeals system or independent tribunal to hear appeals against sanctions of the Racing Regulatory Body.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied beyond doubt that the Racing Regulatory Body can be judge and jury on appeals against sanctions levied by it?  Is it possible to hear an appeal on an issue that has been already determined by the same person?  It would be very difficult for the racing regulatory body to make a liar of itself by overturning its first decision, which is effectively what we are asking it to do.  I do not hold very strong views on either side of this argument, but I accept that virtually all the expertise, legal and otherwise, that is available to the horseracing industry is already cornered by the Turf Club.  I am not sure where one would find a totally independent tribunal, staffed by people who are not already members of or connected with the Turf Club and who would have a similar level of experience and expertise.  That aspect has never been clarified by those who believe strongly that an independent appeals procedure is necessary.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for natural justice.  There are very prominent people in the industry who feel aggrieved by decisions of the Turf Club in recent years. One or two have taken their case to the courts who upheld the decision of the Turf Club.  Natural justice appears to have been done in those cases, but not everyone has the means or the wherewithal to take the Turf Club to court &mdash; the courts cannot give a judicial review of Turf Club decisions.  This is an issue about which we need to be clear.  If the Minister does not accept the call from the sections of the industry that believe we need an independent review of appeals, he should put on record the reasons for not doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague in her very strong and reasonable request <Col N="1769" /> to the Minister to initiate an appeals procedure. The Minister is a very reasonable man, but I cannot comprehend why he is opposing this most reasonable request from a person who has very good knowledge of the horseracing and horse breeding industry.  Is there any facet of Irish life where a person does not have the right to appeal to an independent body? I regard it as absolutely essential for the success of the new racing body that people have that right.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle suggested that people with knowledge of the horseracing industry who are not currently members of the Turf Club but perhaps have served on the Turf Club be appointed to an appeals committee.  There is no doubt, given the composition of racing, that cases will be appealed in future years.  What recourse will a person have in that instance?  Will they have to go to court, with all the associated costs?  That may be beyond the purse strings of a small owner who feels deeply affronted.  We witnessed the case in England some years ago of probably the richest racehorse owner in the world, the Aga Khan, who was so affronted by a decision of the English stewards that he withdrew his horses from the English racing scene.  That created a great void in English racing and affected three or four prominent English trainers such as Luka Cumani and Michael Stoute.  Ireland was the beneficiary as the Aga Khan moved his horses to the John Oxx stable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the same thing happened here, would we deny the Aga Khan an appeals structure?  I mention him because he is the most famous personage in racing and his case caused the biggest furore in English racing in recent years.  He moved more than 100 horses out of England and has not returned to English racing despite the fact that one of his horses, Mantari, was backed to win this year's English 2000 Guineas race.  Can that happen here?  Can we afford to lose a man who has contributed and will contribute much to Irish racing in future years?  Natural justice demands that an appeals procedure be initiated and I cannot understand <Col N="1770" /> the Minister's reluctance to accept this proposal.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 23 proposes the establishment of a tribunal, independent of the regulatory body, to hear appeals under section 45 against decisions of that body which impose a sanction against any person.  I would like to put on the record again that I have spent considerable time discussing with the industry this whole Bill.  In my time in the House I do not know of any case where an industry was so widely consulted. Now that we are moving to the starting tape I do not want a repeat of what happened at Aintree.  This is a diverse industry and it is not easy to get agreement on all matters.  No doubt some people are not as fully in agreement as others but there is general consensus that something needs to be done and we are making worthwhile progress in this Bill. I am sure it is everybody's wish that we get it right &mdash; I certainly hope so.</P>
      <P>The Turf Club has updated its procedures and I have confidence it will continue to provide an appeals system which will be fair and reasonable and will adequately protect the integrity of horseracing, as it is generally accepted it has done for two centuries.  Under section 45 (2) that body will be obliged to consider appeals in a fair and impartial manner. As was apparent from Deputies' contributions, in setting up an appeals procedure outside the regulatory body there is a danger that it would be difficult to find as much expertise as there is in the Turf Club and that technical matters would be heard by people who do not know the business.  The expertise in this area resides in the Turf Club&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response does not surprise me but I am amused by his <i>á la carte</i> references to consultations with Moriarty and the industry.  The Minister took on board the aspects of the industry's submission that suited him but ignored what did not.  He has tried to create the impression that he has engaged in wide consultation with the industry in formulating sections of the Bill implying that there is agreement in regard to what he is trying to do.  However, in case he has not heard or read reports in the racing press there are major concerns about aspects of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with just one area, setting up a system of independent appeals against sanctions of the Racing Regulatory Board.  The industry is divided on how these appeals should be dealt with.  To be fair, most of the representations I received were to make the Turf Club a little more democratic, to update its procedures, making them more transparent, but leaving the question of sanctions, disciplinary system and integrity of services with the Turf Club, but some representations by very well known names in the racing industry, jockeys and trainers primarily, held strongly different views.  Some were part of the group feeding information into the triumvirate coming in over the head of the Moriarty committee with the result that little bits of the Bill were changed as it progressed.  The Minister blames the Attorney General but we know others have the Minister's ear.  Some very high profile members of the industry held very strong views that there should be an independent procedure.  I accepted there are arguments for and against it, but generally speaking over 200 years the Turf Club has voluntarily done an excellent job.  Irish racing would not be where it is <Col N="1772" /> today except for the input of the Turf Club over the years.  That does not mean there is not room for improvement and greater transparency in many of the Turf Club's procedures, but I have every confidence that with the system in place under the new chief steward things will change and that will get the same excellent voluntary service from the Truf Club we have always got.</P>
    <P>The Minister is effectively saying we will continue the present system.  Reluctantly, I have to accept his view, but let me make it clear that it is not held unanimously throughout the industry. Some very high profile people hold very strongly that a third party or independent appeals system is needed over and above the Racing Regulatory Body.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 1, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;request the Garda Síochána to&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking the substance of my amendment on board. Section 47 deals with the prohibition of course-betting by bookmakers not holding permits from the Authority and the authority of authorised officers to remove unauthorised bookmakers or such persons from racecourses.  Yesterday, I made the point that if someone is being removed from a racecourse by force, the Garda Síochána should be involved. Amendment No. 25, in the Minister's name, effectively takes on board the points made by Deputy Dukes and me. Therefore, I will withdraw amendment No. 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1773" /> Similarly, amendments Nos. 36, 37 and 38 deal with exactly the same point in section 62 which deals with the exclusion of certain undesirable persons from racecourses &mdash; Deputy McGahon may have something to say about that, as he referred to it on Committee Stage.  Under the provisions of this section racecourse personnel have power to remove undesirable persons but amendment No. 36 provides for members of the Garda Síochána to assist if it is considered necessary and furthermore the reference to force is amended to &ldquo;reasonable force&rdquo;, if necessary. I will withdraw the amendments in my name.  As the Minister has effectively taken on board the case we made on these issues, for which I thank him, I accept his amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with this requirement.  Every sporting organisation must have the right to remove people whom it deems to be undesirable. The Garda Síochána are always present at race meetings and will be able to assist, if necessary, when a person is requested to leave.  I want to back Scenic Dancer in the ladies' race at Ripon today, I am not going to Royal Ascot.</P>
      <P>People in the racing industry regard the question of undesirables very seriously. Race gangs in England have been involved in significant doping operations in recent years.  Such people are clearly identifiable by the Irish racing authorities who must have the right to exclude them from Irish race tracks.  The dangers of doping to the punter, the jockey and all concerned are very sinister and should be given absolute priority by the racing authorities.  I know they do that and that is why I support any provision to exclude undesirables from race tracks, particularly those with a track record of doping horses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>An exclusion notice under section 62 will apply to people who may interfere with horses or a person causing a problem at a racecourse so it meets the concerns expressed by Deputy McGahon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> I promised, on Committee Stage, to give consideration to bringing forward appropriate amendments on Report Stage.  Deputies in their amendments were seeking to transfer from authorised officers and racecourse executives to the Garda the power to remove, by force if necessary, people from racecourses who were carrying on the business of bookmaking without a permit or who were the subject of an exclusion notice under section 62, such as those mentioned by Deputy McGahon.  As I said on Committee Stage, I am not in favour of involving the Garda Síochána in every case.  If someone is creating a nuisance he will be asked to leave and it may not be necessary to use the Garda in every case. However, I concede there might be occasions when one may have to call the Garda and its support would be useful and appropriate.</P>
    <P>The situations that might arise are, of their nature, very different in each case and, therefore, I leave it to the authorised officers and the racecourse executives to decide when it would be appropriate to call for the assistance of the Garda Síochána. After all, we have trusted these officers and executives with powers to remove persons from racecourses since 1946.</P>
    <P>In the case of the amendment to section 47, as there is no exclusion notice involved I felt it would be appropriate that the person found bookmaking without a permit should first be asked to leave the racecourse, in other words, given the yellow card and if the person does not comply with the request, the refusal to do so should be regarded as an offence. On that basis, I propose also to add the new subsection (3) of section 47 to the list of summary offences in section 6, under amendment No. 1, a technical amendment to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>In this group of amendments I am supporting amendments Nos. 25, 36 and 38 and opposing amendments Nos. 24 and 37.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

There have been many requests to Ministers to implement various changes within the force.  Sometimes Commissioners have agreed and sometimes they have not but at the end of the day the Minister has the power.  I have not interfered in the day-to-day operational matters of the Garda.

In all cases regard is had to a number of factors including the nature of the offence, the length of sentence, the <Col N="1778" /> length of time served, behaviour while in custody and the safety of the public. Weekend releases may be granted for a variety of reasons including family occasions, resocialisation and as part of structured pre-release programmes.</P>

Temporary release automatically ends if any of these conditions is breached and the individual concerned can be immediately returned to custody without the need for fresh proceedings.</P>

      <P>I do.  Does the Minister agree that her constant personal determination to oversee every application from Galway is unfair to prisoners from Galway and amounts to cruel and degrading treatment of them and their right to be treated in the same way as any other prisoner?  Does she accept that it is totally unfair to treat Galway in a different manner from the rest of the country and that the people in Crumlin are entitled to the same treatment as those in Connemara?</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the Minister looking at requests for temporary release for prisoners from Galway is unfair to prisoners from Galway.  I explained to the Deputy and others some time ago in the House that I have not done anything different from what my predecessors did in relation to temporary releases for prisoners. A Minister for Justice from any part of the country would have a particular knowledge of offences for which prisoners have been committed to prison. It would be extraordinary if a Minister did not have a particular interest in certain specific cases.  That would be normal <Col N="1780" /> and natural and I would accept it from any Minister for Justice, as I hope they would accept it from me.  Prisoners from Galway are not the only ones who come to my attention regarding temporary release applications.  Quite a substantial number of temporary release applications are submitted to me and I take a particular interest in all of them.</P>

      <P>All offenders are entitled to a quarter remission of their sentence dependent on good behaviour. At present sex offenders are not granted any other early release concessions.  This means that they are released only on the expiry of the sentence imposed on them by the court less standard remission.  The legal authority to hold them in custody after that, of course, cease to exist.  The offender referred to by the Deputy served the full term of his sentence less standard remission.</P>
      <P>While present practice is as I have indicated, it may change in the context of the new sex offender treatment programme which is about to be introduced.  I understand that international experience suggests that the grant of additional, controlled parole concessions to those who take part in such programmes may play an important part in their success. I am not, therefore, ruling out such a development here since it is so important to obtain maximum benefit, in the interest of the community, from such programmes. I can assure the Deputy that no change will be made in this regard without extremely careful consideration being given to the implications involved.</P>

Will she further confirm that three months later he committed a cruel rape for which he was convicted and sentenced to 12 years in Britain?  Does she accept that it is reckless to the point of irresponsibility to release into the community people who are not subjected to a review of their propensity to re-offend?  Does she further agree that if such a review system is not put in place we will fail in our responsibility to protect society from such men when research has shown they are likely to re-offend?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two broad naturalisation categories which, for the sake of convenience, I will describe as general naturalisations and investment-based naturalisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of applications granted fall into the general category. These are naturalisation certificates granted by the Minister for Justice to persons who have a certain period of residence in the State and fulfil other specific conditions set out in the Irish nationality and citizenship legislation. While I have certain ideas concerning these naturalisations which I shall mention in dealing with Deputy Mitchell's specific question, all I want to say at this <Col N="1784" /> point is that these cases have not been central to the recent controversy, apart perhaps from one point.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Department of Justice, or at least some of the officials within the Department of Justice who deal with naturalisation, apply discriminatory or racist policies in dealing with naturalisation irrespective of the category into which the particular application falls.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that these allegations will not be repeated.  I have no wish to engage in dispute with Deputies on this subject.  It is quite simply too serious to have discord in this House on a matter which may give rise to offence or become the subject of concern to the nationals of any country when there is simply no basis for it.  If anybody has evidence of discrimination I would urge that they supply me with the facts.</P>
    <P>Turning to naturalisation applications granted on the basis of investments made, I have already outlined the background to these cases in the course of a lengthy statement I made to the House on 31 May last and I do not think that it would be right to waste the time of the House by going through all of these details again.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to stress some points because various statements made about investment-based naturalisation, since I made my statement in the Dáil, leave the impression that certain matters have not been fully understood.</P>
    <P>The first point is that the scheme which we now have is, subject to what I will say later, the scheme which has existed since the Government decided that inward based investment, provided that the amount involved was sufficient, should constitute grounds for deeming the investor to have qualified for naturalisation on the basis of what the legislation describes as &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I explained in my statement last month what the legislation provides is, first, that the granting of naturalisation on the basis of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; is in the absolute discretion of the Minister for Justice and, second, that none of the <Col N="1785" /> other conditions specified in that Act need to be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice itself, however, adopted certain informal working rules, the more important of which were that an investment of about £500,000 would be required and that the applicants would demonstrate an intention of residing in the State by purchasing a residence.  Although these working rules were submitted to the Government, the Government's decision was that the question of granting or refusing naturalisation in individual cases should be left in the absolute discretion of the Minister for Justice.  Despite this, Justice Ministers have operated on the basis that investments of the order mentioned would be required and that intention to reside in the country for a reasonable period &mdash; to be evidenced, basically, by the purchase of a residence &mdash; would be required also.</P>
    <P>Having looked over various cases since the recent controversy began, it is fair to say that the Ministers who dealt with these cases operated these rather informal arrangements in a very similar manner.</P>
    <P>Nobody could deny with the benefit of hindsight &mdash; which tends invariably to produce the very best insights &mdash; that the informality of the scheme, while in one way an asset, was, in other ways, a feature which left it wide open to criticism. The strength of the scheme's informality was that it enabled favourable decisions to be made quite quickly in cases where there appeared to be a reasonable prospect of getting investment into the country and thereby creating or maintaining jobs.  It is fair to say, however, that in judging whether a particular investment proposal had a reasonable prospect of coming to fruition and producing or saving jobs, Ministers tended to exercise discretion in favour of the investor without, as a matter of routine, insisting on all the certainties that might well be required if a more formal arrangement was in place.</P>
    <P>For example, it is not, and never has been, the practice to seek police reports on the investors concerned.  Deputy <Col N="1786" /> O'Malley has tabled a specific question on this aspect of the matter to which I propose to respond separately and in more detail.  It was not the practice to insist on a positive recommendation from the Industrial Development Authority. It was usual to consult the IDA and to have regard to its views on particular investments.  However, in the end the judgment as to whether a particular investment was sufficiently attractive in job-creating or job-maintaining terms was a political one, to be exercised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It was not essential that the investment should fall into a particular category.  If there was inward investment likely to produce or save jobs &mdash; even if that investment took the form of what is known as a &ldquo;soft loan&rdquo;&mdash; the inclination was to grant rather than refuse naturalisation to secure the investment.  The only significant development in this regard &mdash; indeed the only significant development of the scheme since it began &mdash; was a Government decision of March 1992 that the interpretation of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; should be interpreted liberally not to confine the requirement to investment in industry, for example, tourist related projects could be included, but property should be excluded.</P>
    <P>There was no automatic follow-up system.  In other words, it was not part of routine practice to check, say, six or 12 months later to see whether the persons naturalised had been resident in the country for a reasonable period, etc. Deputy Rabbitte has tabled a specific question on this aspect of the matter to which I also propose to respond separately.</P>
    <P>While the flexibility of the whole scheme had its advantages in terms of securing investments that might otherwise be lost, and while Ministers tended to decide cases in all good faith to secure those investments, there is now a clear view that more formal and indeed more transparent arrangements are called for.</P>

      <P>The Government fully agrees with this and has already acted.  This brings me to the two Priority Questions from Deputies Mitchell and Gilmore and Deputy McDowell's question.  With regard to Deputy Mitchell's question, the position is as follows. Last year, the Government established an interdepartmental committee of senior officials to examine policy and practice with regard to non-Irish persons resident in the State, and in relation to persons who apply for refugee status. A report has already been published on applications for refugee status and, having considered the proposals, the Government gave formal approval for drafting a Bill.  That Bill will be introduced as soon as possible and, when the work on its drafting has been completed, I will arrange for its immediate publication.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee is continuing its work and preparing recommendations with regard to the procedures and policies governing the admission and residence of non-Irish nationals.  I have asked the committee to consider specifically the existing procedures for the granting of naturalisation to non-nationals in the light of the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that policy towards the treatment of immigrants will meet the highest international standards.  I hope to have its report in the near future and, when I have considered its recommendations, including those of the area of naturalisation procedures, I will act on them as soon as possible.  Action will include amending legislation, if that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Gilmore's question, the position is as follows.  On the basis of my experience in dealing with the &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; provision in the nationality and citizenship legislation, I formed the view that, in addition to having the interdepartmental committee to which I have just referred and which will consider broad policy issues, the Minister for Justice should immediately have available the ongoing advice of an appropriately qualified group of people <Col N="1788" /> on individual applications under the present scheme for investment-based naturalisation.</P>
    <P>On my recommendations, therefore, the Government agreed last April to establish such an advisory group consisting of representatives of my Department, the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Enterprise and Employment, Finance and the Government agency engaged in the support and development of indigenous industry, Forbairt.  This advisory group was established with the function of examining each application for naturalisation on the basis of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; linked to investment in the State and making a recommendation in each instance to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>In establishing the latter advisory group, the Government decided that the Minister for Justice would bring its terms of reference to Government for approval at an early date.  Since then, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has written formally to me setting out in detail his broad views on the future arrangements that should apply in these cases.  I have asked the interdepartmental committee which has been working since last year to consider the broad policy matters raised by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  With regard to terms of reference for the group which will now advise the Minister for Justice on all future investment-based naturalisation applications, the position is that these terms of reference will be considered in the first instance by a Cabinet sub-committee which has been formed specially to advise the Government on the matter. That sub-committee consists of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice.  I will make the terms of reference of the advisory group known publicly when they have been settled by the Government.  In the meantime I assure the House that no further investment-based naturalisation will be decided by me until the advisory group is fully operational and in a position to give me its advice on each case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> With regard to Deputy McDowell's question, the position is that, in the context of the Treaty on European Union, the nationality of member states is not regarded as a matter of common interest for the purpose of achieving the objectives of the Union.  The question of proposals to deal with the granting of nationality does not, therefore, arise.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have not been in a position to provide all the statistical information which Deputies have sought in the various other naturalisation questions, particularly those which were for answer yesterday.  To do so would require an enormous amount of detailed research in a section within my Department which already has a sizeable arrears problem due to the enormous increase in workload which has arisen in recent years in the area of general naturalisation and citizenship.</P>
    <P>I will endeavour to provide whatever information can conveniently be provided from the records though I will adhere to the principle of not discussing the details of individual cases out of regard for the privacy rights of the individuals concerned and the rights of various companies who have provided information to my Department concerning their business affairs, their investment plans, etc. on a strictly confidential basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>How did the Minister omit from her very lengthy reply the information she gave to the House in reply to a parliamentary question on 9 March last that if a foreign national was prepared to be associated with Ireland by making a substantial contribution, purchasing a home and living here he or she would be considered for naturalisation by her Department?  Did the investors in C &amp; D Foods Limited ever live in Ireland and, if so, do they continue to live here? Why have the details of this application not been put before the House?  Despite her statement about the need for greater transparency, will the Minister agree that, conveniently, the waters have been muddied in this case?  Am I correct in saying that this company, in which the <Col N="1790" /> Taoiseach said he remains a 41 per cent shareholder, has received a loan or gift &mdash;it is not a shareholding in the company &mdash;repayable in the event of the passports being revoked?  In other words, do these new naturalised Irish citizens have a sword hanging over their heads and if they ever call in or withdraw their loan or gift their passports will be withdrawn?  What is the precise status of this so-called investment in C &amp; D Foods Limited?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given very lengthy replies in this House and elsewhere about the investment in C &amp; D Foods Limited.  I have been very forthcoming with all the information about the investment available to me and on file in my Department.  My reply was very long and Deputies may have missed some of the points I made.  I said that intention to reside in the country for a reasonable period was one of the informal rules.  In reply to a Private Notice Question I said that the Department of Justice or the State could not compel people to live here &mdash; the people make the decision themselves.  Successive Minister for Justice have taken the view that when people purchase a residence here it is a very strong indication that they will spend a certain amount of their time here each year.  There has been no folow up procedure whereas every six, 12 or 18 months or two years the Department of Justice, the IDA or some other body look at these investments to see if they are still in place, whether the loan has been repaid and the circumstances surrounding the case.  I do not have the information the Deputy seeks.  There is no sword left hanging over the people if and when they withdraw their loan, that in some way interferes with their right of citizenship or nationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the whole nub of this problem that for some time past this State has been operating a two-tier system of naturalisation, one law for those who can afford to buy their way into Irish citizenship and quite a different law for those who cannot afford to do so? <Col N="1791" /> Would the Minister agree that, in all of these various reviews about which she now speaks, perhaps what should emerge is a level playing pitch for all applications for naturalisation, irrespective of whether applicants are in a position to invest large sums of money in a Minister's or in the Taoiseach's company, or whether they be somebody who is simply coming in here to rejoin his family?  By all means we should have an open and generous system of naturalisation but one which applies the same rules to everybody. Second, in relation to the myriad of committees and advisory groups to which the Minister referred, is my understanding correct that there was in place an interdepartmental committee examining general applications for naturalisation and the question of refugees but not the business migration scheme and, furthermore, that the advisory group to which the Minister referred has been established only recently and held its first meeting only on Friday last and that the Cabinet subcommittee to which she referred has been established only since the present controversy arose?  Could the Minister clarify that for me, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no myriad of groups, although it may have appeared like that when I was replying. In effect there are two groups comprised of public servants.  Deputy Gilmore is correct in saying that we have the interdepartmental committee which was set up by me because I felt it was important to have transparency and openness in relation to nationality and citizenship and the way we treat refugees and that we should live up to the standards accepted internationally, particularly with reference to the United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees and her recommendations.  The first objective of that interdepartmental committee was to examine the overall issue of refugee status and to ascertain what should be done in relation to it.  That interdepartmental committee furnished me with a report which was made known, resulting from which the refugees Bill has <Col N="1792" /> been drawn up which is now in final stages of drafting in the paraliamentary draftman's office.  It will be published before the Dáil goes into recess if that is possible.</P>
      <P>The second matter the interdepartmental committee examined was that of general naturalisations.  I cited the different between general and investment-based applications in my reply. General naturalisations comprised the second matter the interdepartmental committee was examining.  It is coming to finalisation of a report on the way this country should treat applications for general naturalisation.  If that final report includes recommendation for changes in the law, statutory regulations or whatever, I will do as I did in relation to the refugees report &mdash; I will be quite happy to get the agreement of Government in relation to it.</P>
      <P>Third, in relation to the advisory committee, Deputy Gilmore is correct in saying that I asked the Government to set up an advisory committee specifically in relation to the business migration scheme, or investment-based naturalisation, on the basis that I felt it was important to have some formal group of people who would examine the companies involved and the persons who wished to make an investment and make a recommendation to me.  That group would be broadly-based, comprised of officials of the Departments to which I referred.  That advisory committee will get its guidelines and terms of reference from the Cabinet subcommittee which the Deputy is correct in saying was established since this controversy &mdash; as he referred to it &mdash; blew up.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.</P>

      <P>The Minister informed the House that the vast majority of these applications fall into the general category and a small number only into the specific category.  If that is the case, why was one of this small number, the one in relation to C &amp; D Foods Limited, not submitted to the Industrial Development Authority in the normal way?  Will the Minister tell the <Col N="1793" /> House why the IDA was by-passed?  Will she inform the House what was the role of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, in all of this?  Was it unusual that when he made further representation on behalf of Mr. Masri, senior, he was replied to not by the Minister, or the Minister's office, as would be the normal procedure, but rather by a civil servant in the Department of Justice? Why was that?  I am advised that is an unusual thing to happen.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the general and welcome changes the Minister is introducing at the request of Members of the House, will she agree to an independent examination of the specific investment in C &amp; D Foods Limited and the granting of passports to the Masris, so that we can get to the end of what is a source of public scandal which will not go away simply because a Cabinet subcommittee has been established to investigate the general problem?</P>

      <P>I will take the last part of the Deputy's supplementary first.  I reject the implication in Deputy Mitchell's statement that the investment in C &amp; D Foods Limited is a source of public scandal.  The investment in C &amp; D Foods Limited was made on the very same basis as many other investment-based naturalisations concluded by all of my predecessors since this scheme was first initiated.  There was nothing unusual, nothing different in it.  Nothing was by-passed.  There was no difference between the way that application was treated and the way every other application for investment based naturalisation is treated within the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>Pehaps Deputy Mitchell will let me continue.  I said in the House that when inquiries were made in relation to the investment, as they are normally made through the consultant in each case, there was no difference in relation to C &amp; D Foods Limited.  The inquiries were made through the consultant who submitted the application, the reply having come back very clearly that the overall project in C &amp; D Foods Limited was IDA grant-assisted. As far as the Department was concerned that was enough to indicate that the IDA was supporting the project and, therefore, that there was no difficulty in relation to the investment.</P>

      <P>In relation to the role of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, there was nothing strange or different about that.  I have looked at the scheme since this overall issue was raised and since early April when I asked the Government to agree to the establishment of the advisory committee.  I ascertained that on the vast majority of occasions on which these type of applications were made to the Department, they are brought by a Minister of the Government, by a Minister of State or Members of this House.  There is nothing different in the fact that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, happened to be the Minister who brought this particular application to the notice of the Department of Justice.</P>

Can the Minister confirm that the statement made by the Tánaiste on 2 June in which he stated that that committee was already in place and was examining the scheme was incorrect and that his statement on that occasion was no more than a political covering of tracks?  In relation to the Masri case, will the Minister agree that the value of the soft loans provided to C &amp; D Foods Limited &mdash; which I understand were at a rate of 5 per cent as against 16 per cent, which was the market rate at the time &mdash; was the equivalent of £600,000 and was a very significant boost to that company but a very cheap price to pay for an Irish passport?</P>

      <P>There were two committees in existence.  The reason for the lengthy reply was that I was anxious that further confusion should not be created in people's minds as a result of my reply today.  Last year I set up an interdepartmental committee to look at two issues, refugees and general naturalisations, and I said what had happened as a result.  Last April the Government agreed to my recommendation to have an advisory committee to the Minister for Justice and that that committee should comprise representatives from the various Departments involved plus a representative from Forbairt because they would have an intimate knowledge of companies, business and marketing and so on and would have an expertise which I and my officals in the Department would not be expected to have.  That advisory committee was asked to look at the whole area of business or investment-based naturalisation.  It was correct for the Tánaiste to say that the advisory committee was in existence.  To make it absolutely clear, what has happened since is that the Government has decided, again <Col N="1798" /> on my recommendation, to set up a Cabinet subcommittee which will lay down the criteria and the guidelines &mdash; the terms of reference&mdash;for the advisory committee. I intend to publish those terms of reference when the Cabinet subcommittee has agreed them.</P>

      <P>Yes, if the Minister answers the questions I put to her.  Can we have a specific reply to the question on C &amp; D Foods investment?  Will the Minister permit an independent examination of the file by either the Select Committee on Security and Legislation or the Committee of Public Accounts? Will the Minister extend to me as the Fine Gael spokesperson on justice the the same courtesy that has been extended to the Tánaiste?  May I see the file?  If there is nothing to hide, what is wrong with my seeing the file?  When the Masris' application in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> was noted the address given was simply Haddington Road, not 46B or any number in Haddington Road.  Haddington Road is a long road comprising many houses and many apartments.  Why did the Department of Justice approve an application simply with the address &ldquo;Haddington Road&rdquo;?  It was the only application from Dublin in that entry in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> which did not have a number.  Are the successful applicants living in the State and, if not, where are they living?</P>

      <P>In answer to the final supplementary, I have no idea where the Masris are living.  In relation to the address given in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, there is no requirement other than that given on the application and that is what was <Col N="1799" /> put in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I omitted to answer a previous question posed by Deputy Mitchell in which he made the comment that there were very few of these investment-based applications.  It is important to put the record straight.  There were 17 successful applications in 1992.</P>

      <P>There were 15 successful applications in 1993 and seven successful applications in 1994 to date.  It is useful to know that because the public is inclined to think there are thousands of applications every year.  The request for an independent examination of the file seems to suggest something which is very serious, a Cheann Comhairle, and which I hope you have listened to carefully. It seems to suggest that in some way, as Minister for Justice, I am telling lies, interfering with the file or that somebody in my Department is doing so.  I hope Deputy Mitchell is not suggesting that because, if so, I would have to deal with it separately.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify two matters. Will the Minister agree that the value of the £1.1 million soft loan &mdash; not an investment of £1.1 million as has been portrayed &mdash; at a 5 per cent preferential rate of interest during the period concerned is £600,000 and that the two Irish passports came very cheap?  My second question relates to the interdepartmental committees.  The interdepartmental committee established to examine the business migration scheme, as distinct from the interdepartmental committee which was examining the general naturalisation issue, had not commenced its work at the time the Tánaiste stated it had commenced its work.  He gave the impression that it was operational and that the scheme was under review.

Does she agree it is not appropriate for the Garda to adopt a low key approach in relation to the age of the person involved as in the case of adult prostitution?

      <P>I agree with the first part of the supplementary question. After the Deputy had raised this matter with me last April I took the issue up with the Garda Commissioner.  He informed me that the Garda has not detected any breaches of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, in the Phoenix Park and that no complaints have been received to date concerning homosexual prostitution, including so-called rent boy activities.  I reject the suggestion that the Garda is adopting a low key approach to this matter.  It views such breaches of the law seriously and any complaints made will be pursued vigorously, perhaps more vigorously because of the age of the young people allegedly involved in this activity.</P>

Last year the Eastern Health Board encountered 427 homeless children.  Does the Minister agree that if a child is staying in a bed and breakfast establishment and is in receipt of £5 a day from the community welfare office there is a danger, as expressed by the authorities working with homeless children, they will resort to prostitution or handbag snatching? There is a serious risk that some children will resort to selling their bodily integrity for a little as £20.</P>

      <P>When the issue was last raised I was asked if I would arrange for a person who works, as the Deputy says, at the coalface and who had commented in the newspapers to meet officials of my Department.  That meeting has taken place with a small delegation of people involved.  It was a lengthy meeting and they had a frank discussion with officials of my Department.  I understand arrangements have been made for them to meet on a regular basis to review the situation.  I understand also that the number of homeless young boys is dropping and that there will be less need to place young boys of the ages referred <Col N="1803" /> to by the Deputy in bed and breakfast establishments.  The health board has been very active in this area.  The Phoenix Park is patrolled by mobile units comprising plain clothes gardaí on night tour. Any breaches of the law will be pursued vigorously.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister, Deputy O'Donnell and I are at one on this matter.  Does the Minister accept there is a problem and, if so, will she ask the agencies of the State, the health boards, her own Department or the Garda Síochána, to carry out an investigation to determine the extent of the problem with a view to reporting to the House on the steps that need to be taken? As a public representative, I have not received any complaints about child prostitution, although I have about sexual abuse of children which is a separate matter.</P>

      <P>After this issue had been raised at Question Time some time ago I asked the Garda Commissioner for figures to determine the extent of the problem of child prostitution, with particular reference to the Phoenix Park.  He reported that the Grada has not detected any breaches of the law and that no complaints have been received.  Like Deputy Mitchell, I have received no complaints either.  A well respected and well known person who had made positive comments in the media met senior officials of my Department with a small delegation to discuss the problem.  They had a long discussion and have agreed to meet on a regular basis.  I can do what Deputy Mitchell asks and consider further ways of determining the extent of the problem but how does one get people to complain to the Garda? I would have imagined that people would be forthcoming with complaints.  I am sure Deputies Gilmore, O'Donnell, Mitchell and I favour vigorous enforcement of the law in this area given that we are talking about young childern.  I would be prepared to do what is necessary, even if this involves changing or amending the <Col N="1804" /> legislation.  I will consider Deputy Mitchell's proposal because we all want the same thing at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>It would be useful to carry out a realistic audit to determine the scale of the problem but, in detecting breaches, the Garda encounter difficulties in ascertaining the age of the person concerned; it is very difficult to tell the difference between a 16 year old and an a 18 year old.  A special effort should be made to liaise with the people dealing with homeless children in Dublin to give these childern protection.  The Minister referred to the activities and responsibilities of health boards.  Does she agree that one health boards in particular, the Western Health Board, has responded well in terms of its obligations? It has issued a directive in which it is stated that it is not appropriate to place homeless children in bed and breakfast establishments.  Does the Minister agree that she must adopt an active role with the Minister for Health and that a combined effort should be made to tackle the problem of youth homelessness? One thousand homeless children were presented to the State authorities in 1993.</P>

It is a good idea that a special effort should be made to liaise with the people dealing with homeless childern. That is the reason a meeting took place between a small delegation and senior officials of my Department and they will meet on a regular basis.  We can formalise this arrangement.

To what extent has this legislation been used in dealing with prostitutes and their clients? Have any arrests been made and, if so, how many? Will the Minister indicate the level of charges pressed over and above the figure prior to the enactment of this legislation?

      <P>It is too soon to talk about amending the legislation because it has not been in force for very long.  We should view its progress and see what happens as a result of it before drawing firm conclusions from the pattern of prosecutions or convictions that have taken place.  Of the 12 prosecutions for soliciting under the Act to the end of April, two have been against male clients of prostitutes and of 18 prosecutions for refusing to comply with the direction of a garda to leave an area immediately, two have been against males.  It is too soon to say the Act needs to be amended, but we are examining the matter carefully. I gave a commitment in that regard when we discussed the Bill here and in the upper House.  If I discover that, on the basis of information made available to me or representations made by Members, the Act should be amended to make it a more preventive measure I will have no hesitation in doing so.</P>

      <P>At present, under the law, the Garda Síochána is the only agency which can act in cases involving the payment of fines and execution of committal orders whether for non-payment of fines or ordinary civil debts.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned if an excessive amount of Garda time is being expended on this activity given the need for the maximum number of gardaí to be engaged on operational duties.</P>
      <P>At the moment, I understand that about 1 per cent of gardaí countrywide are employed full-time in this area.  That represents about 100 gardaí out of the total numbers in the force.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department is carrying out a general review of fines, which takes into account the various options that may be open to us to improve the situation.

Will she also accept that we have had some horrible examples of crime recently, not least in her part of the country?  In that context, will she accept that it is an unfair burden on the Garda to be involved in a matter which is peripheral to its main job, which is to prevent crime and detect persons involved in crime?</P>

      <P>Prior to my reply to this question, people were probably of the view that thousands of gardaí &mdash; hundreds in each division &mdash; were involved in the collection of fines.  It may come as a surprise to most people that only 1 per cent, approximately 100, of the total number of Gardaí are involved in the collection of fines.  We are examining the system of fine collection and I have an open mind as to what should be done in this regard.  A number of very important things should be done in relation to the payment of fines.  The only provision at present is that a fine must be <Col N="1807" /> paid in full which, as the Deputy knows, can create major difficulties for many people in both urban or rural areas. Changes in the system of imposing fines would ensure greater collection.  For example, we could adopt an attachment to earnings provision or collect fines in weekly or monthly instalments.  I am examining the matter in the Department and I hope to have proposals by the autumn to deal with it.  Such changes would reduce considerably the number of gardaí involved in fine collection at present.</P>

Will she agree that this is an aspect of duty that gardaí should have no part in? Will the Minister accept that those 100 gardaí would be better employed in either preventing crime or catching criminals?</P>
      <P>On other methods of collection, has the Minister examined procedures in other countries? Is she aware that in Northern Ireland the instalment procedure is in operation?  Is she aware of the possibility of putting an attachment order on earnings or social welfare payments? Can we get action from the Minister to end what is a scandalous waste of Garda time?</P>

      <P>As a result of examining figures for non-collection of fines, I initiated in the Department a review of the system of fine payments. We examined procedures across the water, in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. Deputies Gilmore, O'Donnell and Mitchell made representations and recommendations in the course of debates on the Justice Estimate and so on as to what might be done to improve the position.  I am anxious that those improvements be introduced and I hope to be in a position in the autumn to make recommendations to the House in respect of changes that would bring about a <Col N="1808" /> major improvement in the collection of fines.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that approximately 14 per cent of all committals to prison are for non-payment of fines, although at any given time only 2 per cent of the prison population is made up of persons who have failed to pay fines? Does Deputy O'Keeffe not have a point in that the time of gardaí and prison officers is taken up with a system which should have a proper collection procedure from the initial stages and, in the case of default, assets seized? In other words, for non-payment of a TV licence, a television should be confiscated.  Would it not be more beneficial to have this work carried out by sheriffs or an independent agency? I have always found the Garda to be humane in cases of poverty or changes in people's circumstances.  We must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water when making changes.  I am glad the Minister is reviewing this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell put his finger on the issue involved. We cannot change the system overnight if it will impose further penalties on people. People are not sent to prison for non-payment of fines, they are sent for breaching a court order.  While the Deputy is correct in saying that less than 2 per cent of the prison population at any time are there for breach of court orders, I am sure all Members would prefer if such people were not in prison for breach of a court order relating to non-payment of a debt or fine.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Garda operate a humanitarian system and we do not wish to replace that system with one which will do the opposite.  We have examined procedures in other countries and we want to introduce a system which will ensure that fines are paid into the State's coffers and at the same time releases precious prison spaces for criminals we want in prison.</P>

Will she also agree that &ldquo;domestic violence&rdquo; should include domestic violence between spouses in the travelling community?  Will she agree there has been a tendency in the past for those who work with the travelling community to gloss over the high incidence of violence between husbands and wives in the travelling community in an effort to protect their distinct identity?

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the travelling community should not be treated any differently from members of any other community.  Therefore, domestic violence among the travelling community is treated in the same way by the Garda as in any other part of the community.  We have set up a woman and child unit in Harcourt Square for the specific purpose of setting out clear guidelines to gardaí throughout the country on how they should handle, deal with and bring to prosecution instances of domestic violence. The guidelines have been drawn up and issued to gardaí in all divisions.  I believe the guidelines will be extremely effective.  Specific gardaí have been trained in this area and there is now a cohesive and a co-ordinated approach to the manner in which members of the Garda Síochána from high to low ranks treat instances of domestic violence.  I have no evidence that the Garda treat domestic violence in the travelling community any differently and the guidelines make it clear that domestic violence is domestic violence wherever it occurs.</P>

Will she agree that the normal refuge centres provided for women are not accessible to women in the travelling community and that a <Col N="1811" /> special effort needs to be made to facilitate those women by informing them there is a place they can go? They should know it is illegal for their husbands to beat them.  An education process needs to be put in place and specific measures introduced to empower women in the travelling community to resist such beating, which in many cases has been accepted from one generation to the next as normal.</P>

It is something I will raise directly with the Minister for Health and I am sure he, in turn, will be delighted to raise it with the health boards, who in most cases operate such refuges.

I do not suggest 90 per cent of prisoners are on sleeping tablets, I do not know the percentage but I ask the Minister to arrange for statistics to be kept to determine if there is a problem in this area.  With the best will in the world people can slip into practices and follow those which may have been used in the past.  I ask that machinery be put in place so that such information can be made available to Members as this matter has been raised by two other Deputies who have tabled questions today.

      <P>The difficulty about doing what Deputy Mitchell requests, which is probably a good thing, is that because those matters are confidential between the doctor and the patient, the patient's consent is required before such statistical information could be kept.  It would be similar to the relationship between a doctor and a patient who is not a prisoner which must be confidential.  We must have confidence in the professional competence of the prison doctors that they will only prescribe sleeping tablets as and when, in their professional judgment, they are required by the prisoner concerned.</P>

I would be concerned if there is difficulty in this area.  I am not raising concerns, I am looking for information and I am concerned it is not available.  Without interfering with the doctor-patient relationship some system should be found to compile statistics in general and we should know whether 10, 20, 40 or 80 per cent of prisoners take sleeping tablets on a regular basis.

Will she agree that this is linked to the fact that 80 per cent of prisoners in Mountjoy do nothing all day but wait for their next fix? There is no incentive for them to take part in any of the available activities. Will the Minister undertake to review the question of incentives for prisoners, particularly those in Mountjoy, to take up some of the options which are available by way of work, recreation or education? Would she agree with remarks made recently at the Garda conference and at the prison officers' conference that it is humane to leave prisoners in a situation where they are just walking around in a state of intoxication?</P>

      <P>The review has been in progress for some time.  It has been completed and the report is almost ready for publication.  In the course of the debate on that review there <Col N="1815" /> will be an opportunity for all Members to give their views and, perhaps, recommend changes.  One of the points looked at carefully in that review is the question of drugs and drug dependency among prisoners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise Deputy Doyle has a question on the Adjournment this evening and I am, therefore, deeply appreciative of the courtesy she has extended to me in adding it to the question tabled by Deputy De Rossa, Leader of Democratic Left, and Deputy Gilmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputies' dismay at the prospect of disruption of freight and passenger services from Friday next on B &amp; I routes.  The consequences for Irish exporters and for the travelling public at this peak time are unacceptable.  It will be damaging to the public interest, to the <Col N="1816" /> interests of B &amp; I and its work force and to Dublin port.</P>
    <P>Let me make it abundantly clear at the outset that neither I nor my Department has a role in industrial relations matters in B &amp; I which operates within the private sector.  I have not been requested by either side in this dispute to intervene at this time, nor would I consider it appropriate to do so.  The well-tried and tested procedure of the Labour Relations Commission and Labour Court are available through which resolutions can and should be pursued without delay and I strongly urge unions and management in the B &amp; I to utilise the existing machinery in the interests of resolving the impasse which has, regrettably, been reached and which does not sit well with commitments by the social partners to promote industrial harmony under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>The dispute revolves around manning levels which were the subject of a 1992 Labour Court agreement.  I do not intend to comment at this remove on the specifice of that issue which is for negotiation between unions and management at the B &amp; I.  I do not have a remit in regard to industrial relations negotiations as Minister for the Marine.  That role may lie elsewhere.  In the meantime there is machinery apparent to everybody that can be used in bringing about a speedy resolution of this problem.</P>
    <P>Reflective of my responsibility for shipping policy generally, I should like to bring a number of highly relevant and positive developments to the attention of Deputies which make imminent disruption of services all the more unsatisfactory and difficult to accept.  It is vitally important that Deputies are fully informed of the very positive developments taking place in the overall context of a shipping imports policy.  These developments are highly relevant to the concerns which apparently underlie the present dispute.  Further progress on these initiatives and the positive climate in which they are taking place would be undoubtedly put at risk in a situation of industrial unrest and paralysis of services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> The following initiatives are being advanced in full consultation with SIPTU and other relevant interests.  A comprehensive strategic review of shipping policy is underway in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government.  The objective is to enable Irish shipping companies to meet interpolicy is under way in line with the compromising on safety.  The intention is to ensure the maintenance and creation of employment in the sector and to facilitate productive investment to modernise and expand the fleet.  I have invited the unions to participate fully in the review of shipping policy and substantive discussions are now under way on the issues involved.  I have also indicated my willingness to meet with representatives of SIPTU at an early date.  In that context pre-arranged discussions between Department officials and SIPTU will take place on 17 June which will, <i>inter alia,</i> prepare the ground for this meeting. SIPTU has been informed of a recent Government decision involving a strategy which secures B &amp; I's position at Holyhead, including a major investment in a new dedicated terminal where the Government will act as guarantor of a satisfactory arrangement.  This development is part of a scheme aimed at parallel and complementary enhancement of the ferry terminals of Dublin port and Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The 1991 agreement with the unions when B &amp; I was privatised will also be examined with all interested parties to determine how expressed concerns about subseqeunt developments in B &amp; I may be met in the context of shipping and economic policies generally.</P>
    <P>In short, there is a substantive commitment to advancing the interests of the shipping sector through a collective process of dialogue, review and planning.  A conducive atmosphere for that dialogue is essential to this process and is in the best interest of workforce and management alike not just in B &amp; I but throughout the sector.</P>
    <P>My door is open to unions and management alike on all matters of shipping policy.  We have set the agenda for <Col N="1818" /> dialogue and constructive review which is now under way.  Closed doors elsewhere are not in the interests of the overall objectives for the sector which are shared by the Government, myself and the social partners.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that neither I nor the Department has any role to play in industrial relations matters in the B &amp; I which operates within the private sector.  I have not been requested to intervene, nor have my services been sought in this dispute and if they were sought it would be inappropriate for me to intervene in the circumstances of my remit and role as already stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that if this strike takes place it will seriously disrupt the tourism season and the holiday plans of many Irish citizens who may have planned to travel by B &amp; I? I appreciate his comments about not intervening directly in the industrial relations dispute but will he agree that management of B &amp; I have been precipitate in posting notices cancelling sailings from next Friday which, given the sensitive nature of the dispute about to take place, will fuel the problem and add to the disruption the dispute may cause? While the Minister may not have a role in the industrial relations issues involved, as Minister for the Marine he most certainly has a role in the wider issues involved in this dispute which relate to the nature of employment in shipping. Since its privatisation this company has operated a deliberate policy of job shedding and reducing well paid and secure employment in a shipping company to a form of Third World flag of convenience &ldquo;hire one day, gone the next&rdquo; employment, which now seems to be the favoured practice not only of B &amp; I but of other carriers on the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point about damaging the tourism season, a strike in the manner intended in any company that caters for up to 10,000 ferry passengers and 100 trucks a day would have a significant <Col N="1819" /> effect on tourism and trade.  On the issue of management, it would be inappropriate for me as Minister for the Marine to comment on that matter.  I understand the Deputy's concern about what he describes as the precipitate posting of notices.  That is a matter for negotiation and reconciliation between the unions and management in the first instance and there may be a breakdown in that regard.</P>
      <P>On the suggestion that maritime policy is part of the core problem in this area, I have a role in maritime policy and I am begining to formulate such a policy.  This is a matter about which I am concerned and which I am addressing.  On the flags of convenience, there is need for safety in shipping at all costs.  Some ships have crews which cannot communicate with one another due to a language difficulty and that is one of the areas I will be examining.  I will also be examining the question of Irish people employed on ships travelling from this island.  That is a very important matter which will be considered in the context of discussions that are about to begin in the first instance between the Department of the Marine officials and SIPTU and possibly in the not too distant future with the company concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take up where Deputy Gilmore left off without covering the same ground.  I am a little concerned that the Minister has not been requested to intervene in the dispute but I am even more concerned about his comment that it would be inappropriate for him to do so.  With respect, I beg to differ on that point.  Is the Minister aware of an agreement signed on 16 December 1991 by his colleague, the then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications who at the time had responsibility for B &amp; I, which accepted that the Government would have a pivotal role to play?  I suggest the Minister has a role in this matter and I urge him to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the chaos that will loom on the Rosslare and Dublin routes if a complete cancellation <Col N="1820" /> of services in the face of industrial action goes ahead this weekend.  As the B &amp; I caters for 10,000 passengers and 100 trucks a day at the height of the tourist season, the other ferry companies could not take up the slack.  The good name of Irish shipping, access transport and the tourism industry is at stake and the Minister suggeests he has no role to play. Without apportioning blame to SIPTU and the B &amp; I unions and their failure to act on the 1992 Labour Court agreement, or to management, I am unhappy about many of the present practices.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in view of the Government having signed the 1991 agreement at the time of the B &amp; I privatisation to the ICG group, to honour that commitment and adopt a pivotal role in terms of protecting employment and the ships on our register.  He should immediately become involved in this matter.  The Minister is by nature diplomatic, not combative, and he could have a very important role to play in bringing all sides together.  We do not rule out the Labour Court but the Minister should not rule out his own intervention either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for the confidence she may have in me.  On the pivotal role agreement of 12 December 1991, that agreement was signed by the then Minister and I am not certain that Ministers in a new administration, although it is of the same colour, are necessarily bound by agreements made on a different occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of honour, I will be glad to consider the matter, and that is what I am doing.  It is in the pipeline and I will not run away from my responsibilities.  I do not believe I have an industrial relations role, nor would that be appropriate.  The parties have not invited me to participate and, if so invited, I do not think it would be appropriate to do so because there are mechanisms that should be addressed in advance of the intervention of a Minister. I do not think I would be the appropriate Minister.</P>
      <P>On the question of damage to tourism, there is a very serious problem.  We are about to begin what I think will be a record tourist season and we are once more causing hardship and chaos in our services.  This will impact on visitors travelling to and from this island.  I do not think this is acceptable because visitors caught up in such a situation will probably never want to return to Ireland.  That is one of the unfortunate aspects of what happens during strikes of this type.  I make a strong plea to SIPTU and B &amp; I to resolve this dispute urgently in their own interests and that of the country. That is as far as I can and will go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;coming in here with an agreement which he said he had secured from the trade unions which would guarantee routes, protect employment and so on.  It was certainly represented to this House that the agreement would be honoured by future Governments and this Minister is the inheritor of that agreement, which covered issues at the centre of this dispute. I appeal to the Minister for the Marine to honour that agreement.  It is disturbing to hear him say he is disposed to welsh on the agreement that was made with the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>Will the Minister state whether he intends to honour that agreement and involve himself with a view to honouring that agreement and protecting employment and routes which are at the centre of this dispute?</P>
      <P>There is a third dimension to the dispute &mdash; it is not a simple industrial relations issue between a trade union and a private company.  There is the guarantee that was given and the agreement that was reached between the then Government and the trade unions.</P>

If there is a prospect that the Minister can offer short term assurances &mdash; I am not sure there is &mdash; I appeal to him to do so.  I realise that the Minister is in the process of drawing up a wide-ranging maritime policy, and I am not asking him to compromise it, but is there potential for short term assurances that would offer a prospect that would diminish the level of confrontation and allow both sides to seek to resolve their differences in a more temperate way?</P>

Several initiatives are being advanced in full consultation with SIPTU and other relevant interests. There is a comprehensive strategic review of shipping policy under way in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

Deputies Dukes, Doyle, Gilmore and Fitzgerald will realise that there are mechanisms available to the parties in dispute which they have not sought to operate.  I think that is the route they should go down.  I am not in the business of interventionism and if there were to be an intervention it might come from some other ministerial colleague.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In his initial response to our questions the Minister indicated that the shipping policy review would have among its terms of reference the role required to maintain and create employment. The Minister will recall points made in Deputy Gilmore's supplementary questions.  I share the concern about B &amp; I employing non-national crews.  If we are to maintain and create employment in the shipping industry will the Minister make a start and not begin the review with a major loss in employment, which is what we will face if the threatened chaos goes ahead on the Dublin and Rosslare routes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister honour the spirit and letter of this agreement, a copy of which I have in my hand, which was signed by his colleague, the then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, who had responsibility for B &amp; I?  Will he ensure that the spirit and the letter of that agreement is honoured? It will come as a major shock to the B &amp; I group of unions to learn that the Minister does not feel bound by this agreement. <Col N="1825" /> What good is an agreement wrought in the face of difficult debate, as this was, to buy peace after the privatisation of the B &amp; I line if some years later it can be thrown aside because a general election has been held since?  Was it not almost like a confidence trick on the group of unions in 1991 if this agreement has such little use?</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged in the agreement that ICTU and the B &amp; I group of unions have a pivotal role to play in ensuring that pledges by ICG are fulfilled.  Accordingly, they have sought a specific undertaking from the Minister that he will uphold the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of this agreement, reached and signed by the Minister's colleague, between the B &amp; I unions and ICG, will he prompt a sitting around the table today and, if necessary, using the industrial relations machinery that has yet to be used?  Given that the Minister promised to play a pivotal role, I ask him to act as a catalyst in preventing Friday's industrial action and the withdrawal of all ships from the Dublin and the Rosslare routes.  I ask him to bring all parties together today so as to allow both sides to pull back from the threatened industrial action.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;50.&mdash;Notwithstanding any provisions of this Part of the Bill, the Authority may set out regulations which will allow for the sale of bookmaker's pitches at racecourses so that authorised bookmakers with course-betting representative permits with not less than two years experience or service on racecourses, shall be able to purchase them freely.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new section on bookmaking <Col N="1879" /> to allow the sale of bookmakers pitches at racecourses to certain categories of permit holders.  While the proposal would appear to have merit I did not intend that this Bill should be so intrusive into how the betting regime is organised on racecourses.  This is primarily a matter between the racecourses and the bookmakers in the first instance. Of course, because the type of betting that takes place affects the levy and the service to the punter, the Authority becomes involved.</P>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to closely examine section 53.  This envisages agreement between racecourses and bookmakers on a whole range of issues relating to betting and the Authority bringing in regulations governing those areas.  I suggest it is in those regulations that any rules on the sale of bookmaker pitches should be specified and I will give a commitment to ask the Authority to examine this, taking into account the Deputy's views on the matter, when drafting the regulations. On the above grounds, however, I oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  He is basically saying that there will be another day to go further in relation to bookmakers' permits and pitches at racecourses.  This is a vexed question.  I understand that bookmakers' pitches &mdash; certainly in some of the top racecourses &mdash; can sell from £60,000 to over £100,000 at the top of the line, yet the racecourses get as little as £1,100 out of a £100,000 sale.  The racecourses are providing the means for bookmakers to earn their living.  This issue needs further examination and I wonder if Deputy Power has anything to add from his personal experience.  If pitches are to be sold for such sums of money the racecourses, and the racing industry, should benefit to a greater degree than they apparently do at present.  I accept bookmakers find it difficult to make a living and are struggling to survive.  There are some high flyers at the top of the line, the big names that we all know, but the bookmakers in the <Col N="1880" /> middle are making an average living and no more.</P>
      <P>I do not pretend to have much experience in this regard.  My colleague, Deputy Yates, is much better qualified to talk about it and, perhaps, this can be debated more fully on another occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 27, line 6, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in the event of the authorised racecourses and the authorised bookmakers failing to reach agreement&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments refer to section 53 which deals with regulations in relation to authorised bookmakers.  The opening sentence in the section, as amended in Committee, reads: &ldquo;Subject to this section, the Authority may, by regulations, provide&rdquo;.  There then follows a list of provisions that the Authority may make in relation to bookmakers and various aspects of their operations at racecourses. Amendment No. 27 states: after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in the event of the authorised racecourses and the authorised bookmakers failing to reach agreement&rdquo;. I am not ruling out the involvement or even interference of the Authority in organising bookmaking at racecourses but the Authority should only become involved if the racecourses and the bookmakers cannot sort matters out.  At present, racecourses and bookmakers manage extremely well in organising their affairs to their mutual benefit. Maybe the racecourses do not feel that they are getting all they should.  Nevertheless there is agreement at present and there has never been need for an arbitrator. I would like the role of the Authority to be that of arbitrator in the event of racecourses and bookmakers failing to reach agreement rather than having its <Col N="1881" /> finger in every pie and involved in every aspect of racing.</P>
    <P>Amendment No.  27 in my name requests that only &ldquo;in the event of the authorised racecourses and the authorised bookmakers failing to reach agreement&rdquo; the Authority can, by regulation, make various agreements.  That is a reasonable amendment.  The Minister has not been generous in accepting amendments from this side and I urge him to see the good common sense in this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh) Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with amendments Nos. 27, 28, 29 and 30. Amendment No. 27 would have the effect that if the racecourses and bookmakers reach agreement on any or all of the items listed in subsection (1) the Authority could not make regulations governing those matters.  There are a number of significant items in that subsection on admission charges for bookmakers, activities of bookmakers at authorised racecourses, betting services on course generally, facilities to be provided for bookmakers at racecourses and the possibility of the introduction of betting offices on courses.  Given the importance of revenue to the Authority from that betting it would not be reasonable to remove from them all power to regulate this area.  They should, when making regulations, take into consideration whatever the racecourses and bookmakers would, in agreement, propose. This is provided for in section 53 (3) where the Authority is obliged to have regard to any such agreement.  I will recommend to the Authority that they take full account of any agreement as soon as practicable after it is reached.</P>
      <P>It is proposed in amendment No. 28 that the Authority should not have power to regulate for the persons who may be admitted to or allowed place bets at on course betting offices.  In the case of high street betting offices the persons admitted are limited by age under the Betting Act.  It is important that young people of 14 or 15 years going to the races would not be encouraged into serious betting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 propose to delete the control of opening hours of betting offices.  These are restricted from admission of the public to the race fixture to one hour after the last race.  This is necessary because the opening hours of the betting premises on the high street are severely restricted.  They are until 6 p.m. in the evening and are closed on Sundays.  An exemption is being allowed because of the direct association of betting activity with the sport of horseracing. The extended hours in the evenings and on Sundays must be limited to the event which is taking place.  Any further liberalisation would involve amending the Betting Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposal in amendment No. 29 to delete section 53 (3), I am sure the Deputy is proposing this in the context of amendment No. 27.</P>

If a person comes into a betting shop and watches a race for ten minutes it is regarded, under the Act, as loitering.  It is illegal to hang newspapers on the wall or results in the window.  The Act needs to be updated. Which Minister is responsible for that?</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister did not see fit to accept my amendment.  This is nationalisation of horseracing.  The establishment of this new political Authority is being taken one step too far if it feels it needs to have its finger in all pies. The Minister referred to section 53 (3) &mdash; where the Authority proposes to make regulations it may have regard to any agreement between authorised racecourses and authorised bookmakers.  He said the Authority would be obliged to take into account any agreement between racecourses and bookmakers, which <Col N="1883" /> could be very important in the future.  Is the Minister agreeable to changing the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; so that it reads &ldquo;shall have regard&rdquo;?  Perhaps then we would be closer to what I am trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point about the Betting Act, 1931, and the provisions for extending betting on course for up to an hour after the last race.  This raises the question of the crazy situation that exists regarding off course bookmaker shops. How quickly will the Minister bring amending legislation before the House to extend opening hours to facilitate Sunday and evening racing now enjoyed in the UK and by Irish punters who leave their money with UK bookmakers?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposes to amend section 54 (1) (b) (i) which provides that the rate of levy on bets is 5 per cent or such other percentage as the Authority, with the consent of the Minister may, from time to time, prescribe.  That is not a proper way to set a rate of levy for bets.  I wonder what Deputy Power thinks about it in his heart of hearts.  I do not think we should give the Authority, with the consent of the Minister, the ability to fix a levy of this kind which is nothing more than a form of taxation.  It is part of our tax system.  People might wish that were otherwise but it is a tax to raise revenue for purposes which will be decided by other people.  It is out of order to provide that an Authority of this kind shall be empowered to raise a tax even if it is to benefit activities that come under its <Col N="1884" /> aegis.  There is no other case as far as I am aware where we allow anyone the discretion to raise a levy of this kind, even with the consent of the Minister. We should look at this under our tax system and that is why the amendment provides that the rate should be varied from time to time as may be prescribed in legislation.  This is not a power we should give to the Authority.  I do not cast aspersions on the Minister or any future Minister but it is not appropriate to do it in that way.  It should be done by way of legislation and that is why I tabled this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy presented a strong case.  It is only in the last few years that Britain has done away with the levy or tax on the tracks.  All one has to do is watch Channel 4 to hear John McCrirrick advising people to come racing and telling them they will not have to pay any tax.  For many years illegal betting on tracks was a problem in Ireland.  The Authority would be the first body to recognise the extent of illegal betting on tracks and would know the rate of levy to apply.  I do not have any great problem with the Authority fixing the rate as it is very familiar with what is going on in the industry.  At the end of the day the Authority has to get funds from somewhere and most punters do not mind paying the tax once everyone is paying it.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 31 proposes to discontinue the now long established practice of allowing the State body in the horse racing sector to decide the rate of levy to be charged on on-course betting subject to the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry of the day.  The Authority will receive the proceeds from the levy and will be responsible for the use of the revenues to develop the industry.  It is approprate that the Authority should be allowed to decide the best rate to apply so as to bring in the greatest revenues without adversely affecting attendance at meetings. Requiring the Authority to get the consent of the Minister of the day will be sufficient safeguard, and it has worked well up to now.  I do not propose any change in the present arrangements and oppose the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has great trust in future Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and I would be surprised if it were otherwise.  Having been a Minister for Agriculture, I am somewhat more sceptical about Ministers for Agriculture and, if it comes to it, Ministers for Finance.  I am disappointed the Minister has taken the view which he has and <Col N="1886" /> am astonished that Deputy Power takes the view that he does.  Deputy Power's statement is a classic state of turkeys voting for Christmas.  If he is purporting to represent the views of those in the business I am afraid they will get a very lukewarm response in future from Ministers for Agriculture, Ministers for Finance and anybody else if they complain about the rate of the on-course betting levy.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the levy is being applied in this inappropriate way.  It would not have cost the Minister anything to accept my amendment.  All it would require is two or three more minutes debate during the debate on the Finance Bill each year. This matter could be properly handled in that context as it would be in its proper place.  I regret the Minister favours the continuing direct involvement of the Minister for Agriculture in taxation policy, something he should not be occupying himself with at all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 29, to delete lines 4 to 14 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) The rate charged by the Authority shall be the short term `single A' rate charged for the time being to borrowers by the commercial banks plus 2 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be a little more open-minded on this issue.  I am not sure if he fully understands that what he has provided for in the Bill is nothing less than extortion.  We are talking about an interest charge to be imposed on bookmakers who have not paid the levy due or made proper returns to the Authority in respect of such a levy or both for a period of one month.  Deputy Power would do well to listen to my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> If for any reason, whether it is good or bad or through negligence, carelessness or simple error, a bookmaker fails to make returns for more than a month under section 54 (4) (b) (i) the Authority may charge interest on the amounts overdue at the appropriate percentage rate, which is supposed to be linked to currently prevailing interest rates, of 15 per cent per annum.  I do not know if Members who also happen to be bookmakers have to fund their payments of levy by borrowing, but they would have to be running their business very badly if they had to pay an interest rate of 15 per cent to any of the banks which we all love to hate so much these days even for that kind of accommodation.  The rate proposed is nothing less than extortion and the Minister has not put forward any good reason for charging an interest rate of that kind.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes that the rate to be charged by the Authority of overdue amounts should be the short term single A rate charged for the time being to borrowers by the commercial banks plus 2 per cent.  Today that rate would be less than 15 per cent.  There were times when that formula was considerably less than 15 per cent and we all hope there will be many times in the future when the single A rate plus 2 per cent formula will be considerably below 15 per cent and will stay below it for a long time.</P>
    <P>If amounts are overdue it is entirely appropriate that the Authority should be able to recover some interest on them; after all the Authority will have things to do with the money and will have to rely on a fairly constant and predictable flow of money.  It is appropriate that the Authority should be able to charge interest on what is after all akin to a normal commercial contract debt and to charge interest on overdue amounts in the same way as other creditors.  However, to say in one subsection that the rate of interest to be charged by the Authority shall have regard to the level of interest rates generally in the State and to literally say in the next breath that the rate shall be 15 per cent is outrageous.  One can argue in <Col N="1888" /> favour of the Authority having regard to the level of interest rates in the State, but it is proposed that the penalty rate should be pitched as high above those as one can get away with.</P>
    <P>The formula proposed in the amendment, the single A rate plus 2 per cent, is rather high.  The single A rate charged by the commercial banks is the highest in the grid of normal daily commercial lending in which they indulge.  There is a certain amount of pain involved in that and it is reasonable to charge something over and above that figure, and we have suggested that it should be 2 per cent.  To state baldly that the rate of interest shall be 15 per cent per annum is outrageous. I ask the Minister to omit that and to insert the provision in amendment No. 32.  It should not be our business, in making a provision of the kind contained in section 54 (4), to impose such a harsh penalty on people that they are likely to be put out of business.  The rate we propose already includes a certain element of penalty and does so far more reasonably than is contained in the Bill.  I anticipate that the Minister will say there might be times&mdash;or that there were times in the not too distant past &mdash; when the &ldquo;single A&rdquo; rate plus 2 per cent would have amounted to more than 15 per cent. If the Minister uses the same logic he used yesterday, I suppose in the next 50 years those circumstances might recur although we all hope they will not.  If they do the levy payable by on course bookmakers on amounts overdue to the Authority will be one of the last things we will worry about.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment as being a much more reasonable way of doing the job than this section sets out to do.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance he became champion of bookmakers when he reduced the off-course levy from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, so I am delighted to see him batting for them here again today.  He makes a very good case since the provision in the Bill appears to be very harsh and hard to <Col N="1889" /> justify.  I will quote section 54 (4) (a) which reads:</P>
      <P>Where a bookmaker is found not to have paid levy due or not to have made proper returns to the Authority in respect of such levy or both for a period of one month, the Authority may make an assessment of levy due and may charge interest at an appropriate rate .......... [in this case 15 per cent].</P>
      <P>Section 54 (2) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>An authorised bookmaker who fails or neglects to pay any sum payable by him in respect of a levy may have any permit granted to him under section 48 suspended or revoked by the Authority.</P>
      <P>Therefore, bookmakers will do their best to ensure that the levy is paid.  Of its very nature it is a difficult game, bookmakers have good times and bad and many fall on hard times.</P>

It is unreasonable <Col N="1890" /> to add a penal rate of interest to money a bookmaker may be making a genuine effort to pay because, as Deputy Power said, on occasions bookmakers can be hit by, dare I say it, a Flashman type of coup. Deputy Power knows what coups are. The reality is that if the Minister happened to encounter a bookmaker who fell on bad times in his constituency, possibly that bookmaker would be petitioning him to intervene on his behalf to the Revenue Commissioners or the Racing Board.

      <P>The purpose of this section is to ensure that the Authority is not used as a banker for short term borrowing through delays in payment of the levy.  Therefore, it should be taken in conjunction with section 54 (4) (a) which stipulates that where a bookmaker is found not to have paid the levy due then the Authority may charge interest.  If a bookmaker, for a reason of a transitory nature, is not able to pay, it is not the intention to penalise that bookmaker but a person who decides to use the Authority as a banker.  In addition, under the provisions of section 54 (4) (ii) the Authority may vary the rate of interest &ldquo;so standing specified and this section shall have effect in accordance with the terms of any such regulations&rdquo;.  The Authority may charge the rate of interest and vary it.  The overall object is to ensure that bookmakers do not use the Authority as a banker.  For that reason the rate must be higher than that charged by the banks. Of course, the ideal position is that this rate would never be levied, that all bookmakers would pay the levy when due. Section 54 (4) (b) (ii) allows the 15 per cent rate to be changed simply by regulation with the consent of the Minister. I consider that satisfactory.  There are dangers of inserting in legislation an exact amount, and rates of interest to be charged by a particular part of the banking sector, as these may be restructured so that over time the references could become inappropriate.  For that reason, <Col N="1891" /> I oppose the amendment as being unnecessary.</P>

      <P>Just on a point of information, we spoke last evening about natural justice.  Where is the natural justice in the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; when one bookmaker could be charged a different levy from another?  Why should that be?  Can the Minister not accept Deputy Dukes's definite proposal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGahon's question was fair.  The Minister's response is not just nonsense but doubly nonsense. If the Minister is relying on the flexibility contained in section 54 (4) (b) (ii) I would have to ask why in God's name is that section included?  Second, it is nonsense for the Minister to argue, as Deputy McGahon said, that the &ldquo;may&rdquo; contained in section 54 (4) (a) provides an option for the Authority because, as sure as God made little apples, if bookmakers, as a body, find out that some of them are being charged interest on overdue amounts and others are not, there will be the father and mother of a row, and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has just stated in much more eloquent terms than I ever could that section 54 (4) is absolute, utter, patent nonsense.  It will be an administrative nightmare if the Minister thinks it will be used in the manner he says and he is a wee bit disingenuous.  We are all used in this House to Ministers defending their Bills on Committee and Report Stages, arguing with the Opposition about the difference between the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Sometimes Ministers say &ldquo;may&rdquo; means almost the same thing as &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  An odd time a Minister comes in, like this Minister, and says it means a very different thing from &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The trouble is this Minister is saying that <Col N="1892" />&ldquo;may&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in circumstances where it would create chaos. Is the Minister really telling us that the Authority will sit down solemnly and say, for example, that Deputy Seán Power is a bookmaker who owes them money for the past six weeks and must not be allowed to use the levy as a bank loan and that they will zap him 15 per cent, while Deputy Brendan McGahon who, for the sake of argument, is also a bookmaker owes them money for the past three months but is known to have had back trouble recently and has hospital bills to pay so they will not charge him interest?  That is absolute nonsense.  If the Minister is saying that the Authority will carry out its business in that way I am tempted to tell him that it would be as well if he threw up the Bill altogether and started all over again.  To tell us that a penal level of charges such as this is justified, that it will be optional for the Authority and that the authority can change it at any time it wishes is putting before us what can only be described as a dog's dinner.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the debate on the amendment and with particular interest to what the Minister has said.  The amendment and the section are not of central importance; they apply only to bookmakers and are of importance only to them.  I suggest that even bookmakers are entitled to simple justice and that this House should not pass a section or a subsection that clearly is deficient.  Section 54 (4) (a) provides that the Authority may charge interest to bookmakers who are in default.  It goes on to provide that it may charge interest at an appropriate rate from the day on which any such levy became due and in doing so the Authority shall have regard to the level of interest rates generally in the State.  That would be fair enough if it stopped there.  Having told them that they should have regard to the level of interest rates generally in the State, the next subparagraph states that it shall be 15 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as of June 1994. The following subparagraph gives the Authority the right to vary the rate.  If 15 per cent is defined as the appropriate rate, having regard to the level of interest rates generally in the State, it can only go up.  Interest rates today are the lowest in about 20 years.  I do not think any financial or economic commentator has forecast any significant drop from now on.  Rates have bottomed out.  If the appropriate rate when interest rates are at their lowest is 15 per cent, then the variation clause given to the Authority can, in practice, only be exercised upwards, if it is to be exercised in accordance with the spirit of this subsection. That is entirely wrong.</P>
      <P>I question this subsection on two other grounds.  One is the startling statement by the Minister that the Authority may arbitrarily charge some bookmakers and may not charge others.  This is essentially a taxing section.  The subsection, if passed in this form, is open to challenge on the grounds that you cannot operate in this way.  Where a quango, such as this Authority, made up of appointed individuals, can arbitraily decide whether somebody is charged thousands of pounds in interest or whether he is absolved of it.  The subsection is open to challenge.</P>
      <P>It is also open to challenge in that under subsection (4) (b) (ii) the Authority is allowed to vary the rate.  As I have said, it will only vary the amount upwards because the present rates are the lowest in the past 20 years.  The Authority is being given power to impose the equivalent of taxation.  We cannot give a quango such power.  Only this House can increase tax.  The subsection is not of importance to anyone other than bookmakers but they too are entitled to justice. If they are to be taxed they cannot be taxed in an arbitrary way where some will be required to pay and others will not if they are friendly with the members of the Authority.  The Authority should not be entitled to fix, in effect, the rate of taxation that defaulting bookmakers will pay; only this House can fix the tax. The Minister should think very seriously about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> The only fault I have with the amendment in the names of Deputies Doyle and Dukes is that the rate they propose instead of the 15 per cent is too high.  The single A rate plus 2 per cent which they propose instead of the 15 per cent is too high.  Why charge 2 per cent above the single A rate, which is the highest borrowing rate in the State other than short term bridging finance?  There may be a time when the single A rate plus 2 per cent would be higher than the 15 per cent penal rate.  We witnessed such a situation some years ago and we may, unfortunately, witness it again.</P>
    <P>There is more to this subsection than the rather minor function which the Minister suggests to prevent bookmakers using what they owe to the Authority as a loan or working capital.  You cannot stop people defaulting by allowing somebody arbitrarily to charge whatever they like against certain people and not against others.  It is particularly important that it should not happen where the Authority is made up of people who will be appointed by the Minister.  This is a recipe for real difficulty and complaint.  It affects only bookmakers but we should not exaggerate its significance.  The seriousness of the principle involved is considerable and should not be brushed off simply because it applies only to perhaps 1,000 people.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to the debate on the amendment to which I am a co-signatory.  Confusion in relation to ministerial replies to points made is creeping into the debate.  In relation to the last amendment the Minister interpreted the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 53 (3) to mean that there would be an obligation on the Authority to take into account any agreement between the racecourses and the bookmakers.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 54 (4) where it is stated that the Authority &ldquo;may make an assessment of levy due and may charge interest at an appropriate rate&rdquo; has been interpreted by the Minister as meaning that it may apply in some cases and not in others.  There is some leeway for the Authority to decide whether to impose <Col N="1895" /> the levy depending on whether the bookmaker is a cumann card holder or went to school with them.  I do not know why &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the second instance leaves some discretion to the Authority as to whether it will proceed on the lines suggested, whereas in relation to the previous amendment the Minister has clearly put on the record that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would oblige the Authority to consult with racecourses and bookmakers.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; has crept into many subsections and sections of the Bill. This is a contentious issue.  The Minister seems to be able to interpret it in the way he sees fit.  I am not sure how it would be interpreted, legally, if any of the sections are challenged but there is confusion.  When I have suggested that he insert the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to make it more definitive the Minister has said that by including the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; the Authority will be obliged to do something; but in this instance he is saying that the Authority will not be obliged, rather that it will have discretion to decide which bookmaker will be levied with an interest charge.  There is a need for clarification.  The Minister cannot pick and choose <i>a la carte</i> because the legal people would have a field day in resolving any issues that may arise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 33, to delete lines 1 to 21 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Authority shall publish a statement of the minimum services and <Col N="1896" /> facilities to be ensured at racecourses. It shall have the right to add specific provisions or requirements in relation to any specific racecourse.  It shall also have the right to modify both the published requirements and the specific requirements for individual racecourses in the light of developments in safety standards and procedures and any other developments that impinge on the safe organisation and running of race fixtures.</P>
    <P>(4)  Application for racecourse authorisation shall be made by the executive of the racecourse concerned to the Authority and shall be in such form and contain such information as the Authority may decide.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Authority may not unreasonably refuse to grant an authorisation. An appeal shall lie from a refusal of an authorisation by the Authority to a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(6)  An authorised racecourse shall continue to be authorised unless and until the executive of that racecourse unreasonably refuses to comply with the conditions set by the Authority, as modified from time to time in accordance with subsection (3) of this section.</P>
    <P>(7)  When an Authority finds that the general and specific requirements attached to the authorisation of an authorised racecourse are not being fulfilled, it may suspend the authorisation until such time as it is satisfied that the requirements are again being met.  Where the Authority has cause to suspend the authorisation of a racecourse on two or more occasions in any period of five years, the Authority may revoke the authorisation and the racecourse in question shall cease to be an authorised racecourse.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Authority may not unreasonably suspend or revoke an authorisation.  An appeal shall lie from a suspension or revocation by the Authority to a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> (9)  An authorised racecourse (within the meaning of the Act of 1945) in existence immediately before the establishment day, shall on that day be deemed to be an authorised racecourse.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a considerable amendment to section 59, which deals with the authorisation of racecourses.  Concern has been expressed about the Minister's proposals in this regard, not least the proposal that racecourses will be authorised for a period of five years only.  Racecourses which want to undertake a capital investment programme and borrow from financial institutions to provide extra facilities and services will encounter major difficulties.  If the financial institutions realise that racecourses will be authorised for a maximum period of five years at any one time it could jeopardise the ability of racecourses to raise finance to fund badly needed capital developments.</P>
    <P>I fail to see why the Minister can authorise racecourses for a period of only five years given that the Authority will have extensive powers to revoke an authorisation, and rightly so, if a racecourse is not providing an adequate service and is not running its business in accordance with the terms laid down by the Authority. I have no difficulty with the proposal that the Authority should be given the power to revoke an authorisation provided this is done fairly and for a good reason, but once an authorisation is granted a racecourse should be allowed to retain it for a period longer than five years.  Deputy O'Malley has proposed a figure of ten years.  It should be allowed to retain it indefinitely as long as it manages its affairs in accordance with the terms laid down by the Authority; there should be no threat of non-renewal after a period of five years.  This is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>We suggest in the amendment that the Authority should publish a statement of the minimum services and facilities to be ensured at racecourses.  As long as they meet the minimum standards they should be allowed to retain the authorisation.</P>
    <P>We also suggest that the application <Col N="1898" /> for a racecourse authorisation should be made by the executive of the racecourse concerned to the Authority and contain such information as the Authority may decide, or indicate that it is fulfilling the criteria laid down, and that the Authority should not unreasonably refuse to grant an authorisation or suspend or revoke an authorisation and that the racecourse should be allowed to appeal the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction in either instance.</P>
    <P>We further suggest that an authorised racecourse in existence before the establishment day of the Authority should be deemed to be an authorised racecourse. That is acceptable.</P>
    <P>Our amendment reflects the position on the ground far better than the section in the Bill.  I am unhappy that it is proposed to limit an authorisation to a period of five years.</P>
    <P>Section 59 (5) states that the Authority may, as it sees fit, from time to time attach new terms or conditions to a racecourse authorisation.  This could be applied in a draconian fashion.  If Brezhnev was a senior steward he would be proud of this provision.  If they see fit at any time they will be able to change the rules of the game.  Adequate notice should be given to a racecourse if the criteria are to be changed or if new terms and conditions are to be attached to a racecourse authorisation. There is no way after a period of five years that one can turn around and say, particularly to the smaller racecourses, that new terms and conditions are to be attached to the authorisation. It has been decided that there is no need to tell the Authority that it must act in a fair and impartial way.  These courses may encounter greater difficulties in gaining access to funds and as a consequence they may encounter greater difficulty in complying with any new terms and conditions attached without warning to an authorisation.  We may find that smaller racecourses may not comply with new terms produced suddenly out of the hat by the Authority during an interregnum of six to 12 months.</P>
    <P>This could be used by the Authority as another weapon to close some of the <Col N="1899" /> smaller racecourses.  It could be used as a technical barrier.  Reference has been made to the law of natural justice.  I am concerned that the Authority will not be seen to have the best interests of the smaller racecourses at heart, given that it will have control over funds, fixtures and programmes.  The smaller racecourses could be squeezed if the members of the Authority were of a mind to do so. I know that some of the people who will be members of the Authority have little commitment to remote rural racecourses, which are of vital importance to the local economy.  I strongly believe that only racecourse executives should be able to decide that a racecourse should stop trading. I do not want the Authority to be given the power, overtly or otherwise, by the Minister to squeeze out some of the smaller racecourses throughout the country. I am afraid that there is a hidden agenda.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this substantial amendment tabled by Deputy Dukes and I and that the points we will make augment the Bill and will protect the interests not only of the Authority but of all the component parts of Irish racing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The system we are proposing in this amendment covers most of the concerns set out in the Bill, which seeks to give the Authority the power to add new conditions to a racecourse authorisation during the currency of that authorisation.  I can see cases where this might be necessary and we have provided for something similar in the amendment. The difference is that the amendment provides for something that is not provided for in the Bill, that is, a final court of appeal in relation to the conditions set out.  There may not often be any argument but it is as well to include a provision just in case there is.  The Minister argued yesterday on several occasions that he wanted to include provisions in the Bill just in case something may happen during the next 50 years.  In this case we can be much more specific and we have provided for the possibility of an <Col N="1900" /> appeal.  If there is a dispute between the Authority and an authorised racecourse both sides could take the case to an independent arbiter.</P>
      <P>One of the central points is that the Minister is proposing that the authorisation should last for a period of five years only.  Deputy O'Malley has proposed that it should last for ten years. That is more congenial, but I can see no reason why a term of years should be specified.  If a racecourse meets the standards initially set down by the Authority and upgrades them in accordance with developments on the safety aspects of racing fixtures, it should not have to go through the bureaucratic process of applying every five years for an authorisation. The amendment which Deputy Doyle and I tabled provides a mechanism under which we can make sure that authorisations continue in being and that racecourses are provided with the information and incitation they need to keep abreast of modern standards.  There is no reason to oblige racecourses to apply for authorisations every five years.  Deputy Doyle outlined the ill effects in respect of race course funding which could flow from that provision.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, who usually advocates bureaucratic measures, stated in a different connection some time ago, &ldquo;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&rdquo;. I heartily recommend that principle to the Minister and to the Authority in respect of racecourse authorisations.  By all means if the Authority deems it necessary to introduce a new requirement to upgrade safety aspects for people attending or running race meetings or for the the horses and jockeys, it would be necessary to reapply for an authorisation. However, it should not be necessary to go through the entire procedure every five years.</P>
      <P>The Minister may argue correctly that the procedure set out in our amendment would give rise to the need for inspection, but the same applies to the procedure set out in the Bill, unless this is totally arbitrary legislation.  Section 59 (3) provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1901" /> The Authority may where it has reasonable grounds to believe that an authorised racecourse is not complying with any term or condition of a racecourse authorisation revoke or suspend (for such period as it thinks fit) the authorisation.</P>
    <P>I object to that provision on the grounds that it does not provide for an appeals procedure.  It is entirely within the Authority's province to decide what is right and wrong and that is why our amendment provides for an appeal procedure. I object to it for another reason, namely, if we are to take that as being anything other than a purely arbitrary exercise of power by the Authority, it must have some means of finding out whether it has reasonable grounds to believe that an authorised racecourse is not complying with the terms or conditions of an authorisation. To do this it would have to appoint people to visit racecourses on a regular basis to observe the conduct at race meetings and report back to the Authority.  A reasonable Minister or Authority should provide for that.  If such people are appointed to attend race meetings, they should be instructed to say whether a racecourse is complying with the conditions of an authorisation and, if it is, it should not have to apply every five years for an authorisation. Section 59 (4) provides that:</P>
    <P>An authorised racecourse (within the meaning of the Act of 1945) in existence immediately before the establishment day shall on that day be deemed to be an authorised racecourse for a period of two years.</P>
    <P>Our amendment provides that an authorised racecourse, within the meaning of the 1945 Act, in existence immediately before the establishment day, shall continue to be an authorised racecourse unless the Authority finds it is unreasonably in breach of conditions which have been laid down.  I see evidence of the Labour Party's bureaucratic bovver boots in this measure.  The Minister has adopted the old principle of assuming people will not do what they should and <Col N="1902" /> proposes to operate the bovver boots on them every five years to make sure they are up to scratch.  I propose we operate on the basis that authorised racecourses anxious about their future will wish to remain authorised and that we should not interfere with them unreasonably unless it can be proven they are not doing their job properly.  We should operate on the basis that if something is set up and properly run it will continue to be properly run rather than on the suspicious bureaucratic basis that if we do not harry them they will not do their job properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reflect on this matter.  It would not cost any more to run the industry in the manner suggested in our amendment and it would probably cost him and the Authority less effort and money.  It would certainly be much easier on the nerves of members of executives of authorised racecourses because it would relieve them of tedious bureaucracy once every five years; they have plenty of other things about which to be concerned.  The amendment provides for the modernisation and updating of racecourses in a similar, but less heavy handed, manner to that provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably give us some palaver about not being able to accept the amendment for various reasons.  What he will actually be saying is that because this bureaucratic heavy handedness was put down on paper, he is committed to it and because we did not have an adequate debate on the matter on Committee Stage, he will not change his mind at this late stage.  That is nonsense. The Minister has had a couple of weeks to consider the amendment.  I would be disappointed, but not surprised, if a Minister who is a member of a party that claims &mdash; sometimes with justification, although it has been overtaken recently in this regard &mdash; to be the most pragmatic in Irish politics, would not operate in a useful and constructive manner on this matter rather than the way the Minister's partners in Government have operated.  Our amendment will achieve the result the Minister wants to achieve without requiring people to go through the hassle of reapplying for <Col N="1903" /> authorisations every five years and without satisfying the bureaucratic lusts of the Labour Party.  The measure provided for in our amendment is a much better way of dealing with this matter than that provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 33 would require the Authority to publish a statement of the minimum services and facilities that would be necessary for authorisation of a racecourse.  The Authority could then add specific conditions in respect of particular racecourses and modify the published or specific requirements. Those would be overly elaborate provisions to detail in legislation before the Authority has even considered what would be required for racecourses in the future.  In any event it would be difficult to detail meaningful general conditions for racecourses.  I am sure conditions would vary, depending on the type of racecourse planned, the frequency of race meetings, the type of facilities that would be suitable, the type of client one would expect in particular parts of the country and the other sporting activities in the locality with which racing would have to compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment also suggests that the Authority may not unreasonably refuse to grant an authorisation, and that goes without saying.  Neither should there be a need for the proposed appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction against the refusal of an authorisation.  The provision in the Bill obliges the Authority to grant an authorisation to racecourses that satisfy the necessary requirements.  If in those circumstances a racecourse believes it is treated unfairly it will have the normal recourse to a legal remedy without providing for special rights in this Bill.  The amendment also envisages open ended authorisations unless a racecourse ceases to comply with published or specific requirements.  Two or more suspensions for this reason would lead to a revocation of the authorisation.  I do not see the need for this elaborate system, but in the current climate where spectators and racegoers are looking for <Col N="1904" /> better facilities and the needs of horse owners and trainers are changing, there is a need to review every racecourse at least every five years.</P>

      <P>I do.  The point of amendment No. 33 in the names of Deputies Doyle and Dukes is to take some of the relative arbitrariness and uncertainty out of the authorisation of racecourses.  It is a complicated way of doing it.  I am not sure if it is the best way and if it is better than what is in place.  A simpler approach is the one I have taken in amendment No. 34, which simply substitutes a period of ten years for a period of five years for a length of an authorisation once granted.  That is perfectly reasonable because an authorisation for a short period, such as five years, will make it extremely difficult, particularly for some of the smaller and less fashionable <Col N="1905" /> racecourses, to borrow money from a bank or another institution to do necessary work because the bank or other institution may take the view that in a few years' time the racecourse may lose its authorisation.  Uncertainty should not be created for the owners or executives of racecourses in this way.  This is particularly true if this Authority, like its predecessor, the Racing Board, will continue to invest on its behalf in racecourses.</P>
      <P>There is much disquiet in Munster because of what is happening or is sought to happen in respect of a particular racecourse. The Minister had grandiose plans for it but they appear to have gone askew in some fashion.</P>

      <P>This is the third time it has been purchased or sold.  At every election it is sold again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to have gone askew and maybe it will get another rattle in 1999, but in the meantime it creates a difficult position for companies who own other courses because the owners of such courses do not know where they stand. The purchase of racecourses by the Racing Board has been at best a mixed success.  It has not been great in at least one case of which I know and I do not think it has contributed anything to that particular course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From now on there will be a conflict of interest between courses owned by the Authority and those which are not owned by it.  The position of racecourses should be clarified beyond doubt and they should not be put in the position where they will constantly be under pressure. In particular, it should not be perceived that the people who make decisions about authorisation are also those who own a number of courses on which the greatest amount of money has been spent.  That is wrong.  The Bill and, in particular, this section should reflect the undesirability of the controller or the regulator also being an owner and a commercial operator.  There is bound to be a conflict of interest.  Even where it does not exist in reality, in some instances it <Col N="1906" /> will be perceived to exist.  As a matter of principle it is wrong that a regulator should also be a commercial competitor of the people whom it licenses or regulates. That principle is fundamentally wrong and it should not be enshrined in legislation.  The authorisation of racecourses should be granted by an independent group if the Authority is a commercial operator.</P>
    <P>It would be fairly outrageous if a particular group of bookmakers were to decide who could have bookmakers' licences and who should be allowed to compete with them.  The principle, if it applied in that way, would be regarded as wrong.  It would be wrong for a small group of trainers to decide who was entitled to a trainers' licence.  The argument could be extended to any field.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to accept a principle that the commercial competitors are also the authorisers and regulators, and that is wrong.  If we are stuck with that position the least the Minister should do is remove some of the uncertainty from the privately owned courses by extending their authorisation to ten years.  If he does not do that, some of the owners of the smaller courses will experience constant tension, friction and great difficulty in trying to raise money for repairs, development, extension or improvement works to buildings and tracks.</P>
    <P>There will be pressure from a section within the Authority, the tote levy collecting section, to consider the closure of some of the smaller courses because they are losing money, which undoubtedly they are.  The Racing Board is losing money because of the extraordinarily inefficient, old-fashioned and over-staffed way it runs the tote.  It need not lose money if it ran it properly, but because it is losing money on many of the smaller courses it may suggest to its board that the Authority would be more profitable and would have more funds at its disposal if it did not have to provide a tote at some of the smaller racecourses and, therefore, it should close them.  That is wrong and the regulator should not make such a <Col N="1907" /> decision and should not be open to such a suggestion from within the Authority.</P>
    <P>If the Minister seriously wants to grapple with the difficulties I outlined, particularly with the unfairness of the regulator also being a commercial competitor, he should accept my amendment to give some limited security of tenure to those who operate racecourses and want to borrow or raise money to improve them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak to both the amendments, that in my name and in the name of Deputy O'Malley.  If this section of the Bill is left unamended the new Authority will have its integrity further compromised as has been ably expressed by Deputy O'Malley.  Given the handicaps the Authority is starting with because of the ten political appointments out of 14, if this Authority is to perform the function for Irish racing and the racing industry that we would all like it to perform, we must ensure that the legislation will not further compromise its integrity.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how the Authority can be seen to act fairly and impartially if it is also an operator of racecourses and has the final say over its competitors as to whether they are authorised.  It will not be seen to operate fairly and, in terms of the integrity of any board or body, it is as important that it is seen to be fair and impartial as it is to be fair and impartial. Often people are fair and impartial but are perceived not to be, and the perception does as much damage as the reality might.  If this Authority is to be seen to be fair and impartial, apart altogether from operating fairly and impartially &mdash; and it is questionable that it can, given the conflict of interests that arises under this section &mdash; the Minister must accept amendments to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer an open-ended authorisation of racecourses provided they meet the criteria, terms and conditions laid down by the Authority.  I see no reason to jeopardise the future of any racecourse unless it fails to meet minimum standards laid down by the Authority. I see no reason to put their ability to raise finance from financial institutions <Col N="1908" /> or any sector at risk because their authorisation is due to run out, say, in two years and they are unsure of their future after that.  We need an appeals system in this section and we referred to that in our amendment.  Above all we must not tie racecourses to five year authorisations, particularly while the same Authority which now owns three racecourses, but could own more, controls the funding released to different racecourses, controls race fixtures and race programming so, effectively, controls the future viability of all the smaller racecourses.</P>
    <P>There are five or six sections in this Bill that would allow the Authority to operate an agenda of streamlining the number of racecourses in the country perhaps because, as Deputy O'Malley suggested, the tote is unprofitable and it does not pay to cross the Shannon or to go down south or to other areas to the smaller meetings.  The Authority could decide, if they are not profitable when it comes to tote returns, to use the powers it has to rationalise the number of racecourses. That is unacceptable when the Authority can be judge and jury over direct competitors, racecourses not owned by it.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused to accept an overall governing clause for due care and consideration in relation to fairness and impartiality in the operation of this Authority in all aspects.  In the absence of an amendment to ensure fair and impartial operation of this Authority, we must ensure that each section is seen to be fair and impartial and the section as outlined in the Bill, if unamended, underlines a major conflict of interest in relation to the Authority's functions.</P>

      <P>In page 35, to delete lines 5 to 54 and in page 36, to delete lines 1 to 12.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to amend the Betting Act to allow the new horseracing authority to take out a bookmaker's licence.  We have rehearsed our arguments against extending this function to the new racing authority.  I see no good reason to extend the functions of the racing authority to allow it become involved in the bookmaking business in direct competition with the private sector.  There is no good reason for the State to act as a bookmaker.  If the experience of the Authority in operating the tote is anything to go by I would not consider, until it has had many years of successful operation of the tote, extending to it the function of bookmaker.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to review the extension of the function to the Authority.  We spent some time on this matter this morning and yesterday on Committee Stage, but I have not yet heard one good reason from the Minister for the extension of this function to the Authority.  The Moriarty Committee made this recommendation because certain components of the industry indicated that this function should be given to the Authority.  The Minister indicated that it could be 50 years before we amend this legislation again and that this is a &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; provision.  I ask him to delete this provision because it makes no sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many amendments needed to the Betting Act and while the Minister is amending that Act in this regard &mdash; I know Deputy Power will agree with me &mdash; he is not introducing amendments to allow for betting shops to remain open for evening meetings and on Sundays to <Col N="1913" /> cater for punters' needs.  The Minister is introducing an amendment to the Betting Act to facilitate the pals on the Authority in the event that they may wish to get into the bookmaking business.  The fact that he is introducing an amendment to the bookmakers Act, without introducing the necessary amendments required, is a frustration and a further indication of the huge missed opportunity that this legislation is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Doyle in that to go into opposition with the bookmakers would be madness.  The State has no function in that area.  Does the Minister know of any country where organised racing is held where the State is in competition with the bookies?  I wish to bring to the Minister's attention, as I brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance, the ludicrous position that pertains at present whereby Sky Television transmits two meetings per evening, three evenings a week, and there is a bar stool bookie in every pub where that channel is available.  Revenue is losing a huge amount of money by this practice, yet the mandarins in the various Departments have turned a blind eye to that fact.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable that racing on Sunday will come into full swing in England in the coming years.  It is highly likely that before the end of the century the Epsom Derby, and probably all other major races, including the Grand National, will be run on Sunday.  In those circumstances will the bookies remain closed here or will they open?  I believe they will open even if we do not legislate for that &mdash; some are open for evening racing at present.  The Minister should liaise with the Minister for Justice and accept the reality that racing in England is more attractive to the average punter than racing in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Wednesday evening there were fewer people at Leopardstown races than would attend a flapper meeting in west Cork.  The Minister should home in on this area and get money for the State. As Deputy Dukes knows, I am deeply concerned about this matter &mdash; it would <Col N="1914" /> grieve me enormously to know that Revenue is losing money to illegal gambling. The Minister, the Department and the Minister for Finance must come to terms with the inevitability of largescale racing on Sunday in England, with possibly four to five meetings being held on that day. To create yet another tier of bureaucracy and involve the State in opposition to bookmakers is ludicrous.  There is no such facility in any country I know, except perhaps in the Middle East.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As sections 35 and 36 envisage a company of the Authority possibly in the future, and with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Finance, holding a bookmakers licence, the Betting Act, 1931, needs to be amended to allow for that eventuality.  Subsections (1) and (2) provide for that.  Subsection (3) of section 64 excludes betting offices at racecourses, which are envisaged in section 53 of this Bill, from the register of high street premises kept by the Revenue Commissioners as the revenue from these offices will go entirely to the Authority. As the racecourses and on-course bookmakers will be regulated by the Authority it is appropriate that on-course betting offices should also be regulated by them. Section 35 allows a subsidiary of the <Col N="1915" /> Authority to hold and operate a bookmaker's licence.  If that section, which is opposed by Deputies Doyle, Dukes and O'Malley, is left unchanged, this section, which provides for the consequential amendment of the Betting Act, 1931 to allow for the issue of the licence, must also stand.  I oppose this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is verging on the provocative for the Minister to introduce this amendment to the Betting Act when the need to amend other provisions of that Act has been obvious for a long time.  If the Minister was interested in the punter he would have amended the Betting Act to ensure that High Street betting shops would remain open in the evening and on Sundays.  We must underline that point because we are out of step with consumer requirements.  The fact that the Minister could introduce an amendment to the Betting Act in this Bill to allow his pals on the Authority to run bookie shops and yet would not attack the aspects of the Betting Act that need revision speaks volumes.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment because I felt so strongly about the extension of provisions to this Authority to act as bookmakers.  I urge the Minister to see the light even at this late stage.

I want to <Col N="1917" /> carefully ensure that we end up with a balanced authority and I am concerned with equity, as I mentioned on several occasions, between various interests in the industry.  Taking account of the contributions made by various Members on the question of membership, I have decided to increase the number of members from 14 to 16.</P>
    <P>What is important is the quality of the membership and I believe that we will put in place a high quality authority well capable of giving a strong lead to the industry.  The second important element is how the Authority works.  It is critical that members see themselves not primarily as sectoral representatives but as a board of directors or executive for the industry.  They must work cohesively because if they do not the whole effort will be at nought.  They must work together to promote and develop the industry as a whole and not individual sections of it.  This is a major national task and I am confident the Authority we put in place will be capable of undertaking it successfully.  In regard to representation for the racegoer, I am making provision for a representative of the oridinary racegoer.  This appeal was made by every Deputy who contributed and since the initiation of this Bill I have stated that it is essential that the person who goes through the turnstiles, the racegoer, will be represented on the Authority.</P>
    <P>I want to let the Authority get on with the job without interference.  The Authority will represent the industry and it will be its responsibility to work out and implement what is best for the industry without interference.  We will, of course, give all the assistance necessary to ensure that they can work effectively.  When the Northern Ireland representative is taken out I will be left with two appointments to make with which to try to achieve a gender and geographical balance as well as the general balance of interests in the industry, the balance between national hunt and flat racing &mdash; a point repeatedly made by Deputy McGahon.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept these amendments although I accept in principle that the <Col N="1918" /> racegoers must be represented but not necessarily by the same organisation. Therefore, I am not prepared to have any specific organisation named in the Act as by their nature the majority of racegoers do not belong to any organisation.  I am also proposing an additional place on the Authority specifically to reflect the interests of the national hunt side of the industry, which is an extremely important sector.  Deputy McGahon made the point that there were fewer people at a recent race meeting than there would be at a flapper meeting in west Cork.  In fact some of those meetings in west Cork are extremely well attended, the reason being they are national hunt fixtures. Strong representations have been made to me that the national hunt should get a special place.</P>
    <P>My other amendments to this Schedule are technical amendments necessitated by the increase in the board membership. Amendments Nos. 49 and 51 propose direct nominations from the representative bodies with the simple condition that those with two nominations shall make, as far as possible, at least one female nomination.  This will involve a maximum of three female nominations. I would not be able to achieve the other balances, either geographical or the interests in the industry, by this system. Under this system the Authority could be very much weighted with members from one part of the country, leaving other regions feeling justifiably isolated. It is critical that all sectors within the industry are encouraged to work together for its overall betterment.  The best way to achieve this is through the composition of the new Authority.  We cannot leave this to chance; it is vitally important that we have an Authority that represents all sectors of the industry.</P>
    <P>Each of these significant organisations has put forward the names of three people in whom they could have confidence. This allows me the opportunity to put in place a well balanced authority from every perspective.  I therefore propose amendments Nos. 40, 45, 50, 52, 53, 53a and 56 and I oppose amendments Nos. 41, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49 and 51.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have spent many hours and many days debating this legislation to establish a new Irish Racing Authority. It would appear that the Minister had a dream some time ago of ensuring a golden future for an industry much beloved at least by the few of us who have taken part in debating this Bill, and perhaps by many more in this House and outside it.  Unfortunately, the Minister is falling at the last hurdle and his dream becomes a nightmare when one considers the procedures he is putting in place for nominating persons to this new Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been consistent in my opposition to the structures the Minister is putting in place in this Schedule for setting up the Authority.  I did not get the opportunity to deal with it on Committee Stage because the guillotine fell yesterday before we reached this section.  I am a little confused by the Minister's reference to 16 when he talks about the Authority. I presume he is referring to 15 ordinary members and a chairman.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Dukes, for pointing out the Minister's lack of grace &mdash; which I did not expect of him &mdash; in failing to accept my amendment No. 41 which is identical to the Minister's new amendment No. 40.  There is not even a comma out of place.  My amendment was tabled all through Committee Stage and retabled for Report Stage.  The Minister could have come into this House and told me he was accepting my amendment to increase the number of members on the Authority from 13 to 15.  We would have welcomed that as a sign of his willingness to accept the consistent points we have made for a long time.  Instead of accepting my amendment, which is identical to the Minister's, he tabled another amendment, No. 40, without any reference to the fact that his amendment is exactly what we have been asking of him, privately and on the floor of the House, to increase the representation on the Authority to 16.  Apart from the increased representation and the extension of representative interests that it will bring to the board, 15 is a critical number in terms of voting strategy and strengths on the <Col N="1920" /> Authority and I sincerely welcome it.  I thank him for taking on board my amendment which perhaps is the most important we have tabled on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I fully support the inclusion of the representation of national hunt interests,.  I hope I am right in thanking the Minister for amendment No. 45 which will include on the Authority one representative of racegoers nominated for appointment thereto by such persons as the Minister considers to be representative of racegoers.  I regret the Minister did not see fit to state &ldquo;nominated by the Racing Club of Ireland&rdquo; which, to my knowledge is the only national racing club.  There are local racing clubs structured around racecourses but it is the only national representation of racegoers.  I would have liked the Minister to recognise the Racing Club of Ireland specifically.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned that the Minister might be facemaking in this regard, that the man whom we all know he had in mind to nominate as one of the four will be nominated anyway under the aegis of this so-called amendment, rather than accept the nomination from the Racing Club of Ireland.  I will have to accept in good faith the Minister's intention on this because he has stated that the representative of racegoers will be nominated by &ldquo;persons&rdquo;&mdash; I do not know what person the Minister will listen to in terms of accepting nominations to represent racegoers.  If there is no body to which the Minister can refer, it is not very transparent.  I would have liked the RCI to be named there but the Minister is at least accepting the point we are making, that racegoers <i>per se</i> should be represented.  I am asking him to nominate the Racing Club of Ireland to represent them.  The Minister has come a little of the way, however, and he obviously listened to some of our comments.</P>
    <P>One major problem the Minister has not accepted is in relation to the substance of amendment No. 49.  I am asking that the people to be appointed under paragraph (1) (d), (f), (g), (h), (i) and now (j), the national hunt interest, <Col N="1921" /> should be the nominations submitted to the Minister by the representative interest concerned.  If this new Authority is to have integrity, if it is to be seen to be removed from the political process, from any Minister and from any political party, the Minister must ensure that the vast majority of its members are the nominations of the representative interests concerned.  I reject the Minister's contention that lists of at least three must be submitted from the component parts of the industry so that he can handpick those whom the Minister decides are more acceptable on this Authority.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure the integrity of this Authority so that it is seen to be the governing body of Irish racing, removed from any political interference and whose only interest is the future development and success of Irish racing. I ask him to look again at the nomination procedure and to accept the person nominated by the different interest groups and not request a list of at least three &mdash; in some cases the Minister has asked for four.  This is a sticking point with us and we feel the Minister is destroying the potential of this authority to ensure a healthy and vibrant future for our horseracing industry so beloved by many in this country.  The Minister is falling at this hurdle and more in sorrow than in anger I request him to look at this provision again and accept the amendment and the nomination of the component part, good, bad or indifferent.  If the nomination does not work out to be a success, it is for the different component parts of the industry to ensure that that person is replaced or that someone is nominated who will have regard to the particular interest of the component part, and all of Irish racing, when taking their seat on this new Authority.</P>
    <P>I requested that the Minister increase the representation of owners from one to two.  If we do not encourage more owners into the industry, look after their interests and ensure there is a service for them there will be no racing.  Without racing there is no need for racecourses, bookmakers or the Authority.  The owner and breeder pay the piper, they pay trainers <Col N="1922" /> and jockeys and keep the industry afloat.  The Minister should increase their representation.  The owners are pivotal to a successful industry but they have not been getting a return for their investment and fewer people are becoming involved in the industry.  Prize money has increased but it has a long way to go before it will reward owners for their investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not accept amendment No. 49 but it is critical to ensure the new Authority will have integrity and be seen to operate purely in the best interests of Irish racing.  It should not be composed of 11 members selected by the Minister out of a total of 15 and he should accede to our request.  I thank him for increasing the number from 13 to 15 and for accepting amendment No. 41 even if he chose to replace it by his own and call it amendment No. 40.  It shows a little lack of grace at which I am surprised as it is not expected of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Minister will not nominate a member of the Racing Club of Ireland.  It is a responsible club which has made an impact on Irish racing since its formation in 1982 and this has been recognised by the racing authorities.  I have a list of recommendations from almost everyone involved in the racing industry and it is regrettable that such a responsible body has been ignored.  I never met Kevin Smith who has been involved in the promotion of this club which has benefited Irish racing here and in the North where for four years they sponsored a maiden hurdle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of their objectives is to bring a <Col N="1923" /> breath of fresh air to an industry which has not been very open.  Potential customers must be aware of the use to which their money is put in the industry and have pride in a world class product.</P>
    <P>I am more concerned about the horse racing industry than engaging in nit-picking and scoring political points but the Minister's refusal to accept nominated persons from the various components of the industry is regrettable.  The fact that the Minister will select the members will be seen as meddling in the industry.  No Minister or civil servant should have that power.  It is a specialised industry and it should be left to the professionals as far as possible.  The prospect of a Minister selecting members is wrong and will not be welcomed by the industry.</P>
    <P>For an industry which contributes so much to the economy it is regrettable that only six Deputies are present for this debate.  On occasion there have been fewer than that.  This is an important Bill and there was a long delay before it was brought before us.  It is also regrettable that members of the racing industry are conspicuous by their absence from the public gallery, with the notable exception of Jonathan Irwin and Mr. Lambe. Where are the chairman, the stewards of the Irish Turf Club and the big wigs of the racing board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by Deputy Doyle.  It is disappointing that the Minister when looking for representatives of race goers now seems to intend to ask unspecified individuals rather than the Racing Club of Ireland. It is the only group that represents racegoers and, by so doing, have demonstrated their commitment to the industry. They are a companionable and well versed body of men and women who have distinguished themselves by setting up an organisation.  They have a substantial annual programme of activities which included a function held in my constituency, though that has nothing to do with it.</P>
      <P>If the Minister needs any further recommendation for the Racing Club of Ireland he should ask the Taoiseach.  As Minister for Finance the Taoiseach had the honour of joining people like Lester Piggott and myself among a list of others honoured by the club.  If the Minister needs any further indication of the discernment, judgment and good taste of the Racing Club of Ireland than that I do not know what it could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial number of people went to the trouble of setting up an organisation to represent the interests of racegoers. The Minister will get the most reliable advice one could get about the interests of racegoers from the members of that organisation; he will certainly get better and more credible advice from those people than from some person, no matter how distinguished he or she may <Col N="1925" /> be, who is plucked out of nowhere as far as the rest of us are concerned after consultation with unnamed individuals.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister seems to be hell bent on doing everything the hard and bureaucratic way except when it comes to selecting the members of the Authority which he wants to do in a very private, potentially underhanded and rather excessively political way.  He could do a favour for the industry and ensure clarity by taking this extra bit of advice over and above the advice he has taken from Deputy Doyle but which he does not wish to acknowledge.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with one of the most important Parts of the Bill and it is a pity more time is not available to debate it.  I spoke on Second Stage but, unfortunately, I have not been able to contribute to the debates since due to circumstances utterly outside my control.  I am sorry I did not have the opportunity to contribute earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that a Bill which should have the enthusiastic support of everybody does not have that support. The Bill is patently defective and the principal reason for this is that it has the hand of the Minister and the State all over it.  Instead of doing as in other countries where the State, the Minister and Government stand back and let the people who understand the industry run it in the general interests of the industry and everyone in it, the Minister has to have his finger in every pie.  While I welcome the Minister's minor concession to appoint two more people representative of racegoers and national hunt interests, any board of 16 members is much too big.  The Minister got into trouble by starting off from the premise that everyone on the board had to be representative of something.  I have plenty of experience of boards &mdash; much more experience than the Minister &mdash; and I know that if a board <Col N="1926" /> is appointed where all the members are seen as representative of a particular interest then we will not have a successful board or industry.  The internal friction between the various competing interests on such boards is such that most of the members fail to take an overall view of the industry.  That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle correctly stated that we are stuck with a very large board, all the members of which are representative of one interest or another, and if these members are going to be representative of various interests they should be nominated by the bodies concerned.  If the Minister does not accept that suggestion he will be making it abundantly clear to the House, the public and the industry that he wants to have the opportunity to put his stamp on everything.  It is part of the awful mentality in certain parts of public life that everything that happens must happen because Fianna Fáil made it happen, allowed it to happen etc.  This is a childish mentality and I hoped some people would have grown out of adopting that kind of approach by now.  It is sad that things have not worked out that way.</P>

    <P>We are debating a long awaited Bill on an industry in which Ireland could easily lead the world.  I read the Bill with disappointment and other Deputies &mdash; due to my circumstances in recent months I could not do this &mdash; have debated it at length and sought to make common sense changes which would have avoided the obvious errors which have been made. Some of the people who have done their best for this industry have expressed their profound disappointment at the Bill.  I am referring to the Turf Club and people <Col N="1928" /> like Lord Killanin who presided over the commission which made very worthwhile recommendations which have been ignored.

      <P>I have not taken up too much time so far.  I welcome the Minister's decision to allow one representative of racegoers to be appointed to the Authority, one-sixteenth of the membership.  That is very small beer indeed.  It is a pity the Minister was not somewhat more adventurous.  Since I have been a Member of this House, which is not very long, I have been amazed at the myopia of the Department of Agriculture when it comes to the overall concept of the consumer.  This is an <Col N="1929" /> industry like any other and, at the end of the day, the consumer is central to its future; without the racegoer or punter there would not be any racing industry. It is extraordinary that it requires amendments from the Opposition to force the Minister grudgingly to change the Bill in order to ease in one non-specified representative of racegoers.  There is a very begrudging attitude on the part of the Department with regard to this idea.  It is self-defeating because if we do not take on board consumers' needs and views they will go elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Life is full of temptations and of alternative ways of enjoying oneself.  The fact that a consumer representative was not included in the original Authority but required an amendment forced on the Minister by the Opposition is an indication of a backward-looking Department that has not really moved with the times.  It is a pity that the Racing Club of Ireland is not named in the amendment because that afforded an opportunity to recognise its track record, to acknowledge the fact that, if it is not the Racing Club of Ireland who will nominate this representative, there is no one else organised to do so.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Doyle in the points she has raised on amendment No. 49 which is crucial.  There is an implication in the Minister's approach that representative bodies of various groups within the industry, whether it be trainers, bookmakers or employees, are not to be trusted, that they will not bring in the safe men who will do the safe thing. That has very serious implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This means we are likely to end up with three nominations from different organisations.  One will be head and shoulders above the two others, yet the opportunity will be missed and a second rater will be nominated by the Minister. Then one ends up with a lesser Authority. One cannot afford to have a second grade representative on an Authority which has such huge implications for the racing industry.  It is not as though the racing industry is doing terribly well or is attracting a whole new generation of racegoers. That is not happening; they are remaining <Col N="1930" /> at home.  The Minister has an obligation to ensure he gets the very best. Nobody knows who can best represent them except the organisation, the people themselves, but the Minister is insisting on holding this power to himself.  I ask him at this eleventh hour to reconsider that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>We must engage in a five furlong dash there is so little time remaining. In relation to the composition of the racing Authority the Minister was in a no win position in that he had outlined from an early stage that he hoped and wished to obtain gender and geographic balance and, in order to achieve that objective, he inserted the condition that the nominating bodies should put forward the names of three persons.  The line adopted by Deputy McManus &mdash; that we might end up getting a second rate nominee &mdash; is an insult to the nominating bodies in the first place, the implication being that they would put forward such a nominee.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage Deputy Deasy suggested to the Minister that he should nominate the entire Authority himself. The members of Bord na gCapall were all appointed by nominated bodies, and Deputy Deasy, when Minister, had to abolish that board.  The argument being advanced does not withstand scrutiny.  I am delighted the Minister has decided to have a consumer representative on the proposed Authority.  I suppose the consumer, punter or whoever it will be might feel very much in a minority.</P>

      <P>I hope he will be listened to as much as he should be.  My concern from the outset was that this Authority would be comprised of people who would meet regularly and talk to themselves repeatedly, whereas new thinking and a new approach is what is needed.  I have received correspondence from the Racing Club of Ireland and acknowledged the tremendous work they are doing for racing, particularly for the consumer. <Col N="1931" /> They were more anxious that a consumer would be appointed to the Authority, not necessarily a member of the Racing Club of Ireland.  We must remember the racing industry has tremendous potential.  I have no doubt that this new racing Authority will go a long way to realising that potential.</P>

Caithfidh mé a rá, áfach, gur ghlac an tAire Dlí agus Cirt le Bille roimhe seo i ndáiríre.</P>

Níl fhios agam cén fáth nach ndeántar leasuithe ar Bhillí a thagann isteach anseo mar de réir dealraimh tá na dréachtóirí an-ghnóthach agus níl am acu teacht suas le Bille nua.</P>
      <P>Molaim an Páirtí Daonlathach a chuir an Bille seo os ár gcomhair agus tá brón orm nach mbeimíd ag caint faoi tar éis na seachtaine seo chugainn.  B'fhéidir, áfach, go dtiocfaidh an Rialtas suas le Bille dá gcuid féin sar i bhfad.</P>
      <P>In expressing surprise that it is normal for the Government not to accept Bills presented by the Opposition, I appreciate the Minister for Justice accepted a Bill presented by my party on a previous occasion.  I hope that badly needed legislation for dealing with this matter will be enacted before long.  People have been saying for years that it is ridiculous that people can continue to commit offences while on bail.  We can only talk about this issue for a certain length of time; the Government should tackle this problem. The Progressive Democrats have done us a service by highlighting it.  It is a pity the Minister has decided not to accept the Bill and amend it as required.  If a constitutional change is required &mdash; last evening the Minister thought that there might be a way around this &mdash; let us make it in order to prevent innocent people from being attacked and robbed by persons who should not be at large.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal in section 3 that the person providing bail should be a surety for the good behaviour of the accused.  Such a provision would make people think twice before deciding to provide bail for someone who should not be at large.  Section 4 provides for the confiscation of bail where a crime is committed by an accused while on bail.  I welcome these provisions, although I am aware that the Bill will not be put into effect as it is not being accepted.  People should think seriously before deciding to provide bail and if an accused commits a crime while on bail the person who provides bail should have to accept the consequences.  While this may be severe, it would also make things very simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Long before I became a Member of this House I always believed that it was a contradiction to talk about someone being guilty but insane.  I do not know how this has survived in law.  It would be more logical to talk about a person being innocent but insane.  If a person is not of sound mind I fail to see how they could commit a crime.  It is a contradiction to state that they are guilty but insane.  This <Col N="1935" /> is a paradox and it is something that has always amazed me.</P>
    <P>Section 59, which deals with infanticide, states:</P>
    <P>Where a woman by any act or omission causes the death of her child, being a child under the age of 12 months, but at the time of the act or omission the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of the effect of giving birth to that child or circumstances consequent upon that birth, then notwithstanding that the circumstances were such that but for this section the offence would have amounted to murder or manslaughter, she shall be guilty of an offence of infanticide.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with this provision. That is as it should be.  Subsection (2) states however that a woman who is convicted on indictment of infanticide should be liable to be imprisoned for a term not exceeding five years or to be committed by the judge to a designated centre or to be released subject to such conditions as the judge may impose.  That is another contradiction and if the Government decides to introduce legislation I would like to see this provision changed.  I fail to see how a woman who is found not guilty of murder or manslaughter because the balance of her mind is disturbed should be sentenced to five years in jail for infanticide.  If she is found not guilty of murder or manslaughter she should not be guilty of an offence which carries a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years, although I accept that other options are provided for.  For example, she could be committed to a designated centre or released subject to such conditions the judge may impose.  If the Government decides to introduce legislation I would like to see this provision changed as it does not make sense.  If we accept the idea that a person who is insane cannot be found guilty, the same should hold for a mother found not guilty of murder or manslaughter.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with a verdict of not guilty of mental disorder.  I welcome this <Col N="1936" /> provision as it puts the horse before the cart, not the other way round as is the case at present whereby a person is found guilty but insane.</P>
    <P>Reference was made last night to the right to silence.  Most people seem to have come to the view that the right to silence makes an ass of the law.  If an offence is committed in Carlow tonight and I refuse to tell the Garda that I was making a major speech in the Dáil rectifying the legal system it would be considered strange.  I fail to understand why, if people fail to account for their movements, an inference cannot be drawn that they have something to hide.  We should allow the Garda draw an inference of guilt where a person maintains their silence. If a person is not guilty they should answer the questions.  While I accept that one has the right not to incriminate oneself, if a person looks into space and makes no effort to answer questions one should be able to draw an inference of guilt.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is regrettable it will not be accepted by the Government, but I hope the Government will shortly introduce a Bill based on these provisions.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the substantial work put into the preparation of this Bill by Deputies O'Donnell and McDowell whose contribution is an excellent example of parliamentary democracy at its best.  Rather than depending on facile point-scoring and criticism, the Deputies examined a number of aspects of our criminal law and put together what they consider to be corrective proposals.  Their Bill deserves to receive a full and fair assessment from the House.  In this regard the Minister's comprehensive and generous response to the Bill is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first part of the proposed Bill deals with the legal regulations which provide <Col N="1937" /> the context for the granting of bail.  I share the view that we must make every effort to minimise the abuse of this facility to the fullest possible extent.  I recently issued a statement and spoke at length about concern's in the community in respect of our bail laws.  Few people can argue with the overall principle of guarding both the rights and the dignity of an accused person.  If we are to consider ourselves a civilised society, nothing less is acceptable.  Similarly we should not be surprised when legal safeguards put in place to protect the rights of all individuals are abused; it would be naive to expect a uniform standard of honourable behaviour across all members of society.  However, when the level of abuse of benign laws reaches an unacceptable level or when close examination suggests that legislation may be amended without infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens, it is our duty to make every effort to improve the details of the relevant laws.</P>
    <P>In general, I agree with the objectives of this Bill's proposed changes in relation to the conditions and levies imposed in the granting of bail.  It is vital that the financial cost be extremely punitive in the case of abuse of bail.  Similarly, any involvement in further crime while on bail must carry the gravest consequences both for the accused and the person providing bail.</P>
    <P>It is vital however to recognise that simply specifying lower limits to the amount of bail set is only one component assisting the proper administration of our bail laws.  The ultimate discretion lies with the court itself.  This has to be the case since the impact of any level of bail is totally dependent on the financial well being of the accused and his or her family and friends.  While a bail set at £5,000 may be totally out of reach of the typical working class person, such a sum is derisory in the case of a drug smuggler.  Any attempt to adjust our laws without taking such realities into consideration would be inherently unfair and socially unjust.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the fact that any changes to our laws regarding bail must not impinge on the constitutional rights <Col N="1938" /> of the individual.  Therefore, it is only prudent that we await the report of the Law Reform Commission before moving to change our laws in the area of bail.  It is clear from the Minister's speech that she is willing to upgarde these laws to the fullest possible degree even if the consequent changes involve an amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The importance of focused research in the area of law enforcement and crime should be stressed.  When examining the proposals in the current Bill, it would be extremely useful to Members of this House if research findings were made available on the extent and nature of abuse of our bail laws during a 12 month period.  A number of relevant questions come to mind.  For example, is the problem encountered throughout our court system or is there a higher rate of bail abuse in certain instances?  Is the likelihood of bail abuse related to the accused's previous criminal record?  Is the amount of the bail acting as a deterrent? Without such fundamental research findings, to a certain degree as legislators we are being forced to act on the basis of personal impressions and media priorities.</P>
    <P>The proposed Bill considers at length the impact of possible mental illness in the prosecuting of criminal charges.  I agree that we need to look critically at current legislation in this area.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is closely co-operating with the Minister for Health in developing new proposals in this sensitive area.  As the Minister stated, the Bill before us depends to a significant degree on the 1978 Henchy report of the Inter-departmental Committee on Mentally Ill Persons.  It is important to note that the Minister is actively working on this issue and intends to introduce a Bill which will deal with criminal insanity in a comprehensive manner.  Consequently, rather than dealing with the proposals before us today on a section by section basis, it would be more useful if we develop the debate regarding the key issues in this area.</P>
    <P>There are three key elements to be considered.  We must ensure that the allegation <Col N="1939" /> of mental disorder is established beyond reasonable doubt in each instance.  Of course this can often be an extremely difficult task.  When a person is charged with a serious crime, an opportunity exists to attempt to avail of provisions regarding criminal insanity.  A number of people resort to such a strategy by adopting bizarre behavioural patterns. Proper assessment of such individuals should be a matter of primary concern.  To be specific, the medical practitioners employed should be very well qualified.  The task of accurately and fairly establishing the mental state of the accused is formidable.  For example his or her state of mind both at the time of the alleged crime and at the time of the trial must be classified.  If the crime was committed many months previously, or indeed years in some instances, the task becomes even more difficult and prone to error.</P>
    <P>In our implementation of both existing and future legislation in this area I strongly urge that adequate attention be focused on the need for properly trained medical personnel in the administration of the system.  In the routine clinical setting the psychiatrist often finds extreme difficulty in arriving at a clear cut diagnosis. Unlike many physical illnesses, mental illness rarely presents itself in an easily identifiable manner.  Rather, the patient may show many and varying symptoms such as aggression, depression, guilt, anxiety and fear. Therefore, the courts must avail of the most skilled practitioners when assessing individuals alleged to suffer from substantial mental disorder.</P>
    <P>Where the court is satisfied that the accused suffers from a significant mental illness it is vital that the case proceeds in an efficient manner on two different counts.  The individual must be treated with care and compassion, and the most effective professional services should be made available to either stabilise or cure his or her problem.  At the same time the prosecution of the case must be hampered to the least possible degree, since the objective in every criminal case must <Col N="1940" /> be to identify the guilty party or parties. Failure to do so undermines the victim of the crime and the legal system.  Our laws must ensure that despite the accused person's mental illness, the case proceeds to a conclusion if at all possible.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the need to protect the public from any person who is clinically judged to be a risk to society.  It is not acceptable that such people should be reintroduced into their home communities in an accidental or random manner.  When a person with dangerous anti-social tendencies is released, either because of innocence on the specific charge or on account of criminal insanity, a comprehensive treatment follow-up plan must be in place.  Unfortunately, this is not always the case.  As a result many needless and sometimes extremely serious crimes can be committed.  As well as dealing with the need for punishing crime, we must make every effort to prevent it.</P>
    <P>On the matter of criminal insanity, we must never forget that we are dealing with a human being, irrespective of their guilt or degree of illness.  Can there be a more miserable state for a human being than to be afflicted by mental torment and to lose one's freedom?  From the time a person is first apprehended to their ultimate release having served his or her sentence, it is vital that the corrective legal system never loses sight of the potential for reform and the dignity of the individual.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I have reservations regarding the proposals in the area of pardons, remissions and temporary release of prisoners.  I do not agree with the concept of a register for any group of convicted prisoners.  The sole responsibility for allocating punishment rests with the courts.  Once sentence has been passed and a convicted person's freedom of movement has been surrendered, no further penalties should be placed on either the guilty party or on his or her family.  Insensitive and sensational media coverage often adds unnecessary grief to the family of the guilty party even though they are totally innocent.  Many of the problems encountered in the area of <Col N="1941" /> criminal law come from deficiencies in implementation of the law rather than major flaws in the legislation.  Too often the finger is pointed at this House for those problems and that is unacceptable. There may be room for even greater care and vigilance in the implementation of the regulations regarding the temporary release of prisoners in particular.  Sometimes the most prudent course of action is to refuse such requests irrespective of the relevant circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes some interesting proposals regarding criminal procedure. However, I have some reservations regarding the proposals dealing with a suspect's right to silence.  I believe that the investigative and judgmental skills of our courts are quite capable of assessing the implications of unreasonable silence from accused persons.  If we apply too much binding legislation in such cases we run the risk of contributing to a miscarriage of justice in a small minority of instances.  For example, people wrongly accused of crime can be so outraged as to refuse to accept the reality of their position.  In such instances it is vital not to confuse stubborn and possibly foolish silence with guilt.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Donnell and McDowell have made a significant contribution to the ongoing debate on improving our criminal laws.  Similarly, I express my appreciation of the energetic and balanced manner in which the Minister and her staff are advancing the cause of justice.  Seldom in the history of the State has such a sustained programme of law reform been developed, implemented and refined.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and the officials in the Department must be complimented on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the two Deputies for introducing the Bill and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  There are a number of issues in the Bill which are very important.  I believe the most important one is the part of the Bill dealing with the reform of our bail laws.  The present position is costing <Col N="1942" /> the State a fortune because of the number of people who are repeatedly offending while on bail.  Members of the Garda will tell of their total frustration with the present position.  They are arresting people, bringing them before the courts, but they are getting out on bail and a few days later are seen on the street.  This has a serious effect on Garda morale and is a bad example to those who hang around with such offenders.  Offenders can get around the law and make a joke of the Garda, which many continuously do while on bail.  It is a serious problem and many gardaí have made complaints to me about the problems they face.</P>
      <P>I have received many letters from constituents and others, some of which have been passed to the Minister, who have come up against this problem when their houses were broken into or they were victims of another crime.  Gardaí have told them that such offenders are repeatedly brought before the courts, are out on bail and there is little they can do about it.  Those people are outraged that this can happen.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago I received a letter from a constituent, which I have passed to the Minister.  The constituent's shop had been repeatedly broken into by the same offender.  The offender is out on bail and I am sure he will reoffend.  It is a serious problem that needs to be tackled.  It undermines the public's perception of the legal system.  Many people cannot understand how this practice is allowed to continue. Newspaper reports of such cases, which may be blown out of proportion, are bad publicity for our legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a survey I carried out in my constituency 70 per cent of those surveyed believed the law on bail should be changed and made stricter.  If the Garda were able to deal properly with 30 to 40 of those criminals it would cut the crime level in the city considerably.  The Garda are repeatedly pursuing the same offenders.  They know who they are and they arrest them.  That is a huge drain on their resources.  Many gardaí are not on patrol because they are dealing with hardened criminals who probably know the <Col N="1943" /> law better than they and many Members of this House do.</P>
    <P>I realise this is a difficult problem to tackle as we must introduce legislation that will not challenge the Constitution. I am delighted the Minister referred this matter to the Law Reform Commission because, hopefully, it will be able to come up with something that will be acceptable. I am delighted also that the Minister said last night that if the Law Reform Commission recommends an amendment to the Constitution the Government will accept it.  That is important and it may be necessary.  An amendment to the Constitution would open up an interesting debate on bail.  One would see the two sides, once it is important to achieve the right balance to ensure that individual rights are protected while at the same time protecting the public.  People who have no regard for the law, people or property must be tackled and realise that if they commit a crime while on bail a further sentence will be imposed.  Crime is one of the top issues and bail is a key element.  If we sort this out, not alone will the general public have more confidence in the legal system, Garda frustration with hardened criminals will be dissipated and we will save money because we are repeatedly dealing with the same people and Garda time is wasted.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill concerns the criminal law on mentally ill persons.  This is an extremely difficult but important area which must be carefully handled.  The people involved in this area must be of the highest calibre, have had a lot of training and know exactly what they are doing.  There could be enormous problems in this area if it is not handled properly. The Minister for Justice gave a commitment in the Programme for Government and I gather that legislation is at an advanced stage.  The Minister for Health is also bringing in legislation, and I look forward to it because there is a need for change in this area and it must be handled delicately.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the remission of penalties, pardons and temporary <Col N="1944" /> releases.  The main provision of this part of the Bill requires notice of temporary releases and mitigation of sentences to be published.  I agree with the Minister's views, if we are trying to rehabilitate offenders I do not see why we should publish their names.  We should publish statistics on temporary releases but not the names of individuals.  If the social services and prison services are successful in rehabilitating prisioners back into society to live a normal life, they want to forget the mistakes they made in the past, and publishing their names would be an invasion not only of their privacy but that of their families.  If they have been rehabilitated and want to live an normal life without offending anybody else, they should be helped to do so.  Many early releases are not instigated by the Minister but are authorised under the supervision of the probation and welfare service, a group of people who work extremely hard under difficult circumstances.  They make their own recommendations.  They should be allowed to do that and there should be no question of the names of the people in question being published which would cause difficulties for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to the strategic plan for the management of offenders.  It is an area fraught with difficulties, particularly in England, because people reoffend constantly and tend to come from the same places, for example inner cities and less well off areas. I recently saw a programme about this and the tragedy is that people are stuck in a rut which it is very hard to get out of.  At a recent meeting of the Committee on Legislation and Security the Minister mentioned that some of the offender rehabilitation schemes here have a 70 per cent success rate, which is extremely high.  Most of the people at the meeting recognised that this is far higher than in other countries.  If we are achieving that kind of success rate with certain schemes we should help as much as we can and not highlight the fact that the people concerned made a mistake in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister's record in reforming the <Col N="1945" /> criminal law speaks for itself.  She brought in approximately eight major Bills.  She has been very active as a reforming Minister and most people welcomed the legislation she introduced. I believe the Minister will fulfil the promises she gave last night as she has always done in the past.  I welcome this debate and congratulate the two Deputies who raised the matter.  The issues are important, particularly the question of bail.  If we can sort that out we will solve many of the problems linked to it.  I eagerly await the Minister's proposals on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the previous speakers for endorsing the proposals in this Private Members' Bill and the Minister for her response last evening.  Anybody with a finger on the pulse at the moment will vouch for the heartfelt concerns of our citizens, expressed by them at every possible opportunity when they meet public representatives, at the level of crime which is perceived to be on the increase in our communities.  They are particularly worried at the motiveless nature of many criminal activities.  Faced with this escalation in crime our citizens demand action, not putting the issue on the long finger and promising reform. They are tired of hearing politicians on all sides coming out with routine condemnation of the high level of crime.</P>
      <P>Last year the Minister announced a £66 million package to be ploughed into law enforcement and reform of the system generally, which is welcome. However, the Progressive Democrats propose a range of measures which are, in essence, a procedural response to some of the problems which beset the criminal justice system.  Not all reform is a drain on the Exchequer or necessarily expensive. There are structural defects in our criminal justice system which could be ironed out without a charge on the Exchequer and without placing a further burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that she is considering our proposed measures which, if implemented, could go a long way towards addressing many <Col N="1946" /> complex inadequacies in the justice system.  The law must change to meet changing circumstances, particularly social circumstances.  With the unprecedented level of unemployment and the breakdown in social cohesion, traditional family patterns and discipline generally among young people, which is being experienced not only in urban areas but throughout the country, we should have confidence to adapt our laws to changing circumstances.  Procedures, precedents and principles which have served society well for several generations are not cast in stone.  It is our responsibility and duty to adapt our laws on crime to changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>My generation grew up with a liberal approach to crime.  However, as one encounters crime, those liberal views are quickly diminished.  They may be accepted in the academic study of law, but in the application of rules it is sometimes proven that the principles which were meant to support the criminal justice system and protect human rights and civil liberties are an obstruction to real justice.  These matters must be confronted.</P>
    <P>This House should not be afraid of the Constitution, a very valuable document which has been changed as society has changed.  This is particularly so in family law matters and the role of the family in protecting children.  As social circumstances change our laws must change.  We must not believe that the Constitution is cast in stone.  We have the power to change our laws and must do so even if it means changing the Constitution. We must be willing to challenge the principles which have served us well in the past and this must be done without ceding fundamental rights.  We should be courageous in putting forward legislation, even if there is a possibility that it will be challenged and sent by the President to the courts for adjudication. Every Bill that goes through the House is deemed to be constitutional until challenged. We are here not only to reflect public opinion but to challenge and enlighten public opinion on particular areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> As seen in the recent elections, the electorate is seeking action on a range of political and social issues.  Many people are tired of politicians who fudge issues and try to please everybody.  This Bill is radical and a sincere effort to challenge the premise that the <i>status quo</i> will suffice. The Bill proposes to amend the law to prevent abuse by people on bail who commit further crimes.  Persistent offenders will find it impossible to get bail under the terms of the Bill.  Every possible step to tighten the law on bail without a constitutional referendum is proposed.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission is considering reform of this area and the implications in practice and in policy of such reform.  I am sure that whatever recommendations are made by the commission will involve a change in the Constitution and I am glad the Minister said she will have no hesitation in going down that road.  The dissatisfaction with the present bail laws needs to be shouted from the rooftops.  If change is not made soon we are all wasting our time.  This is one area of the law which all parties agree is in need of reform and there is no excuse for delay in changing it.</P>
    <P>At present a person cannot be refused bail even if there is evidence that he or she is likely to reoffend while on bail. This is a very serious shortcoming.  The measures we propose would allow surety to be forfeited if the person reoffends while on bail.  This is a simple measure. The Bill also proposes to increase the amounts of bail set, with discretion on the part of the judge.  As the amounts of bail set are frequently paltry, people put up the money as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is a comprehensive restatement of the law relating to insanity and criminal responsibility.  This is particularly topical in the light of widespread concern that people evade justice by claiming insanity.  A verdict of guilty but insane masks the fact that this is an acquittal in law.  New powers are proposed to detain dangerous criminals and prevent abuse of insanity pleas.  The way in which mental disorder affects criminal <Col N="1948" /> responsibility has been the subject of much academic and legal debate over centuries.  This Bill is an attempt to integrate the psychiatric understanding of mental illness in the 1990s with the complex knot of legal problems surrounding the insanity plea.  The subject of the proper management of the mentally disordered defendant at all stages of the criminal process is addressed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is substantially a representation of a Bill drafted by a special interdepartmental committee on mentally ill and maladjusted persons, chaired by Mr. Justice Henchy in November 1978.  The recommendations for change have been neglected for 14 years.  The Minister pointed out last night that these recommendations are in need of review. I welcome the commitment in the Programme for Government to bring forward legislation in this area.  Substantial intellectual investment has been put into this matter by the interdepartmental committee and it would be a shame to waste it.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of that committee were very broad and included the right to examine and report on the provisions, legislative, administrative and otherwise, which the committee considered to be necesary or desirable in relation to persons, including drug abusers, psychopaths and emotionally disturbed and maladjusted children and adolescents who have come, or appear likely to come, in conflict with the law and who may be in need of psychiatric treatment.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Bill, as drafted, which was annexed to the report, did not deal specifically with drug abusers or intoxicated persons who commit offences.  In its introduction the report states that drug abuse and intoxication as factors in the commission of criminal offences require a depth and spread of study beyond the range of the committee. Drug addiction and alcoholism interplay with criminal responsibility.  This is an area that is in need of vigorous and in-depth study.  A very high proportion of the prison population are drug addicts. Because of that, we need to conduct a <Col N="1949" /> complex study into how drug addiction and intoxication can affect criminal responsibility.  That can only be done if we carry out a comprehensive audit of our criminal population.</P>
    <P>The difference between the legal and medical definitions of insanity is complicated by the fact that insanity means different things in medicine and law at different stages of the criminal process, and by the inherent limitations of psychiatric testimony at the trial and post-trial stages.  When a plea of insanity is raised in connection with assessing the competence of the accused to stand trial, the issue is whether he is insane at the time of the trial.  The legal test of insanity is whether the accused is capable of understanding the proceedings, although evidence of certifiable insanity is normally accepted as conclusive proof that he is insane in the required sense, in other words, evidence that the accused has been diagnosed as psychotic is generally enough to convince the court that he or she could not be tried as charged.  There are recent publications dealing with this subject in Irish law and the whole test of what actually constitutes mental disorder. The Minister raised this issue last night.  A defect of the Henchy report is that it did not deal with the crucial issue as to what degree of mental disorder justifies absolving a person of criminal responsibility and how it should be determined.</P>
    <P>Before comprehensive legislation is brought before the House a great deal of academic, psychological and psychiatric work will have to go into the framing of the Bill.  As McAuley in a recent book on criminal insanity says, in Irish law, though heavily influenced by modern psychiatry, the test of insanity is not co-extensive with the psychiatric conception of madness.  There are several reasons for this.  First, legal insanity is an excuse for wrongdoing, not a diagnosis of the accused's mental condition.  We excuse the insane for the same reason we excuse the very young &mdash; because they lack the capacity to act rationally, to understand what they are doing, why they are doing it and to act on the basis of that understanding. <Col N="1950" /> This insanity is not a defence because it is a disease but because it is a species of one of the excusing conditions traditionally recognised by the law.  This proposal is an attempt to resurrect the Henchy report and to put it on the political and legislative agenda and prompt the Government to address this area of the law.</P>
    <P>People do not often claim insanity as a defence because if one is found guilty but insane it means one is potentially locked up for life at the behest of the Executive. That is why such cases are quite unusual, but nonetheless a hard case is always just around the corner and our law should be in readiness and updated to meet the need, such as having integrated up-to-date psychiatric knowledge to deal with the prospect of the legally insane.</P>
    <P>We have argued about the need for more transparency in cases of temporary release and remission of fines.  We do not oppose temporary releases or remission of fines but we believe there would be widespread outrage if the public knew of their true extent.  When somebody is tried and convicted they are sentenced to a term of imprisonment or fined a specific amount and I believe that the public is not aware that the sentences may be remitted by the Executive.  As a new Deputy, I was certainly not aware of it and when I subsequently became aware I was surprised at the extent of it.  The process should be transparent.  In essence, the criminal process is a public affair.  The transcripts of a criminal trial are open to the public and I believe any remission of a sentence should be in the public domain.  I do not believe the excuse that making it public knowledge would be an infringement of civil liberties. In the interest of transparency it should be made public.  The constitutionality of the matter is before the court so I will not go into it in greater detail.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to confer for the first time jurisdiction on the District Court to consider the mental conditions of persons charged before it and to make orders for the treatment and care of those found to be in need of it.  Where it appears to the <Col N="1951" /> district justice that the accused may be suffering from a mental disorder, he may arrange for the examination of the accused by any doctor in the first instance and if it is then thought desirable to have a more detailed assessment by an approved medical officer, provision for this is made in section 15.  The establishment of a mental care review body is one of the primary recommendations in the Henchy report and I believe that this proposal should survive any review of the Henchy recommendations.</P>
    <P>Today I raised the question of sex offenders, having served their sentence, being released into the community.  Last week there was a case in Britain where an Irishman was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for committing a foul rape on a young woman in Britain three months after being released from an Irish jail having served four years of his six year sentence for the rape of a 14-year-old Irish child and having been granted 25 per cent automatic remission.  I believe sex offenders should not be allowed to avail of automatic remission unless someone has carried out an evaluation of the person because there is a propensity for offenders to re-offend.  There is a high rate of recidivism among sex offenders. This area of the law needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister is setting up a treatment programme for sex offenders but generally speaking there is a very low success rate in treating sexual offenders. It appears that these men are being released into the community in an unplanned way.  It is immoral and reckless to the point of irresponsibility to release men in such cases as I have instanced where no objective assessment has been made of their propensity to re-offend.  This is part of the constitutional argument on bail.  The Supreme Court has said that bail should not be refused to a person because of a propensity to re-offend. The presumption is that once one has completed a fixed term, one is free and a propensity to re-offend should not be assumed.  That is too liberal an approach to take to such a serious issue <Col N="1952" /> which allows sex offenders, who are dangerous criminals, back into the community in an unplanned way.</P>
    <P>Another area about which I am concerned is the care of people who may not be appropriate inmates in prison.  I refer to those who have psychiatric disorders and the issue of whether they should plead a psychiatric disorder or insanity at the time of their trial.  If they do so, there is the possibility that they would be put away for ever or at the behest of the Executive.  There must be an audit of the prison population, what makes them tick and whether there is any hope for these people.  Individual plans must be put in place for each inmate.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding bail is one of our great scandals but another great scandal is that remand prisoners are integrated with convicted prisoners.  I have said on many occasions &mdash; during the debate on the Justice Estimate and elsewhere &mdash; that there must be a separate centre for remand prisoners.  It is not fair to integrate them in an indiscriminate way with convicted prisoners.  They are deemed to be innocent until they are convicted and integrating them with convicted prisoners puts pressure on the system which results in temporary releases.  That raises the other issue of crimes being committed while prisoners are on temporary release.  The whole system is close to collapse because of the overcrowding in Mountjoy prison but procedural changes could be made, quite apart from building more prisons.  There is no doubt that we need additional prison places but the law on bail must be examined as well as the separate treatment of remand prisoners.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill deals with the right to silence.  This section might seem draconian but we are not proposing to remove totally the right to silence. We propose that an inference should be drawn if the accused sings dumb.  Many people will say that this might result in a miscarriage of justice and that people should always have the right to remain silent but I understand from speaking to lawyers that those who are innocent want <Col N="1953" /> to shout their innocence from the roof-tops and that the right to silence is generally used as part of the legal game. They remain silent on the basis that the prosecution has to prove everything, they have the right to say nothing and no inference can be drawn from that.  That issue must be confronted and Deputy McDowell, as a practitioner, has drafted various procedural aspects of the Bill which are quite complicated and which possibly would go above the heads of many Deputies, including myself.  As a practitioner, he has an insight into the criminal process which I certainly do not have.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the speeding up geneally of the criminal justice system.  I understand the Minister is drafting proposals in the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill which would change the law in a whole range of issues.  I am glad the Minister is responsive to proposals made by the Opposition.  She has been a very active Minister for Justice.  I regret the Bill is not getting a positive response but we want to encourage the Government to address the problems of bail and the issue of the criminally insane.  Hard cases are always just around the corner in relation to the criminally insane and the response of the law.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about the potential abuse of Executive power in the reduction of sentences.  I understand in the past there was much more consultation with the District Court judge who dealt with the original trial but that the matter is now a routine one for the Executive.  In some cases the remission of sentence is being approved even though the appeal process has not been exhausted by the person concerned.  The figures have increased dramatically in recent years and this is causing a lowering of morale among the Garda Síochána. Perhaps this is something that members of the Garda say only to Opposition Deputies but I cannot be sure of that and I wonder if the Minister and the Minister of State are simply closing their eyes to the fact that there is widespread concern about the lack of transparency in the petition system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1954" /> I look forward to the continuing debate on the Bill.  It provides the House with an opportunity to examine the issue of mental illness and I ask the Minister to respond to my proposal to examine the problems of drugs and alcoholism and how they contribute to criminality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this wide-ranging and substantial Bill containing 59 sections and six parts.  Most of the issues raised merit debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated last night that she was not prepared to accept the Bill but I say to her and indeed to Deputies across the House tha there are many aspects of the Bill with which I am in general agreement.  That is based on my own research, my experience as a member of the crime committee of this House for many years, my experience of the debates in the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and my 13 years experience as a public representative dealing with problems in this and related ares.  I am sympathetic to many of the issues that have been raised and the concerns expressed in relation to them.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill deals with bail and Part III with the mentally ill and criminality. Part IV deals with pardons, remissions, commutations and temporary release of prisoners and Part V deals with criminal procedure.  Given my experience, research and participation in debates I will concentrate on commuting sentences, fines, pardons, remissions, temporary release of prisoners and bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Minister's assurances that all aspects of the Bill will be dealt with individually or collectively in forthcoming legislation.  Some aspects have been referred to the Law Reform Commission. I am heartened by her commitment that, when bringing forward the Government's proposals in areas dealt with by the Bill, consideration will be given to the measures contained in this <Col N="1955" /> Bill.  That is heartening and positive but I would not have expected anything else from the Minister or the Minister of State, both of whom have been extremely active, since their appointment 18 months ago, in the area of legislation to tackle crime.  I welcome her comments that she will take into account the exchange of views expressed here.  Certain aspects of the Bill presented by Deputy O'Donnell, with I am sure the assistance of Deputy McDowell, will contribute to forthcoming legislation.</P>
    <P>Reading through Part IV of the Bill, despite what Deputy O'Donnell said at the end of her contribution, there is an implicit acceptance of the petitions procedure. This area was debated in the Select Committee on Security and Legislation as Deputies O'Donnell and Harney will recall.  It is something I have had to deal with on numerous occasions in my constituency work in Dublin North East.  I do not deny that or shy away from it as some might.  I deal with it on a regular basis.  Having deliberated long and hard about the merits of such a procedure I have come to definite conclusions. I deplore and deeply resent any attempt to restrict &mdash; I am not talking about this House &mdash; the Minister's powers in this area as suggested in recent media reports.  I am glad that kind of approach is not promoted assertively in the Bill in spite of the reservations articulated by Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>The petitions procedure is a necessary feature of the criminal justice system.  It is provided for in the Constitution and the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, where the Minister is given explicit power to commute or remit penalties imposed by the courts.  I recall many occasions when constituents came to my clinic in panic having received a notice of final imposition of the penalty.  Many of them would not have heard of the petition procedure before I informed them of it.  Sometimes they faced fines of £300 and £400.  If there were no petition procedure such people would incur considerable expense in having to go to the Circuit Court.  The petition procedure is an inexpensive, <Col N="1956" /> acceptable means of appealing against the severity of a fine.  It does not cost anything.  Contrast that with the cost of hiring a solicitor or barrister to go to court to prove that an unjust fine has been meted out.  In many cases the people do not have the means to pay.  In one case a deserted mother with four children was fined £300 for non-payment of a television licence.  Perhaps there were cumulative arrears but that was the fine imposed.  She could not afford to pay and her only alternative was to go to prison. Is that what we want as legislators?  If we restrict that system we will need to build many more prisons to house those who do not pay their television licence, park illegally or do not license their dogs.  I do not condone anyone breaking the law, nor would I ever do so but I make that point nonetheless.</P>
    <P>For many people an appearance in court is stressful and traumatic.  It is small wonder that some people avoid attending court and take the rap to a far greater extent then they would if they had attended.  In court they must bare their souls and give full details of their marital and financial circumstances and they are reluctant and embarrassed about doing so.  The court does not always hear the full facts.  Constituents who attend clinics are far less circumspect and talk freely and openly to us.  We are in a better position to make a more accurate case to the Minister.  I could delay the House with numerous examples of that as could other Members.</P>
    <P>I am trying to find the most effective means of dealing with fines imposed on the categories of person to whom I referred, not chancers.  It is high time that we, as legislators, stood our ground and said &ldquo;hands off the petitions procedure&rdquo;. I ask all Deputies whose constituents have been wronged or who suffered an injustice as a result of a court decision, to roundly condemn any interference by outside parties in the legitimate affairs of democratically elected Members.</P>
    <P>Section 51 calls for a register of temporary release orders which is objectionable. As one who constantly advocates the harshest possible measures <Col N="1957" /> for certain categories of criminal, I sound a note of caution that we must never, through the laws we enact, propound the principle that once a criminal always a criminal.  A register as defined in the section has huge potential for damage in that way.  A juvenile in a primary school could be confined to custodial care.  My colleague opposite might not have had as many experience as I given that I teach in the inner city but would, nevertheless, be aware of what I am saying.</P>
    <P>If that juvenile is registered as having obtained early release with whatever reports emanate from that custodial institution he or she is registered as a criminal, perhaps a juvenile criminal but nonetheless a criminal.  When registered, the potential for input by the probation and welfare services, psychiatric and psychological services, teacher services and parental support back-up where available is ignored.  We would ignore the multi-disciplinary team potential input into that young child's life which would enable him to rise about his deviant and delinquent behaviour and become a responsible member of society as he moves towards adulthood.  I caution against that proposal and appeal to the Minister to guard against it.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with bail and I welcome many aspects of it.  In my constituency I have had experience of problems with the bail system.  People on bail have abused the system left, right and centre, some because of drug abuse and others because of their determination to accumulate wealth.  If it takes a constitutional amendment to sort this issue out I would welcome that.  I am glad the Government have referred this for immediate consideration.  I welcome the Minister's commitment that if a constitutional amendment is required she will follow it through.  She will have my support in doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity this debate affords us to discuss both the contents of the Bill and the overall crime problem and its consequences on society.  I am always concerned that we place too much emphasis <Col N="1958" /> on dealing with the consequences of crime rather than devising the means to prevent crime in the first instance.  For example, the lack of a national programme on the prevention of drug and alcohol abuse and intervention methods in our schools is a scandal.  There is a very strong correlation between the level of crime in society and the level of substance abuse.  The increasing number of young people who engage in substance abuse and who subsequently become involved in crime &mdash; some of them are as young as ten or 11 years &mdash; is alarming. We need to concentrate on this problem and urgently put in place both at primary and secondary level a proper educational programme for the prevention of substance abuse which will instil confidence in young people to withstand peer pressure to get involved in substance abuse.  I make that point in the context of this debate as it is fundamentally linked to many of the other problems about which we are concerned.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to expand significantly the community policing programme, which has been an outstanding success since its introduction and which will have a long term impact.  Its impact will not be evident immediately as many of the community gardaí are working with young people and the benefits of this will only be seen in five to ten years. Unlike the relationship between many young people and the Garda, community gardaí can inculcate among young people a respect of the Garda Síochána and help to build a proper and constructive relationship with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many ways this Bill is topical.  It was evident during the campaign for the European elections that the problem of crime is uppermost in people's minds regardless of where they live.  There is a very real and legitimate perception among people that the rights of the victims of crime are not properly recognised by the State or the system and that the rights of criminals are paramount.  As legislators we have to respond to these concerns and reform our law so that the victims of crime are given greater protection. There is a sense of fatalism <Col N="1959" /> among people about our ability to deal with the ongoing crime problem.  Last week an elderly couple in my constituency came across a break-in.  I am sure that when the crime was reported the Garda inevitably said &ldquo;This is the fifth break-in this week.  There is not much we can do about it.  You had better take measures to protect yourself and install an alarm system&rdquo;.  This sense of hopelessness is causing distress among the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very generous in terms of the response to the contents of the Bill, particularly the section dealing with bail.  It makes common sense for us to await the report of the Law Reform Commission before we reform our bail laws.  I welcome the Minister's commitment that if a constitutional amendment is required to improve our bail laws, she will proceed in that direction.  While accepting her words of caution on this complex matter, the public want us to deal with it as it is clearly unacceptable for people to commit crimes while on bail.  Unfortunately, this is happening all too frequently in our community.</P>
    <P>On the question of criminal insanity, the Minister has made it clear that to a certain degree the Bill anticipates legislative proposals which are at an advanced stage of preparation and transcends many of them.  It is only proper that we should deal with this issue in the proper context. As the Minister pointed out, this is a complex area and it will be difficult to be definitive and specific in dealing with it. Much research has been carried out in this area and many disciplines may need to be reconciled.  We cannot arrogantly arrive at definitive conclusions.  I believe the Minister has adopted an understanding approach to this issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Fitzgerald about a register of temporary releases, the mitigation of certain sentences and the publication of these in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Much criticism has been made of the petition system and public representatives have made representations to the Department of Justice and so on. A number of my experiences have given <Col N="1960" /> rise to questions about the custodial system.  For example, it is ridiculous that people who get into debt for different reasons, some of which are beyond their control and others because of the lack of an early intervention system can often find themselves in jail.  People may not be aware that a person in the community is not well off, is experiencing problems and does not have access to a community welfare officer or aid agency.  Representations are then made by neighbours and others to the local TDs to do something about this appalling situation.</P>
    <P>Consideration needs to be given urgently to the cost to the Exchequer of keeping people in jail.  If politicians did not take time to deal with these issues many people would be imprisoned unjustly for unreasonable lengths of time.  Further consideration needs to be given to the imposition of fines on people without any recognition being given to their capacity to pay.  There is little point in imposing unrealistic fines on people who cannot afford to pay them.  We should be looking at alternatives to the age old tradition of imposing fines.  Our focus in terms of the punishments which can be meted out for certain crimes has been too narrow.  I hope any debate on the petition system will not be used by people to make cheap accusations etc. All of us know of genuine cases where great hardship has been unwittingly caused and which needs to be alleviated. If we did not have a petition system this could not be done.</P>
    <P>I would oppose the creation of a register of temporary releases because it would involve issues such as the rights of privacy, for example.  In addition, in my view, it would interfere with the rehabilitative process we should be encouraging. We all agree that, unfortunately, the degree of turnover of the same prisoners is too high, with their returning to gaol repeatedly.  Despite all of the educational content obtaining, we all protest and criticise the lack of rehabilitation within the prison system generally.  The creation of a register of temporary releases would interfere significantly with that process and is one I would oppose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me this opportunity to make some preliminary points in relation to today's events.  On the publication of the Community Support Framework I hope the House will be given an opportunity to debate this matter in greater detail.</P>
      <P>The first point I want to make is in relation to the cynicism displayed by the Government in attempting to mislead the public on the financial shortfall for the national plan was published.  Last Thursday was polling day.  My understanding is that an agreement was reached with the European Commission as far back as April on the broad thrust of the Community Support Framework.  Yet on 1 June the Minister for Finance had the neck to say that since then officials had been working through the detailed text and statistical material &mdash; referring to validation of statistics &mdash; whereas we have now confirmed from Brussels that this was deliberately held over to save the blushes of the Government before the electorate could pass their verdict on Thursday last.  It was deliberately concealing which projects were to face the axe, which way the taxpayer was to pay more and which projects would be slowed down.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, author of the Ethics in Public Office Bill, has lectured us on proper behaviour and it is remarkable that she should attempt such a cynical stroke of the worst Fianna Fáil kind to try to have this done after the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a debate in Private Members' Time on this matter on 31 May and 1 June.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, said that in this House on 8 March 1994 Deputy Yates said the revised proposals presented to the European Commission <Col N="1962" /> last Thursday morning &mdash; an across-the-board cut of 8.5 per cent in the National Development Plan &mdash; will be rejected.  Her prepared script, a copy of which I have states:</P>
    <P>I can assure the Dáil now that when the Community Support Framework is published, Deputy Yates will have been proved comprehensively wrong in his predictions.  The eventual outcome is fully consistent with the Government's approach.</P>
    <P>In the morning newspapers today I read that the European Union officials have rejected a <i>pro rata,</i> across-the-board cut, and have insisted on selective cuts.  That is what happened and Government spokesmen are now saying that the only <i>pro rata</i> element is that the taxpayer will make up the difference.</P>
    <P>On Tallaght Hospital alone the taxpayer will be asked to pay the difference in the shortfall, £40 million.  Let me put that in context: in this year's budget, tax on the old reliables, sixpence on a gallon of petrol, threepence on a pint of beer and tenpence on a packet of cigarettes amounted to £48 million.  This represents another lash for our hard-pressed tax-payers who will have to pay for this Government's incompetence for the Tallaght Hospital.  The total incompetence amounts to £130 million a year.</P>
    <P>Let us not have any more lectures on how well we are doing because the fact is we received more money in 1993 than we will receive in any single year between 1994 and the date of completion of this plan; the money has peaked.  Therefore, we have had insult added to injury for the taxpayer.  To make up for the Government's vanity and incompetence, poor Paddy, the taxpayer, will be asked to rattle his pocket one more time, for the equivalent of the 1 per cent income levy, to keep these spending programmes on target.</P>
    <P>The one slight optimistic note is that I think the public is copping on to this Government.  Despite the plethora of <Col N="1963" /> programme managers, spin doctors and special advisers massaging the message, the people see that this is a Government lacking substance, engaging in politics of the sound bite, just to get through the day on the basis of a fog of confusion. We have had a consistent pattern of false claims.  How many times has the Taoiseach in this House said there will be no alteration in the plan, there will be no cuts?  Today the Minister for Finance muttered into a microphone saying some projects will be drawn out and the Government will look at some projects again, while others remain to be approved, such as the peat-fired station. We have a sorry mess, entirely of the Government's making, because it did not come clean with the public.</P>
    <P>We shall have an opportunity to debate this later.  The cynical stroke to defer this announcement until after polling day is one of the most outrageous attempts to deny the public an opportunity of transparency. It was done by a party that promised to put trust back into politics. It should be ashamed.</P>

      <P>I reject the accusation of cynicism and postponement for electoral reasons.  I would have been delighted to have been able to publish the Community Support Framework earlier because it represents excellent news. Today we received approval in principle from the European Union Commission, at its meeting today, of the Community Support Framework for Ireland for the period 1994 to 1999.  Following submission to the relevant consultative committees we expect formal approval and publication of the Community Support Framework in a couple of weeks.  The Operational Programmes are being finalised and, within a few short weeks, we expect to begin drawing down on this very substantial transfer of funds to increase the jobs capacity of our economy. I am delighted the European Union <Col N="1964" /> Commission has formally approved the Community Support Framework and that there remain just a couple of more formal steps before it is fully approved, signed, and we can begin to draw down the moneys.  The sooner we do that the better.</P>
      <P>I would have been very anxious, as I told this House in the debate a fortnight ago and earlier, that discussions with the European Commission would go well. Indeed, I was anxious to have them concluded earlier because that would have been excellent news for us all embarking on the European election campaign.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that, after all the debate and discussion, we are about to see this real, very substantial investment in the Irish economy.  Our task is to ensure that this money is spent wisely and that we get the maximum long term benefit from every ECU spent.  We were disappointed last October when the Commission announced that the Community Support Framework would be £4.54 billion, the same figure which was announced, or leaked last evening.  Contrary to media reports, there has been no change in the Community Support Framework figures announced last October.  Disappointing as is the shortfall it must be pointed out that it represents the highest amount <i>per capita</i> in the European Union, so that we have done very well.  Deputy Yates has attempted to turn the same bad news, to run it three, four of five times as though it was something new&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's contribution to the National Development Plan of approximately £4 billion has been fully maintained. The Government recognised the <Col N="1965" /> reality of the shortfall in European Union receipts.  As we informed this House on several occasions, we put to the Commission a <i>pro-rata</i> package which would keep the basic shape and order of priorities we had spelled out in the planned document with all the flagship projects in place.  I spelled this out again a fortnight ago in this House.</P>
    <P>The plan, as endorsed by the Commission today, fully reflects our approach.  The combined totals of European Union and Exchequer spending on each element of the Community Support Framework reflect almost exactly to the last ECU the proposition we put to the Commission.  We are delighted with the successful conclusion of our negotiations. I wish to spell out clearly that the total contribution from the European Union is as announced by the European Commission on 21 October last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The mix of Exchequer and EU funding for individual projects has been changed in the CSF, as agreed, but without affecting the totals in any significant way.

      <P>I wish to quote from <Col N="1967" /> the text of the CSF approved by the Commission today:</P>
      <P>The proposals of the Commission in these areas were acceptable to the Irish authorities on the basis that they were consistent with their development strategy and that they were able to make offsetting shifts in the allocations of domestic Exchequer resources so as to essentially maintain the relative shares in overall expenditure in the areas concerned.</P>
      <P>The Government will look each year at the budget possibilities.  If circumstances are favourable it may well prove possible for the Exchequer to inject additional resources in later years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;while maintaining budgetary discipline.  If the Deputy listens he might hear something. This was the case in 1994 where the Government put an additional £40 million over what it had originally committed into the plan.  To the extent that this is not possible, some of the investments originally proposed may take longer to complete, as stated during the past number of months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As pointed out in the independent evaluation commissioned by the EU &mdash; published in the ESRI medium-term review &mdash; investments which make economic sense for the Commission make equal economic sense as investments by the Irish Government. However, the Government recognises that fiscal discipline is essential to creating growth in employment and investment and in no circumstances will there be any increase in borrowing or in taxation.  As the budgetary strategy allows from year to year, if we have a few bob in the kitty and there are worthwhile <Col N="1968" /> investments in the plan that we can bring forward we will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Commission's emphasis on proper investment appraisal and cost benefit analysis.  None of us wants to see funds spent on white elephants or over-designed projects, or to see money frittered away with poor expenditure controls. The shortfall in funding makes good investment appraisal even more urgent and, as Deputies may be aware, any project which costs over £20 million requires a full economic appraisal before it can go ahead.  There is nothing new in such a requirement for any of our large road, rail or electricity projects.  Indeed the Department of Finance, at my request, is updating its guidelines on project evaluation and project management to ensure that we learn from the mistakes of the past and put in place sound systems which avoid mistakes for the future.</P>
      <P>The negotiations of the CSF with the Commission have gone very well and I pay tribute to the Commission officials and to the officials in my Department for the hard work and the constructive spirit in which these negotiations were conducted.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought to be here as this is a very serious problem relating to the impending collapse of the operations of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which was brought into effect by order of the Minister less than ten months ago.  The Act was a response to the growing problem of looking after our elderly population by easing the burden on relatives, hospitals for the aged and other institutions.  Raising standards made the stay of elderly people cared for in private nursing homes more acceptable.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his formidable battery of spin doctors milked the introduction of the Act last September for all it was worth.  It was another episode in the image building of that Minister as the world's greatest carer and healer.  Behind the hype characterised by the Minister, kissing old ladies on one occasion in a nursing home, serving or sipping tea with a couple in another establishment which apparently was brought about by his caring, there was a different reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1970" /> Funding for the Health (Nursing Homes) Act was never realistic and the approach to funding was downright dishonest. For the four months of its operation in 1993 the Minister provided only £4 million, £500,000 of which was used to relieve acute bed pressure in Dublin and £600,000 spent on administration. The remaining £2.9 million was disbursed among the eight health boards.  The Western Health Board, to which I shall confine the rest of my remarks, received a contribution of 5 per cent of that allocation although it has 12.5 per cent of the total elderly population in the State.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the four months in 1993 and the 12 months of 1994 up to 31 December, the total allocation from the Department of Health to the Western Health Board was £550,000.  This figure is ridiculously short of what is needed to fund the scheme in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  To illustrate how wrong the Minister and the Department were in estimating the take-up of the scheme, they announced in May 1993 that there would be 1,200 new subventions, in addition to section 51 subventions, over a four year period from 1993 to 1997.  By the end of April 1994, eight months after the legislation was implemented, 2,132 subventions had been approved in all the health boards. In this period the Western Health Board approved 302 new subventions costing £1,526,604 but the Minister allocated just one-third of that amount.  Up to this week the Western Health Board has approved 400 new subventions.  At the rate in which applications are coming in it is realistic to assume that the number of applicants sanctioned for subvention by the end of this year will be in excess of 500.  There is a statutory obligation on each health board, under the Act, to deal with each application and inform the applicant, as speedily as possible, of the outcome. There is also a statutory obligation on the Minister to ensure the subvention is paid to each person who has undergone a humiliating means test.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> The Minister cannot play a waiting game with this problem as it needs immediate attention.  Asking health boards for reports on various silly details to try to bide time is not acceptable.  In the Western Health Board no subvention has been paid to any patient or private nursing home in County Roscommon since last March and a subvention has not been paid to any patient or private nursing home in counties Galway or Mayo since last April.  In other words, there is no more money in the Western Health Board to continue this scheme and the patients in private nursing homes are being told to pay their full maintenance or go home.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health is conducting business on the floor of the Seanad.  While he has many talents, bilocation is not one of them.  The Deputy made a personal attack on the Minister but he is around long enough to know that jealousy will get him nowhere.</P>
      <P>The legislation to which he referred, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which was brought into effect on 1 September 1993, has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.  The new Act is a major step forward in ensuring that dependent elderly persons will be well cared for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1972" /> A total of £9 million has so far been made available for the implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act.  Of funding distributed to date to the health boards, the Western Health Board received £390,900.  Funding was allocated to health boards on the basis of the size of the nursing home sector and expected demand under the new subvention scheme.  It would appear that demand in the Western Health Board for nursing home subventions has been higher than expected.  Discussions are taking place between officials of my Department and the Western Health Board to establish the extent of the problems facing the board.  My Department is monitoring the situation closely and will work with the board to resolve difficulties which have arisen.</P>
    <P>I realise that the implementation of the new legislation has not been plain sailing for either the health boards or the nursing home sector.  To deal with issues arising from commencement of the Act, my Department set up an implementation group which includes representatives of the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association, as well as members of the Federation of Catholic Voluntary Nursing Homes, the National Council for the Elderly, the health boards and officials of my Department.  The purpose of the group is to highlight problems at an early stage and to resolve them in a way which meets the concerns of all parties.  The group has met on over eight occasions and has reported good progress in all areas of the implementation.</P>
    <P>Private and voluntary nursing homes fulfil an important role in providing high quality care for our dependent elderly population.  The nursing homes Act is strengthening the bonds of partnership between public health services and private nursing homes so that they can provide the best care and facilities for the elderly who need residential care.</P>

      <P>It is most welcome news that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, is to respond on behalf of the Minister for Education.  Having listened to her during the past 12 months speaking about millions and billions of pounds I expect that she will be in a position to give me a cheque for a few thousand pounds to bring home to this rural national school.</P>
      <P>It says a lot that it is necessary for me to raise on the floor of the House the provision of funding to provide a hard playground area for the 70 children at Annacarty national school, an area which the Ceann Comhairle knows well.  It is pathetic that there is only enough ground for 20 children at this lovely rural school which I visited last week.</P>
      <P>One may ask why this matter has caused so much anguish and anger among teachers and parents and hardship for the pupils.  The lack of ground is causing a tremendous problem at this school which has three classrooms, toilets and an inadequate cloakroom.  There is no lunch room, office for the principal, teachers room, PE room or extra accommodation, just the bare minimum.  As a consequence, at break time, even during lunch hour, the children have no option but to go out to the fields to eat and play.</P>
      <P>Due to the lack of hard ground and to weather conditions, from 11 a.m. onwards the children often have to spend the rest of the day in wet clothes.  Parents have informed me that they need five outfits per child because each evening they have to change their shoes and clothes which have to be washed before they can be worn again.  This is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the board of management, teachers and parents need is a few thousand pounds.  They are prepared to provide a local contribution.  They need approval to start this work during the summer months.  I am afraid, however, that they have reached their limit of tolerance. <Col N="1974" /> Having visited the school on a wet day I believe they have been most patient.  All they are looking for is a maximum of £10,000.</P>
    <P>The school has many priorities.  It needs repainting, new school furniture and additional accommodation.  It was lucky to be provided with a shared remedial teacher but they have nowhere to operate from, apart from the cloakroom.  In terms of facilities, resources and accommodation some national schools are well provided for, but others badly need to be considered favourably by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>My request will not upset the national finances and will have no bearing on the National Development Plan but would mean a lot for the students, teachers and parents of Cappawhite.  It is hard to demonstrate adequately just how strongly they feel about this issue and how much they need the finance to make provision for the little students in Annacarty.  It is both urgent and necessary.  We cannot allow another week or two to go by without issuing approval for this project. What they are looking for amounts to a mere pittance.  I look forward to receiving a generous response from the Minister of State which will determine whether I should have trust and confidence in her in spending the millions and the billions of pounds that are to follow.</P>

      <P>A request was received from the chairman of the board of management in April 1994 for the provision of additional play space to the hardcore area already provided at this three teacher school. Enclosed with the request were plans and specifications for the proposed play area, which were referred to the Department's professional advisers for report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Department's advisers are currently examining the specifications and will visit the school in <Col N="1975" /> the near future.  On receipt of their report, the question of approval will be considered by the Department, bearing in mind the entitled allocation of play area for the school.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the school authority's <Col N="1976" /> desire to complete the work this summer and, should approval for this work be warranted, the Department's officials assure me that every effort will be made to facilitate the school in this regard.</P>

I am sure Deputies will agree that there are valid reasons for this and that the individuals who make petitions are entitled to a certain degree of privacy concerning their personal affairs.

For example, earlier this year, on 9 March, the information was provided for each of the four years 1990 to 1993 in reply to a parliamentary question &mdash; see Official Report volume 440, columns 349 to 352.</P>
    <P>In so far as the processing of petitions is concerned the position is that each petition is considered on its merits having regard to the grounds of the petition, offence involved and penalty imposed, and where I deem it necessary I seek reports from various sources, including the Judiciary.</P>

      <P>I have had no direct request from Concern in this matter.  Within the past few days I have received representations on behalf of the organisation from a Member of this House.  The position inso-far as the Garda Síochána is concerned is as follows.  I cannot answer for the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are not in favour of extending leave of absence to members wishing to serve abroad on an individual basis.  They consider it better that existing arrangements whereby members of the Force may be sent abroad on the basis of United Nations requests, which is now established and well structured, should continue to be followed.  Any request from the United Nations for Garda assistance in its missions is considered in the light of available resources and it is open <Col N="1828" /> to any member of the Force to apply to serve abroad with the Garda Síochána as part of a United Nations contingent when details of such missions are circularised within the Force.  Fifty-nine members of the Garda Síochána are currently serving with the United Nations in Cyprus, Mozambique, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated in this House, I could not undertake to indicate, by way of reply to parliamentary questions, what specific legislative proposals I might have in a particular area. Any legislative proposals I may have in relation to any particular matter would be announced in the normal way in due course.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to address certain concerns which have been expressed following the recent removal and burial of one of the victims of the recent shooting incident at the Widow Scallan's pub in Pearse Street.</P>
      <P>There has been reference to the perceived inadequacy of the law in relation to the wearing of paramilitary uniforms. As things stand, there is no provision in the criminal law which prohibits <i>per se</i> the wearing of paramilitary-style clothing. Accordingly, the question as to whether an offence, warranting the taking of a prosecution, is committed on an occasion which, amongst other things, involves the wearing of a particular type of clothing, must have regard to all the circumstances involved and is a matter for the appropriate authorities i.e. the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> This was not the first occasion on which a funeral with some element of paramilitary trappings took place in this jurisdiction. The reality is that such funerals have taken place on many occasions down through the years.</P>
    <P>The question of introducing legislation to prohibit the public wearing of certain types of uniform has been an issue virtually since the foundation of the State. However, any time it was considered it was recognised that there were difficulties associated with such legislation. Apart from the difficulties of enforcement which I will deal with later, it was recognised that a &ldquo;broad&rdquo; provision would unavoidably encompass the wearing of uniforms by a very wide range of legitimate organisations, political and non-political, while a &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; provision might not lead to successful prosecutions or could perhaps be circumvented altogether by the organisations concerned simply adopting a different style of clothing or uniform.  By proceeding in this way the organisation concerned could make a mockery of the law &mdash; in other words they would tend to gain rather than lose in publicity terms.</P>
    <P>Even if one were to introduce a provision banning dress or displays which were such as to arouse reasonable apprehension that the persons concerned were members or supporters of a proscribed organisation &mdash; and assuming that there were no constitutional or other difficulties associated with such a provision &mdash; there would be considerable difficulties in producing the standard of proof likely to be required by an Irish court.</P>
    <P>It must also be recognised that there are particular difficulties associated with the policing of funerals of this nature. We need only look to the experience in Northern Ireland where the high profile of policing of such funerals during the 1980s caused great offence and resentment amongst the Nationalist community &mdash; resentment which was indeed voiced in this House.  It was recognised that such policing only provided the men of violence with ready-made propaganda coups.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> Funerals are traditionally dignified occasions where the feelings of grieving relatives are treated with the utmost regard and sympathy.  If the law provided that the wearing of a particular style of uniform, or a style of marching by uniformed persons, was a criminal offence, the Garda would have to be in attendance in such numbers and so close to the centre of things that their presence could be regarded as, at best, insensitive and, at worst, as provocative and overbearing.  It has to be borne in mind that others who would reasonably expect to be at the centre of things on an occasion such as this could include innocent children and other relations of the deceased &mdash; heavy handed law enforcement could be seriously distressing for such persons.</P>
    <P>The alternative &mdash; and in the view of all of those who considered the matter in the past &mdash; the better alternative is for the Garda to respect the dignity that belongs to all funerals, to facilitate the easy passing of the funeral along the route it is to follow, to maintain a discreet presence, to monitor what is happening &mdash; with a view to assisting in any subsequent investigation that might be required &mdash; and to prevent, as far as possible, any unlawful activity from taking place.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, the policing measures to deal with any public order situation where large crowds are expected to take part are matters for determination by the Garda authorities in accordance with their professional judgement.  It is entirely a Garda decision following an assessment by Garda officers of the operational requirements.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming majority of people on this island, are totally opposed to the use of violence for achieving political ends.  The Deputy will be aware of this Government's wholehearted opposition to the violent expression of political views and our determination to evolve arrangements most likely to bring about reconciliation between the two sections of the community in Northern Ireland.  What successive Governments have done and what this Government will continue to do is to use every opportunity to make <Col N="1831" /> people aware of our absolute opposition to the use of violence for political ends and of our commitment to using all the resources available to us to bring such violence to an end.  In my view, this is the best way to counter the propaganda of terrorists &mdash; I can see no percentage in giving propaganda victories to those involved by attempting to apply the criminal law to an area where it would be unlikely to produce any worthwhile results.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my review of prisons policy, I came to the conclusion that the special needs of women offenders would best be met by the provision of a new, purpose-designed custodial facility.  The Government, on my recommendation, and as already announced, has approved the provision of such a facility.  It is my intention that the new prison will be designed and organised with an ambience and a range of facilities and activities appropriate to the special needs of women prisoners.  In this context, as the Deputy will be aware, I have established an expert steering committee to advise me on the best options to take in relation to the design and operation of the prison to meet the special standards required.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 21, 27, and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Last July I published a discussion paper on the treatment of sex offenders in prison and invited views from interested parties.  Subsequently, I accepted the group therapy approach recommended in the discussion paper and have commenced the process of putting it in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appointed a special steering group within the Department to direct delivery of the programme.  This group is chaired by a senior official in my Department and includes the director of prison medical services and the Governor of Arbour Hill Prison in which the programme will operate initially.  Two programme leaders were appointed to the programme last year &mdash; one senior clinical psychologist and one senior probation and welfare officer.  Two further probation and welfare officers have been assigned to it <Col N="1833" /> recently.  There are now two male and two female staff who will be directly involved in delivering the programme.  The support of the staff of Arbour Hill Prison is regarded as crucial and all staff there are being given a special course to prepare them for it.  This preparation, which consists of day long seminars open to every staff member, commenced in April and finished recently.  An information leaflet has been given to offenders in Arbour Hill to make them aware of what is proposed and this will be followed up with a series of explanatory talks in the coming weeks.  Additionally, the Prison Officer's Association and the teachers who work in Arbour Hill Prison have been extensively briefed by my officials.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of preparing for implementation, I arranged for a comprehensive study visit to be made by the programme leaders to see relevant approaches in Canada and Vermont, USA.  The visit was completed on 31 January 1994.  From the extensive briefing I received on it afterwards I gathered that the North American treatment approaches supported the group therapy approach.  I also arranged for the two leaders to attend a special two week training course in the UK and a course in the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>It is intended to commence the sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison later this month. While prison officers will not be directly involved initially in the actual delivery of the programme, their involvement will be significant.  Their position will be revised in due course when some experience has been built up with the programme. It is expected that ten offenders will take part in the first group.</P>

At my request, the British side have agreed to look at the matter and see what can be done in the United Kingdom in relation to this issue.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The educational qualifications necessary for admission to the Garda Síochána as a trainee are set out in the Garda Síochána (Admission and Appointments, Regulations, 1988.  Paragraph 5 of those regulations specifies that the educational standard required is a minimum of grade D in at least five leaving certificate examination subjects, including Irish, English and Mathematics, or in another examination which, in the opinion of the Minister for Justice, is of a standard not lower than the standard of that examination.  I have no proposals to modify those requirements.</P>
      <P>In practice, in the latter case, the Department of Education is consulted and decides whether other qualifications obtained by applicants are of an equivalent standard to the leaving certificate examination.  Each application is treated on its own merits and the suggestion that blanket approval be granted to any particular qualification other than those specified below cannot be considered.  It is unlikely, in any event, that foreign educational qualifications would include the Irish language as a subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, despite stringent precautions, there is significant drug abuse in some prisons.  Steps which are being taken to keep drugs out of the prisons include a high level of staff vigilance, closed circuit video surveillance, screening of prisoners after visits and regular searches of the prisons.</P>
      <P>Our prison system operates a humane and liberal regime for offenders including free association between prisoners and free and open contact on visits with families and friends.  There is, therefore, a risk that some prisoner and visitors will abuse the system by passing illegal drugs on visits and that prisoners, will abuse free association by passing drugs to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would, of course, be possible to restrict the regim for prisoners in such a way as to virtually eliminate the problem. Such a regime, however, would have to involve severe restrictions on free association between prisoners, more frequent searches of cells and prisoners, including strip-searches, the searching of all visitors to prisons, the erection of barriers between prisoners and all visitors to prevent personal contact, even with children, and the introduction of more intrusive surveillance.  As I have stated on previous occasions, I am not satisfied that I would be justified in introducing so <Col N="1837" /> restrictive and inhumane a regime which would punish the innocent as well as the guilty and could cause irreparable harm to relationships with families, including children.</P>
    <P>The Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases in Prison which reported to me in May 1993 made several recommendations concerning the question of drugs in prison and these recommendations are now being examined and, where possible, implemented by the steering committee which was set up following the report's publication.</P>
    <P>I understand that drug-free units have been developed in the UK, Netherlands and Sweden.  The Prison Medical Director and other senior officials visited drug-free units in the UK and the Netherlands recently to review their method of operation and to see how they might be adapted here.  I will explore the issue in more detail when I have received their report.</P>

The first community garda was appointed in November 1987 in the DMA and there has been a gradual expansion of the scheme since then.  The scheme has been further expanded in recent times to include Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Mullingar, Athlone and Dundalk. The Garda authorities consider that the community policing scheme is a very successful way of putting gardaí in closer touch with the communities in which they serve and of providing a more visible Garda presence in the streets of our cities and towns.  It is planned to expand this scheme further and 13 new areas are currently under consideration, to assess their suitability for community policing.</P>
      <P>Neighbourhood Watch was introduced in 1985 following the success of a number of pilot schemes.  It is a crime prevention programme which enlists the voluntary help of the community in co-operation with the Garda Siochana.  The public response to the scheme continues to be enthusiastic and there are now 1,772 schemes in operation incorporating 323,454 householders throughout the State.  This represents an increase of 6.3 per cent in the number of householders involved in the scheme over the past eight months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interest in Community Alert, which is a rural based crime prevention programme, has continued to grow.  The scheme was originally launched in 1985 and has now grown to the extent that <Col N="1839" /> there are 528 schemes in operation. Between August 1991 and the end of last year, there was a 79 per cent increase in the number of schemes in existence.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert schemes are now being supported by the development of a new Neighbourhood Watch pack and video will be used to develop the schemes and enhance the knowledge of the gardaí deployed in these areas. In addition, a neighbourhood policing course has been introduced at the DMA Headquarters at Harcourt Square and at in-service training centres around the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the community policing initiative for rural areas, this scheme was extended to 100 Garda stations throughout the country in September 1991 following the success of a pilot scheme.  The initiative has proven overall to be very successful, and I understand that the Garda Commissioner will be making proposals to me in the near future in relation to the possible extension of the initiative to other Garda Districts.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the further development of this initiative as resources permit, because as I have said before, there is no point in having gardaí deskbound in their offices pushing paper around.  Their place is out on the streets providing a visible Garda presence in the communities which they serve.</P>
    <P>Both Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert committees liaise on a regular basis with local gardaí on the operation of the schemes and crime related issues generally.</P>

      <P>In the course of a reply to priority question today, I have already referred to the issue raised by the Deputy.  The procedures in this area provide that each application for naturalisation is required by law to be made on the form prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 1956.  The form requires that an applicant for naturalisation provide references <Col N="1845" /> from three Irish citizens to the effect that they are prepared to support the application from personal knowledge of, and intimate acquaintance with, the applicant and can vouch for good character.  With regard to checks, it is not and never has been part of routine practice to go beyond the references submitted in support of applications linked to investments in the State.  If positive references are supplied by three Irish citizens, they are taken as confirmation of good character. The form contains a statement to the effect that a false statement on the form is punishable by a fine of up to £500 and/or imprisonment for up to six months.</P>
      <P>In addition, an applicant is required to provide on the form particulars of any proceedings, civil and criminal, which have been taken against him or her in courts of law in the State or elsewhere. An applicant is also required to make a statutory declaration before a notary public or a commissioner for oaths or a peace commissioner to the effect that the particulars stated in the application are true.  The question of considering an application does not arise unless the statutory declaration has first been made.</P>

    <P>These measures include the introduction, in February, 1994, of a new computerised payment system to process travel and subsistence expense claims, called the Financial Management System.  This system, which involves opening a separate account for each individual claimant, will generate payments, provide financial reports and apply controls which were not possible to the same extent under the previous semi-manual system.  For example, a weekly list showing all outstanding advances will be printed and a record of the amount of any outstanding advance will be produced by the system each time a claim for payment <Col N="1848" /> is processed.  This will ensure that outstanding advances are identified and the necessary action taken to ensure that a claim in respect of travel or subsistence expenses in lodged to offset any advance made.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the application form for advance payments, authorising the Accountant to make deductions from salary if a claim is not lodged within one month of receipt of the advance.  It is intended to pursue this procedure more vigorously than was heretofore possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to existing outstanding travel and subsistence advances which were mentioned in the C&amp;AG's report, a special unit has been established within the Finance Division of my Department to rectify this situation.  This unit has made good progress since it was established in March last year and has succeeded in significantly reducing the number of outstanding advances on the Garda Vote.  The unit is continuing its efforts to improve the position and I expect that it will have brought the situation up-to-date by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>One point that is worth explaining, in case there is any misunderstanding about it, is that the existence of outstanding travel and subsistence advances does not mean that the Exchequer is out of pocket, so to speak, in respect of the amount involved, or that the gardaí are enjoying free loans.  All it means is that the gardaí &mdash; who in many cases are owed money by the State, rather than the other way around &mdash; have not brought their expenses claims up to date.  I would like to assure the House that the introduction of the new computerised Financial Management System and the other measures which I have outlined will ensure that there should be no recurrence of the problems relating to the internal controls on the Garda Vote which were referred to in the C&amp;AG's report for 1992.</P>

      <P>In the course of a reply to priority questions today, I have already referred to the issues raised by the Deputy.  There is no specific residency requirement although the practice under successive Governments has been that an applicant for naturalisation on the basis of Irish associations linked to investments in the State should own a residence and agree to spend a reasonable amount of time here.  Evidence of such ownership is sought from applicants.  A commitment to spend a reasonable amount of time here is generally accepted in good faith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 44, 51 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The Committee to Enquire into Certain Aspects of Criminal Procedures (the Martin Committee) made certain recommendations in relation to the electronic recording of interviews.  As a result, in March 1993, I set up a Steering Committee (the Smyth Committee) firstly, to make recommendations to me on the features of a pilot scheme for audio and audio-video recording of Garda questioning of suspects in selected Garda stations and subsequently, to make arrangements to monitor the pilot scheme in relation to the likely effects of audio and audio/video recording on the criminal justice system as a whole, and the extent to which the pilot scheme shows that an effective and economic basis can be found for a national scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Smyth Committee, which includes representatives from the Garda Síochána, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society and my Department submitted their initial report on the features of the pilot scheme to <Col N="1851" /> me recently for consideration.  In it they recommended that a preliminary pilot scheme for audio and audio/video recording be introduced in the Tallaght Garda station.  I approved the features of this preliminary pilot scheme and it commenced on 11 May.</P>
    <P>It is likely that this scheme will be in operation for a number of months in order to ascertain the level of acceptance on a voluntary basis by suspects of electronic recording and to gain experience regarding the equipment, the accommodation, the training and the procedural guidelines.  It is envisaged that the scheme will be extended to a further three Garda Districts at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that the figures in the Garda Complaints Board annual report indicate that the majority of complaints made to the Board are vexatious and without foundation.  The Board's report for 1992 showed that 178 complaints out of 1,030 dealt with by the Board that year were considered to be frivolous or vexatious and were inadmissible as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be referring to the number of complaints which were withdrawn, deemed to have been withdrawn or deemed not admissible.  These categories, however, cannot be regarded as containing only complaints which are vexatious and without foundation.  The reasons complainants withdraw complaints are generally known only to themselves. The inadmissible category, which <Col N="1852" /> comprises complaints which did not comply with the requirements of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, includes, for example, complaints which were not made within six months of the incident complained of or complaints where the complainant was not directly affected by or did not witness the incident.</P>
    <P>Of the 4,923 complaints received by the Board since its establishment on 6 April, 1987 to 31 December 1992, 750, or approximately 15 per cent, were deemed frivolous or vexatious.  The 1993 figures will not be available until the annual report for that year is published later this year.</P>
    <P>There is already statutory provision in section 12 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, which makes it an offence to make, knowingly, a false report or statement tending to show that an offence has been committed.  A complainant, therefore, who, for example, falsely accuses a member of the Garda Síochána of assaulting him is already liable to criminal sanction.</P>
    <P>In its first triennial report, covering the years 1987 to 1989, the Garda Síochána Complaints Board considered the question of further criminalisation of vexatious complaints but did not recommend an amendment of the Act to introduce penalties in such cases.  The Board felt that further criminalisation might deter more genuine complainants than truly malicious ones.  Furthermore, the Board felt that the effect on the admissibility of complaints could be the opposite to what was intended in that, if decisions to refuse to admit complaints were likely to be used as a foundation for criminal prosecutions, the Board and its Chief Executive would be obliged to admit all such complaints unless satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that they were vexatious.</P>
    <P>The Board stated in its 1992 annual report that it would address the question of frivolous and vexatious complaints in its triennial report later this year.</P>
    <P>I will consider carefully any further recommendations which the Board may choose to make in this matter.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the civil cases heard at the most recent sittings of Cork Circuit Court in May, 1994 were filed in the office of that Court in May, 1992. This represents a delay of twenty four months.  I am very concerned by this level of delay and I am committed to using the resources available to me to reduce these delays.</P>
      <P>In relation to delays in the Circuit Court generally I would refer the Deputy to my Minister's for State reply to Questions Nos. 6 and 46 on 9 March, 1994 (Vol, 440, No. 2, Col. 325).</P>
      <P>I could not undertake by way of reply to a parliamentary question to make known any proposals I might have which require the consideration and approval of the Government.</P>
      <P>It must be emphasised, however, that the time taken for the hearing and disposal of civil cases is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are outside the control of the courts.</P>
      <P>Over 50 per cent of all civil cases issued are subsequently not pursued through the court system.  Of those that are, no case is listed for hearing until a notice of trial is lodged by the parties involved.  The time that elapses between the issue of the proceedings and the lodgement of a notice of trial is entirely in the hands of the parties.  Once a case is listed for hearing it is subject to applications for adjournment from either party.  Indeed in many instances, cases are not pressed forward by or are adjourned at the request of legal advisors in the interests of their clients.</P>

      <P>Section 146 of the Finance Act, 1994, which enacted section 138 of the original Finance Bill, imposes a requirement of a certificate of clearance from capital acquisitions tax and probate tax in relation to applications for registration of title to land which are based on possession. This section is essentially an anti-evasion provision designed to ensure that such registrations do not provide a vehicle for evading the payment of tax liabilities.</P>
      <P>The requirement of a certificate applies to all possession based registrations after 23 May 1994 provided the application was received by the Land Registry on or after 11 April 1994 &mdash; i.e. the date of publication of the 1994 Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the operation of the scheme will allow for the obtaining of the required certificate in advance of the application to the Land Registry.  This approach is designed to minimise any element of delay.  It is envisaged that the applicant for title, or his professional representative, will make application to the Revenue Commissioners for the certificate giving material information in relation to the prior title. Such information, which will need to be produced in any event in order to satisfy the requirements for registration, will relate to all gifts and inheritances of the property sicne 28 February 1974 or the date of the last registration if later.  Tax reference numbers of applicants for certificates will not be required.  Once the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any liability to capital acquisitions tax, gift tax or probate tax charged on the lands has been, or will be, discharged, a certificate will be issued.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as with any new scheme, the operational aspects will be kept under review to ensure that the scheme runs smoothly and achieves its objective with minimal compliance cost.</P>

      <Quest>in the context of her reply to the Adjournment debate of 24 February 1994, in relation to the reduction of fines in the case of a person who had petitioned about a fine for the non-payment of a television licence, whether notice of the petition was given to An Post, who prosecuted the case, and to the judge who dealt with the matter in court.</Quest>

      <P>Ministers for Justice, down the years, have refused to provide details concerning individual petition applications on the grounds that individual petitioners, who are availing themselves of a statutory right, are entitled to their privacy.  On the Adjournment debate to which the Deputy refers I mentioned a case, in non-specific terms, simply for the purpose of illustrating the type of situation where clemency might be exercised on humanitarian grounds as an alternative to a person's committal to prison in default of payment of a fine.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to provide further details concerning this particular case but I can say that each petition is considered on its merits having regard to the grounds of the petition, offence involved and penalty imposed.  Where I deem it necessary, I seek reports from various sources, including the prosecuting authority and the presiding judge.  In practice, such reports would rarely be sought where circumstances of the kind I mentioned on the Adjournment debate were involved.</P>

      <P>The committal of a child between 15 and 17 in the case of a girl, or 15 and 16 in the case of a boy, to an adult prison can only be effected where he or she is charged with or has been convicted of a criminal offence and where the trial judge has signed an unruly certificate under section 97 or 102 of the Children Act 1908.  The number of such children committed to adult prisons annually is very small.  The new female prison currently being planned will include a separate provision for girls.  Committed males who are between 15 and 16 years of age will continue to be accommodated at the Place of Detention, Wheatfield, the most modern facility available, which caters specifically for younger offenders; those on remand are at present accommodated in Mountjoy but I am examining the possibility of accommodating these also in Wheatfield.  I should add that custodial facilities for children under 15 years of age, and those over 15 for whom there is not an unruly certificate, are the responsibility of the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board is responsible for the provision of services at St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  My Department made additional capital funding available to the board in 1993 for redecoration and refurbishment of units on the complex of St. Ita's.  The unit for the elderly has been completely refurbished over the past two years and the psychiatric services admission unit is at present undergoing extensive redecorating.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Eastern Health Board to maintain 150 beds on the complex for mental handicap services.  Extensive upgrading of the mental handicap service has already taken place and a further sum of £100,000 has been made available to the board this year to continue this work.</P>
      <P>In the light of the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals on his most recent visit to the hospital, I am satisfied that maintenance work at the hospital is not being neglected while recognising that there is still scope for improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the psychiatric services report <i>Planning for the Future,</i> and the mental handicap services report <i>Needs and Abilities</i>, a more comprehensive <Col N="1872" /> community-based service is being developed for psychiatric patients and mental handicap clients.  This means there will be less need for long-stay beds at St. Ita's as they are gradually being replaced by community residential facilities for people whose needs can be met more appropriately outside of large hospitals.  It is the intention of the Eastern Health Board that certain sections of St. Ita's Hospital will be vacated. However, the board will retain a number of services on the complex and, to this end, facilities which will be required on a long term basis, will be upgraded.</P>
    <P>As part of the development plan for mental handicap services at St. Ita's Hospital my Department has provided additional revenue funding to allow 47 people with mental handicap to move to more suitable accommodation in 1994.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has set aside a sum of £1 million to continue with the programme of providing more suitable community-based residential facilities, over the next four years, for a further 100 residents with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>A Charter of Rights already exists for patients attending general hospitals setting out what patients have a right to expect when they receive treatment.  It is my intention to produce a similar charter for the mentally ill in the near future which will emphasise the need to improve the quality of all aspects of the services available to them.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice to provide alternative papers for the Leaving Certificate examination.</P>
      <P>Replacement question papers were made available in two subjects for this year's Leaving Certificate examination because the Department of Justice informed my Department, on 23 May, that an individual Garda officer had received reports from a confidential and reliable source that copies of Leaving Certificate question papers in German and English were in circulation.</P>
      <P>Subsequent Garda inquiries have not produced direct evidence to substantiate these reports.</P>
      <P>Because of the rigorous security procedures which are in place, students, parents and teachers need not be concerned about reports of leaks of examination papers or other breaches in security which circulate from time to time.  All reports are monitored carefully and appropriate action is taken if deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>In this particular instance, as the report had come from the Department of Justice and had originated with the Gards, and because of my concern for the integrity of the examination system, I instructed that replacement papers in German and English should be provided for the Leaving Certificate examination.  I should emphasise that the papers in question are replacement papers, not alternative papers, and that the examination time-table was not affected in any way.</P>
      <P>The son of the person referred to was unable to sit the examination in two subjects in the Leaving Certificate in 1993 through illness.</P>
      <P>While special arrangements are made to facilitate candidates with disabilities and candidates in hospital through illness, these arrangements all involve sitting the examination on the scheduled day.  It is not feasible to hold alternative examination sessions for individual students who are taken ill.  This had been explained to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>As I recently announced in the context of the 1994 Education budget, an additional 55 schools have been designated as disadvantaged for capitation grant purposes in the current year.</P>
      <P>I regret that the school in question did not rate high enough on the priority list for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on this occasion.</P>
