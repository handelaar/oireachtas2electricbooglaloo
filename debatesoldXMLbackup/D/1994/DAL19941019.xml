    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has become characterised by unattributable briefings and background announcements subsequently clarified by others who believe that such announcements should have been made in a different way.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether a breach of privilege was involved in the disclosure of the contents of the Courts Bill to people outside the House first? Are the reports in today's newspapers of the contents of that Bill accurate and, if so, when will the Members of the House responsible for introducing it receive a copy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of an alleged breach of privilege the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is the appropriate place to have that matter raised.  In respect of Deputy Bruton's query I can inform the House that, under the rulings of the Chair, publication in newspapers of the apparent content of proposed legislation which had not been made known to the House has been ruled not to be a <i>prima facie</i> breach of privilege and I can quote the references for that if the House desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For clarification purposes, the House was told the Bill would be in the hands of all Members this week.  Publication of details of the Courts Bill in the newspapers is not and was never deemed to be a breach of privilege.  The Department of Justice and the Minister for Justice always make known their plans and proposals to security correspondents in the first instance.  The set of far-reaching reforms in the proposed Bill has been welcomed by both parties in Government, has received widespread acceptance and a good deal of work has been done in the past ten days on those proposals. I am surprised Deputy Bruton has taken exception; it is not clear to me what he has taken exception to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>Last week the Minister for Foreign Affairs made announcements about justice legislation and now the Minister for Justice has made announcements on it.  In that respect the Taoiseach described her as doing it her way.  Is that the Government's way, Dick Spring's way, her way, or has the Government lost its way?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Justice was reminded of the title of the Cranberries' album, namely, &ldquo;Everybody else is doing it, why can't I?&rdquo;  This proposed legislation is item No. 11 on the schedule of legislation circulated by the Government Whip yesterday. I ask the Taoiseach to congratulate the Attorney General on the speed with which he has produced this legislation, for which he deserves the congratulations of all Members.</P>
      <P>On item No. 6 on the schedule dealing with information on termination of pregnancy, will the Taoiseach indicate if the Minister for Health will follow the example of the Minister for Justice and publish details of that proposed legislation so that Deputies will have an opportunity to read the broad scope of the legislation in advance of receiving the Bill?  Will he brief the health correspondents and follow the good example set up by the Minister for Justice in the way she briefed security correspondents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach needs to be reminded that the country had a referendum almost two years ago when it was decided information on abortion should be made available to our people.  Will he indicate when that Bill will be published? Will it be published as quickly as the Courts Bill, which was welcomed? The Taoiseach should not confuse that Bill with the Freedom of Information Bill which he continually does.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <P>A serious situation has arisen as a result of a Circuit Court judgment last week where hearsay evidence from professionals cannot now be heard in court.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak on this Bill which affords us an opportunity to talk about money, the money system and the investment of funds.  I am delighted that old legislation dating back to 1799 is now being replaced with a modern regulatory procedure.  I have felt for a long time that all pre-Independence laws should be systematically replaced by Irish statutes so that all laws governing <Col N="15" /> us are ones that have been passed by an independent Irish Parliament.</P>
      <P>It is welcome that are are at last taking control of another sector of our financial affairs.  It amazes me that it has taken until 1994 to set up an independent Stock Exchange.  I know there are historic reasons for the present set-up. In the 1970s the London Stock Exchange was changed to make it the main Stock Exchange in a federation of stock exchanges.  It is important in an independent State with an independent currency to have a Stock Exchange of our own and I am glad EC Directives have ensured this will happen.</P>
      <P>Questions have been raised in the debate as to why the Central Bank should become the regulatory authority. To date the Central Bank probably has not had great expertise in the matter of the Stock Exchange, but there is no reason it could not build up or buy in the expertise to become an effective regulatory authority.  The group or body regulating the Stock Exchange must be totally independent of the exchange and it is sensible to provide that the Central Bank regulates the new Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>I notice in the brief circulated that the board of the Stock Exchange will include independent members representing the public interest, but I hope they will not be drawn exclusively from the business community.  Everybody has an interest in the Stock Exchange, it is important that the independent members are seen to be in a position of public trust and take a public interest approach to their position on the board of the Stock Exchange.  I hope an effort will be made to appoint people from outside the small circle of big business to represent public interest on the exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a reservation about the mechanism in the Bill which provides that the Stock Exchange will carry out investigations in the initial stages into breaches of its rules.  Self-regulation may cause problems.  I accept that all reports of <Col N="16" /> such investigation will have to be submitted to the Central Bank, but I am a little uneasy about the position where alleged breaches will be investigated by the Stock Exchange itself.</P>
    <P>On the operation of the Stock Exchange, we must consider some of the trends that have developed over the years.  I will deal later with the role of institutional investors on the Stock Exchange.  Speculation in shares is still prevalent and that is all right in its own way.  The Stock Exchange is self-fulfilling in its prophecies.  In other words money is made on the basis of rumour and expectations.  For example, if it is believed the market is good, people buy and as a result the market improves. The expectation reinforces the reality.  I do not know if we can prevent that and there are inherent dangers in this practice as the price of shares can increase beyond their real value based purely on sympathy.  Similarly, when people sell shares the price goes down, thereby encouraging others to sell.  It is a self-reinforcing system where prices are far in excess of those warranted by the changes in the outside world.</P>
    <P>In times of rapid movement on the Stock Exchange fortunes are made and lost.  For those with information, particularly private investors who make a business of investing in the Stock Exchange and the movement of shares, fortunes are made.  Making money in those circumstances does not generate wealth in society.  Those who speculate on the Stock Exchange for the purpose of making money do not create wealth.</P>
    <P>Another question raised by a previous speaker is that of insider trading. In view of what I said about the self-reinforcing prophecies on the Stock Exchange, the question of legitimate knowledge as opposed to insider trading is of great importance.  Strict rules should be enforced to prevent insider trading.  However, I foresee difficulties in distinguishing between legitimate knowledge and inside information which could be used to unfair advantage. For example, it could be common knowledge that the demand for timber <Col N="17" /> will increase rapidly in future years and in those circumstances it would be fair for people to invest in the expectation that there will be huge growth in that industry.  However, there are also instances where people make large amounts of money as a result of gaining knowledge within companies.  It is important for confidence in the Stock Exchange that there is strict implementation of the rules and regulations to ensure that inside knowledge is not used.</P>
    <P>A vast amount of money is invested in shares on the Stock Exchange on behalf of ordinary citizens who would never dream of investing directly in the exchange&mdash;I refer to institutional investors.  Taking into account pension and life insurance funds and other funds operated through banks and so on, by far the largest amount of money on the Stock Exchange is transacted through institutional investors.  There is an obligation on institutional investors to maximise the return, irrespective of how they get that return.  These people obviously work on a world market and this issue raises many questions regarding the rights of people buying into pension or life insurance funds to have some say in where their money is spent and in what it is invested.  It is in this area that huge sums of money come into play.  Pension funds and life insurance policies may be used, unknown to the people who take out those policies, for exploitative purposes in this country or the Third World.</P>
    <P>Some of us would be curious to know where our money is invested; we would like to think it is being put to good use. While I accept this runs counter to the maximisation of profits, that should not be the sole criterion for investment fund managers.  That is their remit at present.</P>
    <P>In the future &mdash; there has been some movement in this direction &mdash; a person will be able to invest in a life insurance policy under which a certain pecentage or all of the funds will be invested in an environmentally friendly programme rather than in a programme to fund cutting down the rain forests in the <Col N="18" /> Third World.  There should be widespread investment to ensure not alone profits but that funds will be invested for environmental purposes.  This should be considered by investment fund managers.  If I was offered the choice I would prefer to invest in a life insurance policy or a pension fund under which the money would be used for environmental purposes or a proportion, 20 per cent to 30 per cent, would be invested in companies in the west.  I would be willing to accept a lower dividend in the knowledge that the funds would be used to support projects acceptable to me.</P>
    <P>Investment fund managers should provide more information to those who buy policies; people will demand to know where their money is being invested and a wider choice so that they will be able to make informed choices as to the purposes for which their money will be used.  There is scope for widening the choice of policies available to the purchaser given the huge sums involved and that money invested here can be used throughout the globe.  We have no say in the way this money is used by investment fund managers on our behalf.  It is time the consumer had greater choice in these matters.</P>
    <P>On the way in which small businesses are financed, the Stock Exchange is not a mechanism for raising funds except funding for major businesses and the larger of the unlisted businesses in this country.  If we accept that most businesses here are small employing between five and 35 people, we need a mechanism whereby funding can be made readily available to small businesses. A certain proportion of investment funds should be allocated for this purpose.  This could be done by way of tax incentives.  One will find that few small businesses have raised capital through the mechanism of the Stock Exchange.  It is a fallacy to believe the Stock Exchange helps small businesses, rather Stock Exchange investors act in a prudent manner and tend to invest in banks and major corporations as they carry a lower risk.  In investing in a life <Col N="19" /> insurance policy or pension fund the consumer should have a choice and should have the option to invest a certain proportion perhaps 5 per cent, in small businesses.  In return he would receive a lower dividend.  Ba mhaith liom míle fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  Tá sé thar am go mbeadh malartán stoic dár gcuid féin againn sa tír seo.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill which has not been presented before its time; it is over 200 years since the last legislation relating to the Stock Exchange was introduced.  The Stock Exchange is in need of reform and I welcome the Government's decision to introduce legislation to modernise it. During the past 50 years there has been a revolution in the financial and investment markets both here and throughout the world.  The previous speaker raised the use to which finance should be put and the lack of support for small businesses in particular.  We should support moves at European level towards a single European currency as this would prevent speculation in the financial markets.  A small percentage of people have made huge profits in this way although it is the ordinary man in the street who has to foot the bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the early eighties the financial markets have changed.  Technology, in the form of computers, has had a major effect.  Today financial markets throughout the world do not close; as the Dow Jones market in America closes the Japanese market begins to trade.  This legislation is necessary to assist the Irish Stock Exchange deal with the changing nature of the world's financial markets by placing responsibility on the Central Bank and the Irish Stock Exchange. The Bill has been prompted also by the <Col N="20" /> introduction of two European directives, the Investment Service Directive and the Capital Adequacy Directive.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank is the most important and powerful body in terms of the regulation of banks and financial institutions in Ireland and it makes complete sense for the Government to charge it with the responsibility of regulating the Stock Exchange and its member firms.  In short, the Central Bank has the knowledge, the experience and the expertise to do the job.  It will take over the regulation of the Stock Exchange and its member firms in Ireland.  There is one Stock Exchange in Ireland which is part of the International Stock Exchange of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some people will argue that giving the Central Bank such a role will create a new layer of bureaucracy for the Stock Exchange.  I do not agree as the Central Bank's primary role is a supervisory one.  The Stock Exchange will regulate its own affairs on a day to day basis and the Central Bank will simply lay down the rules and step in if difficulties arise. I believe the Central Bank must ensure that the Irish Stock Exchange operates to the highest and most scrupulous standards. This Bill demands that it does and so too do the public.  The Irish Stock Exchange has been given the required powers to maintain and enforce such standards.  Above all the Central Bank must carry out its duties in a manner which ensures that the new regime operates with openness, transparency and most important of all, accountability.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made by some Opposition Deputies about the measures in this Bill to deal with insider trading.  The Central Bank must ensure that the Irish Stock Exchange operates to the highest standards and I would expect that it would deal very particularly with insider trading.  Insider trading is adequately dealt with in the 1990 Companies Act, a very lengthy and cumbersome Act.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange, which splits from the International Exchange next <Col N="21" /> April together with its ten member firms, will have to apply to the Central Bank for approval to operate.  The Irish Stock Exchange will have to become a limited company and appoint a new board &mdash; replacing the existing council &mdash; which will be made up of the representatives of the member firms and independent directors, whose appointments have to be approved by the Central Bank.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the composition of this board reflects equally all of the groups and interests who should be represented on such a board.  I suggest also that the board should be set certain tasks and standards strictly in accordance with the new legislation and that it should be charged with ensuring that the public is given information in simple terms on the operation of the Stock Exchange.  In many respects the Stock Exchange is a mysterious organisation with only those who are involved in it knowing about it. We must get the balance right between the interests of member firms and institutions and the general public.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank will be able to impose conditions and regulations on the Stock Exchange and its member firms.  This is a welcome step.  The Central Bank will be able also to appoint inspectors to investigate breaches of conditions and regulations by the Stock Exchange and its member firms and also breaches of the Stock Exchange rules.  To ensure that the Central Bank can carry out its duties and ensure the Stock Exchange operates within defined parameters, the Bill outlines a very comprehensive procedure in the event of any institution breaking the law.  All breaches of the Stock Exchange rules will be investigated by the exchange in the first instance and a report of the outcome of the investigation will be made to the Central Bank.  The Ministers for Enterprise and Employment and Finance will be able to obtain and publish the reports.  I urge the Ministers to do just that because the Stock Exchange is shrouded in mystery.  The general public sees pictures on television of huge dealing rooms full of computers with people <Col N="22" /> buying and selling all over the world.  At the end of the day it is the general public who has to pay.  I hope those reports will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that Members can debate and discuss them.  It is very rare that we get such an opportunity, hence the lack of interest in this type of financial activity and in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will be supporting the general thrust of this Bill but in doing so I wish to outline some general remarks, query certain matters and indicate my considerable reservations on one or two aspects. I look forward to the Committee Stage debate when we will have a more detailed discussion.  I shall listen with interest to the Minister's concluding address on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides a mechanism for the severing of the relationship between the Dublin and London exchanges and makes the Central Bank the supervisor of the Irish Stock Exchange.  That is the way it should be.  It always appeared to me, and I am sure to others, that while we had political independence, financially we were still dependent on London. Some of us are old enough to remember that the Dublin unit joined the London exchange with a fanfare of trumpets. The Bill provides for the future.  It was not too long ago that there existed two exchanges, one in Dublin and the other in Cork.  Today the Dublin Centre for Commercial Law Studies is running a seminar on this Bill with a panel of the usual speakers addressing various aspects.  I assume we shall be reading reports of the expert advice offered.  I hope that reports of this type of seminar will provide the general public with information it can understand on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that this Bill is one from a menu of important commercial law issues presented to this House in recent months and it will shortly be joined by the Foreign Trusts Bill from the same stable.  I suppose we cannot be too far away from a revised Unit Trusts Bill and other important Bills which will tighten up and control financial dealings and company law itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> As I understand it there are two essential purposes for a stock exchange, to raise funds for industry and to provide a method of matching buyers and sellers to their mutual advantage.  With regard to raising capital for industry I have to question seriously whether the exchange is acting as the principal agent for such funding.  In recent years the number of prospectuses lodged with the Companies Office does not show any evidence that the providers of capital see the Stock Exchange as the principal source of funding.  If the business expansion scheme was not available I wonder whether substantial funding would go towards productive industry and, more importantly, to job creation.  In saying that I am aware that three of the largest providers of jobs in County Louth are quoted on the Stock Exchange, namely, Fyffes, Flogas and Cement Roadstone.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to define what he sees as the principal role of the Stock Exchange.  If it is as I indicated earlier, perhaps he will engage in meaningful dialogue with the exchange to ensure it performs that role.  Sections of industry, the trade unions and the general public do not believe it is doing so.  In many cases the general public's view of the Stock Exchange is that of a huge money lending organisation; others see it as a glorified gambling casino where people make or lose millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>It is quite expensive to become quoted on the Stock Exchange and there are many regulations which might daunt an entrepreneur from seeking funding from investors.  Historically, those who deposit money, notwithstanding inflation, get the lowest rate of interest.  With a little creative impulse I am sure investors would support exchange quoted companies but the current number of Irish listings would not be to anyone's advantage</P>
    <P>The second role of the exchange is that of a market provider.  I appreciate that many of the issues relating to listed companies are provided for under the Companies Act.  However, the exchange has a decided impact on the operations <Col N="24" /> of listed companies by means of its own rules.  In this regard I must admit considerable scepticism about how the exchange governs its activities.  Insider trading, for example, is contrary to the Companies Act, 1990 and the exchange must report on compliance with that Act to my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>I am aware that two listed companies are currently suspended from trading on the Exchange.  These are not recent suspensions and they have the consequence of locking in unfortunate shareholders.  It is shareholders whose life savings and pensions have been earned over 40 or 50 years who are the main victims of these activities.  One of the companies suspended had a court inspector's report on its activities presented to the High Court within the past few days.  What will be done about this?  Will it be allowed to drag on without any prosecution if there has been a default or if the law has been broken? It certainly appears to the public that people who break the law in this regard can get away with anything, but if an itinerant steals a bag of groceries he or she will probably be imprisoned for six months.  Why has this problem not been investigated?</P>
    <P>I have a number of important questions in relation to various sections of the Bill but it would be more appropriate to raise those questions on Committee Stage.  In general the Bill represents a move forward.  It has been too long since any attempt was made to upgrade legislation governing the main financial institution of the State.  I commend the Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister on bringing forward such important legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  My colleague outlined the necessity for markets of this kind in a modern economy, particularly in a small economy such as ours, to raise funding for Government borrowing, to provide much needed equity for industry and <Col N="25" /> services and also to provide a general barometer of economic performance.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary aspect of the Bill &mdash; and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward &mdash; is that it took so long to bring it before the House.  It could be argued that this is the type of Bill that should have been drafted in the early 1920s or which certainly should have accompanied the Central Bank Act in 1942 or, at the very latest, in 1971.  It is extraordinary that at this late stage the archaic and often hidden world of the Irish Stock Exchange is at last being made subject to regulation and to the full glare of this House.</P>
      <P>The general public has had a negative impression of this area, whether from fictional accounts or real abuses on Wall Street and in London and the kind of extraordinary activity that takes place on the new exchanges in eastern Europe.  For the ordinary small investor and for the many millions of people who indirectly invest on the Stock Exchange through pension funds, it is critical that we bring forward this legislation.</P>
      <P>No matter what area we are dealing with, whether it is our colleagues in the Four Courts, ourselves as politicians or perhaps the accountancy profession, with which we dealt in a recent debate, self-regulation simply does not work.  At a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts we had a discussion about events earlier this year in relation to Davy Stockbrokers.  It seemed to me that we were led a merry dance from the Dublin Stock Exchange to the London Stock Exchange and back again to Dublin over many months, during which time it was difficult to see what action, under their own rules, the London and the Irish Stock Exchange were prepared to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the ordinary observer it seems that there were clear conflicts of interest in this area.  Misleading information and insider information was often provided. There was a recent famous example on the London Stock Exchange which highlighted the fact that its activities are very open to this type of abuse.  There was extreme reluctance on the part of <Col N="26" /> the authorities concerned to recognise when an abuse was taking place, whether directly in the trading of shares, in underwriting or in the other activities of the exchange.  Self-regulation simply does not work and the Minister is right to bring this institution within the remit of our Central Bank legislation.</P>
    <P>One could examine the whole role of the Stock Exchange in Irish history over the past 200 years.  The Minister or his colleague referred to the economic life of Ireland 200 years ago and the way the Act we are now repealing was simply rushed in before the Act of Union when we entered into the long, dark shadow of direct English rule in the 19th century up to 1922.  During the past 200 years, and particularly during the last 75 years of independence, the fundamental role of raising capital for Irish business has not been very well fulfilled by the Stock Exchange.  Far from fulfilling this role, the Stock Exchange tries to avoid it at all costs and, as a result, many firms such as Dunnes Stores felt they were better off raising capital privately.</P>
    <P>The development of the Central Bank and the increased role given to it in 1971 may well be related to the fact that in 1973, with fanfare, the Irish Stock Exchange became part of the international Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.  We looked forward to a new era.  Insider trading in London was legal and there were few resources to provide the necessary capital in this market.  If we have a properly regulated market and dealers, managers and boards acting with a due sense of probity and particularly concerned for the small investor, we can be hopeful that Irish business will have greater confidence in the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>The Minister has power under the Bill to bring reports, formations of boards and so on before the House.  Will he &mdash; and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment &mdash; look at the level of Stock Exchange charges and fees and see if they are an impediment to small <Col N="27" /> Irish companies utilising the resources of the market for development?</P>
    <P>The big bang had a fundamental effect on efficiency and competition on the London market.  However, there seems to be a 19th century <i>modus operandi</i> in Anglesea Street.  The Minister was probably interested in the Conference of Religious of Ireland which examined areas where socially responsible investment could be made.  My party would like to see the Central Bank encouraging the market to invest in those areas.  Many observers feel the connection between the major banks and the stockbroking firms is overly close and unhealthy.  Perhaps under the new structure and methods of regulation this will be examined.</P>
    <P>In some respects Frankfurt will become, ever so slightly, the financial centre of this country.  It is interesting that the Bill implements the investment services directive which will ensure a common standard for all investment firms and brings forward methods of supervision.  Once again we have been prodded into action on something we were loath to tackle by the determination of our European colleagues.  The Bill also gives effect to the capital adequacy directive.  We can set out the adequate levels of capital which investment firms must have.  The Central Bank will have a key determining role to play in this area.  Self regulation does not work and I look forward to the implementation of section 9 regarding the Central Bank's ability to vet the Stock Exchange or any potential Stock Exchange before it is approved.  I also welcome the provisions regarding the boards of Stock Exchanges.  The Minister has taken an interesting initiative in insisting that not only the operators of Stock Exchanges but the users and representatives of the public interest, particularly the small investor, must be on those boards before they are approved.  This will bring the Stock Exchange into the domain of public debate.  From time to time the Minister will lay reports on the Stock Exchange <Col N="28" /> before the House.  Perhaps a representative from local government should be on the board of the Irish Stock Exchange because it is a key economic element in the life of the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions regarding the Central Bank in section 9 and the special role given to the Minister and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  If a stock exchange disagrees with any of the Central Bank judgements it may appeal to the Minister and he will make a decision on the matter. That is a useful approach and will restore control over the Stock Exchange to this House.  The Minister has inserted strong powers in the Bill.  A stock exchange may have its licence revoked. In Part III I welcome the similar provisions regarding member firms and the proposal to publish a register of firms which will be freely available and open to public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Section 4 gives a careful synopsis of the central elements the bank will pursue to supervise and regulate the Stock Exchange.  Advertising is often a critical element of the operation of stock exchanges and dealers.  There is provision for any instructions the bank or the Minister want to insert being prominently displayed and published.</P>
    <P>There is lengthy coverage in the Bill of the role of auditors in supervising the accounts of stock exchanges and member firms.  In section 36 there is provision for a second audit if the bank is not happy with the information it receives from the Stock Exchange or member firms' own audit.  The Minister has laid down other important measures and standards whereby that can be rigorously pursued.</P>
    <P>It is stated that the Central Bank may be happy where codes of conduct have been drawn up by the Stock Exchange or a member firm.  The phrase &ldquo;making a reasonable effort to avoid a conflict of interest&rdquo; is too loose as it is open to abuse by unscrupulous people. However, we can deal with that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> I welcome the initiatives by the Minister in this area.  It is not his fault it has taken 67 years to introduce this legislation. Since he took up office he has been considering such legislation and I welcome the thorough way in which he has dealt with this area.  As my colleague said, under the legal system some people are punished very severely for minor crimes.  At long last we have an outline of the major punishments which may be inflicted on the transgressors of the provisions of this Bill.  In terms of the Irish financial services sector, I hope the Bill will bring the stock exchange out of the early 19th century and into the 20th century and that stock exchange firms will examine the severe criticisms of their failure to provide the equity capital necessary for the development of a dynamic economy. I ask the Minister to consider at some stage the fees and charges in the market.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate this morning and last Thursday afternoon and welcome the opportunity to reply to the debate.  The Stock Exchange Bill will make substantial changes in the regulation of stock exchanges and member firms and I am glad to have heard the views of Members on what it proposes.  I am also glad there is broad support for the Bill, as indicated by the Opposition spokespersons, Deputies Yates and McDowell. It is fair to say this support has been reflected in the contributions of Deputies Broughan and Bell and other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main points of the Bill can be quickly described.  The Bill marks a radical departure from the Stock Exchange (Dublin) Act, 1799, the basic legislation in this area which has survived for nearly 200 years.  The main requirements of that Act are that individuals selling gilts on commission have a licence to do so &mdash; in modern times this requirement is met where a stockbroking firm employs a person who <Col N="30" /> holds a gilt licence &mdash; and that stock exchange rules be approved by the Minister for Finance, who has, however, no power to initiate changes in such rules.  The Bill proposes to establish the Central Bank as the regulatory authority for stock exchanges and their member firms, require exchanges and member firms to get authorisation from the Central Bank and equip the bank with powers to monitor and supervise an exchange's surveillance of its member firms and to set down requirements and conditions which exchanges and member firms must meet.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also give significant powers to the two Ministers who are closely involved in this area, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  The Minister for Finance, with the consent of his colleague, will have power to set down guidelines to assist the Central Bank in administering the system of regulation.  He will also, again with the consent of his colleague, be able to obtain reports of stock exchange disciplinary proceedings and to publish them where the Ministers think it proper to do so having regard to the public good and the rights of any person referred to in the reports.  This, represents a considerable advance on the present situation and I am sure the House will agree it is proper that Ministers should have this power and the other powers provided for them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to make the Stock Exchange more transparent in other ways also.  It obliges the Exchange to have a board of directors which is broadly based and which strikes a balance between the interests of the member firms and users of the Exchange and the public interest.  Moreover, the board will have to include enough independent members to promote the protection of investors and the maintenance of proper standards.  While these provisions are aimed at ensuring openness and transparency, I am confident that over time they will also be seen as having benefited stock exchanges and their member firms.  This is because they will <Col N="31" /> produce greater accountability, and this in turn will increase investor confidence.</P>
    <P>The Bill reflects the provisions of two European Union directives.  The Investment Services Directive, which must be provided for in national legislation by 1 July 1995, obliges member states to ensure a common standard of regulation for investment firms, while the Capital Adequacy Directive sets out the levels of capital which investment firms must have in their business.  My Department, in consultation with the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, is preparing legislation to implement these directives in respect of non-stock-exchange investment intermediaries and I will introduce that legislation in the House in due course.  In the meantime, the Bill will meet our obligations in respect of stock exchange member firms arising from the two directives.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the points made by Deputies during the debate.  A common point, raised by Deputies Yates, McDowell, Rabbitte and Kemmy, was the level of the Central Bank's experience and expertise to act as the regulatory authority for stock exchanges and member firms.  I am satisfied that the bank has the necessary skills and experience to carry out its functions.  The bank's supervisory responsibilities for financial institutions began in 1971 when it assumed responsibility for the supervision of licensed banks.  It has been inspecting the activities of banks since the mid-1970s.  These activities include highly-sophisticated treasury and investment operations.  The bank was given responsibility for the regulation of building societies in 1989.</P>
    <P>Recent years have seen significant developments in the area of supervision, particularly in respect of non-deposit-taking financial institutions.  For example, the bank supervises approximately 60 firms in the International Financial Services Centre ranging from large securities houses to smaller intermediaries. These firms are engaged in a <Col N="32" /> wide range of investment business, much of which involves trading and investing in international securities and derivatives.  The instruments of supervision used in respect of these firms include risk based capital requirements, segregation of client funds, frequent reporting, review meetings and regular inspections.</P>
    <P>In 1989, the bank was given responsibility for regulating the Irish Futures and Options Exchange, IFOX, which has been subject to detailed supervision by the bank since then.  More recently FINEX Europe, a branch of the Financial Instrument Exchange, FINEX, which is a division of the New York Cotton Exchange, NYCE, was set up at the Irish Financial Service Centre.  The bank has established a mechanism for the supervision of members operating in FINEX Europe and for approving Exchange rules.  Since FINEX is supervised in the US by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, the bank has developed a close relationship with this regulator to ensure that common standards are applied in Dublin and New York.  This process entails training of staff and a continuing dialogue with the members of the commission on matters of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>In 1989, the bank was appointed as the competent authority in respect of Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferrable Securities, UCITS.  At the end of 1990, the bank was appointed supervisor in the area of unit trusts.  At around the same time the Companies Act, 1990, gave the bank responsibility for the authorisation of collective investment schemes in a company structure. More recently, the Government introduced the Investment Limited Partnerships Act, 1994, which allows collective investment schemes to be established in the form of limited partnerships. The bank is now responsible for the supervision of some 220 collective investment schemes in Ireland which have in excess of £10 billion under management.  If anyone doubted <Col N="33" /> its ability to carry out this new role they will change their mind now.</P>
    <P>The bank's supervisory approach involves considerable interaction with supervised institutions through regular review meetings and inspections.  The bank has developed a considerable body of supervisory experience over the period, much of it in activities not dissimilar to stockbroking such as treasury and investment dealing.  The bank, through its banking supervision role, is currently indirectly responsible for the prudential supervision of the stockbroking arms of the Irish banks and as part of this role already carries out prudential inspection of these firms.  In addition, the bank regularly meets international supervisory bodies and has contact with overseas regulations either to give or seek assistance or to exchange views on current regulatory practice. The bank attended all meetings of technical experts in drawing up the EU Investment Services Directive and the Capital Adequacy Directive and attends implementation meetings on these Directives and other relevant EU fora. The bank is also a member of the International Organisation of Securities Commission, the international umbrella organisation for supervisors of investment firms.</P>
    <P>Staff of the relevant department of the bank have considerable regulatory experience and the substantial majority have relevant graduate, post-graduate or professional qualifications.  The qualifications of staff have been supplemented by a strong emphasis on external technical training in the financial area in recent years.  The bank will continue to develop its resources through internal training and external recruitment.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear from all of this that the bank has indeed the experience, expertise and trained staff it needs to carry out successfully its functions under this Bill.  This is the type of expertise this House would wish it to have so that it can carry out its functions in a growing complex area of the financial world.  I should add that the bank <Col N="34" /> will include a statement of how it has exercised these functions in its annual report, which is required to be laid before the Oireachtas under the Central Bank Act, 1989.  This will ensure that the House is kept informed of developments in the bank's functions when the Bill has been enacted.  This covers Deputy Bell's query concerning our contact with what is happening.</P>
    <P>On a related point, Deputy Yates claimed that while the Central Bank has extensive powers of supervision the provisions granting these powers were enabling rather than obligatory, and argued that they should be made obligatory. The Deputy will see that I cannot agree with this approach.  Section 28 lays on the bank a clear obligation to administer the system of regulation and supervision of stock exchanges and their member firms in accordance with the provisions of the Act in order to promote the maintenance of proper and orderly regulation and the protection of investors.  In addition, the Bank will have the duty of authorising stock exchanges and member firms; in that process it will have to be satisfied with the rules and Memorandum and Articles of Association of the exchange, and these determine how the exchange members carry out their business. Deputies will also note that under section 16, the bank will be the competent authority for the purposes of the Investment Services Directive, an important component of which is the establishment of rules of conduct so that similar high standards of conduct of business by member firms apply in all member states.  Apart from this, I assure the House that the bank will be taking very seriously its functions and will be rigorous in carrying them out; I also assure the House that the bank will include a report on the exercise of its functions in its annual report, so that the Deputy will be able to judge for himself whether they have been carried out.  The Governor of the bank will shortly come before a committee of the House and that will be all the more relevant as time goes by.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> Both Deputies Yates and Rabbitte claimed that insider dealing should have been dealt with.  I want to explain again why it is not.  During the past two years as we prepared this legislation, and complementary legislation, we had much discussion on this issue and my mind has been changed in the process.  I do not condemn the Deputy for raising the issue because it is relevant to much of the discussion but the fundamental reason for not dealing with it here is that insider dealing depends on access to sensitive commercial information, and such access is not the sole prerogative of Stock Exchange member firms. Recent comments and articles in the media suggest the first people to have such access are much more likely to be company managements and their advisers than Stock Exchange member firms.  In saying this, I do not mean to cast aspersions on any individuals, companies, advisers, stock exchanges or member firms, I want to make it clear that the issue goes much deeper than simply stock exchanges and member firms.  This is why it is proper that it should be dealt with, not by the Stock Exchange Bill, but rather by company law as is the case.  The Companies Act, 1990 contains provisions on insider trading.</P>
    <P>In addition a group called the company law review group operates under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, which is responsible for company law.  This group is currently considering a number of areas of company law, including insider dealing, one of the areas referred to it by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  That Minister has asked the group to report to him by end-November 1994.  If the group identifies changes necessary in company law in so far as it relates to insider dealing.  I have no doubt the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will be anxious to bring forward legislation to provide for them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Another matter currently under <Col N="36" /> active consideration by the Department of Enterprise and Employment is a replacement for the takeover panel, a matter raised by Deputy Yates.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has undertaken to bring forward legislation in this area and legislation is being prepared by his Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates also asked when the Bill will be brought into effect and whether partnerships would continue to be allowed to be member firms of stock exchanges.  I cannot give a definitive answer on the date, because the Bill's implementation will depend on when the Irish Stock Exchange separates from the London-based Exchange of which it is a part.  The expectation is that the separation will be completed at the end of March 1995 and this is the date towards which everyone is working. However, I have been informed, in casual conversation with both sides, during the past few days that the date could well be 1 May.  The answer to the partnership question is more definite: the Bill does permit member firms to be partnerships.  The Stock Exchange however, will be required to be incorporated and I understand is making the necessary preparations for incorporation.</P>
    <P>Another area on which questions were raised was the composition of the Stock Exchange board.  I assure Deputy Yates that a deal has not been done on the 11 member board for the Irish Stock Exchange, with seven members being brokers and the other four being outsiders as he suggested.  I have no doubt that somebody was trying to lead him in one or other direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The composition of the board has not yet been settled.  We are setting down here what we see as the broad thrust of the guidelines which should represent member firms of investors and those outside.  Many points have been made by Deputy Yates and others about the independence of that <Col N="37" /> group.  In that regard I have no doubt our colleagues in the Stock Exchange will be mindful of what is being said in the House.  All Deputies who contributed have made the point about the need for the Stock Exchange to be conscious of the public interest.</P>
      <P>I will pass on to the people in the exchange the remarks made by Members of all parties in that regard. While I cannot be certain what we will achieve as a result of the debate, I hope the Stock Exchange will be conscious of what has been said about the independence of the board, a major concern of most speakers.  I will inform representatives of the Stock Exchange of the importance Members attach to this issue.</P>
      <P>The composition of the board has not yet been agreed, but, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill, it will be a broadly based board with satisfactory representation of the users of the exchange as well as members, with the public interest represented and enough independent members to promote the protection of investors and the maintenance of proper standards.  That is what I wish to achieve and, unlike the 1799 legislation, this Bill will ensure transparency.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would be difficult to go further than this in a Bill which necessarily deals with exchanges generally rather than with a particular exchange.  I noted Deputy Rabbitte's suggestion that the Bill should require the chairperson of the Stock Exchange board to be an outsider and I will reflect further on that.  The Deputies who spoke today were also of that view.</P>
      <P>Deputies Kemmy, Rabbitte and Yates raised the question of the separation of the Irish Stock Exchange from the London based exchange of which it is currently a part.  Deputy Rabbitte is correct in saying that there is no European Union directive requiring the London and Irish exchanges to separate, but I will set out the background to the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Stock Exchange became <Col N="38" /> part of what is now the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in 1973. Over the years two separate markets have in effect developed, with a common set of rules regulating brokers, but with additional rules applying to the regulation of the market in Dublin.  The nature of the Irish Stock Exchange and its relationship with the bigger exchange of which it is a part have changed with the years, for example in 1984 when the Irish Stock Exchange was appointed as the competent authority under European Union directives for company listings in this country.  A further change, of wider importance from the point of view of regulatory structures, came with the implementation of the financial services Act in the UK in 1988.  This took the responsibility for regulating stockbroking firms away from the London Stock Exchange and gave it to what is now the Securities and Futures Authority. The effect of these changes over the years has been that the Irish and London exchanges are not as inextricably linked as one might imagine.</P>
    <P>The Investment Services Directive which was finally adopted last year effectively requires stockbroking firms based in this country to be regulated by a national competent authority.  This of course raised the question of how the exchange itself would be regulated. Clearly, the most satisfactory solution is to have both the Irish market and Irish stockbrokers regulated by a national competent authority and thus avoid any ambiguity about supervisory responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The impending break with London has been a fact of life for some considerable time now and the Irish exchange has been preparing for it.  It should also be remembered that the Irish Stock Exchange was independent until comparatively recently and that it has had to withstand and learn from the competitive pressures associated with being so close to one of the foremost markets in Europe.  The future of the Irish Stock Exchange is tightly bound up with investor confidence and the Bill we <Col N="39" /> have been discussing is designed to ensure the high standard of regulation which is essential for attracting investors to a market.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary for the exchange to operate with maximum efficiency and to the highest commercial standards.  This is clearly a matter primarily for the Stock Exchange and its member firms.  However, as already pointed out, the Irish Stock Exchange has shown a very considerable capacity for nearly 200 years to adapt to changing circumstances, and I have no doubt it should be able to organise itself to meet the coming challenges successfully. We may have to work hard in that regard, but it is obvious from the discussions in which I have participated over the past two years that there is a willingness on all sides to make it work. Following the separation of the two exchanges, I hope the board will be up and running by 1995.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates asked about the provisions on advertising in section 31 of the Bill.  I should explain that the Bill is designed to cover only stock exchanges based in Ireland and their member firms.  Stockbrokers and investment intermediaries from other countries will be dealt with in the investment intermediaries legislation currently being drafted under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputies Yates and Rabbitte were anxious about whether the reports of Stock Exchange disciplinary hearings will be published.  No doubt their concern springs from a certain celebrated case in which it was not possible for the Minister for Finance even to obtain such a report, let alone to publish it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to tell the Deputies that I have addressed this matter in the Bill. Section 9 provides that a written report must be made of any disciplinary proceedings carried out by a stock exchange and that such a report must be made available to the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment where they request it.  Further, <Col N="40" /> provided the Ministers consider it proper to do so having regard to the public good and the rights of any person referred to in such a report, the report may be laid before the Oireachtas.  I assure Deputy Rabbitte that where these conditions are met, I see no reason not to lay such a report before the House; and even where consideration for individual rights precluded that, the relevant Ministers will still be able to inform the House of the thrust of such a report.  I am sure Deputies will agree that this represents a considerable advance on the situation which has obtained up to now, and a considerable step in the transparency and openness which Deputy Kemmy wanted to see.  It is fair to say that past experiences prompted this legislative change.  Otherwise, we might have re-enacted what has been the practice for a few hundred years, but I am sure we are all aware of the benefits of change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates also raised the question of marketmaking in Government securities and how it would be regulated. Marketmaking has been proposed as a market structure for the gilt market by the National Treasury Management Agency, which is working out in discussions with the market how best it might operate.  It would be premature to anticipate the result of these ongoing discussions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates claimed that detailed provisions for compensation of investors should have been included in the Bill.  Section 51 obliges member firms to tell clients or investors of any compensation arrangements available to them. It does not make specific provision for compensation because a draft EU directive on compensation for private clients of investment firms is still being discussed in Brussels.  The Irish Stock Exchange currently operates a compensation scheme which offers compensation of up to 20,000 ECU to private clients of member firms which are in default.  This is roughly equivalent to the levels being considered for the proposed EU investor compensation directive, now being discussed in Brussels. <Col N="41" /> Assuming that the directive has been finalised in time, any necessary provision will be made in the investment intermediaries legislation which is being prepared in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House replaces legislation two centuries old with a modern regulatory framework.  It establishes the Central Bank as the regulatory authority, and provides a significant role for the two Ministers closely involved in the Stock Exchange.  It meets Ireland's obligations in respect of stock exchange member firms arising from the European Union investment services and capital adequacy directives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell wanted to know, in simple terms, the role of the exchange.  Its role will be to match buyers and sellers and to enable companies to raise capital from investors.  That is what its function has been and will continue to be.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange is not really a good vehicle for small businesses, as the raising of funds on the Stock Exchange tend to be costly.  Over the years Governments have devised schemes to aid the funding of small businesses, such as the business enterprise scheme, the seed capital scheme, a scheme sponsored by the European Investment Bank and a scheme operated by ICC which I introduced in my last budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about the funds raised on the Stock Exchange. According to its annual report of last year some £879 million, including corporate bonds, were raised on the Stock Exchange for that year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan asked me and my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to investigate fees and charges imposed by the Stock Exchange.  Earlier this year I agreed to the removal of the Stock Exchange rule which stipulated minimum commissions for dealings in gilts following the finding of the competition authority that that rule was anti-competitive.  Therefore, it is now an open market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister one final question.  Last weekend, I came across a case where somebody <Col N="42" /> with life savings of £60,000 deposited in a building society was persuaded to invest it with someone else.  It now transpires that the intermediary person has done a bunk, leaving the investor without any prospect of recouping his moneys.  This matter relates to the investment intermediaries legislation to which the Minister referred in the course of his introductory remarks. When does he envisage it being introduced? The investor concerned trusted the intermediary absolutely, got nothing in writing, and now the intermediary has left the country.  Deputy Michael McDowell raised this matter in the course of his Second Stage contribution. Will the Minister say when we will have the heads of this Bill because we must recognise that people who trust intermediaries can be completely ripped off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates and a number of other Members raised this question in the House before.  It has proved very difficult over a number of years to get this legislation drafted. However, legislation to cover these contingencies must be implemented by July 1995 which means that it must be enacted in the next nine months.  Last year I established a working group &mdash; with which the Deputy is probably familiar &mdash; of all interest groups in an effort to bring them together on this issue. They agreed a report on which we are now working.  I do not foresee the relevant legislation being introduced before Christmas, but I hope it will be introduced in the New Year.</P>
      <P>In thanking Members for their support for this Bill I should say its provisions ensure that the Stock Exchange will be more open and transparent than it has been to date and that its board of directors will be representative of its users and the public interest in addition to its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will highlight the point made by Deputy Rabbitte and others about the requirement that the Chairperson of the Stock Exchange board be an outsider.  I hope it will appreciate the importance of ensuring that its members are seen to <Col N="43" /> be independent.  I will convey the wishes of the House to them in this respect.</P>
    <P>I trust I have dealt with the points raised by Members and thank all who contributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation and the associated plurilateral agreements which were signed by the Minister for Tourism and Trade at the GATT Ministerial Conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, on 15 April 1994, and laid before the Dáil on 3 October 1994.</P>
      <P>The Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations commenced in 1986 and concluded on 15 December 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a ministerial conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, held from 12 to 15 April 1994, I signed, on behalf of Ireland, the Final Act embodying the results of the round, thus accepting the text as authentic and as reflecting what <Col N="44" /> was negotiated.  I also signed, subject to ratification, the agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation and three plurilateral agreements, the Agreement on Government Procurement and the Dairy and Bovine Meat Agreements.</P>
    <P>Since the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation imposes a charge on public funds, there is a constitutional requirement that its terms be approved by the Dáil before it can be ratified.  That is the purpose of today's motion.  Following Dáil approval, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, on my behalf, will seek Government approval to ratify the Marrakesh Agreement on behalf of Ireland and the necessary instrument of ratification will be deposited in Geneva.</P>
    <P>The agreement imposes a charge on public funds in the form of an annual subscription to the World Trade Organisation. However, there is no new matter of principle here since Ireland has already been paying an annual subscription to GATT which is being replaced by the WTO.  The subscription for 1994 is £320,750.  Members of GATT contribute to its budget in proportion to their shares of world trade and a similar arrangement will apply to the WTO.</P>
    <P>The Agreement must be ratified also by the European Union, since external trade policy in general is the responsibility of the Union rather than of its member states.  The EU ratification process is under way and is expected to be completed by December at the latest. All other GATT members are engaging in, or have completed, their ratification procedures.  An implementation conference in December will confirm that the results of the round will come into effect from 1 January, 1995, provided that most parties, including all the major ones, have ratified before the conference.</P>
    <P>The Uruguay Round was debated at some length in the Dáil and Seanad on various occasions while the negotiations were under way.  Therefore, the Houses of the Oireachtas have been kept well informed of developments during the <Col N="45" /> negotiations and have already debated the economic effects of the Uruguay Round at some length.</P>
    <P>Last year I commissioned and published a consultancy study on the impact of a GATT Agreement on Ireland. Also, I propose to publish next month a booklet entitled &ldquo;A guide to GATT and its effects in Ireland&rdquo;.  This booklet, which has been prepared in consultation with IBEC, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, gives a general summary of the results of the Uruguay Round in various negotiating topics with particular emphasis on those aspects likely to impact most on Ireland's trade performance.  I hope it will be of benefit to all who have an interest in trade matters.</P>
    <P>The aim of the GATT is to provide a secure and predictable international trading environment and a continuing process of trade liberalisation.  The liberalisation process has been carried out mainly through a series of rounds of negotiations of which the Uruguay Round was its eighth.</P>
    <P>The text of the agreement, running to more than 26 thousand pages, was finalised at the Ministerial Conference in Morocco in April 1994.  It has since been published by GATT and has already been laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Ireland's policy in the negotiations was to support the conclusion of a global and balanced agreement, covering all countries and sectors in a manner consistent with the level of development of each country, while seeking to minimise the negative effects that any agreement might have on specific sectors in Ireland, such as agriculture and textiles. The Government believes this objective has been met and Ireland will benefit significantly from the overall improvement in the world economy and the creation of the stable trading environment which will result from the conclusion of the round.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Marrakesh Agreement there will be significant reductions in tariff and non-tariff barriers with all developed countries and many <Col N="46" /> developing countries reducing tariffs by 33 per cent or more.</P>
    <P>The new agreement means that for the first time GATT rules and disciplines will apply to agriculture in a comprehensive manner.  Of course, this was an area of huge importance to Ireland and my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, will speak on the sector later in this debate. However, I would note here, that the outcome on agriculture was satisfactory for Ireland and the provisions agreed were consistent with CAP reform.</P>
    <P>All clothing and textiles trade will become subject to normal GATT provisions over a ten-year period during which quotas will be gradually removed. This will be done in four steps.  Because of the significance of the clothing and textile sector to the Irish economy, it was important to avoid any sudden liberalisation of trade which would adversely impact on that sector.  The ten year integration period gives Irish industry a good breathing space for continued restructuring and improving its competitiveness.  It also allows time for strengthened GATT rules and disciplines to take effect in areas such as dumping and counterfeiting.  Through the EU, Ireland will have a say in determining what products should be integrated into GATT at the various stages, thereby ensuring that account is taken of the specific interests of this important sector to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Another new area covered by the agreement is trade in services.  Sectors such as tourism, banking, transport, construction, distribution, telecommunications, management consulting, medical services, accounting and legal services are all covered.  The services sector accounts for almost 60 per cent of Irish jobs and for more than 50 per cent of Irish output.  International competition has developed in many sectors and this trend is likely to continue.  Up to now, opportunities for companies to carry out services work abroad were not underpinned by agreed multilateral rules and could be changed or removed at any time.  GATT bindings give added <Col N="47" /> stability and certainty to these opportunities. The services agreement is also a framework for progressive liberalisation in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Benefits for Irish exporters will also accrue from reduction or elimination of non-tariff barriers, through the new agreements on intellectual property rights, anti-dumping, import licensing procedures, rules of origin, subsidies and countervailing measures as well as an agreement on Government procurement.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should refer to the creation of the World Trade Organisation, or WTO, to replace the existing GATT organisation.  The development of the rules relating to the international trading system called for an organisation designed to ensure rules were respected and, if necessary, adapted and developed to meet changing circumstances. Implementation of new dispute settlement procedures will be one of WTO's key functions.  The procedure has now been improved and made more automatic, transparent and certain.</P>
    <P>The globalisation of trade and increasing interdependence of different economies and cultures is making the need for cohesion in world economic policy more necessary than ever.  This will be part of WTO's role.  Its increased status <i>vis-à-vis</i> other international institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank places it in a strategic position to contribute to the development of world economic policy from an international trade perspective.  The emphasis must be on keeping markets open and rejecting measures that restrict or distort trade.</P>
    <P>Provision has already been made for the WTO to deal with the links between trade and the environment.  As part of its wide remit the World Trade Organisation may have to address a wide range of new topics, including social, competition and immigration policies as well as regionalism, and financial and monetary matters.  Many of these are complex and contentious issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> The world economy will benefit substantially as a result of the Uruguay Round Agreement.  Recent estimates by GATT suggest that global income in 2005 may be more than 500 billion dollars higher than it would have been without the market opening agreed to in the round.  There will be a major impact on the development of the economy of the European Union, since the Union is the world's largest trader.  One job in every ten in the European Union is directly generated by exports.</P>
    <P>The trading interests of Ireland, as a small open economy, are obviously best served by the existence of open, stable, trouble-free and barrier-free markets for our goods and services.  The Marrakesh agreement will provide that environment.  The general boost which is confidently forecast for the world economy will also provide opportunities for us to increase our trade in goods and services.</P>
    <P>These opportunities can, if exploited by Ireland, lead to significant expansion of our exports and increases in foreign earnings.  The consultancy study which I commissioned and published last year concluded that the Irish manufacturing and trade services sectors will gain substantially, in terms of output and employment, from the increasingly liberalised international trading system arising from the Uruguay Round Agreement.  Using rather conservative assumptions, the study estimated that the Irish economy stands to gain in excess of 20,000 jobs from this deal in comparison with a Uruguay Round failure scenario.</P>
    <P>We know from our experience that success in a free-trade environment depends on competitiveness and innovation. The degree of exploitation of the trade and growth opportunities that the agreement will create will depend on the response of industry &mdash; manufacturing, agriculture and services.  The Government will contribute through the creation of the right economic environment and the pursuit of policies designed to improve the competitiveness and innovative capacity of the <Col N="49" /> productive sector in Ireland.  Export sales growth will ultimately depend on industry itself and I am confident that we can look forward to a continuation of the very favourable trends in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement on the issues.  I acknowledge that within ten minutes it is hard to do justice to the subject of the motion before us.  I am speaking as Fine Gael's agricultural spokesperson and because of the time limit I will confine my remarks more particularly to the agricultural implications of the GATT agreement.</P>
      <P>Major decisions on agricultural policy affecting Irish and EU farmers have been taken in recent times.  The CAP reform decisions are being phased in during the period 1993-95 and the recent GATT decisions will be implemented between now and the year 2000.  The policy framework for European agriculture to the end of the decade is now, hopefully, largely in place. However, some important issues are still outstanding.  For example, the need for an efficient administration of CAP reform compensation and the need to secure EU compensation if the GATT decisions result in further cuts in excess of CAP reform.  My concerns about CAP reform and the GATT are well known.  Indeed, I have made my views known both here and in the Seanad peviously.  The inescapable fact is that the policy environment facing agriculture has changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final agreement on GATT was adopted by member countries on 15 December last.  Negotiations were formally concluded at a ministerial meeting in Marrakesh on 15 April last.  The agreement was signed on behalf of Ireland by the Minister present.  The formal ratification of the agreement by Ireland will be by way of Dáil resolution and that process has begun today.  The majority of member countries have yet to formally ratify the agreement.  The US House of Representatives and the US Senate will not adopt the GATT <Col N="50" /> agreement until 29 November.  I suppose electoral considerations have delayed matters there and that is understandable. However, it is expected that Congress will approve GATT by a large majority.  A new world trade organisation, the WTO, will replace GATT with effect from January next.</P>
    <P>There were two stages in the GATT agreement, namely, the overall agreement negotiated by the EU on behalf of member states and the internal arrangements adopted by the EU to meet its international commitments given under GATT.  For Ireland the Second Stage is as important, if not slightly more important, than the first.  Members will recall that the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the present Minister, Deputy Walsh, received firm assurances that the internal arrangements would not lead to disproportionate burdens being placed on regions, such as Ireland.  In a reply given in the Dáil on 25 February 1993, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, stated: &ldquo;I can assure Deputies that in any such negotiations I will continue to fight vigorously for the necessary amendments to the current proposals so that what is eventually agreed will not require greater restrictions than those already required under CAP reform.&rdquo;  We should remind ourselves of the commitment given by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to the House.  In that reply he went on to state:</P>
    <P>I will in any event be insisting on firm commitments that our vital interests will be protected.  I will also be demanding that the burden of any commitments must be shared equitably throughout the Community with due regard to the contribution which sectors make to the economy of a region.  I will also seek to ensure that this country's dependence on agriculture, particularly agricultural exports, is fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission formally adopted a draft basic Council regulation for the implementation of GATT at its meeting <Col N="51" /> on 5 October, 1994.  The regulation contains 13 separate annexes, each dealing with individual agricultural sectors. That whole package of measures is now being discussed by the trade committee drawn from member states.</P>
    <P>The Commission hopes to have all the necessary discussions completed in time for the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 December 1994.  The Farm Council will discuss the agricultural part of the agreement and hope to have their discussions completed in November.  I look forward to hearing from our Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry about progress on the Farm Council view.  At present the agricultural issues are being considered by the Special Agricultural Committee, which includes senior civil servants from all member states.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the EU dispute about the Commission's competence. Perhaps he might deal with that when replying to the debate because it requires clarification.  A fundamental disagreement has emerged concerning the competence of the Commission in relation to ratifying GATT, particularly in the case of new areas such as services and intellectual property. This could be of major importance to Ireland as it includes agricultural issues which are now included under GATT for the first time.  The essential issue is whether the Commission has full competence in relation to all matters on GATT.  The House needs an answer to that so that it can be sure that what we are doing today is not giving the Commission powers to ratify GATT before the European Court judgment indicating their views on the matter is with us. The issue is at present before the Court of Justice and a decision is expected by mid-November.  Both the Commission and the member states signed the GATT agreement in Marrakesh, but the Commission had already referred to the European Court the issue of who had the right to sign the agreement.  A code of conduct which would impose a &ldquo;community discipline&rdquo; on member states in <Col N="52" /> matters relating to the WTO has been considered by member states.  The draft council regulation confers on the Commission the power to deal with the implementation of GATT.  This power will be exercised in conjunction with various management committees.  While the management committees are made up of member state experts, the management committee procedure falls within the Commission's competence, and in the event of no decision being reached by the management committee the Commission have the power to act nonetheless.</P>
    <P>I now come to some sectoral interests. The annex on dairying deals with imports, exports and other issues relating to tariffication.  In a word, dairy farmers can expect a 4 per cent cut in their quota over the next few years and up to a 10 per cent decrease in the price of their product.</P>
    <P>All imports and exports of dairy products will be subject to licences issued by the Commission.  The EU will not put in place national quotas for the right to export subsidised products.  An Irish position paper to the EU in July 1994 came out against national quotas. The licence to export, which is in effect a licence to receive export refunds, may be on the basis of tendering or be set on a periodic basis.  It is envisaged that a security would have to be lodged with the Commission and would be refundable depending on whether the trader had succeeded in making the delivery within the time limit set.  The wording of the draft regulation is quite vague on this issue and could also involve the Commission awarding licences without receiving a formal request or even awarding them to non EU traders.  Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry could clarify this matter when responding to that area, which appears to be vague still.</P>
    <P>The draft regulation provides for the first time for the management committee to select which products will be eligible for export refunds as distinct from setting the rate of export refunds. <Col N="53" /> Licences will also apply to imports, including imports for minimum access, that is, 5 per cent of domestic consumption in the base period (1986-88) to be effected by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The non-annex II &mdash; processed dairy products, which include non dairy ingredients such as chocolate crumb &mdash; will be exempt from export licence requirements but the rate of refunds will be fixed by the management committee. Furthermore, these are not covered by the 21 per cent volume reduction but of course are subject to the 36 per cent budgetary restriction.  It may be that butterfat in non-annex II products will not attract export refunds. That will have implications, particularly on price.</P>
    <P>Casein is an industrial product and receives no export subsidy.  While it receives a production aid, it will not be directly affected by GATT, by way of either volume or budgetary restrictions. The tariff on casein is to be reduced to zero.</P>
    <P>Export refunds will be at the same level for the whole of the EU but may differ, depending on the country of destination.</P>
    <P>Let me say a few words on the beef sector.  Basically the same system will operate for the beef sector as outlined for the dairy sector.  Without going into the problems in that area, I would like to know exactly how we plan to deal with the area of exports to third countries, which is extremely important for us.  Apparently the one million tonnes per annum European quota to third countries is to be divided across the EU, not on the basis of countries but on the basis of individual firms tendering. Where does our Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry stand on this issue.</P>
    <P>What is the position relating to growth promoters and their use by American farmers for beef production now that they have access to the European beef market?  The FDA accepts growth promoters in beef production; we have a complete restriction on it here.  This area needs rationalisation <Col N="54" /> because it puts our farmers at a disadvantage competitively.</P>
    <P>There is to be a 2 to 3 per cent reduction in quota in the sugar beet area.  Cereals fare out much the same as under the Common Agricultural Policy commitments except that now we hear that the US is increasing its wheat production this year and has abolished set aside for wheat.  We need a level playing field in this whole area.</P>
    <P>We must question how free trade oriented the US is.  The fact that GATT is here to stay and that future GATT rounds will seek to achieve further cuts in protection and support for EU agriculture does not mean that &ldquo;free trade&rdquo; is inevitable.  European economies have very different objectives in terms of maintaining a viable rural society than is the case in the US.  These desirable objectives cannot be sacrificed on the altar of &ldquo;free trade&rdquo;.  If European Union farmers have to observe restrictions and regulations which erode their competitiveness on world markets, the European Governments must ensure that future WTO agreements continue to compensate for this.  Free trade must equate to fair trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Doyle, I will have difficulty in compressing into ten minutes what I have to say about this agreement, the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round.  It is of tremendous importance to this country and to the trading world generally.  Had it not been successfully concluded, the losses suffered in Ireland, in the European Union and throughout the world would have been enormous.  It is only right, therefore, that we should pay tribute to the man who, above all else, brought about a successful conclusion of the round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was successfully completed not at Marrakesh in April, where there was only a ceremonial signing, but in December of last year.  I went to Brussels in December 1990 with a point on my pencil for the purpose of signing what we hoped was the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.  However, because <Col N="55" /> of problems, particularly on the agricultural side but also in other areas, we were not able to conclude it.  There was one subsequent effort that also failed.  It was only with the advent of Mr. Sutherland, which engendered a sufficient feeling of urgency in countries generally throughout the world, that it was concluded last December.  It was a matter of great regret that he will not be the Director General of the WTO when it is established in January next.  That job was there for the asking if he had chosen to go for it.  He may have been under the misapprehension that he would be proposed for another equally important job.  He made a mistake because he was not proposed by his own Government and failed, therefore, to get that job.  The whole European Union has lost out, particularly in the light of developments since.  Mr. Sutherland's achievement in bringing about a final conclusion of Uruguay Round after seven years is deserving of the greatest praise.  He has brought great credit to this country and, indeed, great benefit to this country and the entire trading world.</P>
    <P>In general the provisions of the Uruguay Round as finally concluded last December are beneficial to this country and to the European Union.  I know of no country that, on balance, will lose out, because the strengthening of the trading rules and the expansion of trading rules into areas that were not previously covered has to be valuable to everybody concerned.  It is in applying world trading rules to agriculture that the difficulties and sensitivities are greatest.  Transition in this area will certainly be difficult and, at times, unpredictable for farmers in Ireland and in the European Union.</P>
    <P>It is in our long term interest that there are specific, identifiable rules in trade, not alone in agriculture but also in services and in the areas known colloquially as trims and trips which are of substantial importance to this country. It is also very important that there <Col N="56" /> is a proper dispute settlement procedure and I am glad that is included in this round.  The uncertainty of dispute settlements was previously highly unsatisfactory and led to tremendous uncertainty as to what could or could not be done by trading nations and international trading companies.</P>
    <P>I will avail of the opportunity in this discussion to deal with a matter referred to briefly in the House yesterday, which is of some importance, particularly because of the principle involved.  The time available yesterday did not allow the matter to be discussed as only about one minute of Question Time was available. Because of the lack of time there is a possibility that what was said may convey the wrong impression.  I refer to a procedure brought by the Commission against Ireland under Article 169 relating to the action of the Irish Government in respect of the GATT beef import quota.  The Commission found it necessary to bring proceedings against Ireland because it believed it had flagrantly breached the Commission regulations. Ireland replied to that complaint on 5 March 1991 and the reply, signed by an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs, contains misstatement of fact of a serious nature.  The aggrieved party in this case brought the matter to the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That was referred to by the Tánaiste yesterday when he sought to convey that the aggrieved party was prepared to await the outcome of a Supreme Court appeal which the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is bringing against parts of the High Court decision in this case, but that is not so.  The aggrieved party complained to the Department of Foreign Affairs about the misstatement of fact in Ireland's reply to the Article 169 proceedings; he did not discuss the Supreme Court appeal which is a separate matter over which he has no control as he has to await its outcome.</P>
    <P>I referred yesterday to the judgment of Mr. Justice Costello in the High Court and I used certain words which I wish to correct.  While I do not think <Col N="57" /> they misrepresent the findings of Mr. Justice Costello, they are not literally the words he used in the case.  I wish to avail of this opportunity, the earliest available to me, to quote from the judgement his exact words in respect of the GATT beef import case.  On the Department's version of the facts he said: &ldquo;This was of course a fiction, known to be such by the Department&rdquo;. He went on to say: &ldquo;that the description of the plaintiff as an agent was a formula devised by the Department and bore no relation to the commercial reality&rdquo;.  He further stated: &ldquo;To conclude, as was done, that the meat processors had `imported' the meat was a travesty of the true position&rdquo;.  He said:</P>
    <P>Nor need I express any opinion on the submission that the explanation for the Department's decision was that it had succumbed to pressure from a powerful economic group of traders.  I have concluded that the Department acted in breach of its duties imposed on it by regulations &mdash; it is not necessary for me to conclude why it did so.</P>
    <P>These quotations give a clear indication of Mr. Justice Costello's view of the version of events put forward by the Irish authorities.</P>
    <P>A disservice had been done to the aggrieved party, who sought to draw the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs to the misstatement of the facts by that Department, by the suggestion made by the Tánaiste yesterday.  The views of the man concerned were misrepresented in what was said here and I am glad to have this opportunity to put the record straight in this respect.  I hope that the question of the GATT import quota, which has had a very sorry history in recent years, can be put right, that the obvious injustice done to one individual company for the benefit of other companies in the same trade in this country will be rectified and that the huge losses that have been sustained will be reimbursed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the <Col N="58" /> remarks made by Deputy O'Malley. The details of this case are well known to me and I look forward to redress of the matter and to a change of attitude, particularly on the part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising that the Minister's entire script deals with the expected advantages to Ireland and, to a lesser extent, to the European Union of the Marrakesh Agreement.  I am not as convinced or as upbeat, nor, I think, are a great many economic commentators, about this matter as the Minister.  Some of the assumptions are unprovable at this stage.  That is not to say one does not expect advantage to accrue to Ireland and to the European Union as the major trading bloc.  The Minister's view is rose tinted and it will be very interesting to measure his expectations against the outcome.  It is remarkable that there is no reference in the script to the impact of this agreement on the Third World.</P>
      <P>Since the time available to us is very brief and other Deputies will no doubt deal with various aspects of this matter I will simply make a couple of points about that aspect and its impact on the developing world.  The Minister said: &ldquo;The Houses of the Oireachtas have, therefore, been kept well informed of developments during the negotiations and have already debated the economic effects of the Uruguay Round at some length&rdquo;.  I do not believe that is the case. I recall debating it here on a Fine Gael Private Members' motion, and very often we have confined it to the agricultural sector.  Clearly, that sector is important but it is not the only one and there has been little discussion on such a wide ranging and significant agreement. Given the proposals relating to the World Trade Organisation, I am concerned that it legitimises the existing power structures, makes the poorer countries more vulnerable and facilitates the two great power blocs in retaliating against the poorer countries.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not address this issue and I ask him to do so in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> Some Third World organisations have argued, for example, that the loss in trade to Africa is of the order of £2 billion per annum.  They are particularly concerned that Africa's role as a producer of non-tropical commodities is declining and that as a result it will be hardest hit.  The price of non-tropical commodities has scarcely been addressed in the agreement.  Commodities such as coffee, tea and especially sugar which are so critical to certain African countries have not been dealt with.  I ask the Minister to address this question in his reply.  Naturally enough, we have tended to look at this matter from a purely national perspective but it is a matter of concern so many years after the Brandt report was presented that we are still ignoring the dangers associated with a widening trade imbalance and the North-South division.</P>
    <P>The Marrakesh Agreement copper-fastens the existing trade disparities between the developed and developing worlds.  Two major trading blocs, the European Union and the NAFTA countries, have divided up the spoils leaving the poorer half of the world to watch from the sidelines.  The agreement covers almost two-thirds of world trade and 114 countries.  Two years after the much vaunted Rio de Janeiro summit which was going to radically rejig relations between the developed and developing worlds, the GATT has combined with the World Bank to undermine progress towards fair trade and sustainability.  While we have debated the issue of agricultural dumping we have neglected to consider the effects of social dumping, the legitimation of the world's division into a bloc of rich consumers and another far less advantaged bloc of cheap labour providers.</P>
    <P>Anyone who doubts the effects of GATT on developing countries need only look at the effects on Mexico of the GATT sub-agreement.  NAFTA.  American and Canadian companies have migrated south at an astonishing rate to take advantage of the low wages and lack of union protection in Mexico.  The <Col N="60" /> long term effects on Mexico are likely to be devastating.  The rich North persuaded the developing world to come on board by holding out the lure of world trade expansion amounting to around $200 billion.  Yet the Secretary General of the OECD, the organisation which made the estimate, admits that the figure is &ldquo;highly theoretical&rdquo;.  I question the tired theory of &ldquo;trickle down&rdquo; economics; the developing world was told that improved economic performance in the North would stimulate demand and allow the south to sell more products.</P>
    <P>At a time when the trade imbalance is ostensibly at the top of the international agenda the developed world has mastered the art of aid hypocrisy.  The Maastricht Treaty urges that all European Union policies must take into account the effect on developing countries, yet at the same time subsidised meat, for example, is exported to the sub-Saharan region, undercutting indigenous producers and depriving thousands of their livelihood.  By the same token the Rio de Janeiro Summit committed the developed countries to the principle of sustainable development, yet the GATT document on trade and the environment implicitly rejected this concept.  In effect the document stated that in the event of conflict between free trade and unilateral environmental protection measures, free trade must win out every time.  The market is everything and anything, including environmental or social protection measures, which distorts that market is rejected out of hand.  The world's economic leaders failed to recognise that there is a fundamental difference between protectionist measures using tariffs and quotas to protect inefficient and exploitative industries at the expense of others and protectionist measures used to protect the weak.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent I agree with the authors of that document.  I would much prefer internationalised environmental and social protection measures to unilateral measures but in today's world we <Col N="61" /> do not have the choice, it is unilateral measures or nothing.  Every meeting of the international economic élite, be it the OECD or the group of seven, pays lip service to the concepts of free trade and development co-operation, yet it was that economic élite which pushed ahead with the GATT regardless of the social and environmental cost.  The developing world was faced with a Hobson's choice between a flawed agreement and economic expansion.</P>
    <P>On the question of democratic accountability, the new World Trade Organisation, the successor of GATT, is an un-elected and unaccountable body responsible neither to citizens nor to national parliaments.  The democratic deficit, it seems, is not the sole preserve of the European Union.  The Marrakesh Agreement will undoubtedly benefit Ireland in the short term.  In the long term, however, the disparities which the agreement legitimises could be detrimental to us all.</P>

      <P>I propose to comment on the agriculture aspects of this agreement and do not propose to dwell on the history of the agriculture negotiations which has been debated many times in the House.  I recall that our major trading partners, especially the United States, initially sought the almost total elimination of all agriculture support measures.  When they failed in this objective they continued to insist upon severe restrictions, particularly in relation to subsidised exports. Other Ministers and I fought hard to secure changes to the original proposals put forward by our trading partners and succeeded in getting significant modifications which enabled a GATT agreement on agriculture to be concluded in December 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the final agreement on agriculture is compatible with the reformed CAP and that the Union will be able to continue to support the agri-food industry and rural areas in a positive manner.  This is a significant <Col N="62" /> achievement given the opening negotiating positions of others.</P>
    <P>All of the foregoing is history and the main focus now is on the rules and regulations to be adopted by the Union to implement GATT commitments.  A special working group has been established by the Council of Agriculture Ministers to oversee the implementation of these regulations and will commence its discussions on Friday, 21 October.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the GATT agreement on agriculture does not pose any threat for the agri-food sector.  It does present a challenge to and open opportunities for the sector.  Taken with CAP reform, the future for the agri-food industry will be a more open one with the emphasis on market orientation. This change has been signalled for some time and the industry has responded well.  We now have an efficient and competitive agriculture industry.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to develop policies which foster the agri-food industry.  Considerable resources have been invested in the industry in recent years.  Some £323 million to help develop the industry was invested from 1987 to 1993.  An Bord Bia has been established to ensure that an aggressive marketing programme is developed for agri-food products.  Furthermore, the food sub-programme for the period 1994-99 envisages total investment of a further £641 million in the industry.</P>
    <P>Our interest today is in the GATT Marrakesh Agreement.  I am satisfied that the agreement reached on agriculture is a reasonable one and that it addresses the major concerns raised by Ireland during the course of the negotiations. Overall, the conclusion of the GATT agreement will lead to expanded trade activity and will benefit all sectors, including the agricultural sector. Deputy Doyle raised a number of points.  A special working group has been set up by the Council of Agriculture Ministers and will commence its deliberations on implementing regulations on Friday next, 21 October 1994. <Col N="63" /> It is true also that the Commission proposes to implement trade commitments by way of licensing.  The rules and procedures for allocating licences have yet to be agreed.  Member states will be fully consulted on this matter.  The Commission proposals envisage granting a significant level of responsibility to the Commission itself in the management of the licensing system.  We will, of course, be insisting on the Council of Ministers being given a greater role in this area.</P>
    <P>I recommend approval of the terms of the Marrakesh Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> As chairperson of the Sub-Committee on Development Co-operation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I wish to say a few words on the occasion of the debate on ratification by Dáil Éireann of the GATT agreement.  The points I raise were dealt with at length in the course of a Fine Gael Private Member's motion last December.  I will make three points with a view to ensuring that Ireland, as a new member of the World Trade Organisation, will raise them at that level.  We cannot rewrite history but we can learn lessons from it and move forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lack of proper consultation and involvement by and with developing countries as evidenced by the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations. Essentially, the United States, the European Union, Japan and, to a lesser extent, the Cairns group dictated the terms of trade between themselves without, in my view, due regard and provision for the needs and concerns of the developing countries.  When we in Ireland participated in the debate on the setting up of the Single Market we recognised that the freeing up of the market could have a downside for less developed or developing countries and we ensured that provisions were put in place to guard our interests and redress the forces that would militate against us in the setting up of the free market.  I do not believe that enough attention was <Col N="64" /> given to this need on a global scale and I believe that trade liberalisation will affect in a detrimental way many of the developing countries, without sufficient safeguards for their position being put in place.  I appeal to the Minister to address this issue at the World Trade Organisation.</P>
    <P>As evidenced by the Rio de Janeiro Summit, there has been admission internationally of the links between and interdependence of the economy, development and the environment. GATT went against many of the recommendations on sustainable development issued from the Rio de Janeiro Summit. The unfettered liberalisation in many areas, particularly in primary production, will serve to worsen the environmental degradation being suffered by many of the less developed countries.  I believe this issue will have to be faced by the World Trade Organisation. GATT made a public disassociation of the links between the environment, ecology and economy and I think this will have to be repudiated and reversed.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the question of accountability.  The Minister said in his speech that the World Trade Organisation will become a much more important organisation than GATT because of the need for cohesion in world economic policy.  The Minister also likened the status of the World Trade Organisation to the IMF and the World Bank.  Earlier this year the Sub-Committee on Development Co-operation produced a report on the role of the IMF and the World Bank in reinforcing the debt problem in developing countries.  I sincerely hope that the World Trade Organisation will not become another lever of enforcement of these disadvantageous policies on developing countries.  I asked the Minister to ensure that non-governmental organisations and the people of the developing countries who will be affected by the World Trade Organisation policies will have an opportunity to participate in the decision-making of that body.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and in the short time available I will try to deal with some of the points raised.  Deputy Doyle queried the competence of the Commission <i>vis-à-vis</i> member states.  This matter and the issue of the respective competencies of the European Union and member states relating to new areas covered by the Uruguay Round such as services, transport and intellectual property have been referred to the Court of Justice.  It had been feared that the court's decision would not be given until next year.  Fortunately, the court indicated recently that it would give its decision by mid-November, so this danger has been averted.  In the meantime the European Parliament has been consulted with a view to having the agreement formally ratified by the Community by the deadline of 1 January. Both the Commission and the member states have agreed to await the outcome of the court case and therefore I do not propose to comment further on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a possibility. Deputies Rabbitte and Gallagher raised issues relating to developing countries. We could have a very interesting debate on this subject and I know that Deputy Gallagher is an expert in this field.  This issue has been raised not only by these <Col N="66" /> two Deputies but by many people outside the House.  Membership of GATT, shortly to be known as the World Trade Organisation, is voluntary and contractual. Developing countries themselves decide if they wish to become a member and the extent of trade liberalisation they wish to offer.  The agreement explicitly provides for the need to take account of the special problems of developing countries, especially the least developed among them.  This is mentioned explicitly in the preamble to the agreement.  Also, a ministerial decision forming part of the agreement provides that least developed countries will be obliged only to undertake commitments and concessions to the extent consistent with individual development, financial and trade needs.  The decision also provides for special consideration to be given to the interests of least developed countries in the implementation of the Marrakesh Agreement.  A further ministerial decision specifically commits Ministers to review the food aid and technical assistance needs of least developed and net food importing countries in the light of the liberalisation flowing from the agreement.</P>
      <P>Developing countries as a group are expected to benefit substantially from the agreement.  The GATT secretariat estimate that the agreement will lead to a minimum 14 per cent increase in their trade.  This compares to a 7 to 8 per cent increase in the case of OECD countries. Developing countries will benefit in particular from increased access to markets in developed countries, especially in areas such as textiles and tropical products.  This will be of particular benefit to those developing countries which, having gone through painful economic adjustment programmes, felt cheated by the high tariff barriers their exports often faced in developed country markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte and Gallagher also raised the question of the impact of this agreement on the environment.  This is one of the major issues for the new World Trade Organisation.  It is already <Col N="67" /> highlighted in the preamble to the WTO Agreement which talks of:</P>
    <P>the optimal use of the world's resources in accordance with the principle of sustainable development, seeking both to protect and preserve the environment and to enhance the means for doing so in a manner consistent with their respective needs and concerns at different levels of economic development.</P>
    <P>We decided at Marrakesh to set up a special WTO committee to examine the link between trade and the environment. The agreed aim is to achieve harmony between expanded trade and protection of the environment, in accordance with the principle of sustainable development.  We must ensure that the gains achieved in recent years through such measures as pollution controls and increased recycling are consolidated and enhanced, while also ensuring that spurious environmental reasons are not advanced as a form of protectionism, especially by developed countries.  The issues involved are complex but I am confident that the new WTO committee will achieve a satisfactory and workable system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher raised the question of accountability.  It is intended that the World Trade Organisation will be more open and accountable to all, including the non-governmental organisations. This matter is being examined with a view to preparing future proposals.</P>
    <P>In the short time available we have covered a wide range of topics worthy of seminars or debates inside and outside this House.  I thank the Deputies for their co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <P>We should ensure that we have another opportunity after the European Court judgment to come back into this House and have a slightly more extended debate.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I undertook very successful official visits abroad from 14 to 29 September, visiting consecutively Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand.  As is the case with all previous visits of this kind, I sought to promote and advance the two priority objectives of the Government.</P>
      <P>First, this trip coincided with the recent and ongoing developments of an historic nature towards peace in Northern Ireland.  It was particularly appropriate, therefore, that, in the course of my visits, I sought on every suitable occasion to inform our many and influential friends of the present position with regard to the peace process.  Similarly, our emigrants had a very natural and keen interest in developments here at home, particularly in Northern Ireland.  I, therefore, made a very special effort to address that interest throughout my visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very heartened by the enormous interest shown and by the support demonstrated for our efforts to consolidate peace, and to work towards an agreed political settlement founded on <Col N="70" /> consent and respect for difference.  A huge and informed reservoir of goodwill exists at all levels in Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand for all our efforts in that regard, and I feel privileged to have had the opportunity at this time to channel that goodwill towards meaningful and constructive effect.</P>
    <P>Second, I sought in direct contact with leading political and business people to promote increased investment into Ireland, increased inward tourism, increased exports and, on that basis, increased job creation.  My efforts in that regard were, of course, greatly facilitated by the new era of peace.  I have no doubt that, as a result, the task of selling Ireland as a location for inward investment will be made easier. Indeed, my visits suggest strongly to me that a whole new perception is now developing in the minds of many people with regard to Ireland as a holiday destination and a secure investment location. In terms of promoting the peace process, inward investment and increased job creation here, my visits were extremely successful.</P>
    <P>On Northern Ireland, I briefed the Governor of Hong Kong, Mr. Chris Patten, on the Government's approach and response to the recent IRA ceasefire announcement.  We had a most constructive discussion on Northern Ireland, recognising that, at the outset, the peace process has been well founded on constructive and friendly relations between the Irish and British Governments.</P>
    <P>My discussions with the governor also included a briefing by him on the current political and economic situation in Hong Kong and developments towards its handover to China in 1997.  He stressed the intention of the British Government that all arrangements in that regard would proceed smoothly.</P>
    <P>While in Australia, I had discussions with Prime Minister Keating, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Alexander Downer, the Western Australia State Premier, Mr. Richard Court, the premier of Victoria, Mr. Jeff Kennett, <Col N="71" /> the Deputy Leader of the Opposition there, Mr. Dimitrios Dolos, the Premier of New South Wales.  Mr. John Fahey and the Australia/Ireland Parliamentary Group.  These meetings with the leading people in Australia's political life focused principally on Northern Ireland and Irish-Australian relations in the economic and trade spheres.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with Prime Minister Keating, I briefed him fully on recent developments in the peace process, on the efforts being made to consolidate it, and on the progress being made by the Irish and British Governments to agree a joint framework document that would constitute our shared understanding on the broad outlines of a settlement.  The Prime Minister expressed a strong desire to assist in a meaningful way our efforts towards an agreed political accommodation in an environment of peace.  Recognising that economic rejuvenation in deprived areas is a fundamental part of the peace process, he pledged seven million Australian dollars to the International Fund for Ireland over the next five years.  The Government is deeply appreciative of this tangible expression of support and I was most pleased that the decision received a warm welcome from the Opposition Leader there, Mr. Alexander Downer, who has also been very supportive of the fund since its inception. Prime Minister Keating shares the strong desire of many Australians that the momentum towards an agreed settlement in an atmosphere of peace must be sustained.  He, like President Clinton, wishes to promote agreement between the divided people of Ireland in a spirit of constructive friendship and genuine affection for both Nationalists and Unionists.</P>
    <P>My principal public engagement in Canberra was an address to the National Press Club which was followed by a lengthy question and answer session. These were carried live on nationwide television.  I very much welcomed that opportunity to speak directly to members of the Australian media on <Col N="72" /> developments in Ireland.  Much of my address and the subsequent questioning related to Northern Ireland.  I dealt in considerable detail with the peace process and on our efforts to achieve political agreement between the two traditions here.</P>
    <P>The issue of peace in Northern Ireland and the role which Australians can play towards its consolidation were at the heart of major speeches I made to the Irish Club in Perth, at a dinner hosted by Prime Minister Keating in Canberra, and in my address to the Australian-Ireland Fund Dinner.</P>
    <P>While in New Zealand, I also availed of every suitable occasion to promote the peace process and an agreed political accommodation.  In my discussions with Prime Minister Jim Bolger, the issue of Northern Ireland featured prominently.  He showed a strong personal interest in recent developments and assured me of his Government's desire to assist our efforts.  To this end, he announced a further contribution of three-hundred thousand New Zealand dollars to the International Fund for Ireland.  This is New Zealand's third contribution to the fund.  I expressed the Government's deep gratitude for this additional gesture of support, serving to demonstrate yet again the very real commitment of the international community to progress the peace process. Prime Minister Bolger expressed the hope, now realised, that the IRA ceasefire announcement would be followed by a complete cessation of violence on all sides, thus facilitating quicker and more effective progress on political issues.  I held discussions with the Acting Leader of the Opposition there, Mr. David Caygill.  He, too, demonstrated great interest in the peace process and shares all our hopes that an agreed political settlement will be achieved soon. I also paid a courtesy call on the Governor General, Dame Catherine Tizard.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the second priority of my visits to Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand focused on increased job creation here, by promoting Ireland as a location for investment <Col N="73" /> in the manufacturing and services areas, particularly tourism.  Throughout my visits, I sought, whenever appropriate, to encourage expansion of our excellent bilateral relations in the economic and trade spheres.</P>
    <P>While in Hong Kong, I had meetings with a number of prospective investors here.  Owing to strong international competition for such investment, the names of the companies must remain confidential.  I also addressed the Curragh Club, comprising a group of Irish business and professional people for which the Irish Trade Board provides a secretariat.  My speech centred on the investment opportunities offered by Ireland in the context of our geographical location, our highly-skilled workforce, our strong macro-economic performance and our membership of the EU, the ERM and the European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>My visit to Australia comprised 23 engagements in Perth, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.  Most of these were of an economic or trade nature.  My principal engagements in Perth included an address to the Irish-Australian Business Association and to the Irish Club there.</P>
    <P>My meeting with Prime Minister Keating in Canberra naturally focused on economic issues as well as Northern Ireland, particularly on our bilateral relations in the trade and services areas. He expressed the view that Australia's geographical position relative to the Asia-Pacific area and Ireland's location as a gateway to Europe constitute powerful reasons for improvement in our bilateral relationship.  The Prime Minister referred to Australia's significant investment in Ireland.  I drew his attention to the principal macro-economic indicators here, placing special emphasis on our corporate tax rate being guaranteed to the year 2010.  In response, he underlined Australia's success in attracting European investment from companies wishing to capitalise on the development potential of the Pacific Rim and in that regard, Australia holds unique opportunities for Irish firms <Col N="74" /> seeking to expand their overseas operation to that region.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister provided an update on the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation, APEC.  Australia, like Ireland, has a strong interest in a liberal world trading system and to that end, the Prime Minister views the early ratification of GATT as highly desirable. Apart from APEC's commitment to developing and strengthening the open, multilateral trading system, it was clear from my discussions that the Australian Government regards it as a unifying force in a region beset with historical and economic divisions.  In that context, our discussions also covered European Union matters.</P>
    <P>I raised with the Prime Minister the present situation in East Timor, recognising that public opinion on this issue is particularly strong in Ireland.  Prime Minister Keating assured me that the Australian Government is using its influence with the Indonesian Government to effect positive change, particularly in relation to a reduction in troop levels and to expand access to East Timor for human rights organisations and the international media.</P>
    <P>In my address to the National Press Club in Canberra, I placed special emphasis on Ireland's advantages as a location for overseas companies, particularly on the large number of tax and other incentives available to companies who wish to locate their European operations here for exporting to the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>I addressed the Irish-Australian Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne on a similar theme.  While in Sydney, I spoke at a luncheon hosted by Bord Fáilte and An Bord Tráchtála, placing special emphasis on the unique attractions of Ireland as a holiday destination.</P>
    <P>While in New Zealand, my meeting with Prime Minister Bolger covered economic and trade matters, as well as Northern Ireland.  He stressed the importance of building &ldquo;people-links&rdquo; between our respective countries, drawing a comparison with existing links between New Zealand and Malaysia. <Col N="75" /> We, therefore, agreed to examine the possibility of developing bilateral working holiday arrangements, with a view to enhancing even further the very warm bilateral relationship which exists at present.  The Prime Minister referred to the opportunity for greater investment and trade between Ireland and New Zealand by virtue of our respective memberships of the EU and APEC.</P>

      <P>The Prime Minister of New Zealand is strongly of the view that many Asian countries offer great market potential for firms wishing to increase exports or expand their overseas operations.</P>
      <P>Developments in GATT and NAFTA also featured prominently in our discussions which covered a number of other international issues such as the role of the United Nations and the situation in former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Haiti and Cuba.</P>

      <Col N="76" /> Many of my other engagements in New Zealand likewise contained a strong economic and trade dimension.

    <P>I also paid a very short visit to the United States comprising one day of engagements in New York and Philadelphia on 6 October.  While there, I attended the fifth meeting of the Irish-American Economic Advisory Board. My attendance was important having regard to the background of the recent breakthrough on Northern Ireland. Having briefed the board on developments in that regard, our discussions focused principally on matters relating to the proposed US aid package in the context of the new era of peace.</P>

At another level, economic trade interaction and tourism was promoted and this, in time, will contribute positively to job creation here.</P>

      <P>I asked the Taoiseach about the position in East Timor.  No <Col N="87" /> one would expect him to solve the problems in that country, but it appears that the best on offer is that human rights monitors will be allowed into the country to monitor the abuses of human rights.  Is that the best we can hope for in regard to East Timor?  Has the Government any hope that conventional human and democratic rights will be achieved for the people in this most oppressed part of the world?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I put forward the views as I heard them expressed here, which I believe are representative of the view of Irish people in regard to East Timor.  As I said in my reply, the Prime Minister of Australia has made known his view that there should be a reduction in the army presence in East Timor and that human rights should be improved.  I do not know what else Deputy Bruton expected me to do in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again ask the Taoiseach if he received a specific commitment from anyone to invest in this country during his sojourn in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong?  Did he inform the Australian Prime Minister that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has passed a very strong resolution on East Timor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not refer exactly to the resolution but I represented our views on this matter, which more or less coincide with what Deputy Gilmore would want me to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to my visit to Australia and New Zealand, as I said these were primarily State visits and were at the request of the Australian and New Zealand Governments.  The total cost of the delegation in Australia and in New Zealand was borne by the host Government. I availed of every opportunity, whether at meetings, in speeches to trade organisations, business organisations, tourism organisations or on national television in both countries, to <Col N="88" /> highlight the success of the Irish economy and the opportunities in Ireland for servicing the European market.</P>
    <P>In Australia and New Zealand it was suggested to me that there were plenty of opportunities to service fast developing regions on the Asian Pacific Rim and that there were opportunities for Irish companies to spread their wings into that area.  Now that peace has broken out in Ireland, a different message will go out on television screens around the world and undoubtedly the peace dividend will increase bringing more tourists, more investment and expansion of our trade.</P>

      <P>In his reply the Taoiseach said he spoke at length with the various people he met about the peace process and that is understandable.  At a lunch hosted for him in Wellington he said that confidence and the durability of the peace process would allow us to deal with the disposal of weapons and the release of prisoners.  Does the Taoiseach think we have arrived at that position now and what does he think the British Government should do to consolidate the peace process?</P>

We have now got <Col N="89" /> that.  The Irish Government will continue to move the peace process ahead.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> On the proposal of the Russian side, in response to an invitation I had extended some time previously to President Yeltsin, it was arranged that the President would meet me on Friday, 30 September 1994, at Shannon Airport on his way back to Russia from his visit to the United States.</P>
    <P>In the event, the planned meeting with the President did not take place. However, a meeting took place between Irish and Russian delegations at which a wide range of international and bilateral political and economic issues were discussed. I led the Irish delegation which included the Ministers for Finance and for Transport, Energy and Communications and officials of my Department, the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Tourism and Trade, Transport, Energy and Communications and the Irish Ambassador to the Russian Federation. The Russian delegation was headed by Mr. Oleg Soskevets, the First Deputy Prime Minister and also included Mr. Oleg Davydov, Minister for External Economic Relations and officials, including the Russian Ambassador to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The discussions held were very worth while and led to agreement on a number of practical matters of considerable economic importance, including that the Russian authorities would introduce to the Russian Parliament as a matter of priority the ratification of the signed Double Taxation Agreement between the two countries; that every effort would be made to hold a meeting within a month between the respective Ministers responsible for air transport, with a view to finalising an air agreement between the two countries which has been under discussion in a joint high-level group on aviation co-operation and to pursue a wide range of other mutually beneficial opportunities in the aviation area where there is scope for further co-operations, including the establishment of a pre-clearance facility at Shannon for cargo consigned to Russia &mdash; a note on these matters was given to the Russian side; that the Russian side would proceed towards a waiver of <Col N="91" /> export taxation on the quantity of aviation fuel exported from Russia to Shannon for use by Aeroflot; that the Russian side would take up Irish concerns about certain interpretations of VAT legislation in Russia which have had some adverse effects on the operation of Aer Rianta partnerships there &mdash; again a note on this issue was given to the Russian side; that the Russian side would send veterinary experts to Ireland, with a view to paving the way for a removal of the Russian ban on imports of bone-in beef from Ireland; that the meeting of the Irish/Russian Joint Economic Committee would be held, before the end of this year, with a new higher level Chairman on the Russian side and that, at the invitation of President Yeltsin, I would visit Russia in the first half of 1995.</P>
    <P>Since then, I received a letter from President Yeltsin, in which he expressed his sincere regret that the planned meeting between us failed to take place.  He indicated that the most intent consideration would be given to the practical questions raised by the Irish side and that relevant Russian Ministers and Departments have been duly instructed. I have also given directions for vigorous follow-up on the Irish side and our Ambassador in Moscow has already presented the Foreign Ministry there with a memorandum of the points identified for further action and met the Minister for External Economic Relations and the new Chairman of the Russian side of the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>In his letter to me, President Yeltsin reiterated his invitation to visit the Russian Federation and I intend to accept that invitation in 1995.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  In the discussions at Shannon on the use of the <Col N="94" /> airport by Aeroflot, did the Taoiseach get a commitment that Aeroflot will continue to use the airport at present traffic levels?  Are there plans to increase Aeroflot traffic through Shannon? Has the Government agreed with the Russian Government to allow Aeroflot to fly transit passengers from East European countries flown into Shannon Airport by other national airlines?  Also, does the Taoiseach envisage Aeroflot being allowed to fly Irish passengers to places in the United States, apart from Miami, in particular to New York and Washington?</P>

      <P>Some of the Deputy's questions are more appropriate to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, the details of which I do not intend to dwell on here. However, I will bring the Deputy up-to-date on the progress made so far.  I listed the areas put before members at the meeting for consideration and attention. Ambassador McCabe met the Russian Minister, Mr. Davydov, to follow up the issues raised by me at Shannon.  Heretofore the responsibility rested with various Ministers, but since President Yeltsin's return, he has been given the responsibility of handling the issues raised by me at Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At his initiative a luncheon meeting took place last Friday between him and the new chairman of the Joint Committee for Business Co-operation on the Russian side and Ambassador McCabe and his colleagues on the Irish side.  It clearly emerged that the Russian side had followed up actively on some of the points already raised.  Instructions had been given to have a double taxation agreement ratified by the Russian Parliament before the end of this year because that is holding up a great deal of business between Ireland and Russia. The Russian Ministry for Finance has been asked to make a decision on VAT on duty free goods, a problem affecting Aer Rianta.  Mr. Davydov saw no difficulty in Russian veterinary experts visiting Ireland before 25 October to sort out the ban on imports of Irish bone-in <Col N="95" /> beef.  The Russians confirmed their continuing interest in Shannon, not only from a transport viewpoint but also as a possible centre for adding value to goods for export.  That is the response to a number of the issues raised and the others are being followed up.  Some of the detail requested by the Deputy is more appropriate to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications who I am sure will be delighted to supply the information.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that there is extreme concern in the Shannon regions generally about the future levels of traffic through Shannon and that Aeroflot is seen as vital to maintaining its lifeblood?  Will he reply to the part of Deputy Noonan's question which related to maintaining Aeroflot's level of traffic through Shannon? Will he also answer the very important question about the possible freeing up of the regulations governing the type of passengers that Aeroflot may bring through Shannon, its ability to pick up at Shannon and take traffic from intervening airports using it?  Will the Taoiseach clarify those two points as they would contribute greatly to increasing the use of Shannon by Aeroflot and former Soviet airlines generally?</P>

Within a month a meeting will take place between the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and his counterpart to deal with the specific elements regarding air transport agreements. I will also supply Deputy Bruton with details of the other issues which I will submit to Deputy Noonan.  In regard to generating more business from Russia for Shannon, I suggested measures regarding cargo clearance.  We should generate more business for Shannon through cargo as well as passenger traffic.  We are all interested in developing those areas at Shannon and I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy Cowen, will endeavour to get firm commitments in that regard at the forthcoming meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from investigations, which may be initiated independently by the Garda or the Revenue Commissioners, there are other mechanisms available to the Government for the investigation of matters of public concern.  These include ministerial investigations, which can be initiated on a statutory or non-statutory basis, and investigations into the affairs of companies under the Companies Act, 1990. There are also mechanisms available for people who feel aggrieved by decisions of public bodies to appeal to, for example, the Social Welfare Appeals <Col N="104" /> Office, An Bord Pleanála or the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Government Chief Whip to conduct a wide-ranging examination of the ways in which matters of public concern are dealt with, particularly in other countries, and to report to myself and the Tánaiste as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this examination is to find a more cost-effective means of conducting inquiries into matters of major public concern other than beef-type tribunals. In so doing the Government will ensure that any new procedure proposed will provide that any investigations undertaken will use fair procedures, as guaranteed by Article 40.3 of the Constitution.</P>

Is the <Col N="105" /> present position that the Government still adheres to the ludicrous proposition that Ministers are not responsible to committees of this House because they are responsible to the House in its entirely?  Is that the advice of the Attorney General to this Government? If that is the advice of the Attorney General to the Government, can the Taoiseach tell us when we will have an Attorney General who believes that the Irish Constitution is the same as that in every other Western democracy, in that Ministers come before committees of their parliaments, testify when required to do so, answering questions in detail when it is appropriate that they should do so?  Does he accept that parliamentary questions such as we have just had, which at best are parliamentary fencing, do not constitute the appropriate way to deal with serious matters such as export credit insurance?</P>

In view of the fact that there have been 276 ministerial trips since this Government took office and the Government jet has never been busier, having clocked up 976 hours at a cost of £5 million, will he consider reintroducing some level of control by his Department?

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The amounts of claims by parties awarded costs by the tribunal will be closely scrutinised and, if necessary, vigorously contested before the Taxing Master and, if necessary, in the High Court.  The work will be done by the cost accounting section of the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  A legal cost accountant, specialising in legal cost claims, has been engaged to assist in this work.</P>
      <P>Fees paid to the State legal team were set in accordance with the advice of the Attorney General, who took account of the importance and complexity of the case.  Legal fees paid to the State legal team for working days when the tribunal was not in public session were reduced in January 1992 when it became apparent that the tribunal would last longer than expected.  Since there were almost twice as many such days as days in public session, this renegotiation resulted in a significant saving for the Exchequer.  Efforts were made to reduce the cost of counsel engaged to help complete the report and a small reduction was achieved.</P>
      <P>Fees in relation to the beef tribunal were not allowed to rise as the hearings went on and the fees paid were at a rate considered appropriate throughout the life of the tribunal.  Accordingly renegotiation, other than as I have outlined, was not undertaken.  I understand that it is common for counsel to be paid at a higher rate for an unusually long assignment, since being unavailable to other clients for a long period may damage their future career and earnings prospects.</P>
      <P>It is my intention, as I outlined some weeks ago, that every costs claim against the State will be vigorously contested in order to keep costs to the Exchequer and thus to the taxpayer to a minimum.  While acknowledging the rights of all to protect their good name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> I am anxious that claims from parties who, in the light of the tribunal findings, could be considered to have brought trouble on themselves by their own actions, will be particularly keenly disputed. However, a hearing on costs claims before the Taxing Master is not the correct place to pursue allegations of tax evasion or other criminal offences.  Where offences against the criminal law may have been committed, that is a matter to be dealt with through the courts in the normal way.</P>
    <P>As regards the level of representation at the inquiry, the number of lawyers whose fees have been allowed was decided by the tribunal.  That number was a good deal less than the number actually briefed by the parties concerned &mdash; 75 as against 107 claimed.</P>
    <P>As regards excessive attendance, all claims will be closely examined when they are submitted and every avenue for reducing costs to the Exchequer will be thoroughly explored.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Byrne's question about administrative and procedural changes to be introduced, my Department has drawn up, with the Office of the Attorney General, guidelines to be applied by all Departments in respect of any future tribunals.  These guidelines are designed to ensure that the legal costs in connection with tribunals are controlled to the maximum extent possible.  The guidelines have been circulated to all accounting officers in Departments with the instruction that they are to be strictly implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The public are outraged that the Beef Tribunal will cost more than £30 million.  How was the figure of £1,890 per sitting day agreed?  I understand that figure represents a High Court rate for a normal case that would take three to five days.  The tribunal continued for virtually two years and barristers said to me that the rate per sitting day would be renegotiated downwards. Is the Minister aware that in the Whiddy Island case Mr. Justice Costello <Col N="112" /> refused to award costs to Gulf Oil?  In view of the findings against Mr. Goodman, was there not a case to be made, on the basis of tax evasion, and malpractices in respect of beef, for not awarding costs to Mr. Goodman?  Is the Minister aware that some people including Members of the House, who had a minimal input in the tribunal had a full team of senior and junior counsel at the tribunal, who did not examine or crossexamine witnesses?  Will the Minister vigorously contest that element of costs, which in one case may be in excess of £1.5 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will vigorously negotiate the various costs with the taxing master.  On whether costs can be denied to the Goodman group or anybody else, under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, the tribunal may allow parties to be legally represented.  Under the tribunals of inquiry legislation of 1979 the tribunal may award the costs of such representation. There is no question of interference with that.  It is a matter of legislation, and it is a matter for the tribunal in the first instance when people go before it and in the final instance when they make the report.  There is no question of us being able to block that. However, we have powers, and Mr. Justice Hamilton highlighted in his report that it was a matter for the Department of Finance to appeal these issues with the taxing master.  As I outlined in some detail in the House, I intend to do that, without interfering in any way with the legislation, the tribunal or legal rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fees were negotiated by the Attorney General in the first instance. In January 1992 he renegotiated in respect of the non-sitting days.  I agree with Deputy Yates that the costs are large even though at this stage they are hard to gauge because the only figures I have relate to the costs of the State's legal teams amounting to £3.8 million. I have only a few small claims for the remainder.  There were 226 sitting days which were paid for at the full rate. There were 419 non-sitting days in <Col N="113" /> respect of which renegotiation saved the Exchequer a considerable amount of money.  During the debate on the tribunal I said I will dispute the costs as best I can within the terms of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in previous tribunals there was no payment for non-sitting days?  Instead of making a virtue out of it, why did he not ask serious questions when it became likely that instead of running on for a few months it would run for two years? Why did the Attorney General, as leader of the profession, not say that it was never intended to make millionaires of lawyers and that there should be some renegotiation?  Barristers have told me that would have been eminently reasonable.  Will the Minister specifically investigate people who were granted representation who sat there getting £2,000 a day on days on which there was evidence that had nothing to do with them?  It was an absolute disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Where we can make a case to the taxing master that the fees were excessive we will certainly do so. Under the legislation it is up to the tribunal of inquiry to decide whether parties may be legally represented and if they may be awarded costs.  Such rights are important and consistent with fundamental legal rights.  When such decisions are made at the outset of a tribunal, it is not open to me to say that the fees should be adjusted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 41, 61, 63, 75 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The expected yield in 1994 from the residential property tax was £12 million. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that all residential property tax payments for 1994 have not yet been processed fully.  However, at this comparatively early stage, the indications are that the yield for 1994 will be in the region of £13 million.  Subject to any adjustment when the payments are fully processed, the amount received to 10 October was £12 million.</P>
      <P>The residential property tax is levied on the same basis throughout the State but obviously those areas with higher property values and income levels will pay the greater share of the total.  These variations are not simply based on whether a house is in an urban or rural area.  We all know that houses in some areas of the same city tend to be more valuable than a similar house in other areas.</P>
      <P>As regards the abolition of residential property tax, I have no proposals to do so.  As for the review referred to by Deputy Yates in regard to local service charges and residential property tax, I have indicated on previous occasions that my Department has been preparing a report on property tax generally and this is being examined by the tax strategy group.  Any proposals which emerge from that examination will be considered by the Government in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has shown that it is responsive to genuine concerns over the impact of residential property tax. These concerns were taken into account in an examination carried out in February/March this year.  This resulted in the introduction of adjustments to deal with long standing anomalies and to recognise the position of certain taxpayers, while preserving the broad thrust of the budget measure.  The <Col N="116" /> changes eliminate possible hardship for households with elderly, incapacitated or widowed persons, while a new general hardship provision has been introduced to deal with cases not otherwise catered for.  It was also decided to reduce the rate of tax applying to houses valued between £100,000 and £150,000 from a proposed 2 per cent to 1½ per cent.  Marginal income-related relif was extended from £30,000 to £35,00.  Finally, a deferred payment option was introduced to assist taxpayers in meeting their obligations.  The effect of these adjustments has been to ease significantly the burden of the residential property tax on a considerable number of family homes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of house valuation.  I agree with Deputy Callely's view that house owners by and large are fairly realistic in their own estimates of the value of their property and this seems to be borne out by what research there is on the subject.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their experience of the operation of the tax indicates that the vast majority of householders tend to submit a fair and realistic value in respect of their property.  This seems to be supported by the experience from the clearance certificate scheme which has applied since 1993 to properties sold for more than the residential property tax limit.</P>
    <P>Obviously house valuation is not an exact science and for that reason, a banding system was introduced in this year's Finance Act, for houses under £100,000.  This means that owners of such houses can place their house within value bands of £5,000.  There is also an appeals procedure whereby if agreement cannot be reached on the value of a property, the householder has the right to appeal to an independent expert.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that in terms of the amount of revenue it yields and in the context of the cost of administering it, complying with it and the difficulties <Col N="117" /> created by it, the residential property tax is simply not worth the candle as a major component of any system of tax reform?  Would he not now take this opportunity, as a member of Fianna Fáil, to indicate whether the people of Ireland can expect a promise from his party at the next election, which my party is certainly making, to repeal this tax?</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell is being at least constructive and helpful in putting forward an alternative system. Deputy McDowell will note that since we discussed this on the Finance Bill during the summer months I have completed a comprehensive analysis and report on the various taxes.  I am not in a position to give a direct reply to Deputy McDowell's question but the House will note that although the socalled experts who knew all about property and property values told me that my prediction of £28,000 to £30,000 was widely off the mark, that figure was somewhat over optimistic.</P>

I agree with Deputy McDowell that the IFSC has so far this year given me an <Col N="118" /> additional £70 million.  The £5 tax on holidays, a loose enough arrangement, yielded £80 million.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate that he will put forward to the tax review group his view that this tax should be scrapped, that it is an ideological tax and that it is not fair?  For instance, is he aware that people over the age of 65 do not have to pay this tax and that some serving members of the Judiciary, who have still not retired under the new scheme, have vast salaries and are exempt from this tax while their next door neighbours on lesser salaries have to pay the full tax?  Is the Minister not ashamed of this arbitrary tax and is he not determined to bring it to an end?  Will he respond to a suggestion I made on two occasions when standing in for Deputy Cox on the Finance Bill by establishing an all-party committee to examine the financing of local government and forget about this tax which is an ideological Frankenstein that has done much damage?</P>

    <Title>ACC Bank Bill, 1994: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a simple technical Bill, with just one section, whose purpose is to <Col N="184" /> raise the limit on the borrowings which ACC Bank is permitted to undertake. At present this limit stands at £1,000 million and I propose to raise it to £1,400 million.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; in this context means the sum total of the deposits placed with the bank and all other forms of borrowing.  When a bank accepts a deposit from a customer, it is increasing its borrowing.  This enables the bank to increase its lending and thus to grow its business.  In recent years ACC Bank has been attracting substantial deposits and growing at a strong rate.  At 31 December 1993, ACC Bank's total borrowing amounted to £882 million.  Business has grown significantly in the current year.  There is a distinct possibility that the bank's existing ceiling will be reached by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to discuss the contents of the Bill in some detail, I would like to say a few words by way of background commentary on the operations and position of ACC Bank.  As Deputies are aware, the Agricultural Credit Corporation was established in 1927 to cater for the special funding needs of agriculture in this country, in particular by way of the provision of long term credit which was not readily available from other sources.  Growth, however, was slow.  It was not until the 1960s that the corporation began to establish itself as a major lending agency, assisted by legislation which increased its borrowing powers and enabled it to accept deposits from the public.  In this period, and in the following decade, the agricultural sector grew strongly, boosted by Ireland's entry into the European Community.  The economic difficulties of the early 1980s adversely affected the sector, with attendant consequences for ACC.  Bad debts and increases in arrears reduced the profitability of the corporation, culminating in heavy losses in 1987.  The Agricultural Credit Act, 1988, sought to help address the problems of ACC, in particular through the granting of powers to the corporation to widen the base <Col N="185" /> of its operations in accordance with modern banking practice.</P>
    <P>In the following years ACC turned the corner and is now heading for its seventh successive year of increasing profitability.  This process of recovery was aided by the passage of the ACC Bank Act, 1992, which removed entirely the remaining restriction on lending outside the agriculture sector.  That Act also changed the name of the organisation to ACC Bank plc to reflect the enhanced orientation into sectors of the economy other than agriculture and agribusiness.  It also increased the authorised share capital from £35 million to £50 million, and raised the limit on borrowing from £800 million to £1,000 million. Finally, the 1992 Act brought ACC Bank within the prudential supervision of the Central Bank.  This means that ACC Bank is now subject to the same rules as apply to the other credit institutions supervised by the Central Bank. These rules relate in the main to capital adequacy, liquidity, categories and exposure, permissible charges and deposit guarantee.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, an increase in the statutory borrowing limit of ACC Bank is required because without it the bank would have to cease increasing its deposits and adding to its other forms of borrowing.  This would correspondingly limit its capacity to increase lending to its customers.  This impasse would obviously be unacceptable, as it would amount to imposing an unnecesary and discriminatory restriction on the bank's operations. That is why I am now proposing to raise the ceiling to accommodate the operational needs of the bank.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase in the limit is £400 million.  At the average rate of growth which has obtained in recent years, this should cover the bank's requirements for the next three or four years.  However, if recent trends are maintained, the new ceiling could be reached in as little as two years.</P>
    <P>This Bill addresses the needs of ACC Bank as they exist at present.  If there are any developments in the banking <Col N="186" /> sector which involve or fundamentally affect the operation of the bank, appropriate measures, including the introduction of legislation, will be taken as the needs arise.  The present Bill is purely technical and is in no way related to the possible restructuring of the State banks.  There are no hidden links with or implications for the restructuring of the State banks.  As Deputies will know, I have received the report of the consortium which I appointed to advise me on the options available in respect of the goals underpinning the Programme for Government in relation to the development of the banking sector.  I am at present examining that report and hope to be in a position to bring the matter to Government at an early date.  In the interim, I have to deal with the <i>status quo</i> which dictates that if ACC Bank is not to be hampered in its development, it requires an immediate increase in its borrowing limit.  It is in any case highly unlikely that any change in the position of ACC Bank, if that were what the Government should decide, could be implemented in the short period between now and the end of this parliamentary session, by which time the increase in the borrowing limit will be required if present trends continue.</P>
    <P>This is a technical Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <P>I ask the Opposition spokespersons on Finance to agree to the proposal that, on conclusion of Second Stage, we proceed with the subsequent stages. However, if there is a difficulty the Bill can be referred to the Select Committee which is due to debate the Stock Exchange Bill and the report of the Central Bank.  In addition the by-elections will be held in a number of weeks.</P>

      <P>The Minister is proposing that all Stages be taken today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill, the purpose of which is to raise the financial limit, and I have no particular difficulty with it.  My only difficulty is that I am <Col N="187" /> due to leave for Cork shortly but the Bill can be agreed to in my absence.  I indicated to my party's Whip last week that, given the nature of the Bill, I would be happy to take all Stages.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to deal with matters which, unfortunately, we were unable to deal with at Question Time today.  As the Minister indicated, the future of the ACC is uncertain, we do not know if it will remain in State hands.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97</i> states at page 4:</P>
      <P>The Government will develop a vigorous third banking force from within the State sector by merging the ICC Bank and the ACC Bank and by seeking a merger of the new entity with the Trustee Savings Bank.  The new State banks will also develop strong links with the network of An Post for money transactions and banking services.</P>
      <P>The ACC has never agreed to or supported this proposal.  It is implacably opposed to such a merger and has stoutly resisted all such overtures.  When its last annual report was published the chief executive and chairman made it abundantly clear that such a merger would not be in its best interests.</P>
      <P>The ACC Bank has served this country well since its inception in 1927 and has been very successful since its remit was widened in 1988 to include corporate banking, small business finance and personal lending.  With annual profits of between £8 million to £10 million we can look at this matter in a new light. It was established specifically to provide credit for the agriculture and food industries which was not available elsewhere. However, in the overall scheme of things it is a small player.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if either party in Government commissioned an analysis or study of the proposal to establish a new super State bank or if they thought that these banks, if they were in the private sector, would be a natural fit.  It is my understanding that it is likely <Col N="188" /> there will be substantial job losses within the ACC and the ICC if the merger proceeds.  There is no synergy in the way there is between a corporate bank and a building society where there would be no conflict.  Such a conflict exists in this case.</P>
    <P>No analysis was carried out of this proposal and it was not put to the Department of Finance.  The Government is beginning to realise that this proposal has no economic foundation.  If the ACC, the ICC and the TSB are merged, as proposed, would such a State bank have the AIB and the Bank of Ireland quaking in their boots? People have missed the point; that the three banks combined are smaller than the Ulster Bank and it would not be a major player.</P>
    <P>We need to reassess this matter calmly and objectively in the context of the TSB proposals and the future of ACC and ICC.  We must set out clear objectives in discussing the future of these banks.  There are three simple objectives the first of which should be to maximise competition in the banking sector.  Prior to the European elections the Taoiseach with some justification launched a broadside at the banks about the differential between their lending and deposit rates and their charges but there has been no follow up.  International experience shows that regulation can play only a limited role in this regard.  It is crucial to shake up the big two through competition.  What proposal, therefore, would lead to the maximum level of competition?</P>
    <P>Second, having invested in the ACC and the ICC and having fostered development in the TSB through special legislation and tax breaks during the years, the taxpayer is entitled to the maximum return from any sale.  I have seen quotations attributed to the Department of Finance to the effect that it does not want to get involved in a Dutch auction.  I realise that there may be procedural difficulties as far as the TSB is concerned but the taxpayer has a right to ensure that whoever is prepared to pay the highest price is given <Col N="189" /> proper consideration.  We should not accept a discount deal or a sweetheart arrangement with a particular interested party.</P>
    <P>Third, any suitor in presenting a development plan should have to give assurances to protect the livelihoods of those directly involved in the ACC, the ICC and the TSB; a vigorous investment programme to develop the retail bank clearing network and the corporate banking sector and to increase market share so that people would be aware that they were part of an organisation with real potential.</P>
    <P>There is a queue and I have received glossy material from all three, the Ulster Bank, the Irish Nationwide Building Society and the NIB.  The Government made attempts at Tinakilly House to resolve its ideological problems but, as the Minister is aware, having spoken to ADM about the sale of Greencore shares, one cannot conduct a business transaction on the basis of political paralysis whereby the chairman of the Labour Party or someone else says that the State must have a political role. That is not the way to conduct business. It is important for the banks involved, the ACC, the ICC and the TSB that the uncertainty is removed sooner rather than later, that the matter is not treated as a political football to be kicked to touch every now and again and to be thrown to the Labour Parliamentary Party and Government sub-committees. We need to take commercial decisions on the criteria I outlined.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware the proposal contained in the Programme for Government was unworkable.  When his departmental officials began to study it he had to rewrite the ground rules and obtain a consultant's report because it was inoperable and nobody, except the ICC, was keen on it.  The ICC has served this country well.  It is proper that the ICC should be taken into consideration. In the final analysis the Minister cannot delay much more than a month before he makes a decision.  It cannot be a haphazard or <i>ad hoc</i><Col N="190" /> decision which leaves the ACC in limbo.</P>
    <P>The proceeds of any such sale should go towards the debt and not be used for current financing.  I do not believe that the services provided by the banks in the public sector are better than those provided by banks in the commercial sector.  I do not believe that the cost structure of a State bank would be lower or that its service would be more competitive.  I noted also that the chairman of one of the two big banks in a remarkable speech last week challenged the Government to go ahead with the State bank because the banks were waiting to take on the competition.  In fact the way I read the report of what was said by one of the great and the good in our society who sat on task forces and so on was he was saying jeeringly that he wanted a State bank because commercial banks love to take on competition and if politicians are to lecture them on their cost he would like to see how they will get their cost structure down.</P>
    <P>This matter has to be dealt with properly and on commercial criteria as too many livelihoods are involved.  We need a serious competitor to the two big banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland but I do not believe that the Programme for Government will fulfill that.  In a fair, transparent and open system, a new bank should emerge, but it should not involve the ACC.  The request to the management of ACC is in line with the best interests of the ACC.  The ICC and the TSB should form a new commercial bank but it should not be a bank of last resort.  We abolished Fóir Teoranta but it left a huge mess in terms of people having a different attitude to repaying debt to the State than to others.  We need to have a clear cut analysis of the criteria for such a bank.</P>
    <P>This side of the House will look at the resolution for the TSB bank on the criteria I mentioned.  We will not be playing politics with the issue.  We do not want to see backbenchers agonising and unable to make a commercial decision. <Col N="191" /> Greencore was a total farce at the end of the day, which was no way to conduct business.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to this Bill and will facilitate its passage.  We compliment all those involved with ACC bank on the very professional way its business has grown, in particular since 1988, and we wish it every success in future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates said he had no objection to this Bill.  I was reflecting on why this House has been discussing the Bill and I arrived at the diametrically opposite conclusion to Deputy Yates, I have a strong objection to this Bill, I do not mind voting on it but I object to the very fact that we are listening to the debate.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why it is the concern of the 166 elected politicians what the borrowing limit of ACC actually is.  It is a commercial organisation which is operating profitably.  It is owned by the State and because of that we have to act as its regulator and on behalf of its shareholders decide how it grows and to fix limits from time to time, such as the one we are amending today.  I think much of the problem with the State sector is that this House has to concern itself with matters such as this.</P>
      <P>It is pretty obvious that the third banking sector is now dead although it has not yet been given a decent burial. Doubtless it will or, alternatively, the embarrassed political equivalent of a decent burial, a quiet cremation some afternoon where nobody will know it is no longer on the agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>From the beginning the whole idea was cracked and ideological.  I am not saying that from the opposite ideological end of the spectrum but one has to analyse the benefit of consolidating three institutions under the rough control of the State into one bank and making it into a significant third force.  The Labour Party, of course, thought this was some latter day <Col N="192" /> resurrection of the National Development Corporation and that it was some other agency by which politicians, who know best how to invest people's moneys and what ordinary capital development companies do not know &mdash; which companies will succeed &mdash; could create an instrument whereby they could intervene in the economy to the benefit of the small entrepreneur.  Just like the National Development Corporation, which itself was a foolish enterprise from the very beginning and an ideological Labour Party enterprise &mdash; this third force in banking was pregnant with all the possibility for disaster that its predecessors had experienced. Everybody knows that in the last analysis Fóir Teoranta ended up as a bale out agency for failing enterprise.  Of course, there were some enterprises including a well known Midlands company which was mentioned earlier this afternoon &mdash; and I will not get more personal than that &mdash; that received large hand outs from it.  Perhaps there is something more seemly in being baled out by Fóir Teoranta than by a foreign source but it seems that the idea that the State and the taxpayer should intervene in the economy to the extent of providing banking rescue services for individual companies is wrong in practice always and the principle always one which is never complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The TSB is apparently about to be sold off.  I agree generally with the remarks made by Deputy Yates that we should not get up in a heap about its sale.  If the TSB is to be sold I agree that the taxpayers should get the best possible price bearing in mind the interest they have in preserving jobs and fostering competition.  It is not a difficult decision and, quite frankly, I have no strong views as to which of the intending suitors is the better partner for this particular daughter of the Legislature. The management and employees of ACC and ICC are working hard to make them profitable commercial enterprises and obviously a great many of them fear that if their banks are sold off it will be like Cooley Distilleries, for <Col N="193" /> the purpose of being closed down by somebody who wants to eliminate the competition rather than to build, make the enterprise grow into something better, create more economic activity and greater competition in our economy.</P>
    <P>I am not like some ideological avenging angel but I simply query why it is thought that Deputies Rabbitte, Kenny, Ahern or I have any particular expertise in fixing borrowing limits for a bank. Many people accuse me on occasion of claiming omniscience and expertise in a whole series of subjects but I do not claim any expertise in banking and I have never seen anybody here who struck me as a proficient banker.  For Members collectively to think that we are wiser than we are individually is wrong and the simple fact is that we do not need to be running companies of this kind.  I believe the Chairman of AIB was fundamentally correct, if a little bit mischievous in the precise rhetorical stratagem he used.  He was fundamentally correct in asking the Government to compete with them if it really believed their charges were excessive.  He would not welcome a substantial player doing battle with him; he simply recognises that if the State attempted to do so, it would result in an almighty débâcle in which they would laugh at the departing army after a short competitive battle and the State would simply throw in the towel.</P>
    <P>The observe side of the taunt made by Mr. Culliton is equally valid and to some extent reflects on the two largest banks.  They need competition and the customer needs effective competition.  If it does not come from within our economy it will come from outside it.  If it does not come from banks which have traditionally functioned here, some big player will move into Ireland, take them on and provide genuine competition. Obviously, if possible, most people would prefer the competitor to be an Irish domiciled and controlled banking partner but looking to ACC, ICC, TSB and any other likely coalition of banking forces, there does not seem to be &mdash; even if they are all together &mdash; the <Col N="194" /> bones of a significant competitor for the two larger banks.</P>
    <P>That brings this House to the point that it is far more important to enforce anti-cartel and anti-competitive practice law against the two larger banks because there is not any sign of a large competitor or break into the banking duopoly now.  It will not become a three cornered battle among equals in the foreseeable future and, therefore, the function of the State is to ensure that this duopoly, which effectively operates in most areas of the country, does not do so at excessive cost to the banking public.</P>
    <P>One must take on board also that if the State is preaching lower margins, lower charges, lower manning levels and greater productivity to the larger banks, one only has to look to the State sector to see whether it is practising what it preaches and whether it is capable of doing so.  That is yet another reason why it would be desirable to divest the State of its existing banking investments.  To some extent, in the arguments with the AIB, the Bank of Ireland and the other large banks, the presence in the State &ldquo;sheep pen&rdquo; of the three State owned mini banks is a standing argument available to the top brass of the private banks whereby they could say: &ldquo;if what you are saying is correct about us, why can't you practise it yourselves?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the proposal for a third sector bank, there is a danger of creating a body which would make political decisions on investment of moneys.  One only has to imagine the pressure from a Government such as we have now, or one party of it, on such a third sector bank to make loans available to companies which were in difficulty.  I am deeply against politically available credit and we must rid ourselves of the notion that that is a proper way to run a credit institution or that some of the 166 TDs in this House can, by pulling strings, get loans for this or that.</P>
    <P>If we eventually have a number of competitive institutions here.  I hope some type of effective banking customer ombudsman is established to <Col N="195" /> ensure that people get fair service from the banks and that people who are vulnerable, especially when they are in a difficult financial circumstance or where their credit lines are extended, are not treated unfairly by banking institutions. Instead of devoting departmental time to supervising these agencies, auditing their accounts and so on, it would be far better if the equivalent departmental time was put into ensuring competition among banks and redress for people who are unfairly treated by them rather than inadequately attempting to compete in the market as is currently, the case.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not been dismissive of the ACC Bank because I am pleased to see that it is a profitable body.  If it is disposed of I hope its potential for profitability will determine its price and that we will get real value for money disposing of this bank, the ICC and the TSB to whoever wishes to invest in them.  Profitable businesses are always the subject of potential takeovers and I do not see why there should not be a queue of potential suitors for the ACC Bank and ICC Bank.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Labour Party, who went into this coalition Government arrangement trumpeting that there would be no privatisation, to grow up. Nobody in this House, including me, believes we should privatise everything. None of us would adopt the attitude that the State should only be concerned with running the police force, the army, the courts and some other services.  The Labour Party is a prisoner of an out-of-date ideology.  It is not doing battle with a Thatcherite Opposition in this House or a Thatcherite partner in Government in Fianna Fáil.  It is not as if the higher echelons of the public service, who devise many of the policies which underly this Government's activities, have suddenly developed an appetite for Thatcherite privatisation.  Nobody is suggesting that our water supply should be privatised tomorrow.  Nobody is looking at aspects of Irish society with a view to privatising them immediately <Col N="196" /> because it is wrong to have them under communal control.  If that is the case, why is one party in this House saying that it will not allow privatisation under any circumstances, that Telecom is too important and that it wants a State interest in the banking field?  Who does the Labour Party think it is kidding?  It is shadow boxing.  It is like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza &mdash; I do not know who is the Sancho Panza to Deputy Spring &mdash; and it is tilting at windmills. Nobody wants to undo this huge State sector because they are driven by some ideological compulsion to do so.</P>
    <P>This country has matured to the point of realising that the Government is not a good and efficient shareholder of a banking company; the same applies to the aircraft maintenance industry.  The Government appears not to be a very good shareholder or board member of these type of institutions.  The Labour Party has to argue the merits of each company's case and it establishes that it would be better for the workforce or for the economy to allow a particular company to remain in State ownership, let it make that case but to say as it did before the last election that there will be no privatisation is entirely illusory and politically dishonest.  It creates difficulties for many firms.  If long term decisions are not made about huge areas of the semi State sector, such as Telecom Éireann and the ESB which face real competition in the next five years, based on a real appraisal of the requirements of the economy and the companies concerned with a view to deciding what the national good requires and not the private good of individual or collective investors or people who would tell Sid what they want to do with their private deals, there will be more casualties of the Irish Steel and TEAM Aer Lingus type.</P>
    <P>Let us forget about ideology and stop listening to the Labour Party prating on about how they are protecting employees from privatisation.  There is no virulent privatisation agenda on anyone's desk.  The people have come to a realistic view of these matters.  They do <Col N="197" /> not believe they had to run Greencore and they are happy to have divested themselves of their responsibility there. They do not believe it was necessary for them to run Irish Life or that they profited from owning it.  It was better to divest themselves of that ownership. The same applies to the banking sector. The time has come for the Labour Party to come off its ideological pedestal and prove one way or the other the implications of a merger between ACC, ICC and TSB.  It should state publicly and coherently, where it is subject to challenge, what the advantages would have been of this mythical third sector, what decisions it would make under political ownership and control which other banks are not making now and why it would be better than Ulster Bank at dealing with customers.</P>
    <P>I am tired of seeing specialist schemes stating there is £10 million or £20 million available in this or that bank for small enterprises.  I welcome anything that helps enterprise but the fundamental role of Government is not to twist the arms of the banking sector to set up this or that fund &mdash; kiddies corner in economic terms &mdash; to promote this or that political or economic aim.  What is needed is a Government which looks to the overall economic climate and asks if this is a challenge or an obstacle to innovation and enterprise here.  In that context, I would be more impressed if the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, spent more time making the case for tackling the tax wedge than he does making the case for special funds for Irish enterprise, courtesy of this or that bank. I would be more impressed if he were actively concerned with reducing electricity prices further by competition rather than posturing as being concerned with the interests of small industry by publishing glossy brochures and endless reports on their problems.</P>
    <P>I would be happier if the Government looked at the economic regime it is imposing on Irish enterprise generally and see what it can do in that context rather than have a special tailor made <Col N="198" /> scheme which looks good because one could bring out a report, have a press conference in the Shelbourne Hotel and have half a page in the <i>The Irish Times</i> devoted to it when one announces it. However, no one gets that kind of publicity for continuing in existence the anti-work system.  It is easier to get credit for an innovative proposal in the financial media than to accept criticism for maintaining an anti-enterprise culture.</P>
    <P>I will not ever be impressed by the Labour Party but I would be much less unimpressed if it faced up to what is really holding the economy back and basic facts such as the cost of employing people.  It talks about being the party of labour but it has not suggested or politically supported reducing tax on work and has not done anything to further employment.</P>
    <P>I am tired of our attitude towards the EU.  We believe that it is always in our interest to support the Commission and say the Tories in Britain are wrong, their attitude to Europe is repugnant and we are more <i>communitaire</i> than others.  We sign on for things such as the Social Chapter with gay élan and will go down the road of social control of the employment contract irrespective of its effect on the numbers in work.</P>
    <P>Among the pile of glossy rubbish given to Deputies I saw an EU White Paper on employment prospects.  I do not know who is responsible for it but it is a deplorable document.  It acknowledges in passing the abject failure of Europe to deal with employment as an activity but goes on to elaborate on other plans to make the employment market in Europe more restrictive and difficult to operate.  I would be much happier if an Irish Government stood up and said we are on the periphery of Europe; we have 270,000 people unemployed; we do not want more regulation of our labour market and do not want standards which Germany, Belgium or Holland feel are necessary for their highly regulated markets to be extended to us.  The European disease has produced the lowest growth in employment <Col N="199" /> despite Europe having one of the highest rates of economic growth over the last 30 years.  We want to call a halt to that.</P>
    <P>I would be impressed if an Irish Minister for Enterprise and Employment or Finance said: &ldquo;I want to call a halt to increasing regulation and restriction of the labour market on a European level&rdquo;, if they had the courage to tell Commissioner Flynn &ldquo;no, we have had enough.  We do not need more regulation rather we need bright ideas about how to deregulate the labour market and get people into a position where they can participate in our economic life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like Ireland to look to its own interests.  These are not simply the interests of farmers but of employers and employees.  I am glad IBEC has challenged the notion that being totally <i>communitaire</i> is in Ireland's economic interest.  I am sorry it is the only group thus far which has had the courage to challenge the suffocating consensus in Ireland that whatever the Commission says is right and that whatever is handed down in the form of draft regulations which carry the little halo on top of them and is part of the Social Chapter or is socially cohesive, is necessarily in Ireland's interests.</P>
    <P>I will be impressed when we cotton on to the fact that the European Union, of which we will remain a member, has the worst record in job creation and that imposing the European Union standards of economic failure on our economy at an increasing level carries with it the almost inevitable consequence that we will have less capacity to provide employment opportunities for our people.  Instead of a Labour Party which says it is protecting, like a lonely group of stragglers in an ideological army, the commanding heights of the Irish economy, which is a laugh, we want a Government which will examine every aspect of economic life on a case by case basis and decide whether government is part of the problem rather than part of the solution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> I am very strongly of the view that this should be the last occasion on which this House is asked to change the borrowing limits for ACC Bank.  The next time the House considers a Bill dealing with ACC it should be to sign off the State's interest in the bank and to launch it as a mutual organisation in the real world, with owners and managers who do not have to go to the Minister for Finance for permission to increase their borrowing limits but who will compete in the real market and achieve an increasing share of the credit market for their bank.  This should be the last occasion this House is troubled with such a Bill.  This debate is fundamentally a waste of time, a distraction from our real work.</P>
    <P>I would love the Labour Party in particular to come to the view that it is prepared to examine the State sector on a case by case basis so as to decide what the national interest requires of those companies in the future.  I fear this will not happen and that instead there will be much jersey pulling and shin kicking on the political pitch and that in the last analysis we will see an ideological tussle in which the Labour Party will not be motivated by the good of the institutions about which it is arguing but rather will be increasingly motivated between now and the next general election by its desire to be seen to be flexing its muscles and asserting its identity. This is what worries me most of all.  I am afraid it will not care about the issue, just as it did not care who was appointed president of the High Court. It did not matter a damn what the issue was.  The important thing was that it was seen to be flexing its muscles, asserting its identity and telling other people to take it for granted.  Unfortunately, that coinage will be the stuff of the tussels within the Cabinet on the semi-State sector generally and the losers will be the people who the Labour Party claimed at the last election it would protect, the people who work in those institutions.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell has <Col N="201" /> greatly broadened the scope of the debate.  The first question which arises in my mind is: where is the Labour Party?  If Deputy McDowell's speech does not provoke the Labour Party to enter the House I cannot imagine any speech which will.</P>
      <P>The House is subject to much uninformed criticism about the number of Members who regularly attend here.  A great deal of this criticism is uninformed nonsense, but on occasions it is very pertinent.  For example, all Deputies have participated on radio programmes with members of the Labour Party who have told the listenership about major speeches they have made and the initiatives they have taken.  We are often too polite to correct this assertion. Last night I watched a very enjoyable programme during which the very pleasant Deputy Roísín Shortall outlined the frustrations of being a back bencher, the lack of opportunity they have to make an input, etc.  I thought this Bill, which provides an opportunity to discuss the banking configuration in this economy, was an ideal occasion for Labour Party Deputies, if they were so minded, to tell us what they think about the questions raised by Deputy McDowell.  They should not leave it on my shoulders to defend them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two questions have been raised during the debate: first, whether a State bank could provide real competition in the economy and a genuine alternative which would lead to a better service for consumers and, second, the paternity of the idea that there ought to be a third banking force within the meaning of the Programme for a Partnership Government. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, most emphatically knows the paternity of this idea, which can be traced to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Deputy Ruairi Quinn, who in his pre-ministerial guise raised it during the debate on the ACC Bank Act on April Fool's Day 1992.  He articulated the idea at some length during that debate and fleshed it out on a number of occasions on which the Minister for Finance and I were present in <Col N="202" /> the House.  That is another reason Labour back benchers should be present. Instead of availing of the medium of the 1 p.m. news on Sunday, they should tell the Minister what they think about his decision to sell out on their idea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my memory too. Nonetheless the Minister was a member of the negotiating team which put this idea in place.  He had access to the advisers in Merrion Street at that time, yet he went ahead with it.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, abandoned his baby?  This was his idea and we ought to know the position.  This has not been a good week for Minister Quinn.  Of all the Members of the Cabinet I am sure he was most shaken by the cataclysmic events of recent times. He did not deserve the horrible joke made at his expense in terms of the threatened general election.  I never thought there was going to be a general election until the Minister for Finance was dropped from the negotiating committee, at which stage I got worried. However, I was reassured by the horribly cruel joke at Minister Quinn's expense that everything was safe because the negotiating team was comprised of three Fianna Fáil Ministers and one Labour Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entitled to know if the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and the Labour Party have turned their backs on the only unique and distinctive proposal in the Programme for a Partnership Government, that is, a third banking force within the State sector comprised of an amalgamation of ICC, ACC, the TSB and a possible link with An Post.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, ought to tell us if he has browbeaten the Labour Party on this issue.  If the Labour Party was prepared to risk a general election for the appointment of a President of the High Court, it ought to be prepared to go to the wire on a uniquely <Col N="203" /> Labour proposal in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I appeal to some of my colleagues on the Labour side of the House to tell us where they stand on this very important issue.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, in his pre-ministerial guise, on April fool's day in 1992, said &mdash; and he was even more dismissive of it than Deputy Michael McDowell has been now for different reasons &mdash; at column 283 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The Bill is nothing more than a coat of polish for the family silver,...</P>
    <P>He went on to call for the establishment of: &ldquo;a diversified and integrated banking system under the control of the State&rdquo; comprising the ACC bank, the ICC and the Trustee Savings Bank.  In expressing his distrust of Government intentions on that day he was echoing, very faintly admittedly, the views of his colleagues on the Trustee Savings Bank Bill, 1989.</P>
    <P>One has to get the indignation decibels up a great deal when quoting from Deputy Mervyn Taylor, prior to his Ministerial portfolio on issues such as this.  Deputy Taylor accused the Minister, (column 1290 of the Official Report of 2 November 1989) of, &ldquo;gearing himself up and preparing the powers to do a Thatcher operation on the Trustee Savings Banks&rdquo;.  He went on in full rhetorical flight to say: &ldquo;not 5 per cent, not 10 per cent, not even 1 per cent of these banks will be allowed fall into the hands of private creditors.&rdquo; I would like to hear from him now. Deputy Taylor, who pleaded impotence on these benches for a long time, is now a Cabinet Minister.  The indignation decibels have gone down but I would like to hear where he stands on this uniquely Labour creation for a third bank within the State sector.</P>
    <P>Deputies Michael McDowell and Yates asked whether a State bank would provide real competition.  There is no dispute in this House about the necessity for competition.  A cartel operates among the high street banks with a <Col N="204" /> duopoly between the two big banks. The result is the consumer is getting a harsh deal, small businesses are finding access to seed capital very difficult and the large banks are making extraordinarily high profits.  They argue, by reference to international benchmarks that they require profits of the order they are achieving.  However, those profits are extraordinarily high in an Irish context at the expense of the Irish consumer. Everybody agrees there is a bewildering array of charges and fees attached to the accounts of both corporate and personal consumers.</P>
    <P>The need for competition is not at issue here.  The question is whether it could be provided by a State bank.  I take a different view from Deputies Michael McDowell and Yates in that I believe it could in certain circumstances. The campaign of the high street banks to kill off the idea is evidence that it could.  For example, on the Continent, either in France or Italy, there is a thriving major banking system within the State sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it may be necessary to link up with some international bank if the idea of a merger between the banks listed in the Programme for a Partnership Programme is developed but I cannot see how hiving off the ACC, the ICC or the TSB will contribute to competition in banking here.  I do not care what was the motivation of the Chairman of AIB, Mr. Jim Culliton, for his statement but his question is worth a reply.  He said:</P>
      <P>If the Government wants more competition, is it not peculiar that it is contemplating selling at least two of the three banks it owns or influences to banks who already operate here?  I feel that this would reduce rather than increase consumer choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a fair question.  That is precisely the impact it would have.  There may well be an argument, on pragmatic <Col N="205" /> rather than ideological grounds, on what contribution a substantial State bank &mdash; preferably with a link-up with some continential bank &mdash; could play in this economy, but hiving off small banks to be gobbled up by National Australia Bank or Ulster Bank would only add to the cartel.  If they are not in it they will be in it pretty soon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell's argument is wrong in one respect.  He says he is opposed to politically available credit.  I absolutely agree with that.  I am opposed to politically available credit but where Deputy McDowell is misdirected is that he is relating that to the Fóir Teoranta experience or he is making it equivalent to a rescue agency.  A State bank is not a rescue agency.  The ACC, which he rightly praised in terms of its profitability performance and its service to its customers, presents a broader base than heretofore, but it does not operate on the basis of politically available credit.  Undoubtedly Fóir Teoranta made credit available, was a milk cow and was abused.  When it was wound up we never heard how much of the debts the State inherited and were never cleared.  Fóir Teoranta was a rescue agency, a port of last resort.  It was not a bank but it may well have been and probably was abused and treated as a bank by those who had the ear of people who held power at the time and who were able to facilitate some people being treated more generously than they ought to have been by Fóir Teoranta. Perhaps a great number of them should have been told to go away.  A third banking force should not be equivalent to a rescue agency.  That is where I differ from Deputy McDowell.  If there is any question of a bank within the State competing on realistic terms with the High Street banks and if it were to get into the business of easily available credit because of political intervention that would be a disaster.  I entirely concur with that view.</P>
    <P>The position now is that most consumers have despaired of us being able to do anything to deal with oppressive measures they experience every day at <Col N="206" /> the hands of the banks.  Inordinate profits extracted from Irish consumers, often to finance imprudent ventures abroad, are working to the detriment of this economy.  For example, the notion of real competition in this economy in the banking world does not find its advocates exclusively on the left, in the ranks of the Labour Party nor with Deputy Ruairí Quinn, at least before he went into Cabinet.</P>
    <P>ISME, the organisation for small businesses, very graphically demonstrate the difficulty its members experience in getting access to credit and seed capital.  The idea should be examined on its merits, but I do not know the merit of this debate or why the Minister continues to string it out.  It is regrettable we did not reach the matter on Question Time today.  It appears the Labour Party has thrown in the towel on the uniquely Labour proposal in the Programme for Government and does not intend to make a stand on this issue. There is no indication it is fighting any rearguard action on the preservation of what was a uniquely authorised Labour proposal in the Programme for Government. It is a dead duck as there is nothing to suggest the idea is being seriously contemplated.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I believe it has merit is the intensity of the campaign the high street banks mounted on Merrion Street to prevent it happening. They perceived a great deal of their customer base getting out from under their control and taking the advantage of an alternative bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is so, but I am well advised in stating that the Minister was told none too subtly that there would be immediate and large scale redundancies in the high street banks if he pushed ahead with the idea. The possibility of an acceleration in the introduction of technology in the main <Col N="207" /> banks would lead to the redundancy of many bank employees and under no circumstances were they prepared to tolerate that.  They won the argument and convinced Merrion Street and, in turn, I presume Merrion Street convinced the Minister for Finance, but for whatever reason, the Labour Party chose the Four Courts rather than the banking system to make its stand.  It would have made more sense to the public if it had made its stand on the banking system.  It would have received a great deal of support from the clients of banks, whether personal or corporate consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell treated the debate as an Adjournment matter and his contribution ranged far and wide.  This is probably not the place to discuss some of the issues he raised.  Nevertheless, I agree with his comments about the ESB and Telecom Éireann.  It is prudent that the management, boards and unions of both those organisations should look down the road in terms of their future in the new deregulated environment and its implications for employment and so on.  Without entering into such a debate now, the Government, as in the case of the Trustee Savings Bank, is motivated, not by the direction we should be heading in respect of the telecommunications industry, but by how much money is up front from prospective bidders.  In the case of Telecom Éireann, there is a very significant offer of equity injection, £230 million to Telecom Éireann and £230 million to the Exchequer.  The evidence appears to suggest that is the type of option towards which the Government is disposed without examining the serious and complex issues for the future of the telecommunications industry here, in Europe and globally, the fantastic significance of which is borne out by the European Union's estimate that by the end of this decade no less than two-thirds of jobs will, in some sense, be related to the telecommunications industry.  That is a major strategic <Col N="208" /> decision for this economy and Government and it should not be made on considerations of whether it will make a contribution to public finances.</P>
    <P>I could sympathise with a Government taking that view if the public finances were in the state of disrepair they were in a few years ago, but that is no longer the case.  Major strategic decisions should not be made on the basis of an unexpected windfall to the Exchequer.  Similarly, in the area of banking, it is neither here nor there whether we receive £100 million or £120 million for the Trustee Savings Bank. That is not the issue about which the economy is concerned.  It is concerned with value for money, whether the customer base of the banks gets value for money and if small or large businesses get reasonable access to capital.  Despite all the schemes and announcements from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment about, say, another £100 million being made available for small businesses, as a member of a county enterprise board, I continue to receive dozens of applications from people who see such funding as a cash injection because they cannot raise the cash anywhere else.  The last thing banks would consider is taking on that type of risk. In many cases they may be correct, but there is no point in talking about an enterprising economy if we permit a cosy cartel arrangement whereby the banks' dominance of our possibilities for economic expansion goes unchallenged.</P>
    <P>That is the significance of this debate and it is regrettable it has not taken off. Deputy McDowell raised many interesting questions, but not one Labour Deputy, not to mention a Minister, came into the House to take up some of the points he raised.  The Tinakilly retreat and the lip service promulgated from it left us none the wiser.  The Taoiseach, wittingly or otherwise, is a master of the type of statement that is so ambivalent that one does not know what he means.  He told the political editor of RTE, after the two-step at Tinakilly, that the third banking force is <Col N="209" /> alive and well and that we will see it all in due course.  By a third force he means one dictated by the associated banks mediated through Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil knows well what it means by a third force.  It is not what the authors of the programme on the Labour side meant, but none of its members is prepared to come in here and say where they stand on the issue.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and, as requested by the Minister, it is appropriate that we should take all Stages today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Members were wide-ranging in their contributions, I will refer to the Bill as well as to other related financial matters.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to the multiplicity of bank charges.  Some years ago there was no such thing as bank charges, but nowadays new charges are introduced frequently and consumers and small businesses have quite properly cried halt.</P>
      <P>Members on all sides of the House have highlighted bank charges.  I read only yesterday Deputy Michael McDowell's comments on what is best described as a penalty charge in relation to bounced cheques.  This is not a new charge but one that has been imposed for many years on those unfortunate enough to be recipients of such cheques, in addition to the drawers of those cheques who will have their credit facility either abolished or curtailed.  It has been correctly highlighted in the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the banks produced a glossy brochure which was circulated to Members of this House, endeavouring to explain in laymen's terms the necessity for imposing bank charges.  It detailed the cost of the money transmission system and estimated that the cost to the clearing banks amounted to £264 million annually, with a recoupment from their various customers of some 34 per cent or the equivalent of £90 million.  Yesterday Mr. Felix O'Regan, public relations officer of the Irish banks' information service, indicated that the cost of the money transmission <Col N="210" /> system was £240 million with recoupment of £96 million.  He claimed that the banks derived no profit from the penalty charges to which Deputy Michael McDowell and others had referred, but rather that it cost them a substantial amount merely to operate that system. That is a clear endeavour to fudge the facts.  I have calculated that over a period of 15 months the banks have increased their yield from such bank charges to the extent of an extra £30 million, representing an increase of one third in charges over that period, figures which I extrapolated from the banks' information service.  I can only rely on the information furnished by their spokesman and I do not doubt those figures. We saw recently the new £20 charge imposed by the Bank of Ireland following on that imposed already by Allied Irish Banks.  If that extra £30 million does not improve the profitability of the clearing banks, I do not understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;profit&rdquo;.  Perhaps the banks have a different interpretation from that of Members of this House and consumers. They are imposing substantial additional charges on individuals and on small and medium-size businesses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate on the Consumer Credit Bill whose provisions will render it obligatory for the Director of Consumer Affairs to have an input in regulating such charges.  It came as a surprise to all of us that such control was already provided for under section 28 of the Central Bank Act.  Unfortunately, the Central Bank never has restrained a bank from imposing an increased charge.  It is important to emphasise the amount of money about which we are speaking, which constitutes an additional burden on businesses. If the banks continue to impose such accelerated charges in order to yield an extra £30 million within a period of 15 months, it is only right and proper that the Government should take action.  I look forward to the implementation of the Consumer Credit Bill. The banks would not appear to have <Col N="211" /> been concerned at the recent public outrage over the imposition of charges.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I commend the role played by ACC and ICC in their respective fields since establishment. Where would our agricultural or small industries be today were it not for ACC and ICC?  I should like to see their role guaranteed within any new banking framework, whether it be a third banking force or a State bank.  One need only look to the history of the ACC since its establishment in 1927 to recognise its profitability and growth rates which have developed in tandem with agriculture. I am pleased to note that its growth rate since the 1970s &mdash; it had been very slow until then &mdash; has accelerated, in keeping with substantial developments in the agri-industry here.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that some two years ago ACC was allowed to expand its activities beyond purely agriculturally-based lending to non-farming activities.  It has done so very successfully, providing additional competition to the established banking network.  The Minister has said he should like all Stages of this Bill to be passed this evening.  It is important that no delay should curtail the deposit-taking base of the ACC.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about a third banking force.  I listened carefully to Deputies McDowell and Rabbitte. Clearly, different people are talking about different things.  There are many different banks wishing to enter the fray, with substantial figures being mentioned. For example, there has been talk of a State bank, an amalgamation of ACC, ICC and the Trustee Savings Bank, or a third banking force.  If the Trustee Savings Bank is purchased by National Australia or the Ulster Bank &mdash;while I am very much in favour of private enterprise &mdash; I do not think that will lead to the break-up of the cartel, that cosy arrangement between the two main banking groups which control 80 per cent of our overall banking activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> Despite any pious aspirations or business plans on the part of National Australia or Ulster Bank, or their commitment to expanding their branch network and so on, the fact is that ACC and ICC, despite having been curtailed in many different ways, have succeeded in playing a vital developmental role which the main clearing banks failed abysmally to do over many years.  Only recently, with increased competition and the opening up of various financial services, have we seen banks such as the Ulster Bank provide special loans at very competitive rates.  That was a response to Government action, particularly the £100 million loan now being administered by ICC.  That loan has been an important catalyst, reflecting the huge differential in the cost of credit. There is a huge difference between the yield one can obtain from one's money on deposit and the cost of borrowing money.  The Government subsidy of approximately 3 per cent, giving companies guaranteed loan capital at a rate of 6.75 per cent for a period of ten years, is welcome.  Its take-up has been most rewarding, to the extent that that fund will be exhausted by the end of this year.  I welcome the proposal that that fund be replaced by a joint European Union-Irish package, amounting to approximately £200 million.  This meets the need identified by the Task Force on Small Business, by IBEC and many others who have highlighted the lack of outlets providing seed capital for investment and expansion.  The main banks have demanded collateral even to the extent of the family home.</P>
    <P>The ICC and the ACC have played a vital role and I would like that to be guaranteed.  I would not like the TSB to be purchased by National Australia Bank or the Ulster Bank with the ICC being thrown in as part of a sweetheart deal.  The ICC has built up an expertise in a particular field.  It knows its customers who, in the main, would have been granted a first loan and returned for more when their businesses expanded.  The corporate industrial sector who sought financial assistance from <Col N="213" /> the ICC in the past are concerned that it might be absorbed into a third banking force in the private sector.  To date the ICC has loaned approximately £800 million to small and medium sized businesses. Although, like the ACC, it has reported small profits in the region of £10 million, it has a role in the future of the banking forces here to ensure an alternative banking force into which the State can play at times to exert leverage on the private banking sector.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Brennan, who has responsibility for small and medium sized businesses for the report presented from the small business task force.  While multinationals and large companies have played an important role in employing thousands of people, the small business sector is now properly identified as one which has a major role in future development and to ensure that unemployment rates are stabilised.  We have in excess of 100,000 small businesses and if each was in a position to recruit an additional employee it would dramatically affect unemployment rates.  That sector identified many problems which prevent it doing that although many people have taken risks with their capital to expand their businesses without State aid.  Even though the small business task force was set up only one year ago it has been successful. It has made approximately 100 recommendations some of which were included in the budget.  Now that we are nearing the time to frame the next budget I would like financial recognition and legislative effect in the next Finance Act to be given to one of the most important recommendations in that report namely, a reduction in corporation profit tax.</P>
    <P>Many people who wish to set up businesses are prohibited by the risk element involved.  Approximately one in four or five small businesses fail in the first few years.  The security requirements of lending institutions, particularly in respect of title deeds to private houses and other resources force people <Col N="214" /> to set up business by forming limited liability companies.  Small businesses, such as filling stations, restaurants, small manufacturing concerns and so on would report at best extremely small profits of £10,000 to £40,000 per annum if they succeeded in the first few years. If they had operated as private individuals they would have been taxed at a rate of 27 per cent up to the first £16,400 earned after allowances.  However, as they are obliged to form limited liability companies they are taxed at the rate of 40 per cent corporation profits tax.  The report of the small business task force recommends that the first £80,000 profit earned by companies with a turnover of up to £3 million should be taxed on a tiered basis and the first £80,000 should be taxed at 25 per cent.  That would represent a tax reduction to 25 per cent in respect of limited liability companies which would allow companies to plough back an additional 15 per cent profit into their businesses and if such profits were extracted by dividends they would be taxed in the normal way.  Officials in the Department of Finance estimate that measure would cost the Exchequer £27 million, not a large amount considering the impact it would have on the economy.  People running small businesses do not take three to four weeks foreign holidays, they work hard to build up their businesses to hand on to the next generation.  The cost to the Exchequer would be retained in small businesses to allow further expansion which would increase the potential to extract revenue in the future.  This imaginative measure would be extremely well received.  I know it is strongly supported by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Brennan and I sincerely hope it does not fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>Last year people in the motor vehicle industry campaigned strongly for a reduction of tax on cars because of the depression in that industry.  The Minister responded to a certain extent and with tax buoyancy there will be a substantial take on tax revenue this year.  If <Col N="215" /> the Minister reduced corporation profits tax to 25 per cent, equivalent to the rate in England, and incorporated into the budget the recommendations on small businesses it would establish an enterprise culture on a sounder basis. Much lip service has been paid to the enterprise culture, but unless practical measures are implemented to encourage people to take risks, how will we reduce unemployment without substantial State intervention?</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister for Finance for the additional funding for county enterprise boards.  Each board received funding of £0.5 million this year, but that did not take account of the geographical size of counties or population densities.  County enterprise boards in counties Mayo, Galway and Kerry, exhausted their budgets by mid-year and projects awaiting grant approval were delayed.  In my county projects with a potential to generate 50 jobs were delayed.  I am pleased that has been rectified in the past two to three weeks in that county enterprise boards are being monitored and grant approvals are issuing on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to raise matters not directly related to the Bill.</P>

We moved from county enterprise boards to other matters, but it was great stuff.  I am sure you will not discriminate against any other <Col N="216" /> speaker who might also wander off the mark.  This is a very narrow Bill and I propose to confine myself to relevant areas.  Speaking as one who is more often in the red than in the black, I will deal to some extent with bank charges. I was interested to read remarks in the October-November 1994 issue of the Irish League of Credit Unions Review of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, attacking bankers.  I do not know if it is Government policy, but Minister Higgins attacked the banks saying that on an individual level they use crises in people's lives as an opportunity to make profit and, on an international level, keep the southern part of the world mired in poverty.  He went on to say that we live in the shadow of each other.  It appears that the predictions regarding the third banking force outlined by the Labour Party in the Programme for Government are coming true.  The wagons are surrounded and the old war horse, Fianna Fáil, is assuming command in its own inimitable way.  The Minister went on to say that credit is not neutral, that our banking systems will have to accept that and see it as an investment within a wider set of obligations; that if such a conversion does not happen it must be made to happen.</P>

      <P>The big stick is out again.  I am not sure if this interpretation of Labour Party policy is really Government policy or how deep is the commitment to a third banking force in the Programme for Government.  It appears that, two years on, the matter has not been resolved.  The Labour Party absconded from the House during a debate on a matter of extreme importance to it.  There is a need for clarification from Government about whether we are to have a third banking force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to bank charges.  In the late 1970s banks were in a position to throw money around right, left and centre, mainly to agricultural people, for the purchase of <Col N="217" /> land that was then valued at £3,000 an acre.  Many farmers purchased land at exorbitant prices, borrowing extremely heavily and found themselves in a very short time, because of inflation and high interest rates, unable to stock the enterprises for which they had paid dearly.  Many had to sell their properties and move on to other enterprises.  It has come to the stage where banks take the money before you get it.  In the 1970s people did not have to pay to meet the bank manager but now his time is charged at a very expensive rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we should and we might not receive the amount of public odium that we do.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates said that there should be three simple objectives in selling any of the banks.  The first is to increase competition in the banking sector to reduce charges and lending rates.  As public representatives we are in contact with people, particularly graduates and young people interested in manufacturing. Many have invented material and equipment which is of value to industry. However, the cost of setting up their enterprises with funding from the banks is exorbitant.  If we do not do something about their initiative, their commitment and motivation, the country will lose heavily.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates also said that the sale of a bank should obtain the maximum return for the taxpayer and that that should go towards debt reduction.  He went on to say that the best possible development plan should be put in place for the future investment strategy of each bank to protect and enhance the prospects of those directly employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am not in full possession of all the facts, as I have not been told what Government policy is in respect of a third banking force, and as the Labour Party has not backed off from its original commitment in this regard, I assume that the ACC in particular has, for a very good reason, resisted all attempts to become part of a third <Col N="218" /> banking force.  The ACC, founded in 1927, went through a lean period but is now in its seventh successive year of profitability.  In the west, from Donegal to west Cork, it attracts approximately 215 new customers each month.  Many of these are in agriculture but are taking out home loans.  This level of new loan custom creates keen competition in all sectors of the economy as in the past it did in the farming sector and that is to be commended.</P>
    <P>However, it is obvious that ACC, like other banks, is in need of strengthening and in that context has established close links with a number of potential European partners who are prepared to invest additional capital in ACC.  If the Government decides against a European partner it will be necessary for it to put in the required capital.  Indeed, it would be disastrous if some other Irish bank succeeded in taking over ACC. There would be less competition and substantial job losses.  While the ACC would like to accommodate the Government, rather than be in conflict with it, a sale to another Irish bank will be strenuously opposed by it.  The ACC feels that the European connection, coupled with the link to farmers, the FBD and so on, would be a positive development and increase competition. It would be a logical step for at least one State-sponsored company that has expanded successfully and rapidly in the past five years, when other semi-State companies nose-dived.</P>
    <P>The reasons ACC would resist any merger include the fact that merger of the ACC and ICC would put at least 200 of the 800 jobs in both organisations on the line, very few of these jobs losses would be achievable on a voluntary basis as both organisations have already had voluntary schemes of redundancy. If the TSB merged with ACC and ICC up to 700 jobs would be lost.  It would be impossible to quantify the redundancies that could arise on the subsequent involvement, if any, of An Post, since its role in the Government's plan is unclear even at this stage.  If rationalisation were not to occur, therefore, the <Col N="219" /> Government would be faced with a merged bank which would be overmanned and would not be cost efficient, a bank which is not cost efficient would find it difficult to compete in the banking market and achieve the Government's objective of becoming a third banking force.  Also, the only sustainable economic argument for a merger is the reduction in overheads that, in theory, rationalisation would bring.  If a merger of ACC, ICC and TSB were to go ahead that would create an entity with £3 billion in assets which is still only half the size of the Ulster Bank which is currently the third largest bank in the country.  A merger of the ACC and ICC would create an entity with assets of £2 billion, even less of a force in overall banking terms.</P>
    <P>The TSB made it perfectly clear in public statements that it does not wish to become involved in the State bank as proposed in the Programme for Government.  It is also clear there could be legal problems in attempting to include TSB in such a plan.  Capital in the order of £170 million would be required to develop any such merged entity.  The State, being the sole shareholder, would have to address this need. Without access to sufficient capital the merged bank would not be able to develop at the pace or to the extent necessary in order to compete effectively in the Irish banking market.  In the current difficult economic conditions there is no prospect of the State providing this capital.  It would be difficult for the merged bank to attract the interest of an international partner which could supply capital until the rationalisation process is satisfactorily completed and until it has demonstrated its ability to perform on a sustained basis &mdash; this would be unlikely to be achieved within five years.</P>
    <P>The ACC Bank and the ICC Bank are two diverse institutions.  There would be difficulty about the strategic direction of any such merged bank.  The focus would be on resolving internal issues to the detriment of developing <Col N="220" /> the business, which would be of benefit only to the competitors of such a bank. The ACC Bank believes that the State banking sector can be developed effectively if the State agrees to a joint venture between a major European co-operative bank and ACC Bank.  It believes that is the most constructive way to secure the involvement of an international bank.  The ACC Bank is satisfied that a joint venture partnership between ACC Bank and a European co-operative bank could be brought about within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>The benefits that would result from such a move would be that the involvement of an international partner which does not have a base in Ireland would mean there would be no overlap in current activities and therefore job losses through rationalisation would not be required.  During the last five years the number of staff employed in ACC Bank increased by 60, from 400 to 460.  The continued development of ACC Bank would create more jobs and a greater opportunity for job enhancement.  A joint venture with an international bank would provide capital to the Exchequer which could be used to finance job creation in Ireland.  It would also facilitate that bank in establishing a presence in the International Financial Services Centre, which would create further jobs.</P>
    <P>Between 1988 and 1992 the ACC Bank transformed itself from a single sector credit institution to a profitable, broadly-based commercial retail bank. The fact that 250 new customers per month are being attracted by ACC Bank in an area such as the west is proof that its business is spreading and it is commercially attractive.  If this trend continues ACC Bank will need access to further capital to continue its progress.  An international partner such as that mooted by the ACC would be of great benefit to it.</P>
    <P>A co-operative bank is owned by its customers.  While it is fully commercial, it does not have a socially responsible approach to business.  Ireland is one of the few European countries that does not have a co-operative bank.  The <Col N="221" /> ACC's customers would benefit from the introduction of a co-operative bank because the focus on customer service and the concerns with the banking needs of farmers, small businesses and individuals would be met.  In a joint venture such as that proposed, the State would remain in control.  In line with the Government's objective to increase its role in banking, a joint venture would provide the State with a much more meaningful presence in banking in general.</P>
    <P>It is time we were given a clear direction by the Government as to what is proposed in terms of a third banking force.  If the Labour Party element of this policy is to be disregarded, if this section of the Programme for Government is to be dropped, we should be told so.  Since ACC Bank is expanding at a rapid rate it should be given a clear direction as to whether it will be allowed form a joint venture with a European based partner, as is its wish.</P>
    <P>This is a short technical Bill and we have no difficulty with it.  It is necessary that ACC be allowed increase its borrowing limit requirements.  I commend the bank, its staff and its members for its efficiency and the professional way in which it goes about its business.  It has a proven record over seven successive years with profitable results.</P>
    <P>Bank charges are exorbitant and are grossly unfair.  Changes in technology and the introduction of banking cards have resulted in many people getting deeper into debt.  I have witnessed people hurriedly leaving hostelries in Merrion Row when they run out of money, to withdraw funds from the nearest &ldquo;hole in the wall&rdquo;.  These facilities are almost too convenient.  This enticement to the consumer, together with the take-now-and-pay-later concept and the fact that money is at one's disposal 24 hours a day, has unfortunately driven many people much further into the red than they would otherwise be.  The level of bank charges and activities for which banks charge are to be deplored.  In that context the greater the <Col N="222" /> range of options open to people the better. Given the extent of the overall profitability of banks in recent years, particularly the two main banks, they could reduce charges.</P>
    <P>We recommended that the Government outline clearly and concisely the position regarding a third banking force. I believe that, sadly, the Fianna Fáil element of the Cabinet will again rule over this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I join previous speakers in welcoming this technical but important legislation which increases the borrowing limit of the ACC Bank from £1 billion to £1,400 million.  In this legislation we are talking about the capacity of the ACC Bank to welcome deposits as part of its overall borrowing limit.  It is interesting that ACC Bank's borrowing amounted to £882 million at end 1993.  Business has grown significantly in the current year and it is vitally important that we increase the ceiling.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Kenny who spoke about the importance of the ACC.  It is a pity Fine Gael, when last in Government, did not believe it was important.  When we came into Government in 1987 ACC was suffering very heavy losses.  We had to take remedial action; legislation was introduced in 1988 by Mr. Ray MacSharry to address the problem by granting the corporation the power to widen its operations in accordance with modern banking practice.  This proved successful and, as has been said, the ACC is now heading for the seventh successive year of profitability.  Further measures were taken in the 1992 legislation to allow the bank to expand further under the supervision of the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a success story of which we, as legislators, should be proud.  The bank was established as part of the State sector in 1927 to provide finance for the agriculture sector.  As the Minister said, it did not take off until the 1960s and 1970s.  If I have a criticism it is that the horticultural sector has not benefited from the efforts of the ACC in recent years.  I appeal to the Minister, in the <Col N="223" /> context of this Bill the purpose of which is to increase the financial limit to £1,400 million and of the structural changes that will take place involving the ACC, the ICC and the TSB, to emphasise the role of the horticultural sector to the board of the ACC.  Given the scope for job creation and the good year it has had, the ACC should be asked to look at this sector again and give a long term commitment.  In this way it would meet the needs of the sector effectively.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in the context of his budget proposals, to bear the needs of the horticultural sector in mind given that it is specifically excluded from many of the schemes which have been introduced for the benefit of the agriculture industry.  I ask the Minister to consider expanding the BES and other schemes to include the horticultural sector.</P>
    <P>Colleagues on all sides of the House have referred to the exorbitant bank charges imposed not just on the agriculture sector but on small and medium enterprises.  These charges have become a feature of business in this country. The banks in Pontius Pilate like fashion have washed their hands of the issue and argue that they are only covering their overheads.  If a tourist or someone going to the United Kingdom on business wants to buy sterling they can do so at the Bank of Ireland branch at the airport where they will not be charged the going rate on the money market but an exorbitant rate.  In addition they will have to pay a fee for the pleasure of doing business with the bank.  As a consequence business travellers and tourists are being hammered.  This matter should be addressed and examined with a view to introducing some controls.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael Members mentioned that, regardless of what structural changes are made, there should be three objectives: that we should seek to maximise competition to reduce charges, to maximise the return for the taxpayer from the sale of any State assets and look <Col N="224" /> after the interests of staff.  I have no difficulty with any of these objectives but surely the most important question is what do we want from the banking system and what needs have to be met within the economy, be it a lack of money or facilities for the agriculture industry or small and medium enterprises.  The sole purpose should not be to maximise competition; we need to put in place structures to meet the needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to have an ideological hang-up about a third banking force but that is not the way we should be thinking.  The question we need to ask ourselves is what does the economy require and how can we use State assets such as the ACC, the ICC and the TSB to meet those needs as we approach the end of the 1990s and the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the sister operation of the ACC, the ICC which was established in 1933.  It has targeted its efforts at small and medium sized enterprises.  It is only in recent times that the commercial banks have shown an interest in this sector.  The ICC has had a long term commitment to it since 1933.  This is not the only economy in which a particular bank meets the needs of a niche market; the same applies in the case of the strongest economies in Europe: Germany, France and Holland.</P>
    <P>In an excellent aricle in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> of 16 October, 1994 Kathleen Barrington and Mark O'Connell reported that a Dutch bank had expressed interest in buying the Industrial Credit Corporation and that the State owned De Nationale Investerings Bank's interest had been welcomed by the board of the ICC.  I note with interest that the Government will not stand in the way of any deal.  The Government is wise in thinking that there is not only one solution, a third banking force.  I also note that the Stokes Kennedy Crowley report has been made available to the Minister and I am confident that in considering this report he will recognise the need to <Col N="225" /> obtain the maximum return for the taxpayer from the sale of any State assets but it is more important that whatever structure is put in place meets the needs of the economy.  It is important to realise that the agricultural sector of our economy is no longer concerned only with production but with agri-tourism, and the development of the co-operative sector and spin off industries that supply it.  Those needs are being met by ACC. The ICC matches its sectoral commitment. Whatever decision the Government makes, it should not be based on ideology but on practical solutions that recognise the problems and opportunities in our economy.  The needs and opportunities in our economy must be taken into account in the decision on the future structure.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence that the Minister for Finance recognises this and I wish him well in the decision he has to make.  If the outcome is to be three banks, four groups or a stronger TSB linked to another body, the decision must be made in the national interest and not on ideological grounds.</P>

      <P>I join Members from all sides of the House in welcoming this Bill.  The ACC, as banks go, has given a good service to consumers in the agricultural sector for which it was set up initially and latterly to the business and private sectors.  I think the more the ACC engages in general banking the better all round.  More competition in the banking sector will ensure a better service for consumers.  It was good to see in a survey of lending services that ACC offered the cheapest and most competitive service.  It is to be commended for that.  This is the line we would like them to pursue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the founding principles of this Government and a kernel of Labour Party policy is the culture of transparency and accountability.  This was to apply not only across politics but to all aspects of Irish life.  Lack of transparency seems to be the essence of the <Col N="226" /> banking ethos and there is no transparency in banking.  There is no independent test of whether what the banks are saying is true, as nobody really knows.  The banks refuse to tell what they pay for the funds they raise on the domestic market.  The banks resist the attacks made on various occasions by business organisations or politicians in the safe and sure knowledge that nobody can penetrate their operations. Consequently, the banks can get away with making general assertions about high administrative costs and offer other excuses and guises which are extremely hard to refute.</P>
    <P>Last May the Taoiseach attacked the banks for squeezing the productive sector of the economy by charging over high interest rates thus costing the economy jobs.  The common perception was that the Taoiseach was right and people braced themselves in the expectation that action would follow but there has been none.  Similarly, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, publicly upbraided the Bank of Ireland, in particular, for imposing a special charge on current account holders a number of weeks ago and again there was an understandable expectation that something would happen.  However, the only thing that happened is that a great deal of favourable publicity was generated, the banks continue merrily with their practice of accumulating massive profits in the expectation that this year's returns will reach new record levels.  It is fine for the Taoiseach and for various Ministers to publicly scold the banks from time to time.  It makes a good soundbite but it achieves nothing.  It is a mere slap on the wrist and to a giant such as the banks, that means nothing and has no effect.</P>
    <P>Nobody denies the right of commercial enterprises to make a profit.  That is the <i>modus operandi</i> in the commercial cut and thrust of the marketplace. Nobody objects to profits but one has to look at the level of profits made by the Irish banking sector in the context of the profits of other banks particularly <Col N="227" /> those in the United Kingdom.  The profits of Allied Irish Banks of over IR£300 million and IR£290 million by the Bank of Ireland in 1993 are excessive by any standards.  The Bank of Ireland, for example, earns four times as much on its shareholders' funds as the UK's bank with the cheapest rates, Barclays; Allied Irish Banks earns twice as much on assets as NatWest, Britain's second largest bank.  Last year, Ireland's two largest banks had an average margin of approximately 4.3 per cent between what they charged borrowers and what is paid to depositors.  In the much larger economy of the United Kingdom the margins are 3 per cent and in the mega scale of the United States economy the margins are 4 per cent.  In our small economy 4 per cent has been the norm.</P>
    <P>There is no transparency in banking and this Government has failed to do anything to bring it about.  For that the Labour Party stands condemned.  The banks do not publish a detailed breakdown of performance figures for the domestic market operation.  Again because of its labyrinth of products on the lending and deposit fronts, it has become almost impossible to establish the banks' exact interest rate spread or the difference between what it earns on loans and what it pays out to depositors. The banks have consistently argued that they lose money on loans to small and medium sized businesses in spite of charging them up to 4 per cent more than the rates charged to larger businesses. When challenged, the banks have never revealed the figures to substantiate those claims, they continue to argue that they lose money on transmission systems which include cash movement and cheque clearance but again no figures have been advanced to substantiate or defend such claims.  The banks say they lose money on personal borrowings because of administrative costs and bad debts, yet, again, no figures are produced to substantiate it.</P>
    <P>The figures banks produce grab the headlines and show that their operations, particularly the two main banks, <Col N="228" /> engender excessive profits, down to the humble profits of the National Investment Bank of £7.8 million.  As long as people such as the Taoiseach and various Ministers decide to indulge themselves in periodic bank bashing but do nothing further, the banks will continue on their merry way.  I see absolutely no evidence that the banks have a scintilla of a social conscience.  My perception of the banks is that of a ruthless sector which gives out an umbrella on a fine day but takes it away on a wet day.  They make huge profits and yet introduce a job shedding and low paid grade policy, economic giants which indulge in high profile sponsorship and low level or minimal investment in the real resources of this country, its young people, in particular.  I see little risk taking and little evidence that they will make genuine concessions to small businesses. Indeed, all the evidence indicates that the small business sector is correct when it claims that the main banks will not provide loans without security including personal guarantees that the interest costs of funds is far too high for small businesses, that bank charges are too high, that working capital on overdrafts is too expensive and that such facilities can be withdrawn on demand.</P>
    <P>The issue of dormant bank accounts might be described as peripheral but the banks continue this indefensible practice. I was approached some time ago by an individual who had been told by a bank official in the west of Ireland that his late father had lodged money in a deposit account in the bank 14 years previously.  Nobody in the family was aware of the existence of this account which had generated £8,000 profit when it was finally claimed by the next of kin. That money would never have been claimed by the next of kin had it not been for the good grace of the official in question.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister in this House on several occasions to investigate the dormant accounts of the ACC, the AIB, the Bank of Ireland, the Ulster Bank, the National Irish Bank, the <Col N="229" /> building societies and all of the lending institutions.  There are millions of pounds in unclaimed accounts about which the next of kin of deceased persons have no knowledge.  This money stashed away at some stage is technically the money of private individuals but, in reality, is in the possession of the banks.</P>
    <P>These moneys remain in the banks' possession for several reasons; the depositors have died, they have been forgotten about by the individuals concerned, the depositing organisations which lodged the money have gone out of existence or for some other reason. The banks should not have possession of this money and they have had use of it for far too long.  The Minister should ensure that the banks publish on a regular basis the amounts in these dormant accounts and that this money is brought back into the public sector as soon as possible.  The Minister has the power to do this and in doing so he will release millions of pounds that have been lying dormant in bank accounts and which have been at the disposal of the banks. The money should be repatriated to the individuals who lodged it or to society.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I want to see the development of the ACC but I also want to see many of the charges which were laid by the Minister, by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke and by the Taoiseach last May bear some fruit in better policing of our banks.</P>

      <P>There has been general agreement in the House today on the Bill before us.  Those of us who are familiar with the activities of the ACC will realise that lack of capital has prevented it from expanding.  The ACC has been very successful, particularly in the past <Col N="230" /> few years, and has provided a worthwhile service to the agricultural community and, more recently, to the private and commercial sector.  This Bill will help to increase the potential of the ACC and present it with a brighter future.</P>
      <P>The ACC was set up originally to provide a service to the agricultural community. Perhaps it did not work as efficiently as it should but it provided a very necessary service.  Its remit has been widened in the past few years and there is a greater demand from outside sources.  For that reason, the borrowing limit must be increased and that is why the Bill is before us today.</P>
      <P>We tend to forget the urban-rural divide. On occasions the contributions of some Deputies in this House help to widen that divide.  We have often listened here to hostile criticism of the decent, hard working individuals of the farming community.  They are, however, a very vulnerable group whose harvest is determined by influences over which they have no control.  The weather determines what work will be done on a given day.  Indeed, the fine weather of the past fortnight has helped to secure the harvest for many people.</P>
      <P>There is much publicity when farms are sold.  A fair sized farm may be sold for approximately £2,000 per acre but the reality is that in most cases young people inherit farms and want to carry on the business and selling the farm is the last option.  They want to make the farm viable and the whole family is generally involved in that.</P>
      <P>Outside of the farming community there is very little sympathy for farmers and that can be attributed to ignorance as people do not understand the great financial pressures on farmers.  Farming is a great way of life for those who can afford it.  Unfortunately, many farmers today are experiencing major financial problems and this can result in a sense of isolation and loneliness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure we are all familiar with agriculture related suicides.  There are no <Col N="231" /> figures available in Ireland for the number of suicides committed in the agricultural community but a recent British report on suicides among professionals indicates that farmers are in the top five professions at risk.  I have no reason to believe that things are different in Ireland.  In conjunction with the main farming bodies, the ACC and other financial institutions should seriously consider setting up a scheme to provide medical and social care for those at risk of suicide.  The financial institutions and the farming organisations can play a major part in reducing the number of suicides in the agricultural community. It is necessary also to establish a suicide prevention programme which providing support for the bereaved after a person has died in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the financial institutions to concern themselves solely with the collection of debts.  The agricultural community has made a major contribution to the growth and development of our financial institutions and their social responsibility must now be shown.  I thank the ACC staff for their work over the years.  They are going through a difficult time but I have no doubt that what the Minister did today will ensure a bright future for ACC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time and congratulate the Minister in bringing in this Bill which increases the borrowing limit of ACC to £1,400 million.  The Minister said it is vital that this be done as it would be a serious matter if the bank were forced to curtail its deposit-taking activity.</P>
      <P>ACC has done great work, particularly for smallholders in the west.  It has given a lead on the agricultural front which the Minister has recognised and it is competitive.  I do not disagree with the criticism of bank charges but all the surveys show ACC has the lowest charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1987 ACC has made consistent profits.  It is the first bank that the farming community look to when they wish to borrow money.  Deputy Hughes <Col N="232" /> referred to an article by Mr. Felix O'Regan in which he defended bank charges and outlined bank services.  He referred in passing to ACC.  I do not agree with some of the point he made, particularly regarding the need to have extra bank charges because cash handling services lead to so much paper work.  He made the point that customers were charged according to their transactions.  He stated that on average 43 per cent of personal customers of the main banks do not pay bank charges.  That is all very well but new services are introduced which customers must pay.  Deputy Kenny stated that as more ATMs are introduced the banking system is made too convenient.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Regan said the average amount of bank charges at £70 per year compared favourably with telephone line rental which is £120 a year.  That is not a fair comparison because the line rental charge is fixed but the bank charge will increase as new services are introduced.</P>
    <P>ACC acknowledges its responsibility to rural Ireland.  I read with interest an article by Mr. Matthew Barrett in <i>The Irish Banking Review</i> outlining how the Bank of Montreal helps the community in which he lives.  I visited a number of schools where the first bank to sponsor furnishings was ACC.  That is not to say that other banks do not fulfil a social role.  I was at a tidy towns celebration in Mountbelew last Sunday where the Bank of Ireland sponsored awards for the tidiest business premises and estates.</P>
    <P>ACC has helped small businesses tremendously.  Small businesses are creating jobs, as can be seen from the country enterprise boards.  Since the board was set up in Galway 85 new projects have been approved and £600,000 provided by way of grant.  Whenever there is a recession or economic difficulties small businesses are badly hit and they need support.  I hope ACC and the other banks will help such enterprises.  Mr. Barrett in his article outlined the role they should play.</P>
    <P>I wish ACC well and pay tribute to <Col N="233" /> the staff in Tuam and Ballinasloe.  Its office in Galway city is inundated by requests from farmers.  ACC also plays a major role in the business life of Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for sharing their time with me.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the Bill and welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution.  This is a simple technical Bill the purpose of which is to increase the borrowing limit on ACC Bank plc from £1,000 million to £1,400 million.  The borrowing carried out by ACC Bank is mainly the taking of deposits.  It also includes interbank borrowings, issues of bonds and subordinated debt.</P>
      <P>The increased deposits will not be State guaranteed as the State guarantee limit is being left at £800 million.  ACC Bank is already successfully taking deposits without State guarantee.  In addition to deposits from customers it will be able, if it so wishes, to use the increased borrowing limit to increase its short term interlink borrowing or, with Central Bank agreement, its level of bond and subordinated debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ACC was formed in 1927 under the Agricultural Credit Act.  It was established as the Agricultural Credit Corporation to provide a specialist credit service to agriculture by way of medium and long term loans to farmers and farming co-operatives.  The corporation offers a variety of loan facilities, mainly general purpose loans at fixed interest rates for terms of between five and ten years.  By 1937 it had lent a total of £1.6 million, with annual lending at a rate of £250,000 per annum.  It was funded at this stage by equity contributions from State and mortgage bonds.  For many years the volume of business remained small, reflecting the economic environment for agriculture, farmers' reluctance to borrow and the lack of attractive capital intensive options in the agricultural sector.  By 1961 total assets had reached £3.7 million and annual lending was a mere £0.8 million.  ACC's expansion began in the late 1960s when <Col N="234" /> it started to promote itslf as a lending agency.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Act, 1961 increased the authorised share capital of the corporation, raised its borrowing limit, simplified its procedure for taking land as security for loans and allowed it to engage in hire purchase lending.  The Agricultural Credit Act, 1965 enabled ACC to take deposits from the public, thereby providing the grounds for the subsequent increase in its resources.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to bank charges which have reached an all time high.  I accept it is not appropriate to discuss them in connection with this Bill. However, the time is opportune to face up to this problem and I appeal to the Minister to consider the position from the point of view of the customer.</P>
    <P>A dramatic expansion took place in ACC business in the 1970s.  There was a tremendous demand for credit as farmers took advantage of the opportunities afforded by EC membership.  By 1978 annual lending stood at £132 million. However, despite this growth in business the bank reported losses from 1974 on because of exchange rate losses on foreign funding.  The Agricultural Credit Act, 1978, doubled the ACC share capital to £20 million.  The difficulties which arose in the 1980s as a result of the general economic problems and the restrictions on the Common Agricultural Policy led to a decline in confidence in the agricultural sector.  This had an adverse effect on the ACC and new lending business fell from £132 million in 1978 to £85 million in 1983. This business picked up during the intervening years and, aided by the increase in business with the corporate food sector, amounted to £162 million in 1986.  The ACC also had to contend with defaulting borrowers and difficulties in attracting new borrowers.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the level of ACC profits disimproved considerably, resulting in a heavy loss of £14.8 million in 1987.</P>
    <P>Since that time the ACC has continually improved its position, recording an increasing level of profits each year and <Col N="235" /> paying dividends from 1991.  While retaining its involvement in the agricultural sector, the bank has expanded into other areas of retail banking.  It is worth noting that during the financial year ending December 1993 it recorded a profit of £6.832 million after tax, achieved a return on shareholders' funds of 15.39 per cent and had gross assets of £932 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the increase in the statutory borrowing limit of ACC Bank is necessary as otherwise the bank could not increase its deposit rates and would add to its other forms of borrowing. He went on to say that this impasse would obviously be unacceptable as it would amount to the imposition of an unnecessary restriction on the bank's operations.  I agree with Deputy Jim Higgins.  It is imperative that an investigation be carried out forthwith into dormant accounts in banks, with a view to bringing them to the notice of the next-of-kin.  I appeal to the Minister to take this point on board.</P>
    <P>Over the years the ACC has given much encouragement to farmers by providing essential finance.  Many farmers owe a debt of gratitude to this bank but, unfortunately, many fell by the wayside, so to speak, over the years as a result of bad advice from many sources, not just the ACC.  However, the ACC has been good to agriculture and I hope this will continue.  The Bill deals with the needs of the ACC, and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. However, the Minister has not gone far enough towards ensuring that the ACC will be the third banking force.  The increase in the borrowing limit to £1.4 million is not sufficient and I urge him to go the whole hog and increase it to £2 million.  The ACC has been a stalwart of the agricultural community for many years and made a major contribution to the development of the agricultural industry.  If it were not for the ACC many sectors of the agricultural industry <Col N="236" /> would not have developed.  I ask the Minister to increase the borrowing limit to at least £2 million.  In future our economy will depend on the promotion of the agricultural, fisheries and tourism sectors.  The ACC played a very important role in recent years in pioneering and fostering the expansion of the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>For far too long people were at the mercy of the whims of the two major banking institutions.  When the Bank of Ireland decided to operate a mobile banking system in rural areas Allied Irish Banks tried to frustrate this development by opening branches in various villages and towns.  However, when the Bank of Ireland withdrew its mobile banking system Allied Irish Banks closed down the offices they had opened in those villages and towns. Competition is the name of the game and without it in the banking sector customers will be bled dry.  I say this from experience.</P>
      <P>The ACC has been behind every major agricultural development in recent years.  There should be no restrictions on the ACC, which should be the third banking force.  We should not forget the credit unions which will shortly make an application to become a banking force.  Credit unions have been the salvation of many people in rural areas. I hope in the not too distant future the credit unions will in conjunction with the ACC, apply to become a banking force, thereby giving people a safe and decent banking system.</P>
      <P>The two major banking institutions have a monopoly in the banking sector. They have put people behind bars for failing to meet their responsibilities &mdash; this can be debated any way one likes. These institutions, which fail in their responsibilities to customers, should have a human face.  I agree with Deputy Jim Higgins that dormant accounts in the two major banking institutions should be made public.  Who will claim them if the next of kin cannot be traced?  I am a firm believer in democracy and I think the banking system needs to be reviewed very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> I had an opportunity to visit the state of Iowa four years ago, not in a junket from this House but as an invited guest for a St. Patrick's Day Parade in Des Moines, paid for by the St. Patrick's Association of the United States.  I had an opportunity to meet the main banking institution in Iowa, the Brethon Bank, which was commandeered by the Government of the United States to make available interest free loans to individuals who came up with sound projections.  The state guaranteed the repayment of their interest.  The unemployment rate in that state was only 0.5 per cent because the banking system was working in league with the Government.</P>
    <P>There is a major role for the banks. Last year the two major banks made a profit of £6 million on the money of the people of Ireland.  The time is right for the Minister to take them on.  The banks are becoming millionaires as a result of the hard-working people of this community. The system that exists in the United States should exist here.  The Minister for Finance, in whom I have great faith&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;has the power to take on the banking system.  I ask him not to be misled by the banking system. They owe young entrepreneurs who have the determination and the drive to start industry in Ireland a policy to get them off the ground.  Why not establish the same type of system as in the United States where an unpaid committee is set up in every state?  The committee comprises ex-bankers and ex-industrialists who have contributed to that great economy.  The Minister for Finance should take up this matter with the banks.  He should make it clear to them that he will not sit idly by while any institution in Ireland can make a profit of £6 million a year from the people without generating one job.  The time is ripe to tackle that situation, especially when 300,000 people are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Competition is the name of the game. <Col N="238" /> Without competition in the banking world, the people are suffering.  This Bill has not gone half far enough considering the good work being done by ACC. I implore the Minister to allow ACC to borrow up to £2 billion instead of £1.4 billion.  It is wrong to curtail them.  For God's sake give the people of Ireland an opportunity to make a living.  The banking system has completely ignored them.  They have put people behind bars when they have failed to make repayments while at the same time they gobble up all the interest and make themselves millionaires overnight. Industrialists, entrepreneurs and the young man trying to start off a business are x-rayed by the banking system.  Why are the banks not asked to shoulder some part of the responsibility for creating employment?</P>
    <P>I am amazed that any Minister for Finance could allow these people, at a whim, to close an office in Goleen or in any part of rural Ireland.  I speak about Goleen because it is my native village. The Bank of Ireland had a mobile bank there but AIB bought a premises in the village and put them out of business. The two main financial institutions, AIB and the Bank of Ireland, are vying with each other for business while rural Ireland is decaying.  We do not have AIB or the Bank of Ireland in Goleen now.  I have to travel ten miles to cash my Dáil cheque every month.</P>
    <P>There is much to be learned in regard to broadening the horizons of the banking system.  The Minister is not tackling the problem by means of this Bill.  He should go the full hog and give unlimited borrowing capacity to ACC.  This is only the thin end of the wedge so far as the banking system is concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to encourage industry and help young entrepreneurs get off the ground he must recognise that we will not survive without an alternative banking system.  While it may involve a trip in the Government jet, the Minister should visit Iowa and meet the president of the Brethon Bank who will advise him on the ideas he should promote. The provisions of this Bill only <Col N="239" /> skim the surface so far as entrepreneurs here are concerned.  The time is ripe to take a bold step.  If the Minister does not grasp the initiative he will not get a second chance.  He should explore the possibility of giving the ACC and the credit unions &mdash; institutions trying to create jobs and get rural Ireland off the ground &mdash; a similar opportunity to the banking moguls.  For too long the two main banking moguls have been bleeding the lifeblood of this land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill signalling steady growth in the ACC bank is both welcome and timely.  It provides an opportunity to assess and evaluate the contribution of the bank to agriculture and the economy in general.  The bank's continued growth is testament to its success and it is interesting to view it in the context of Irish banking in 1994.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank's most recent review lists 83 credit institutions currently submitting returns to it.  The ACC bank holds approximately 2 per cent of the national banking business. That is interesting and impressive when one considers the range and strength of some of the opposition, but it will need capital for further growth if the importance of the agricultural sector is taken into account.  The Bill provides for the authorisation to extend the bank's facility by approximately 40 per cent. While this will undoubtedly meet the short term needs of the ACC, a long term strategy must be pursued.  I would not like the ACC to be subsumed into another bank with an established presence here.  I would prefer it to continue operating with an emphasis on the agricultural market, although it is now allowed to lend to both the business and personal sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of specialist agricultural business and the farming sector, I would welcome a link or a strategic alliance with a bank of the calibre of Credit Agricole in France or the Rabo bank in the Netherlands which would ensure that we would continue to have <Col N="240" /> a banking force with a strong emphasis on agriculture &mdash; perhaps a fourth force.</P>
    <P>The specialist requirements of agriculture are not always understood or appreciated.  The Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry are promoting two schemes which will impact favourably on the quality of our environment, namely, the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the rural environmental scheme. There is a strong case for backdating the former scheme to January 1994, as happened with the tourism schemes.  This would reduce the level of borrowing required by farmers and increase the level available for other environmental and farming enterprises.  To my knowledge, the ACC bank is the only bank which operates an environmental loan scheme at preferential rates.  The impact of that scheme would be greatly increased if farmers were automatically tranferred from the FIP to the CFP scheme from 1 January 1994.  The ACC is the ideal vehicle for providing milk quota loans to farmers availing of the scheme recently announced by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, under which qualifying farmers in disadvantaged areas are subvented in acquiring extra quotas which up to now have gone to wealthy farmers in richer areas.</P>
    <P>In view of their previous record, there is little reason to be confident that the associated banks will offer any scheme of milk quota loans.  It is vital that a bank which responds readily and imaginatively to the needs of agriculture is retained and enabled to grow and expand.  This Bill deals with this in the short term, but the day is fast approaching when a more long term strategy will have to be implemented.</P>
    <P>A glance at a table of sectoral distribution of credit from licensed banks from 1986 to 1991 drawn up by Professor Ray Kinsella, shows a drop of approximately 2 per cent, from 12.71 per cent to 10.84 per cent, in their investment in agriculture and fisheries at a time when demand for credit for necessary works was at a peak.  A difficulty facing farmers is that capital works <Col N="241" /> do not contribute to future profitability and are not attractive to commercial banks.  In that regard it is important that the ACC continues to make the contribution it has made up to now in providing specialist services to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the task force on small businesses established by the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan. In its 30 point blueprint for small business, IBEC called for cessation of the practice whereby owners of small businesses are required by banks to guarantee loans by mortgaging the family home.</P>
    <P>A scheme introduced in September 1992 by a number of the main banks, including the ACC, made £75 million available as standard commercial rates without personal guarantees to finance new and developing enterprises.  Unfortunately, agricultural enterprise tended not to be considered for the scheme and the level of benefit to small and medium enterprises in agriculture was minimal. The £100 million small business expansion loan scheme introduced in February 1994 was confined to firms in manufacturing, tourism and international services at a fixed rate of 6.75 per cent. That scheme has been a major success. I understand all the money has been used up and I am sure the Minister has received representations for its renewal and expansion.</P>
    <P>An important study, entitled <i>Jobs in Farming and Food,</i> carried out by Liam Downey and Lance O'Brien of Teagasc in 1992, concluded that a positive and concerted approach to raising the competitiveness of agriculture and food industries and to establishing market led developments in small and medium scale alternative farming and rural businesses could maintain approximately 120,000 to 130,000 productive jobs in agriculture, including 5,000 to 10,000 additional jobs arising from the diversification of farm enterprises and the establishment of related rural businesses. Unfortunately, setting up such businesses requires a significant input from the banking sector and the <Col N="242" /> additional money which will now be available to the ACC will undoubtedly make a major contribution towards meeting those targets.  The report also states that it would increase the number employed in the food processing industry by approximately 3,000 and create additional employment in agricultural services and other sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>With the support of properly resourced services in advice, training and research the agricultural and food industries, together with alternative farm enterprises, could provide productive employment for approximately 150,000 to 170,000 people.  That will be possible only with the support of a strong banking sector.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Rural and Local Post Offices: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy J. Fox on Tuesday, 18 October 1994:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, expressing concern at the increasing number of closures of rural and local post offices and alarmed at the serious damage being caused to the fabric of community life in rural Ireland, calls on the Government to immediately halt these closures and to reaffirm its commitment <Col N="243" /> to maintain and preserve rural and local post offices. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that the policy of An Post to ensure a first class postal service in rural areas is an intrinsic part of wider Government policies which are aimed, in the aggregate, at facilitating and underpinning rural renewal and development.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The irony of the position in An Post, giving rise to this motion is that, rather than limping from a loss of £8.7 million to a minimal profit of £4.8 million, and chugging into automation and computerisation on a phased basis, with a proper dynamic approach An Post could be a multi-million pound, profit-making organisation contributing to this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The infrastructure of An Post gives it a head start over the financial institutions. That it has a network of 2,000 offices, spreading its tentacles into every community nationwide, gives it an advantage over the banks and building societies and its well trained staff, supported by a progressive responsible and co-operative union, means that it has the personnel in place.  That these offices remain open from 9 o'clock each morning until 5.30 each evening, six <Col N="244" /> days a week, again gives An Post a considerable edge on its competitors.</P>
    <P>I welcome the progress, computerisation, automation and modernisation of An Post but, at a time when there is major debate on the role of the Trustee Savings Bank, the third banking force and so on, surely we should look to our State-owned post office banking system? There is no reason a vigorous development plan, a true viability plan, with emphasis on viability and expansion could not be implemented.  For example, there is no reason An Post could not provide pass or credit card services, or enter into the business of current accounts, cheque books and lending facilities as do the banks, building societies and insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Not one single insurance company, bank or building society can offer savings schemes on a par with the former index-linked savings scheme of An Post, the Savings Certificates or other savings or bonus schemes operated by the company. Yet these excellent schemes have not been adequately promoted, certainly not in terms of the huge volume they should net by way of wide-scale participation or investment in them.</P>
    <P>There is a harvest of commercial opportunity for An Post.  Is it that An Post has not got the initiative, ability, flair or enterprise to bite the bullet and run with such opportunity?  Is it that An Post is being held back by restrictions, by Government policies, or what exactly is the problem?  Why have we been having a debate in this House over the past two evenings almost apologising for the inability of An Post to be the throbbing, vibrant, energetic, profitable and competitive organisation it should be?  We have discussed the provisions of the ACC Bill for the best part of four hours this afternoon when Members alluded to the vast, excessive profits being made by the banks.  One need only look at bank profits to clearly see the harvest of commercial opportunity there.  For example, in 1993 the Bank of Ireland made £280 million clear profit and the AIB group a profit of £293 million.  One can go right down through the various <Col N="245" /> banks to the very smallest, the National Investment Bank, and see that it made £7.98 million.  Yet, here we have a Stateowned institution with a highly trained network of staff, with offices spreading throughout every single community which has failed miserably to exploit the commercial opportunities staring it in the face.</P>
    <P>Rather than dismantling the subpost offices which cost the company virtually nothing &mdash; amply illustrated by CORPO, the Cork-based organisation and by Deputy John Fox and other Members in the House last evening &mdash; or relegating the offices in smaller towns and shedding jobs An Post should develop a five-year expansion plan with specific targets so that, by 1999, as we face into the new millennium, An Post will be a vigorous, profit-making commercial organisation which it is very definitely not now.  It could do that and continue to provide a top class service to its customers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by the chief executive of An Post, Mr. John Hynes, to keep Carracastle subpost office open. In the light of the commitments given and the misunderstandings that arose, I commend him on doing the right thing, which was not easy in view of the decision taken previously.  A commitment should be given that no other sub-post office will be closed.  We should consolidate not dismantle; we should build and not disband; we should retain our post offices and the post office network as an integral part of revamped An Post operations that would give it an edge over its keenest commercial competitors.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted the Culliton report last evening in the context of postal costs and so on.  However, it is also worth recalling that the Culliton report spoke about the need for greater emphasis on the untapped job potential in the service sector.  In An Post we have a service sector, with an elaborate infrastructure already in place.  Let us not shoot ourselves in the foot by destroying what should be the key component in the development of An Post.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> I am for rationalisation and for cost-cutting measures where necessary but, in this case, it is not rationalisation, it is irrational and does not make any sense. I was not at all assured by the Minister's contribution last evening when he merely confirmed the policy of An Post to implement a gradual system of closure, of natural wastage, whenever the next of kin are not in a position to display an interest in retaining an office. This is a subtle policy of closure and it is not acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate An Post, rural decay and the lack of Government interest in retaining people in rural areas.  In many ways An Post has provided a good service to rural and other communities over the years.  I was extremely interested in listening to the comments and suggestions of Deputy Jim Higgins on how it could and should be improved.  I want to comment on the more human aspects of what An Post has meant and should mean in the future in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a notion that through natural wastage matters will rectify themselves. In Monaghan recent efforts have been made to withdraw postal sorting services from village post offices and transfer them to larger centres, thereby reducing the need for auxiliary postmen, many of whom have served for 20 or more years.  At a time of high unemployment when it is supposedly in the national interest to keep people at work such a move would be a major retrograde step.  For the aged and the not so old who live alone in rural areas the visit of the postman is appreciated. Recently in the Ballybay region there were six old people's dwellings to be filled but because of concern about the impact of the closure of post offices and the fall in garda numbers in rural areas, more than 40 people, mainly rural dwellers, sought to occupy those houses.  In some areas efforts were made to introduce green boxes to reduce community Garda services, but in the main they <Col N="247" /> were unsuccessful.  A few were introduced but that was a retrograde step at a time when we are trying to keep people in rural Ireland.  It is not the responsibility of An Post to enable people to remain in rural areas but it is a State institution and it must have regard to present circumstances.</P>
    <P>What will be the next measure if the sorting facility is removed from village post offices?  People are concerned that if that service is removed, the auxiliary activities to which it gives rise would no longer be needed, postmen would not carry messages to the post office and they would fall into decay and be closed.  An Post proposed to close 550 post offices in 1991, but because of the local elections and a fear of the impact of such action at the polling booths that proposal did not go ahead.  Now they are being closed by stealth.  Careful attention must be given to the long term effect of such closures on the viability of rural areas.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister stated how well the Government was looking after the rural community and that is one of the main reasons I wanted to contribute to the debate tonight.  He said that the Government was pursuing policies which were contributing to low inflation and low interest rates.  That must be a joke.  Does the Government's decision to award the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Ministers a 17 per cent pay increase represent an effort to maintain low interest rates?  Does that decision encourage workers, who are receiving less today than this time last year, to refrain from seeking wage increases? Does it encourage the workers of Irish Steel, An Post or other organisations to work for the benefit of this country?  I come from a Border county which suffered most from the debacle of the sterling related problems when interest rates went through the roof over 12 months ago.  Government action did not help.  Interest rates fell in spite of the Government, not because of it, yet a Minister claims credit and asserts that <Col N="248" /> he is doing everything possible for rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have had promises of decentralisation to Monaghan.  In the light of peace in the North, which we all applaud, it is possible there will be fewer Garda and Army personnel in the constituency in the long term.  The Minister talks glibly about decentralisation.  He should ensure that as few post offices as possible are closed, thereby retaining their services in the constituency.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to what had been done under the Leader Programme. That programme has been successful but if the Government gets its way the funds available to the new Leader Programme, which covers a longer period than the older one, will be scattered so broadly throughout the country that it will be of little use. Whatever benefit the Leader Programme had in the past, it is likely to have a limited benefit in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge An Post to remember that opportunities exist to develop the post office service.  I am aware that it intends to extend a computerised system to many post offices. An Post is improving its services in some areas but it should not forget the role played by rural post offices or remove postal services from those areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. I dislike the move to curtail services to <Col N="249" /> isolated rural areas.  As a Deputy who resides 240 miles away from the centre of power in Dublin, I am fully aware of the position in rural Ireland.  Unless we safeguard the future of post offices and sub post offices we will deal a death blow to the fabric of rural society.  I have to travel ten miles to the nearest bank to cash my monthly cheque from Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I do not want to see rural Ireland without post offices to facilitate the people who live there.  It is enshrined in our Constitution that every citizen should be treated equally.  If post offices in urbanised areas are making money for An Post it should percolate to the most remote post office in Ireland.  We cannot all live in Donnybrook or other urbanised areas.  I live 20 miles from the nearest town, Bantry, and I do not know how I survive.  If the Minister has any humanity he will ensure that rural post offices are maintained for posterity.</P>
      <P>The rural post office has given great service over the years.  When I was a small boy going to school I was able to buy savings certificates at the post office.  I do not know how many school-children now have savings certificates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hands off the rural post offices and keep the fabric of rural life going.  It is very difficult to run a postal service that covers an area from Skibbereen or Schull to the extreme end of the Mizen Peninsula, from Bantry to the extreme end of the Béara Peninsula, or from Bantry to Sheep's Head Peninsula. I am fortunate &mdash; or maybe unfortunate &mdash; to have three peninsula areas in my constituency, thinly populated, where a <Col N="250" /> visit from the postman, even if he brings a bill, is welcomed by some of our old people.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that under no circumstances will the closure of rural post offices be permitted.  As a Minister and Deputy representing a rural area, he should understand the position and I implore him not to allow An Post to close post offices in rural areas.  As far as post offices are concerned, the element of profit should be taken out of the reckoning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who were in the Chamber last night heard the Minister's excellent analysis of the postal service generally.  One could not but be taken by the description of the postal service as it is at present and the development and expansion plans for it in anticipation of the competition with which An Post will have to contend in the wake of the liberalisation of mail services in the Community.</P>
      <P>The reality is that we live in an ever-changing world.  Population movement, demands for a more efficient service and for better working conditions and greater mobility of customers, demand a greater range of services.  All this applies to most of the range of services required by our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The postal service has not escaped the changes.  Population movement, whether caused by economic changes in rural areas or the tendency to concentrate population along the east coast, particularly in the greater Dublin area, impacts on planning for the postal service. Post offices in rural areas have always been and continue to be a focal point in every parish.  When there were fewer motor vehicles than today everybody in a parish used the post office at some time or another.  However, times <Col N="251" /> have changed and rural post offices have lost out to bigger offices with a wider range of services in nearby towns. Many in the Chamber will remember a time when visits to the town for shopping were organised on a once a week basis.  Such expeditions are now organised on a more regular basis.  The advent of the two car family and general economic changes in the employment arena have seen postal transactions and business operating from the larger post office outlets in the medium and larger towns.  There are many instances of people living cheek by jowl with the post office in their local parish who, whether collecting their social welfare payment or availing of some other service that An Post provides, drive six or seven miles to the nearest town.  Confidentiality is a consideration; people like to transact business without their next door neighbour knowing it.</P>
    <P>When the Culliton review of industrial policy was published Members accepted many of its conclusions and recommendations.  Two of the important recommendations related to reduced telephone and postal charges. The reality is that An Post, under the direction of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, is actively pursuing a cost reduction policy.  In his script last night the Minister said that the difference in domestic rates in the EU generally as distinct from this country is about 13 per cent.  We cannot live in isolation within the EU.  In population terms we may be small and, some may believe, an insignificant member, but we are subject to the normal cost and competitiveness that exists in an economic bloc such as the EU.  Unless we bring our costs into line we will be at a serious disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The development of the automated counter service delivery systems was heralded by the Minister last evening. We all agree that if An Post is to survive and prosper, automation will have to become the norm in its development programme.  The Minister stated that there is one post office for every 1,800 <Col N="252" /> people.  In the UK there is one post office for every 2,500 people and in Portugal there is one post office for every 7,000 people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1990 An Post lost approximately £8.7 million.  Recent figures indicate that that position has been turned around.  As is clear from the Minister's script, An Post would need to be in a profitable position to help fund the development plans envisaged for it. Our postal service cannot operate in isolation.  The completion of the Single Market has clear implications for it.  Liberalisation and better service demands are ever present.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers have focused on the area of rural development and I think there is consensus on that issue. There is a great need for rural development. Those who are in the business of organising rural housing co-operatives, encouraging local community initiative, developing Leader programmes in their respective areas and actively encouraging the development of small industry in towns and villages in rural Ireland do an immense service.  There are many people working in a voluntary capacity who do not get the recognition they deserve.</P>
      <P>While people are living in parishes in rural Ireland the demand for postal services and the prospect of maintaining as many viable post offices as possible will exist.  On the basis of the Minister's comments last night, it is clear that there has been a process of reduction in the number of sub-post offices.  This is not a trend that began 12 months ago; it has been ongoing for many years.  It is taking place in tandem with the unfortunate process of depopulation in some of the areas referred to by Deputy Sheehan.</P>

Ag an am sin, ag caint sa Seanad, dúirt mé nárbh leor díreach na hoifigí poist a chaomhnú ach go raibh gá leis na seirbhísí a bhí acu a fherbairt.  Tá áthas orm go bhuil sin déanta ó shin.  Tá áthas orm, freisin, go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh go mór mhór i gcomhthéacs ríomhairí le gur féidir seirbhísí éifeachtacha a chur ar fáil ar fud na tuaithe.  Ainneoin go bhfuil comhnaí orm i ndúiche &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo;, níor ghlac mé leis riamh go raibh sé sách maith i gcomhthéacs na tuaithe <Col N="254" /> a bheith ag caomhnú go sean-fhaiseanta an rud a bhí ann ach go gcaithfí an rud atá ann a fhorbairt agus a dhéanamh feiliúnach don nua-aois.</P>
      <P>I was surprised last night to hear an Opposition Deputy bemoaning the demise of the telegram as a way of sending urgent messages.

      <P>In the community in which I live development has taken place by adopting modern technology to local needs, not by closing the door against modern technology.  Of course we want to preserve our local institutions; I do not want to see local post offices, national schools or Garda stations closed.  We are all agreed on that, but to preserve them in some frozen form of the 19th century will ensure their ultimate demise.  Too many services in rural Ireland have been destroyed by an unwillingness at State and local level to adapt to change, particularly in technology.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a huge range of services provided at post offices, most of which would be based on one of our greatest assets, the telephone service. With the use of computers, it should be possible in time to provide banking and social welfare services and perhaps even deal with headage applications.</P>
      <P>Five years ago our post office services were run down.  A person who wanted to withdraw £50 from the Post Office Savings Bank had to send their deposit book to Dublin.  I hope this debate does not mark a return to that untenable position.  It was a positive decision to introduce technology and computerise 1,200 post offices and allow the Department of Social Welfare to make use of them.  This will ensure that they remain viable as a central service in the community. I am happy that the Government is approaching the matter in the right way and I hope An Post will continue to examine the question of services which can be provided at post offices.</P>

      <P>It is not accurate to say that rural Ireland is dying because An Post is closing down post offices.  It is important to ask, however, the effect closure of post offices would have on the fabric of rural Ireland.  It is also important that we outline the facts. During the past ten years 26 per cent of the post offices where a postmaster or postmistress retired or died were closed; the remaining 74 per cent remain open. We should ask ourselves how many banks have been closed under the banks' rationalisation programme.</P>

We should ask ourselves what effect will this funding have on the fabric of rural Ireland.  Are people being attracted from our major cities and from abroad to see what rural Ireland has to offer?  This programme is succeeding admirably and increasing numbers are being attracted.  This means that an <Col N="257" /> increased number of jobs will be available and that the migration of people to the larger cities can be halted.</P>

Under the Leader II Programme we will reap the benefits.</P>
      <P>It would be foolish of the Government not to refer to the fact that the county enterprise boards have been established.  We should ask those who question the commitment of the Government to rural Ireland what is the purpose of these boards and what they hope to achieve.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I am anxious to ensure that this will be the position.  I have asked the Minister and the Government to ensure that we do <Col N="258" /> not have two opposing policies &mdash; that, on the one hand, we do not put the Leader Programme, tourism enterprises and county enterprise boards in place, and on the other, close down post offices and schools.  People must be given an opportunity to create jobs under the various programmes and the Government must be seen to have a commitment to ensuring that social services are maintained and subsidised.</P>
      <P>An Post deserves great credit.  It must be remembered that under its rationalisation programme it sought the closure of 550 post offices.  The Minister of the day also deserves great credit for deciding that the programme could not proceed and for asking how the service could be rationalised and made more cost effective.  It is interesting to note that over a four-year period An Post has invested £50 million, over half of which has been invested in the provinces, and plans to invest a further £20 million per annum during the next five years.</P>

Cuireann sé ionadh orm nach raibh an Rialtas sásta glacadh leis an rún seo agus go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh é a athrú sa bhealach atá leagtha síos acu anseo.  Nuair a bhí an tAire ag labhairt anseo aréir dúirt sé rudaí a bhí contráilte i mo thuairim féin.</P>
      <P>I thought the Minister contradicted himself and I would like to draw his attention to what he said in his speech last night.  He said there would be no lessening in the number of sub post offices operating or in the level of counter service available to the public, yet earlier in the speech the quoted section 12 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, stating that the company's present policy, with which he agrees is &ldquo;to consider an office for closure when the incumbent postmaster retires or dies, when no family member wants to continue to run the office, where the turnover in the office is too low to give a long term sustainable living from the job and where there is, within a reasonable distance, another post office to which the business can be transferred&rdquo;.  He says there is nothing new about closure of sub post offices under this policy, with which he agrees. He gives figures for the number of post offices which have been closed, 235 in all.  The Minister seems to imply in that part of his address to the House that he had no objection to the continuation of further closures but later he seems to imply the opposite.  There is a contradiction and perhaps he will clarify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the increasing competition in <Col N="261" /> the communications industry brought about by technological advances and rapid changes in the demands of consumers it is recognised that incumbent firms must take steps to cut costs to be able to sustain their position in the industry and carry out further development and growth.  For this reason it is argued that so-called loss making services which these firms may provide would have be be eliminated or the cost of providing them borne by those who utilise the service.  The provision of counter services in rural areas tends to be regarded as loss making by postal administrations.  There is a number of reasons such services should not be done away with in rural areas.  The reason given for the closure of rural postal counter services is that it is a necessary procedure to be able to compete with new entrants to the industry, it is argued that rural postal services are loss making and, hence, need to be cross-subsidised.  However, to be able to cross-subsidise them it is held that consumers of the more profitable services have to be overcharged.  This makes An Post less competitive in respect of providing more profitable services in the market.  Hence the argument is put forward that maintaining the rural post office leads to an increase in price to consumers and continued reduction of An Post's share in the profitable market. The viability plan called for the closure of 550 sub post offices.  I want to draw the attention of Members to the New Zealand experience which indicates that, to become more competitive instead of closing counter service at rural outlets, the number of outlets should be increased.</P>
    <P>New Zealand is one of the most deregulated countries in the world in economic terms.  It is also one of the few countries where a full comprehensive economic survey has been carried out of the postal services, including rural postal services and counter services in rural post offices &mdash; exactly what this motion is about.  Let me repeat, New Zealand is renowned as one of the most advanced deregulated economies and as <Col N="262" /> a result the level of competition in their market for public utility goods and services, including postal services, is intense.  In 1987 the postal services provided for the corporatisation of New Zealand's post, that its postal service was to be run as a commercial entity responsible for its own profits and losses, would no longer be propped up by Government subsidisation and protection and would have to become as competitive as any other firm operating in the industry.  In 1994, seven years later, the New Zealand post office is still a state owned enterprise and the company which operates in a market which is almost entirely deregulated has a reliability level of at least 95 per cent and often 99.9 per cent on next day deliveries.  It employs 8,671 people, including full-time and part-time staff but excluding subsidiaries.  It has converted substantial losses in its postal services into substantial profits.</P>
    <P>The House will be particularly interested to know what happened to the counter service in rural areas in New Zealand.  At its inception in 1987, the New Zealand Post inherited 1,244 retail outlets but in 1994 it has 4,738 such outlets. Instead of closing down its outlets it expanded and plans to continue to do so.  It should be noted that this is the practice of a commercial entity and not one that it is forced to operate in the public interest.  New Zealand Post has increased the number of outlets because they generate profits through increasing availability of postal services for consumers and hence an increased demand. How has it managed to operate such a large number of outlets feasibly?  It has done so by increasing the number of services available at each outlet.  For example, the range of postal related merchandise was developed to be sold in these outlets.</P>
    <P>The merchandise includes postcards, greeting cards, easy to assemble cardboard boxes and protective envelopes in which customers may package items for posting.  The outlets also became agents for the collection and maintenance of <Col N="263" /> licensed data on behalf of State regulatory agencies in the transport industry, the collection of broadcasting licences and for various transactions on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and other central Government services.  It also became an agency for local government services and supplied services to major companies.</P>
    <P>The viability of sub-post offices could also be increased if the range of services which they can provide is increased. The majority of our rural sub-post offices, approximately 1,100 out of the total of 1,854, are termed &ldquo;non-dedicated&rdquo;, that is their business not only includes trade and postal services but they may also trade as newsagents, grocery stores, etc.  If An Post considers it viable, a contract is offered to permit the grocer or newsagent provide postal services.  The salary which the postmaster receives will depend upon the earnings of that post office and out of that salary the postmaster must pay for the lighting, heating and rent of his premises which are necessary to provide the services.  If An Post is calculating correctly, the costs of these services are minimal.  As the location of the post office is often in another type of shop, the economies of scope which are available, and hence the low cost that these would accrue, mean there is little justification for closure of these facilities on a cost basis.  In fact, they increase the availability of postal services to consumers thereby raising the demand for services and benefiting the industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>For industry to develop in rural areas, which is essential if high levels of migration arising from high unemployment are to be reduced, it is vital that support industries, such as financial and communications services etc. are available. In other words, to encourage the location of industries in areas other than in the major cities, it is paramount that services such as a postal service are located nearby.  In considering a small rural firm, closure of local facilities <Col N="264" /> would increase the costs of mailing because of an increase in the distance which that firm would have to travel to avail of postal services.  This is obviously detrimental to firms at a time when we must do everything in our power to encourage enterprise.  As the Culliton report pointed out, the development of the country's communication network is vital for industry.  Instead of closures there should be a concentration on expansion on the lines of the developments in New Zealand.</P>
    <P>A postal service is often regarded as a public utility good, one provided, regardless of whether it is profitable, because of its importance to society. Even if rural sub-post offices are regarded as not being lucrative, the Government has a duty to the public utility characteristic of postal services, as outlined in the EC Green Paper on the development of the postal industry, which emphasised the need for a universal service.  This should include not only the collection and delivery of mail but also the accessibility to all the postal services.  It is important to remember that the public utility characteristic provides justification for the postal monopoly. If, on the other hand, the postal services were not regarded as an essential utility, there would be no reason such a postal industry should continue to be given the protection by legislation of a monopoly.</P>
    <P>This motion expresses concern at the increasing number of closures of rural and local post offices.  My party supports the motion on the contention that there is no justification for closures on grounds of increased competition taking into account developments in New Zealand where competition is intense and bearing in mind that New Zealand is one of the few places where any comprehensive survey of the whole operation of rural post offices, has been undertaken.</P>
    <P>The motion is worthy of support because there is no justification for closures on cost grounds as most of the sub-post offices are located in newsagents and premises where other services are <Col N="265" /> already provided.  The economies of scope which these accrue mean that the selling of postal services is minimal.  We support the motion also on the grounds that this service is essential for the development of industry and subsequent employment in rural areas.  It is also required under European Union commitments that a postal service is a public utility good which a Government must ensure is available to all its citizens. The Progressive Democrats fully support the motion.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Molloy for sharing his time with me.  As a rural Deputy I support this motion because if rural areas are to survive they must have post offices, schools, shops and churches.  Also, local authorities must build small schemes of houses which will keep the people in these areas.</P>
      <P>I did not hear any Member today refer to the people who run An Post and I am talking about the pinstripe brigade.  The people in charge of the semi-State companies have taken a bad example from the Government and I refer to the various managerial jobs created in An Post.  We never hear the management of An Post saying that in regard to job cuts they will start at the top.  Instead they focus their attention on the rural post offices that cost them very little and when they have obtained the necessary cuts in that area they move on to the postmen.  It would take three postmen to replace one of the men in the pinstripe suits.</P>
      <P>The proposal to close rural sub-post offices is an attack on rural areas.  It is easy for An Post to make these decisions in Dublin because they do not know the effects they will have on the people living in the west and other rural areas.  The postman delivers the mail to isolated areas; he visits once a week and lets the householder know what is happening in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Semi-State companies now appoint programme managers.  Gardaí in rural areas are being removed and the next attack will be on the schools.  We cannot allow this continue.  I am surprised at <Col N="266" /> this action of the Government, particularly Fianna Fáil, which has always said it is in favour of development of rural areas.  How can the Government support rural areas when it is taking away our post offices and schools and will not provide proper school transport for our children who must travel 15 and 20 miles to the nearest school?</P>
    <P>I am delighted this motion, which deserves support, is before the House.  I am happy that the people of Carracastle recently stood their ground and said that enough was enough.  This Government talks about saving the west.  There is little point in talking about saving the west if there will be cutbacks in our schools, school transport and post offices.  That is not saving the west.  All we hear from the Government are words and no actions.  The Government should leave our rural post offices alone and if it wants to attack An Post, it should do so at top or middle management. It should remove some of the men in pinstripe suits because they are making decisions in Dublin affecting the people in the west and other rural areas. That is wrong and I will tell the people in the west that in future we will stand up for ourselves and we will not take such treatment from any Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that this motion has been put forward by the independent Members.  Many of us are aware of the closures that are taking place at such a rate that the original plan of so-called rationalisation of post offices is coming into force by stealth. An Post adopts an air of injured innocence when tackled on this point. However, it is clear from the evidence on the ground that the drive to undermine rural post offices, and communities as a consequence, is active.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined policy on the closure of post offices and argued that <Col N="267" /> there was natural end to a post office where the owner retired or died, where a family member did not wish to take up the option and where business was on a small scale, as if somehow these conditions justified the closure.  I would argue differently.  Anyone who knows what is happening on the ground knows that support should be provided for a post office rather than taken away. There are many instances where young people have taken over post offices which were in serious decline due to the age of the previous owner.  They are fully committed to upgrading the service and just when they are at the point where their initiative is about to be realised An Post pulls the rug from under them and closes the post office. This happened in Bray and conflicts with the idea of good business and developing a product which An Post prides itself on doing.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why a small post office, whether rural or urban, should not have a strong and viable existence in modern life.  There are many services a post office could provide, as Deputy Molloy stated.  In the area of modern technology they could offer simple services such as fax, photocopying and the various forms of information technology which are crucial to small businesses operating in rural communities with the support of a county enterprise board or the Leader Programme.  It would be a tremendous boon for small communities and local enterprise to have that resource.  The development of the tele-cottage is an indication of the direction in which An Post should go in providing services within communities.</P>
    <P>Instead of expanding services and keeping up with the times their knee jerk response is based on old style thinking which fails to recognise the changes in rural communities.  Instead of seeing a rural post office as a resource with potential the crude, shortsighted response is to close it.  A number of post offices were closed in my constituency, one in a rural area around Kilquiggan where the impact of the <Col N="268" /> closure is serious.  It should be remembered that it is not simply the business carried out by a post office that benefits the local community, it is also the business a post office brings into a community. Social welfare cheques, old age pensions and long term retirement payments are paid out at post offices which means local people will spend money in adjoining shops.  If closures continue we will such out the economic supports from local communities and centre them in larger communities.</P>
    <P>The most modern thinking on economic development transcends the market-led view of centralisation and the concept that big is always beautiful.  If there is to be local economic growth there must be services and sources of wealth which encourage local development. A properly managed post office can play such a role.  At present post offices are not given that chance by an organisation and a Government which claims to be in favour of good business.</P>
    <P>The need is no less great in urban areas where it is often the elderly or parents of young children who avail of the services.  They often do not have cars.  Poor working class areas already find their isolation is a fact of life because of inadequate transport systems and the closure of local banks and post offices.  In my own area a small local post office which was the hub of local community activity was closed down over night because the previous owner retired, even though young people were willing to take it over and build up the business.</P>
    <P>There has been an emphasis on rural post offices but it is not just a rural matter. The fabric of society is underpinned by economic and social services.  The enriching feature of a local post office cannot be reduced to a matter of profit and loss.  The knock-on impact of a post office in the community is inestimable, as is the impact when a post office is closed.  Many local communities watched jealously as An Post reversed its decision to close a small post office at Carracastle, County Mayo.  I commend the people for their battle but <Col N="269" /> their success was due to the nationwide attention given to the matter by Gay Byrne.  It is a sign of the paucity of leadership in Government when it is Gay Byrne who determines the survival of a post office.</P>

      <P>He can do a nationwide tour.  Speaking as a Deputy from a rural county which has within its boundaries urban areas of great deprivation, I and my party fully support the motion and the importance of the role of the post office in community development.</P>
      <P>At EU level, the arguments put forward by Government have to do with subsidiarity, a bottom up approach enabling us at national level to have a say over our destiny.  The same arguments hold true at local level &mdash; a factor which is consistently disregarded and swamped by the raucous demand for rationalisation and the dictates of the market overall.</P>
      <P>We are elected to serve the people and it is our responsibility to ensure that the services and opportunities they need to develop enterprises within local communities are in place.  The Government has failed in its duty to provide post offices and the Minister has a responsibility to right the wrongs committed at local level.  These will continue to be committed unless the Government changes the overall policy on services for local communities, whether rural or urban.</P>

      <P>I thank those who supported the motion for their positive contributions. There were some positive aspects in the Minister's speech which must be acknowledged.  The amendment is an expert piece of side-stepping and illustrates that when we handed over the drafting of policy to programme managers and senior civil servants we also handed over the drafting of answers. This is a major side-step by the Government.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; is not often used in politics, it is mainly associated with international soccer at club level where a team which loses three goals to nil away and wins four goals to nil at home will qualify.  The Government seems to be using this principle to defend the decision to close rural and local post offices, that the number of viable and well run post offices means that the post offices in some areas can be closed down, that the service and balance sheet has been improved and everything is hunk'y-do'ry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Deputies opposite who represent rural areas &mdash; Deputy O'Keeffe should know better &mdash; would suggest that the introduction of technology is not welcomed in rural areas.  Of course, this is not the case. Deputy Kirk said people did not mind driving six to ten miles to a post office. However, he forgets that the post office is the poor man's bank and that an old age pensioner receiving £70 per week would not have a car and would probably have to pay someone to drive him to a post office to collect his pension. This is a fact of life in rural Ireland and it is disingenuous of the Government to <Col N="271" /> suggest it is covering all aspects in its amendment.</P>
    <P>Our motion calls on the Government to persevere and maintain rural and local post offices and makes no reference to post offices doing good business. I take this opportunity to compliment An Post for the improvements in the postal service.  However, improvements cannot continue to be made at the expense of people in rural areas who need the services provided by their local post offices.</P>
    <P>This is far too serious a matter to call the salaries paid to postmasters and post-mistresses a joke, but a salary of £80 per week is not adequate and needs to be reconsidered.  I am sure these people would receive more than £80 per week in unemployment assistance.  The closure of post offices will not lead to a saving; rather it will lead to further expenditure.</P>
    <P>The services provided by rural post offices are a basic requirement of the old, poor and vulnerable in society.  I very much enjoyed Deputy Sheehan's contribution but I do not entirely agree that a postman is welcome even if he is delivering bills.  This may be okay on one or two occasions but if he continues to deliver bills and nothing else on a daily basis he will quickly wear out his welcome.  I agree that the postman's knock is a very welcome sound to old people living in isolated areas and that on occasion postmen have a cup of tea <Col N="272" /> and discuss the local news with them.  If local post offices are closed down, this aspect of rural life will be destroyed.</P>
    <P>Deputies will shortly have an opportunity to say whether they support the closure of rural and local post offices.  It is not good enough to say that the service is improving, welcome as that is.  As Deputy McManus said, in my constituency of Little Bray, old age pensioners have to queue in the rain for hours on end outside the post office.  This is not good enough in this day and age, and all in the interests of the auditor.  I intend putting to a vote the motion which calls on the Government to maintain, protect and refurbish rural and local post offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I also thank the Minister, Deputy Andrews, for coming in to respond.</P>
      <P>It was recently announced in the Defence Forces that interviews would take place for promotion from the rank of captain to that of commandant.  Promotional opportunities were restricted to the 51st cadet group who were commissioned on two separate dates, 1 December 1975 and 4 October 1976.  I believe there are 61 officers in that group.  The third potential officer class was commissioned on 14 June 1976 and I understand there are eight officers in that class who hold the rank of captain. Those eight men are excluded from participation in the present round of promotional interviews.  Are they being excluded simply because they have risen through the ranks to captain level rather than coming through the cadet school? If that is so I wonder who decided they should be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This exclusion is unjust when one considers the date on which those men were commissioned and the fact that <Col N="275" /> officers junior to them are allowed to participate in the competition for promotion. The decision is also unjust when one considers that many of the officers from the third potential officer class may be compelled to retire shortly if they remain in the rank of captain. This will have serious implications for those men and their families and will seriously affect their pension entitlements. If such treatment were contemplated in the private sector, not alone would it be regarded as unjust but there would be staff unrest and a walk out. The dedication, quality, commitment and experience of those officers is well known at every level of the Defence Forces and their exclusion from at least the possibility of promotion has sent waves of disbelief and disappointment throughout the force.  Morale has been seriously affected.</P>
    <P>The Gleeson report on the Defence Forces published in July 1990 refers specifically in paragraph 268 to the need to encourage NCOs to strive for promotion to the rank of officer.  It states that the commission would favour the introduction of appropriate inducements in relation to remuneration, postings and future promotional prospects aimed at encouraging the widest possible candidature among serving NCOs. The present action goes against the spirit of that recommendation and serves to discourage NCOs from bettering themselves.  I also refer the Minister to paragraphs 227 and 229 of the Gleeson report.  The men involved meet all the criteria recommended in those paragraphs. This again highlights the injustice being suffered by those officers.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to intervene in this debacle before it is too late.  Knowing his commitment to justice, I am confident he will intervene and ensure that justice prevails on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews) Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to tell the Deputy that I have good news for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter this evening, one in which <Col N="276" /> I have taken a personal interest.  I am fully abreast of all developments connected with it.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Gleeson report, published in 1990, in relation to promotions in the Permanent Defence Force was to the effect that there should be a move away from the previous seniority-based system to a meritocracy, a more open merit-based, competitive approach.  Given the radical nature of this recommendation, it was felt appropriate to introduce it in a gradual rather than in a sudden fashion into the Permanent Defence Force.  In relation to promotions at the level of captain or commandant, an agreement reached with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers &mdash; RACO &mdash; provided that captains of the then most senior cadet class, the 50th, together with other captains from earlier classes who had not been promoted with their own class, would be eligible to compete in a competition held in 1993.  This arrangement, which became known as preserving class integrity, worked satisfactorily in 1993 and was to be applied to the competition held this year.</P>
    <P>The preservation of class integrity in respect of the captain to commandant promotion competition this year became difficult to sustain when it emerged that a group of officers, not from the cadet stream but who had been commissioned from the ranks, had the same length of commissioned service and an equal length of service in the rank of captain as at least half the 51st cadet class.  The question of their admission to the competition was raised with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and I discussed it with RACO on 9 June this year.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the 3rd potential officers course group has a case, in justice, to be admitted to the 1994 captain to commandant promotion competition being held at present.  I am sustained in this view by legal advice I have received from the Attorney General.  Accordingly, I concluded some time ago that the 3rd potential officers course group <Col N="277" /> should be allowed to compete for promotion from captain to commandant in the current competition.  This has been made known to the representative association.</P>
    <P>Discussions are taking place under the auspices of the Defence Forces Conciliation Council with a view to advancing this matter.  I established a scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Defence Forces last year.  It is a comprehensive and sophisticated system and is the appropriate forum for dealing with issues such as this.</P>
    <P>I am aware of RACO's concern in relation to officers recruited in the large cadet classes of the mid-1970s who, in the nature of things, see their promotion prospects as being somewhat limited.  However, it will be possible to arrive at a future system of promotion at this level which will cater for the legitimate aspirations of captains for promotion to commandant while, at the same time, providing the Permanent Defence Force with access to a pool of talented officers of an appropriate age who will be required to fill appointments in higher ranks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bantry Bay is recognised as the capital of our mariculture industry in Ireland.  Though the promoters of this industry applied for licences to the Minister for the Marine as early as 1983, to date no designated licences have been issued by his Department. The mariculture industry in Bantry Bay has an output of 2,500 tonnes of mussels annually, with a capital investment of £5 million, providing employment to 85 people in a full-time capacity and 44 people in a part-time capacity. Almost all, 99 per cent, of the product produced in Bantry Bay is exported to France, Italy and other continental countries.  However, no licences have been issued by the Department of the Marine despite the fact that the Mussel Growers' Association in Bantry applied as far back as 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> It is of paramount importance that the Minister for the Marine gives immediate consideration to the issue of those licences because the industry in the south west Cork region needs to be properly managed.  Mussel farming is a new industry to Ireland and will be of enormous benefit to our economy.  As I said, the finished product is exported widely, to France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, Malta, Sweden and Portugal.  The production of mussels here has escalated from 1,950 tonnes in 1990 to 5,050 tonnes in 1993 with an unlimited capacity for expansion. The value of the product has now escalated to a figure of £4.5 million and provides employment to a vast number of people.</P>
    <P>Bantry mussel farmers first applied for licences to grow mussels in 1983, but although they advertised their application and complied with the requisite procedures, not a single mussel line has been licensed by the Minister's Department. This discourages investment, threatens capital grant assistance from the European Union and casts an air of illegality over the entire industry.</P>
    <P>Naturally recurring toxins in certain plankton eaten by mussels caused shellfish in the south-west to become mildly toxic during the summer months.  The Fishery Research Centre of the Department of the Marine has been responsible for such testing.  However, over the years the crude rat biopsy used by the Department of the Marine to determine toxin levels has proved highly inaccurate, resulting in the Fisheries Research Centre having to recommend closure for longer periods than would have been required if a more accurate test had been undertaken by the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The mussel industry urgently needs the replacement of this test with a more accurate one used in other European countries, the mouse biopsy and chemical analysis, which comprise the official tests in the countries to which our mussels are exported, principally France and Spain.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance to our <Col N="279" /> mussel industry that the Minister takes immediate steps to regularise this industry by issuing licences to those who applied for official mariculture licences around our coastline.  The Department has dragged its feet for far too long on this important issue.  After all, if the Minister for the Marine cannot get it right how can a major industry here get off the ground?</P>

      <P>I did not come &ldquo;armed&rdquo; with the type of information required by Deputy Sheehan, in the sense that I did not come specifically with information relating to Bantry Bay mussel farmers. Certainly the Deputy's allegations are extremely serious and I shall have to examine them in some considerable depth.  I will extract the Deputy's remarks from the Official Report and have them examined &mdash; if I may use a marine expression &mdash;&ldquo;in depth&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may briefly outline the policy objective of the licensing regime in the Department of the Marine in relation to aquacultural and maricultural development, which is to ensure that such developments take place in an orderly, well regulated manner, with full respect for other interests and in harmony with our environment while maximising the contribution of the industry to our economy in terms of jobs and revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with that objective, the Department is devoting considerable resources to meeting the licensed demand for aquacultural operations around the coast.  This is particularly so in the case of shellfish farming &mdash; as the Deputy quite properly pointed out &mdash; which is expanding rapidly to the benefit of our coastal communities.  A common philosophy, shared by the various political parties in this House, is we must ensure that our coastal communities which have been disadvantaged for <Col N="280" /> so long will be advantaged as far as is practicable.</P>
    <P>All applications for licences to engage in fish farming are subject to comprehensive evaluation by the Department's aquaculture licence vetting committee, a multidisciplinary advisory body, which brings together relevant expertise from within the Department and the Central Fisheries Board.  Applications are assessed from all technical, scientific and other relevant perspectives to determine the suitability of proposals. In addition, any new salmon farming project with a proposed annual output of more than 100 tonnes must comply with the requirements of the European Union Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment.  In all cases this evaluation process is further informed by public consultative procedures, including consultation with appropriate statutory bodies such as the regional fisheries boards, local authorities, the Wildlife Service, the Department of the Environment, Bord Fáilte and the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  Representations and comments received under this procedure are taken into account as part of the overall evaluation of applications. It is a very democratic, thorough, some might even say, tedious form of consultation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps other would please take note of my last remark.  My decisions, as the statutory authority, either for or against individual applications, will continue to be taken on the basis of the wide-ranging advice and <Col N="281" /> analysis derived from this evaluation and consultation system.</P>
      <P>My primary aim is to ensure the sustainable and well regulated development of the fish farming sector with full respect for the rights and interest of other users of the marine and fresh water resource.  I will continue to combine the need for a strategic view of the acknowledged economic contribution of aquaculture with the responsibility to take all relevant factors and interests into account.  With this objective in mind an intensive review of the existing planning-regulatory framework for aquaculture is at an advanced stage, which will determine the scope and need for improvement of the present licensing system.</P>
      <P>Reflecting the continued growth potential of aquaculture, particularly that of shellfish cultivation &mdash; which is what the Deputy has in mind &mdash; a substantial number of applications are with my Department and are being processed. Every effort is being made to expedite the assessment-evaluation processes and to bring licensing applications to finality.  The timescale and outcome of the decision-making processes inevitably varies in individual cases dependent on the technical considerations and specific local circumstances involved.  Each application is considered on its objective merits and processed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The very positive contribution of aquaculture to jobs and exports has been fully recognised under the <i>National Development Plan 1994-99</i> in that the planned investment under that programme has the potential to generate over 1,000 new jobs directly in the sector over that period.  A significant number of jobs will be created also in the added-value processing and marketing sectors.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputy Sheehan, who has a deep knowledge of the fisheries sector, that I will examine the matters he raised at the beginning of his contribution this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter this evening.  It concerns flooding at Whitehall Road, Shelton Drive and district in the Kimmage Road West area of Dublin.  I have been in correspondence with both Dublin Corporation and South Dublin County Council on this matter.  I received a reply on 13 June 1994 from the county engineer of South Dublin County Council which states:</P>
      <P>I refer to your letter dated 23 May 1994, to Mr. W. Soffe, Assistant City Manager, Dublin Corporation, regarding the above.  The letter has been passed to South Dublin County Council as the area referred to is within its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The sewers in Shelton Drive and Whitehall Road are combined sewers i.e. they drain both surface water run-off and foul effluent.  During periods of heavy rainfall there is not sufficient capacity in the sewerage system to accept the increased flows and consequently overflows occur, usually at the lowest points in the sewerage system. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the Rathmines/ Pembroke sewer into which the Whitehall Road area drains is also surcharged during heavy rainfall.  I understand Dublin Corporation are examining proposals to increase the capacity of this sewer but it is not likely that these will be implemented in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Drainage Maintenance Section of South Dublin County Council are very much aware of the problem in the Whitehall Road area and during heavy rainfall they have provided as <Col N="283" /> much assistance as possible to mitigate the effects of the flooding.</P>
    <P>The drainage design section have examined the flooding problems in the Whitehall Road area and have designed a scheme which will alleviate the problem. This scheme was submitted for approval to the Department of the Environment on the 16 May 1994 under the small schemes programme.  Under this programme the Department has indicated that it will fund small schemes up to 75 per cent of the capital cost or £75,000 which is the lesser.  The Department has not, as of yet, given grant approval to the scheme.</P>
    <P>That letter precisely sets out the problem &mdash; sewage and flooding.  People are finding sewage in their gardens a serious problem in an area which until 30 to 40 years ago following major housing development was a rural area.  The system is not able to take the off-flow of water and sewage.  On Kimmage Road West the sewers connect into the Dublin Corporation system and on into the Rathmines-Pembroke system.  The problem crosses the boundary of two authorities.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter with the Minister for the Environment on 11 October and received a reply which states, &ldquo;Given the primary rural orientation of the small schemes programme, it was not possible to include this scheme for financing from this source&rdquo;.  If the scheme is not financed from that source how can the problem be resolved?  It is a serious health problem.  I do not trouble the Minister often on Adjournment debates or raise matters on the Adjournment but I ask the Minister to agree to include this application under the scheme.  Its inclusion would not involve a great deal of money but it would solve problems for many people who live in the area and who are experiencing difficulties because of the sewage and flooding problems.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to give me good news this evening because he is the only hope for those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The area in question is predominantly urban, consisting of private residences dating from the late 1940s.  Out of a total of 550 or so houses, about 150 are drained by way of a combined sewer which collects both foul effluent and surface run-off from roads, roofs and paved areas.  This, in turn, discharges to Dublin Corporation's Rathmines-Pembroke sewer.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Mitchell has indicated, effluent spillage has occurred at a number of properties along the route of the combined sewer in the wake of sudden downpours or after periods of prolonged heavy rainstorms.  This problem is particularly associated with up to 20 houses which are located at points where the gradient in the sewer is poor. Sedimentation and lack of maintenance also contributes to reduced sewer flows, which in turn gives rise to surcharging which can result in flooding and effluent discharge at those properties where the cover level on house drains is lower than road surface or manhole levels.</P>
      <P>The Minister is mindful of the concern of local householders that every effort should be made to prevent a recurrence of these problems.  I understand that South Dublin County Council has, since the last flooding incident, undertaken a programme of sewer cleaning in the area and the condition of this sewer is now constantly monitored. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that while drainage works are designed and constructed to accommodate, as far as practicable, storm flows as well as dry weather flows, we can experience, from time to time, extremes of rainfall which can give rise to unwelcome and damage-causing flooding incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have ongoing programmes of maintenance and renewal of drainage and sewage collection systems. In general, they have sufficient powers and resources to respond to maintenance and renewal needs at local level without recourse to central Government for assistance.  In setting <Col N="285" /> priorities, the Minister has to be conscious of what is proper for central Government to fund and what can best be met from local initiative.</P>
    <P>My Department has, in the past, responded in a very positive way to the need for urban flood relief measures in Dublin and elsewhere.  Proposals from local authorities for flood relief measures are considered in the light of the financial arrangements for public water and sewerage schemes as provided for under my Department's water services programme.</P>
    <P>A key objective of this programme is to meet the drainage and waste water treatment needs of urban areas in order to support economic activity, meet residential needs and to protect public health and the environment.  The bulk of expenditure, including European Union aid as provided for under the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, is largely directed at meeting the water supply and sewerage needs of urban communities. The Minister is also keenly aware of the need to provide water and sewerage infrastructure outside the larger urban areas in order to meet the needs of agriculture and to support economic activity and the development of rural areas.  The small schemes programme, to which Deputy Mitchell refers, is largely directed at meeting these urgent needs, particularly in cases where public water and sewerage infrastructure is either non-existent or greatly inadequate. Only limited resources are available under this sub-programme and having regard to existing commitments and the demand of schemes already prioritised for investment, it is not possible to consider schemes such as this one for approval at this time.</P>
    <P>I am, however, concerned that incidents of this type can be avoided in future.  The maintenance and monitoring arrangements being put in place by the council can be expected to help prevent a recurrence of the problem. My Department will be in touch with South Dublin County Council with a view to devising a long term solution to <Col N="286" /> this and related sewer capacity problems.</P>

      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter this evening.  Without reflecting on the Minister of State, I regret that neither the Minister for Education nor her Minister of State are present to deal with this. This issue is of great concern to parents and students in the general locality of Glenamoy, Ballina, County Mayo, one of the most windswept areas in the country.  It arises because of the desire of parents to have a choice in selecting a school for their children.  Students also like to have a choice in the matter. Some students from that area attend the local college, a very fine all Irish college in Rossport.  Others decide to attend the schools in Ballycastle or Lacken Cross 15 and 22 miles away, respectively. Others decide to attend Belmullet vocational school and Belmullet Convent.</P>
      <P>The problem is an issue right around the country and cannot be sorted out without ministerial intervention.  I am aware that the Department of Education would be loath to change this because it would create a precedent. Without going into detail, there are three families from the one village going in different directions.  It is not possible to sort this out in the Chamber this evening so I am requesting the Minister, first, to meet with a delegation from the Glenamoy area to discuss this; second, to amend the transport scheme to allow for catchment boundary transport to the school of their choice for the families and to do that in the context of the existing schemes as an exceptional measure.  Otherwise, nothing beneficial will result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> Some students are receiving day passes to travel to Lacken Cross and Ballycastle schools in the morning but have no transport home in the evening. The distances in questions are 15 and 22 miles respectively.  If ministerial intervention is not resorted to, this problem will not be sorted out.  I cite the precedent of what happened in the Kilcoole area where arrangements were eventually arrived at the incidence where, for the last 20 years and perfectly legitimately, transport has been provided from within 100 yards of Cornamona school to Ballinrobe community school.  These cases are ones I dealt with myself a number of years ago as Minister of State.  I know these matters can be sorted out and how that can be done.  I therefore ask the Minister, through the Minister of State, to meet the delegation and allow for an amendment of the transport scheme to cater for existing students in one of the most barren and windswept areas of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>We are almost into the depths of winter and still there is no sign of an end to the intolerable Glenamoy, County Mayo, school bus dispute.  Does anybody care about these unfortunate pupils and their worried parents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schools affected are Our Lady's Convent of Mercy, Belmullet, the Convent of Mercy secondary school, Ballycastle and Lacken Cross vocational school.  Fifteen students, all from the Glenamoy area, have been severely inconvenienced by a change in Bus Éireann's pick-up arrangements.  Only this evening I spoke to one harassed mother who told me her child leaves for school at 7.45 a.m. and arrives home at 6.15 p.m.  The craziness of this is underlined by the fact that a local bus driver passes these children on the road every morning but has been instructed not to pick them up.  It is not fair that these children should have to go to school soaking wet and study all day in drenched clothes.  If it happened in <Col N="288" /> Dublin or in the Minister's own constituency, there would be a terrible outcry.</P>
    <P>This is a simple problem and it can be resolved.  No precedent will be set.  What these people are looking for is something they had for the last 20 years, an arrangement whereby they were picked up at the pick up point.  This was changed only this year.  I hope the Minister will tell me why that was done and why these 15 students and their parents are suffering.  The children are suffering because they are not going to school and that is not in their interests.  I hope the Minister will have good news for us tonight.  If not, the parents of these pupils will have to go to Ballina to picket Bus Éireann and they will be here next week in a deputation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny has requested a meeting. I am disappointed that neither the senior Minister nor the junior Minister is in the House to answer this case and it is left to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to do this very unpleasant job. It is wrong that they did not attend.  I wrote and faxed on three different occasions requesting that both the senior Minister and the junior Minister meet with Deputies Kenny, Hughes and myself and the parents' representative.  I did not succeed in getting the Minister's agreement to meet such a deputation.</P>
    <P>These people are not asking for any more than a return to last year's arrangements.  As Deputy Kenny said, the distances involved are 15 and 20 miles respectively.  One father has to bring his children five and a half miles to the pick-up point.  A return to the original arrangement would mean he would have to bring the children nearly three miles.  I ask the Minister to be sympathetic to this case.  Major things are happening all over the country.  This is only a small problem in a small place in the west.  I hope the Minister will give us good news tonight.</P>

      <P>The main policy aim of the school transport scheme is to facilitate equality of access to primary and post-primary education by providing transport to enable children who might otherwise have difficulty in doing so to attend school regularly.  Because of cost implications, the most that can be provided is a basic service.  There are no aspirations or claims to anything other than that.</P>
      <P>The post-primary transport scheme is organised, in the first instance, by the transport liaison officer, who is the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee of the county, in co-operation with the school authorities and Bus Éireann.  The Department does not make detailed arrangements.  This is the responsibility of the transport liaison officers, in conjunction with Bus Éireann.</P>
      <P>I should explain that, for the purposes of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary education centre.  In order to be eligible for transport, pupils must live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they are based.</P>
      <P>Pupils who are eligible for transport to the appropriate schools in their catchment area, but who wish to attend a school outside it, may be allowed transport only from the catchment boundary of the school attended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Catchment boundary transport may be allowed, provided that there is room, after all eligible children have been accommodated and that no extra cost is incurred, either by way of an additional or larger bus, or an extension of the route.  In the organisation of school <Col N="290" /> transport services, all routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of time-table and distance from the route, while, at the same time, ensuring that all vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner.</P>
    <P>In this case, the parents of the children in question chose, as is their prerogative, to send their children to school outside their catchment area.  They qualify, therefore, for catchment boundary transport only, subject to the conditions I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Each year, during the school summer holidays, Bus Éireann is obliged to revise its routes and services to make provision for population trends, and in accordance with the Department's direction to provide a cost-effective school transport service.</P>
    <P>I repeat that catchment boundary pupils, that is, pupils from outside the catchment boundary, may be carried after all fully eligible pupils have been accommodated, provided there is still room for them on the bus of an existing service and that no extra cost is incurred through carrying them.</P>
    <P>After all normal reorganisation of services in County Mayo was completed this year, the position was that there was a shortage of seats for catchment boundary pupils.  Seven of these were going in one direction to Belmullet and seven more in the opposite direction to schools in Ballycastle and Lacken Cross. None of these pupils lives in the catchment area of the school they attend and they are, therefore, entitled to catchment boundary transport only.</P>
    <P>When, on 12 September, the final arrangements were being put in place in County Mayo, extra provision had to be made for fully eligible pupils in the Bangor Erris-Ballycroy area and there were ten seats left over.  Seven of these were offered to the parents of the pupils going to Belmullet.  The parents refused to accept the seats.</P>
    <P>The seven pupils attending the Ballycastle and Lacken schools were offered <Col N="291" /> seats on a national school bus in the morning, but these parents also refused this offer.  In each case, they would have to travel a longer distance to a pick-up point than last year.</P>
    <P>Claims have been made that the catchment areas for the three schools have been changed and catchment boundaries moved.  This is not the case.</P>
    <P>Pick-up points have had to be changed for two reasons.  One is to suit the needs of the eligible pupils, who take precedence.  I would like to draw the House's attention to the fact that children from three families in the one townland are attending three separate post-primary centres.  Only one of them is going to the centre in her own catchment area, Rossport.  Second, previous pick-up points &mdash; Aughoosse Cross and Shrahnaploya &mdash; were both inside Rossport catchment area.  By picking up children at these points, the bus had been encroaching into that catchment area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> I come from a remote rural area and I fully understand the exigencies of the school transport system.  I listened with great interest to what Deputies Kenny and Ring said &mdash; Deputy Hughes has also spoke about this matter &mdash; and I have the utmost sympathy with their problem.  I understand that people are frustrated when their children are late home in the evening while a bus passes them and cannot take them home.  We must utilise the vehicles and have flexibility while maintaining the integrity of the service.  Based on what has been said tonight, I will recommend to my ministerial colleges that if at all possible they should meet a deputation and try to resolve the matter to everybody's satisfaction.</P>

      <P>On 10 October, I received the report of the consortium of consultants, Stokes Kennedy Crowley Corporate Finance Limited, N. M. Rothschild &amp; Son Limited, and William Fry, whom I appointed to advise me on the available options in respect of ACC Bank, ICC Bank, and TSB Bank in the context of Government policy for the banking sector and An Post and in the light of a recommendation from the Trustees of TSB Bank which envisages the disposal of the State's interest in TSB Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report, based on a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the options and on extensive consultations with <Col N="122" /> interested parties, will be a significant contribution to the Government's deliberations on how best to achieve its objectives in relation to the development of the banking sector.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to publish this report, as to do so would release into the public domain confidential and commercially sensitive information concerning not only the State banks but also other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I am at present examining the report and expect to be in a position to put the matter before Government at an early date.  As I indicated on two occasions last week.  I cannot make any comment on the matter until the Government has had the opportunity to consider it in detail nor can I divulge particulars of the positions of interested parties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 47 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The net income for an employed married man, with a non-working spouse and four children, earning gross incomes at £1,000 intervals between £8,000 and £15,000 per annum is given in a tabular form and is being circulated to Deputies.  This table also sets out the additions to and deductions from gross income in arriving at levels of net income.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that an unemployed married man with four children would have a net income of £7,636 per annum when account is taken of all allowances, including secondary benefits, medical card, and the costs of local authority differential rent and work-seeking.  When this is compared with the information in the table it is clear that at all gross incomes between £8,000 and £15,000 this man is better off in work rather than on unemployment.  Indeed the married man described would be better off in work at any level of earnings from employment when his earning and Family Income Supplement are taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government recognises that adjusting the tax and welfare systems to improve the operation of the labour market is an important policy objective. <Col N="125" /> In recognition of the considerable complexities involved, the Government has set up a working group of experts in the tax and social welfare area to look at these issues with a view to developing a strategic approach to the closer integration of the tax and social welfare <Col N="126" /> systems.  The group submitted an interim report to the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare in December 1993.  The Government is awaiting the group's final report which it expects to receive in the first half of 1995.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Notes on Table:</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  The main factors contributing to the apparent decline in net income as gross income increases are the withdrawal rate of Family Income Supplement (60 per cent) and the operation of marginal relief for income tax (involving 40 per cent tax rate).</P>
    <P>2.  It is essential in interpreting this table that the mechanism for reviewing Family Income Supplement (FIS) is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 1 2 monthly basis.  Once awarded it will <i>not</i> be reduced/withdrawn until the end of the period regardless of any upward movements in pay.  Theref ore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while any adjustment of FIS will not occur until after the e d of the year.  The Expert Working Group has pointed out in its interim report that FIS withdrawal does not generally occur at the same times as a gro ss pay increase.</P>
    <P>3.  The numbers of people who potentially lose disposable income as gross pay increases are small.  In so far as FIS and marginal relief income tax ar e the main elements of the trap, the number of people affected by the trap is essentially a function of the numbers who both receive FIS and pay tax. The numbers of people both paying tax and receiving FIS is of the order of 1,500 to 2,000.  The OECD has also concluded that this situation potential ly &ldquo;applied only to a very small proportion of the employee workforce (0.75 per cent)&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 36 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of recent criticisms of the role of the Bretton Wood institutions. In fact, before attending the recent annual meetings of the institutions I met members of Irish non-government organisations and heard their criticisms first hand.  Indeed, I have met the NGOs on several occasions in the last 12 months and am well aware of their concerns.  I am concerned myself at the negative view of the role played by the Bretton Wood institutions which is held by the voluntary development agencies.</P>
      <P>I see two issues here.  There is clearly a problem of perception but there is also the issue of the impact on developing countries of the operations of the organisations in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, there is a need to reverse negative perceptions.  Both institutions need to improve their liaison <Col N="130" /> with NGOs, internally and internationally. Closer co-operation would not only increase transparency and local participation but would also ensure more effective action on the ground to help the billion people worldwide who are living in poverty.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the institutions themselves accept that previous programmes have not always served the needs of the poor. I have heard some highly critical comments concerning the impact of the institutions' activities on the poorest people in the developing world.  There is a need to address that situation in a meaningful way.  There has been a welcome willingness of late on the part of the multilateral organisation to learn from past experience and from their interaction with their clients, their shareholders and other organisations active in development, including the NGOs.  For instance, in pursuit of its over-riding objective of poverty reduction, the World Bank is devoting more of its lending to education, health and social development.  In this process, and indeed, in all its lending operations, it is putting particular emphasis on borrower ownership of projects and on the participation of stake-holders in development initiatives which affect them.  Moreover, the Bank has responded to criticism of its lack of transparency by making available to the public many documents which heretofore had been confidential and by setting up an independent inspection panel to investigate public complaints about its operations.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that the structural adjustment process must put people first while still getting the required reforms.  Basic human needs to be paramount with local people participating fully in the process of designing and implementing projects and programmes. Access by all to basic health care and primary education must be ensured along with proper protection for the most vulnerable and marginal groups.  There has also to be a thorough evaluation of the actual effectiveness of such provisions in promoting human <Col N="131" /> well-being.  At the same time, I appreciate the importance of building a development strategy on sound and stable macroeconomic policy.</P>
    <P>Poverty reduction remains the benchmark for measuring the performance of the World Bank.  The Bank's fundamental objective is to support the reduction of poverty in its member countries.  I welcome the targeting of programmes at poverty relief and the explicit commitment to ensure access to health and education, promote the role of women in development and provide effective, comprehensive and carefully monitored social safety nets.</P>
    <P>The Irish representatives in the institutions are well aware of my views. They have supported the changes being made by the institutions to make their activities more effective and also helping the developing countries cope better with the problems of poverty and deprivation.</P>
    <P>Turning to the debt question, I addressed the joint annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on Tuesday, 4 October 1994, in my capacity as Governor for Ireland.  I drew attention to the ongoing problem of debt in the developing world.  I referred to my call last year for the implementation of the Trinidad terms for Africa and other poor developing countries.  These terms involve, among other things, the write-off of two thirds of the debt of the low income developing countries.  They do not cover debt owed by these countries to the multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, IMF and the Regional Developments Banks.  Progress has been made on this issue in the last number of months, but I, nevertheless, stated at this year's meeting that there is now a need to press on beyond the Trinidad terms.</P>
    <P>I told the annual meeting that as the problems of bilateral public and private debt became more manageable attention was now focusing more on the remaining indebtedness to multilateral institutions.  It is clear to me that the <Col N="132" /> measures taken up to now do not go far enough in addressing the debt problems of the most severely indebted poorest countries, especially in Africa.  At a minimum, I consider that there needs to be a further major increase in concessional financing to countries within this group which are making serious efforts to develop their economies yet still find themselves caught in a debt trap.</P>
    <P>Both governments and non-government organisations are calling for further initiatives in this area, including the sale of gold reserves.  I said at the meeting that I would be happy to support measures which would help the poorest and maintain the effectiveness of the institutions in the development process.</P>

      <Quest>if there will be a current Budget surplus in the Exchequer accounts for 1994 in view of the likelihood that surplus tax receipts exceed the target current Budget deficit of £269 million on the basis of independent forecasts.</Quest>

      <P>As I indicated in the press statement which accompanied the release of the Exchequer returns for end-September, tax receipts and the current budget continue to benefit from favourable timing factors, mainly relating to the tax amnesties.  Nonetheless, a buoyant performance by virtually all tax heads is pointing to a very healthy outturn surplus of tax receipts over initial estimates for the full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent to which the tax surplus will reduce the current budget deficit below the initial target is obviously a function not only of the size of the surplus itself, but also of the performance of the other relevant components &mdash; non-tax revenue and current expenditure &mdash;<i>vis-à-vis</i> their targets.  While I expect that the outturn will be reduced by a significant margin below the initial <Col N="133" /> forecast at this stage, I do not envisage that the current deficit will be eliminated this year.</P>

      <P>I wish to take Questions Nos. 45 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The designations recognise the importance of these areas for conservation purposes.  The proposed designations place no formal conditions on these areas.  It is intended to protect them by obtaining the co-operation and goodwill of landowners and farmers. Farmers are asked not to engage in developments or activities which will damage these areas.  It is EU and Government policy not to grant-aid environmentally damaging developments. Planning authorities will be asked not to approve damaging developments. There is no question of compensation being paid as there is no compulsion on landowners but a top-up payment of 20 per cent is available to farmers under the REPS, if any of their land is within an NHA.</P>
      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service has met with the farming and conservation organisations and discussed the designation process with them. Their views have been noted and taken into consideration and their assistance throughout the project is appreciated.</P>
      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service Rangers have contacted a number of farmers directly while assessing sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers will not be consulted in advance of designation of sites.  NHA sites are selected on scientific grounds <Col N="137" /> on the basis of their importance for conservation. If landowners are concerned that a site should not be designated, they should approach their local Wildlife Officer in the first instance.  If there is still disagreement, the landowner may submit a formal appeal.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question is prompted by the Exchequer returns to end-September 1994, which indicated that income tax receipts totalled £2,887.7 million in 1994 compared to £2,575.5 million over the first nine <Col N="138" /> months of 1993.  That represents a year-on-year increase of 12.1 per cent.</P>
      <P>The 1994 income tax receipts shown in the returns include some £220 million attributable to the tax amnesties.  This has to be excluded in any consideration of the trend in the burden of income tax.  On that basis, cumulative Income Tax to end-September 1994 was £2,667.4 million, or 3.6 per cent ahead of the same period in 1993.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to allocate the 3.6 per cent margin into the components mentioned by the Deputy.  While there is undeniably an indirect influence, neither inflation nor economic growth would be direct determinants of income tax yield.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All residential property payments for 1994 have not as yet been processed in full.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that subject to this, the largest single payment received up to 10 October 1994 in respect of the current <Col N="141" /> year's residential property tax liability was £33,700.  In view of the proximity of the due date &mdash; 1 October &mdash; a breakdown of the yield by category of payment is not as yet available.</P>
    <P>The self-assessment nature of residential property tax requires the householder to submit a value in respect of his or her residential property.  In the case of property valued below £100,000 a &ldquo;banding&rdquo; system is in operation.  It is the experience of the Revenue Commissioners that such self-assessment values are in general correct.  It should be emphasised however that, as with any self-assessment tax, residential property tax returns are subject to audit. This audit activity is greatly facilitated by the existence of a clearance scheme in respect of sales of residential property. Experience of the operation of the clearance scheme indicates a high level of compliance on the part of those with a liability to the tax.</P>

      <P>The present position is that investment intermediaries are regulated by the Department of Enterprise and Employment under the Insurance Act, 1989 in so far as they deal in insurance products, while the legislation governing Stock Exchange members is being updated in the Stock Exchange Bill, 1994, currently before the House.  These measures provide protection against the establishment of unauthorised investment intermediaries in the areas they cover.  Legislation to cover investment intermediaries in other areas is at present being prepared by my Department in consultation with the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise and Employment: this legislation will fulfil obligations under the EU Investment Services Directive, which requires that all member states have structures in place by 1 July 1995 to regulate investment intermediaries.</P>

      <P>To date the Government has provided IR£2 million from Ireland's Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund for the international humanitarian relief effort in Bosnia.  Most of this assistance, IR£1.6 million, has been channelled through the UN system particularly through the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) which is the lead agency for the international relief effort in the region.  A small amount of money has also been made available to Irish NGOs of which £132,000 was earmarked for a Rape Crisis Centre counselling project in Croatia with the balance going to relief projects in Sarajevo and in Mostar.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department visited Croatia and Bosnia in April of this year to assess the political and humanitarian situation there.  They had discussions with the Croatian and Bosnian authorities and with the main aid agencies including UNHCR and the UN peace-keeping force in former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR).  One of the main issues discussed was the question of access for relief to affected areas.</P>
      <P>The conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina has highlighted once again the difficulties of delivering humanitarian assistance in a conflict situation.  I am satisfied that the UN operation has sought to be fair in the distribution of aid to victims on all sides of the conflict in the region.  Assistance has been delivered in accordance with the principles of humanity, neutrality, and impartiality as set out in UN Resolution 46/182 of December 1991.  Ireland fully supports the efforts of the UNHCR and UNPROFOR to ensure the effective, impartial delivery of emergency aid.</P>

      <P>During the course of my recent visit to Beijing, I had the opportunity to discuss the application from the People's Republic of China for re-entry to GATT with the Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.  I informed him that Ireland and its European Union partners welcomed China's application for membership of GATT and the new World Trade Organisation and looked forward to a successful outcome to the negotiations currently taking place in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Ireland also welcomes the application from Taiwan for membership of GATT. We support the approach adopted by the GATT Council in September 1992 to the effect that the working parties negotiating the terms and conditions of membership for China and Taiwan should process both applications in parallel and report back to the Council expeditiously.  It was agreed that the GATT council would examine the China working party report and adopt the Protocol for the People's Republic of China before examining the report and adopting the Protocol on Taiwan. Work on the applications has been progressing in Geneva and it is hoped that they will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The proposed accession of both China and Taiwan to GATT and the new World Trade Organisation is welcomed by the European Union and by Ireland.  Given the potential of China as a trading partner and the importance of Taiwan in international trade, it is desirable that they should both be bound by GATT rules regulating world trade.</P>

    <P>(2) The sectors are as set out in the National Development Plan.  The Operational Programmes will cover broadly the same areas.  However, human resources measures for the various sectors which for most sectors in the plan were shown under the human resources heading rather than the relevant sectoral heading will be included in the relevant sectoral operational programme e.g. tourism training is shown under human resources in the heading above but is included under the tourism operational programme.  There may be some differences in the definition of categories between the plan and the CSF but these are not significant.</P>
    <P>(3) In the plan human resources measures relating to local development were shown under local development.  In this table they are shown under the human resources category in line with the other sectors.</P>
    <P>(4) These figures include the cohesion Fund aid and grant aid under the European Economic Area Financial Mechanism.  These are not governed by the Community Support Framework but by separate administrative procedures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> It should be noted that the figures set out in the table above include EU Structural and Cohesion Fund aid (excluding Community Initiatives), eligible Exchequer expenditure (both co-financed and unco-financed), eligible non-Exchequer public expenditure (both co-financed and unco-financed), private sector matching finance and associated private sector finance.  The pro-rata reduction applied by Government to deal with the shortfall of EU Structural Funds aid applied to the combined Exchequer and EU aid allocation excluding Cohesion Fund expenditure. Any consequential effects on non-Exchequer public and private sector expenditure varied by sector.</P>

      <P>In 1991 the aggregate town population was 2,010,700 or 57 per cent of the total and the aggregate rural population was 1,515,019 or 43 per cent of the total.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to balanced regional development in Ireland and this commitment is fully reflected in the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> which sets out the country's main development priorities over this period.  While the plan is based on national sectoral objectives, maintaining an appropriate regional balance was at all times a central underlying consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparing the National Development Plan, the Government invited each of the sub-Regional Review Committees around the country to make detailed submissions setting out its recommendations concerning a development strategy and the priority <Col N="150" /> measures to implement that strategy for its sub-region.  In the plan the Government has responded to these initiatives to the extent that they are consistent with the overall national objectives of maximising sustainable growth and employment within the constraints of the resources available.</P>
    <P>The commitment to rural development was recognised in the agreed <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which stated, and I quote, that &ldquo;the National Development Plan's overall strategy aimed at increasing economic growth, improving infrastructure, developing skills and placing an increased emphasis on harnessing local community leadership and local initiative will have an important impact on the rural economy and the regions within which the various rural areas are situated&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the fact that the plan and the Community Support Framework 1994-1999 which has now been agreed with the Commission places a major and expanded role on local development.  The CSF states that this, and I quote &ldquo;reflects the need to mobilise the energies of individuals and communities throughout the country and a recognition of the potential for development which can be released by doing so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In addition to the Community Support Framework, EU assistance from the Community Initiatives will make an important contribution to regional and rural development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty on European Union sets out the timescale for a move to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).  Briefly, it provides that the European Council will meet before 31 December 1996 to decide whether a majority of the member states fulfil the criteria for adoption of a single currency and whether it is appropriate to begin the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union, and, if so, to set the date for it to begin.  If by the end of 1997 no date has been set, the third stage will begin on 1 January 1999, and the European Council will meet before 1 July 1998 to confirm which member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present ten member states, excluding Ireland and Luxembourg, have been judged by the European Commission and the ECOFIN Council to have excessive deficits and so not to meet the Treaty criteria.  Accordingly, sufficient progress may well not have been made to allow Economic and Monetary Union to begin in 1997.  Although the situation is likely to improve as Europe emerges from recession, it is too early at this stage to make a prediction either about the likely starting-date for Economic <Col N="152" /> and Monetary Union or about which member states will qualify for participation.</P>
    <P>Ireland's policy has been, and continues to be, to support the realisation of Economic and Monetary Union because of the benefits it will bring to member states and citizens.  Our fiscal and other policies are geared to ensuring that we continue to meet the Treaty criteria so that we will be in a position to join Economic and Monetary Union from the beginning, whenever it is formed. The Programme for a Partnership Government and our recent Convergence Programme 1994-1999 set out the Government's determination to continue to meet the Treaty criteria.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom has yet to make a decision on whether or not to join Economic and Monetary Union.  A decision by the UK to stay out of Economic and Monetary Union would not present significant difficulties for trade with the UK unless Sterling were to weaken sharply.</P>
    <P>Such a development in the currency of any major trading partner would obviously pose a problem of competitiveness. The potential for such an eventuality in relation to Sterling has been with us since we joined the ERM in 1979 and it will remain a feature of the situation unless and until the UK becomes a member of Economic and Monetary Union, although clearly Economic and Monetary Union would deprive us of one possible response, namely to adjust our exchange rate.</P>
    <P>At the same time, membership of Economic and Monetary Union would carry advantages on a wider front for Ireland, because it would eliminate exchange-rate risk and currency transaction costs for trade between participating countries and because Economic and Monetary Union should provide an environment of reliably low interest rates and inflation.</P>

      <P>To qualify for a deserted wife's benefit a claimant must satisfy a number of conditions.  One condition is that the claimant's husband must have left her voluntarily or that she had to leave him.</P>
      <P>The person concerned married in August 1985 and separated from her husband shortly after marriage.  She later returned to her husband but left him in June 1986 and has not lived with him since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> A claim for deserted wife's benefit was made in 1988.  This claim was disallowed on the grounds that the husband did not leave her of his own volition. The person concerned appealed against the deciding officers's decision.</P>
    <P>Following an oral hearing of the appeal and having considered all the facts the independent appeals officer ruled that she did not qualify for a deserted wife's benefit because she was not a deserted wife within the meaning of section 195 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 in that her husband did not leave her of his own volition.  For constructive desertion to be proved it has to be established that the wife was forced to leave the family home.</P>
    <P>The decision of an appeals officer is final and may only be revised in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.  It may also be revised by the chief appeals officer if it appears that the decision was erroneous by reasons of some mistake having been made in relation to the law or facts.  Following representations from the Deputy the chief appeals officer reviewed the appeal.  He considered that the appeals officer had properly addressed himself to the issue before him and had taken the full circumstances of the case into account in arriving at his decision that the person concerned was not a deserted wife within the meaning of the social welfare legislation. In the circumstances, he considered that a revision of that decision is not warranted.</P>

      <P>Where a redundancy, as defined in the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-91 takes place, an eligible employee must be given notice in writing of the proposed dismissal. Form RP1 must be used for this purpose. A duplicate copy of the notice, fully completed, must be sent to my Department at the same time as it is given to the employee.  These are legal requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts, responsibility for the payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum entitlement rests in the first instance with the employer/liquidator.  Accordingly, if the person concerned is made redundant and considers that he is entitled to a statutory redundancy payment he should approach his former employer/liquidator with a view to obtaining this entitlement.  If the former employer/liquidator refuses or fails to make the payment within a reasonable time, the employee can then apply to my Department for payment from the social insurance fund.  Such an application must be supported by evidence of <Col N="157" /> entitlement to a redundancy lump sum either in the form of a redundancy certificate (Form RP2) issued by the former employer/liquidator or, where entitlement is contested by the former employer/liquidator, a decision from the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the employee's favour.</P>
    <P>The statutory redundancy lump sum to which an eligible employee is entitled is based on age, length of service in the employment and gross weekly pay at the time of the redundancy.</P>

      <P>Following discussions between relevant Departments, a letter of clarification was issued by my Department to County Enterprise Boards which indicated that people who qualify for the Social Welfare Back to Work scheme should not also qualify for employment grants from the County Enterprise Fund.  This applies to promoters who are self employed and claiming the allowance in respect of their own job or in respect of employees who are in receipt of the Social Welfare allowance.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>if he intends to take any action to deal with some of the serious difficulties for labour intensive industries, particularly sectors employing a high percentage of young people, in the context of the completion of the GATT Agreement and general difficulties being experienced in the textile industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The GATT Uruguay Round Agreement is the biggest trade agreement ever concluded in the history of world trade.  It will create confidence and buoyancy in the world economy and lead to significant opportunities for investment and development of exports.</P>
      <P>The Irish manufacturing and traded services sectors will gain substantially in terms of output and employment from the increasingly liberalised international trading system arising from the Agreement. A consultancy study commissioned by the Department of Tourism and Trade concluded that the Irish economy stood to directly gain in excess of 20,000 jobs from a GATT Agreement.</P>
      <P>Some sectors such as clothing and textiles, may experience difficulties but I would point out that during the negotiations particular attention was paid to the sensitivity of these sectors for Ireland.  The objective was to ensure that the Multi-Fibre Arrangements (MFA) would be gradually integrated into GATT and that this would be linked to a strengthening of GATT rules and disciplines.  This has been largely achieved.  A ten year transition period has been agreed and this will allow the clothing and textile sectors time to restructure and re-position in order to concentrate on the higher quality segment of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two special initiatives in the R&amp;D are training areas were introduced in order to help companies in this regard and enable them to become more competitive. Under the 1994 budget a number of provisions such as reduced employers' PRSI, removal of levies and widening of tax bands were introduced. In addition the wide range of incentives under the Industry Operational Programme and Community Initiatives which are specifically geared towards improving the competitiveness of Irish industry are available to all sectors <Col N="159" /> including clothing and textiles.  The combination of all these measures should provide the necessary impetus for the maintenance of employment and indeed the development of both sectors.</P>

      <P>Grant allocations totalling £106.4 million have been made to local authorities in 1994 for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads. Details of the allocations notified to individual authorities in February and May 1994 are set out in the reply to Question No. 72 of 24 May, 1994.  These allocations include £33.6 million under the EU co-financed scheme of specific improvement grants for non-national roads, which, although paid initially from the Exchequer, are expected to qualify for EU aid at the rate of 50 per cent.  The allocations made in May 1994 to individual local authorities under the EU co-financed scheme are set out in the accompanying table.</P>

    <P>A provision of £194.787 million is included in the Department's Vote this year for the maintenance and improvement of national roads.

      <P>In its report dated 31 July 1990, the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission) recommended that the military service allowance (MSA) should be made pensionable. On foot of this recommendation, an addition to Defence Forces pensions in respect of MSA was introduced and applies, subject to certain conditions, to personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990, i.e. the day following publication of the Commission's report.</P>
      <P>Military service allowance has been reckoned in the calculation of the pensions of all qualified retired personnel. The estimated cost of extending this measure to pensioners who retired prior to 1 August 1990 would be in excess of £4 million a year.  Having regard to established superannuation practice in other areas of the public service, and the cost involved, it is regretted that the extension of the measure to other retired personnel cannot be undertaken.</P>

      <P>During 1992, a geographiclly-based national survey, which will run over several years, was initiated by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  Radon measurements will be made in over 6,000 homes nationwide and statistical evaluation of the results will allow the percentage of houses above 200 Bq/m³ reference level in each national grid square to be predicted.  All measurements are for a 12 month period and, once completed, will identify any areas at particular risk from indoor radon.</P>
      <P>In the course of this survey, measurements have been carried out in 139 houses in County Cavan and 90 houses in County Monaghan.  The analysis has not yet been completed for the Cavan and Monaghan results.  However, preliminary results indicate that seven houses, 5 per cent, in Cavan and four houses, 4 per cent, in Monaghan had radon concentrations above the reference level.  The incidence of houses with radon concentrations above the reference level does not differ greatly from the estimated national average of 4 per cent.</P>

Encoding of channels is a standard practice of MMDS companies, and has the advantages of reducing interference to other frequency users and the risk of illegal theft of signal, thus helping to keep costs and prices down.  I understand that there will be a damage deposit of £25 per decoder.</P>

In this regard I have already indicated to the Deputy that I am in consultation with the managerial authorities in order to put in place a structure for dealing in an orderly and transparent way with the various issues which arise when a school ceases to be used for national school purposes in advance of the expiry of the lease.  The duration of the lease is normally 99 years.</P>
      <P>The number and proportion of schools in respect of which leases have now lapsed or expired is not readily available in my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which her Department is implementing the January 1991, EC Directive on Recognition of Diplomas in respect of teachers qualifications; if teachers from Northern Ireland, Britain and other EU States are recognised as teachers in our primary or post-primary schools; and where decisions as to recognition are made.</Quest>

      <P>The EU Directive 89/48/EEC on a general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration was transposed into Irish law in January 1991 under Statutory Instrument 1 of 1991.</P>
      <P>The Directive does not refer specifically to the recognition of teachers qualifications or any other professional qualifications.  Consequently the Statutory Instrument lists the professions the admission to which is regulated here. Teachers are included in the list of regulated professions.</P>
      <P>The Statutory Instrument also specifies that qualified teachers from any EU member state who wish to apply for recognition for the purposes of teaching in primary, community, comprehensive or vocational schools should apply directly to the Department of Education. Those wishing to apply for recognition as a teacher or lecturer in a Regional or Technological college should also apply to the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Those wishing to apply for recognition as registered secondary school teachers should apply to the Secondary Teachers Registration Council c/o the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>My Department fully grant aids the provision of a site and permanent accommodation for All-Irish primary schools where such schools have been given permanent recognition and where no alternative permanent accommodation is available for those schools.  A standard lease for these schools has not yet been developed and accordingly the site and property remain for the present in the full ownership of the State.</P>
      <P>Denominational and other schools at primary level provide the site for the school building and the relevant local contribution towards the school structure. The State's interest in such schools is safeguarded under the terms of a standard lease to which the Minister for Education is a party.</P>
      <P>All vocational education committee schools including All-Irish Schools under their control are owned by the Vocational Educational Committees in accordance with the Vocational Education Act 1930 and receive the same level of State funding.  Similarly, recognised All-Irish Secondary Schools received capital grants in the same way as mainstream secondary schools.  All community and comprehensive schools are provided by the State and are vested in trustees under a standard Deed of Trust/Indenture.  This provides for reversion to the Minister on expiry of the term of the lease or on the school ceasing to operate.</P>

      <P>In May, 1993 my Department confirmed to Westmeath County Council that the grant of £1.5 million, which had been originally allocated in 1988 for a multi purpose indoor sports complex, was available for the provision of a new swimming pool in Athlone.</P>
      <P>This grant was allocated under my Department's major sports facilities programme and the terms and conditions, which apply to all such Exchequer funded capital projects, were notified to Westmeath County Council. These conditions included requirements in respect of the appointment of consultants, tendering, contract arrangements, management and operation of the completed facility.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the appointment of a design team were submitted by Athlone UDC, as client for the swimming pool project, in September 1993.  These proposals, taken in conjunction with another design team proposal submitted by Westmeath County Council for the original project, raised a number of complex legal issues, including the question as to whether a contract existed for the design of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal advice on these issues, which was received by my Department in June 1994 has been the subject of correspondence and meetings between my <Col N="183" /> Department, Westmeath County Council and Athlone UDC.  It is expected that the question of my Department sanctioning the appointment of a particular design team for this project will be finalised shortly.  As the legal issues involved in this matter are not yet finalised it would not be appropriate at this stage to indicate the design teams involved.</P>
