      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3 inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Prime Minister and I had an informal meeting in London on Thursday last, principally to review recent political and security developments relating to Northern Ireland.  The meeting was very useful, serving to demonstrate yet again the firm determination of the two Governments to advance our shared <Col N="694" /> objective of lasting peace and an agreed political settlement.</P>
    <P>In the course of our discussions, John Major and I reaffirmed the strong commitment of the two Governments to bring the peace process to full political fruition based on the framework of principles set out in the Downing Street Declaration. We remain convinced that the declaration can achieve the breakthrough to peace, now that the removal of the clarification logjam, as a result of the constructive British Government response, has cleared the way for an early and definitive response from the Republican movement and for a decision on a complete cessation of violence by both sets of paramilitaries, Loyalists and Republican.  It is our hope that the response will be genuine and positive, leading to the next logical step in the peace process, which is a permanent halt being called to the futile and counterproductive campaigns of terror currently being waged, for which there is no vestige of justification.</P>
    <P>The continuation of violence now constitutes the biggest obstacle to the advancement of the peace process.  The recent wave of senseless killings, maimings and bombings must stop, if the paramilitaries on both sides want anybody to believe that they are seriously committed to the peace process.</P>
    <P>Following our meeting on Thursday last, John Major and I welcomed and supported Mr. Molyneaux's call for a complete cessation of violence by Loyalist paramilitaries.  Mr. Molyneaux, as leader of the largest political party in Northern Ireland and as a committed Unionist, was giving expression to the wish of the great majority of the people for an end to paramilitary violence.  Similarly, Republican paramilitaries will have to give tangible expression to their stated interest in peace by calling a permanent end to their campaign.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that no political objective will ever be advanced, or no legitimate grievance redressed, by the use of violence.  The Irish and British Governments share a rock-solid and unshakeable determination in that <Col N="695" /> regard.  Following our meeting, both John Major and myself made it very clear that we will not permit any party or organisation to veto or hinder political progress.  We are absolutely firm in our resolve that the pace and nature of political developments will not be held up or determined by any waiting around for paramilitary organisations to make up their minds on whether to opt for full democratic participation.  There is no question of either Government allowing any group to bolster their negotiating case by continued violence.  These criteria are fundamental to the approach of the two Governments towards a solution.</P>
    <P>In the course of our discussions, John Major and I reviewed the progress made so far in the development of a Joint Framework document, grounded on the principles of the declaration, as a basis for resumed all-party talks.  While no absolute timetable exists for the completion of this document, we set ourselves the aim of finalising it by the time of our next formal meeting which is scheduled to take place in mid-July. Work on the formulation of this document is continuing apace and this will remain the position.  I expect to have a further informal meeting with the Prime Minister on the margins of the European Council meeting in Corfu towards the end of June.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of advancing the principles of equality of treatment and parity of esteem, I put forward certain specific proposals which would help Nationalists feel that they too are first class citizens.</P>
    <P>John Major and I also reviewed recent security developments relating to Northern Ireland.  The two Governments will continue to work closely on all security matters to protect people's lives.  We are committed to improving wherever possible the unprecedented level of co-operation which exists between our respective security forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse everything the Taoiseach said about the cessation of violence by both sets of paramilitaries. <Col N="696" /> We all agree that if they want to shed their own blood that is their business, but they are not entitled to spill the blood of others.  On the political front, as one who pressed for a joint approach between the two Governments that would appeal to the moderate majority in Northern Ireland, will the Taoiseach state why there is such a delay in the completion of the framework document?  I presume it will be based largely on the joint working document that was leaked to Emily O'Reilly last November.  Why is it that six months later this document has not been agreed between the two Governments? Will the Taoiseach confirm that this document will cover constitutional as well as institutional issues?  In regard to the peace process, can the Taoiseach confirm that the end of June is now the deadline for acceptance of the peace process by Sinn Féin/IRA and that thereafter the focus will switch to the talks process? In that context has the Taoiseach kept in touch with Mr. John Hume and constitutional nationalists to make sure that their views are taken into account?  Has he kept open his lines of communication to the Unionists so that their views can be taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter part of Deputy O'Keeffe's question, I read reports in the paper from time to time and I have no knowledge of an 8 June deadline.  I am not saying that is a deadline; I am not setting a deadline.  I assure the House that the two Governments are working on a framework document with or without the people involved in paramilitary violence and with or without a clear decision from them.  It is their decision to make whenever they wish. The two Governments will continue with the process and we would hope that both sets of paramilitaries, as has been advocated by so many community, religious and political leaders in the North, will realise that if they want to be part of the discussions on a new Ireland they will have to call a permanent cessation of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work on the framework document is continuing.  These are very complex <Col N="697" /> matters with which we are dealing.  I can confirm that we are seeking possibilities for a balanced constitutional settlement. We will continue to do that and will not hang around waiting for paramilitaries to make up their minds.  Both Governments will continue with their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the question of internment discussed between the Taoiseach and the British Foreign Minister? Was the Loyalist attack in Dublin discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is &ldquo;no&rdquo; and the answer to the second question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>To whom it is intended to present the framework document? Will it be presented to all political parties? Will it be published and how will it be processed?  Will there be a round table discussion to process it or will there be discussions with individual parties?  Will there be a time limit on the discussion phase to be followed by a decision phase or will this be open ended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Such decisions have not yet been taken.  Deputy Bruton can be assured that when we are closer to agreement on it I will certainly keep him, and the other political leaders, advised as to when we expect to finalise it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly anxious that this framework document should have broad support from the moderate majority within the North.  For that reason I wish to press the Taoiseach more on the question of the discussions I hope he is continuing to have with moderate opinion in the North.  Can he confirm that he is keeping in touch with Mr. Hume and moderate constitutional Nationalists in the North and that his lines of communication with Unionist moderate opinion in the North are being kept open at this vital time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the lines of communication between <Col N="698" /> moderate Unionists and moderate Nationalists are always open.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.  The British have their own candidate in the field, Sir Leon Brittan, who the British Prime Minister feels is a very competent and effective person to take on the job if the other countries of Europe so decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Prime Minister is in no doubt about my views; they are well known to everybody.  His views about his candidate are what one would expect and my views, which have been given in the House, were confirmed to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Taoiseach's statement that what he is seeking is a balanced constitutional arrangement, is it intended that this arrangement will be incorporated in the framework agreement which he expects to have finalised by mid-July?  In referring at an earlier date to comprehensive, far-reaching equality legislation, was the Taoiseach referring to the introduction of such legislation in this State as well as in relation to Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought Deputy De Rossa would have no problem recognising that there is a Minister for Equality and Law Reform charged with responsibility for bringing forward equality legislation and he is engaged in that aspect of his duties.  On the first part of the question about a balanced <Col N="700" /> constitutional arrangement, I think Deputy De Rossa is well aware of how that will have to be enshrined in British legislation.  If we get agreement on a balanced constitutional arrangement it will lead to a referendum of the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach whether he hopes the balanced constitutional arrangement to which he referred will be part of the framework agreement which he expects to have concluded by mid-July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's comments that hopefully there will be agreement on constitutional change, has any thought been given to establishing a time frame for the completion of the talks process, bearing in mind that when the situation in South Africa looked very difficult, a date was set on which elections would be held and matters finalised?  Has any thought been given by the two Governments to the time frame for the talks process and whether there should be an indicative date for a referendum on the two parts of this island to complete that process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our working agenda is as I have laid it out: the two Governments, through the liaison committee, continue to work with the aim of finding agreement to finalise the framework document by mid-July.  The talks process is a question for another day.  We must first compile a framework document that will form the basis for the resumption of the three stranded talks.</P>

      <Quest>if the pay and non-pay accounts of Westmeath Vocational Education Committee are overdrawn at present; if so, the amounts overdrawn in each case; if approval for this was sought or granted by her; if the committee's bankers threatened to refuse payment on cheques issued; if any discrepancies have been found in financial or other returns to her Department from this vocational education committee; if approval was sought or given for the purchase of property in France; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Every vocational education committee is obliged to make monthly returns available to my Department.  The financial monitoring reports received by my Department from the County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee during 1993 did not indicate any departure from the approved 1993 budget.  Its statutory financial statement for the year 1993, which was received in my Department in April 1994, showed a deficit of £450,000 and an overdraft with County Westmeath <Col N="702" /> treasurer bank of £574,000 at the end of 1993.  The statutory financial statement does not differentiate between pay and non-pay balances.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that we are talking about an unaudited financial statement.  Confirmation of surpluses or deficits in the course of audit requires judgments on cash assets and liabilities included in the financial statement.  Consequently, the balance of cash assets and liabilities in the audited accounts can be different from those shown on the financial statement initially submitted by a committee.  The approval of the Minister had not been sought or given for incurring this overdraft as required by the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  I am greatly concerned at these developments and at their implications for the effectiveness of the County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee financial management and control procedures generally.</P>
      <P>My Department has brought these matters to the attention of the local government auditor who is responsible for the audit of accounts of vocational education committees until the end of 1993.  My Department has also written formally to the Westmeath Vocational Education Committee seeking is observations. On receipt of the observations of the Westmeath Vocational Education Committee, I will consider what further action would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>In the course of recent contacts, my Department was made aware of the concerns of the treasurer bank and a verbal request for approval of overdraft facilities has been made by a delegation from the Westmeath Vocational Education Committee.  This request is still under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of the property in France arises under the vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS).  In general, approval for a vocational training opportunities scheme is conveyed in units of 20 students and inclusive funding is provided separate from the vocational education committees general second-level budget.  This funding is intended to cover all the costs of the programme, including instruction, equipment, payments <Col N="703" /> to students in respect of school books and other expenses and accommodation where necessary.  In view of the overall pressure on school places, vocational education committees provide accommodation for the VTOS in many instances through renting-leasing and meet the cost out of the general VTOS budget.  Specific approval for this renting or leasing is not generally sought or given.</P>
    <P>In the case of the County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee, approval in principle was given to the provision of a VTOS module in France provided this could be done within the normal level of funding for the scheme. No specific sanction for leasing-purchasing premises was given.  Following continuing contacts and discussions and the submission of additional information, the Westmeath Vocational Education Committee was informed in February 1994 not to take further action in the matter until it had been fully considered by the Department.  This was repeated in May 1994.  My Department is considering all aspects of the proposal in the light of additional information and clarification being made available by this vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to examine the general financial operation of the Westmeath Vocational Education Committee. On receipt of this information I will consider what further action I should take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister extremely concerned that Westmeath Vocational Education Committee is £574,000 overdrawn, which represents about 100 per cent of the annual turnover in the non-pay account?  Is it not very frightening that a vocational education committee would be overdrawn to such an extent?  Who is responsible for bringing to the attention of the Department the fact that a vocational education committee is going into overdraft?  Is it the responsibility of the chief executive officer or the chairman and the members? <Col N="704" /> If it is the responsibility of the chairman and the members, will the Minister clarify whether those members are liable to be surcharged on the £500,000 that is overdrawn on that account in relation to their bank borrowings?  In regard to the property in France, if that also was not brought to the Minister's attention, does that further expose the chairman and the members of that committee to surcharge by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my reply that I am greatly concerned also.  Under the terms of memorandum V.53 it is the duty of a CAO to ensure that expenditure is kept within limits imposed by the Minister in his/her approval of an annual financial scheme unless sanction has been obtained in writing for any subsequent modification or revision.  Those are the vocational education committee functions, and there are discretionary powers under the 1930 Act.  Some of its functions, within parameters, are laid down by the Minister and I made reference to that in regard to renting property to carry out a VTOS.  There is a degree of flexibility as long as the budget is adhered to.  The vocational education committee system in general is very sucessful at responding in a flexible way to the needs of a community which may change from county to county or town to town.  There are functions, however, it can only carry out with the express approval of the Minister, and raising loans is one example.</P>

    <P>To refer to my original reply concerning the French property, the matter was brought to my attention in February and the Department said it would look into it.  It informed the vocational education committee not to take further action and that was repeated in May.  I am greatly concerned about this matter and, under various Acts and memoranda, it is clear that there is flexibility but while we want to protect that flexibility to a vocational education committee, there are parameters.  Where the parameters are breached and the information becomes available to the Minister, the Minister can then take action.  I have formally requested the Westmeath <Col N="705" /> Vocational Education Committee to answer questions and when that information is available to me, I will inform the House of the action I intend to take.</P>
    <P>We must be careful because we are talking about unaudited accounts, and that was specifically included in my reply. It is only when the audited accounts are available and satisfactory answers to the questions are received that I have an obligation to seek a satisfactory explanation.</P>

      <P>I intend to co-operate with the Chair.  I am frightened to hear the Minister say that she informed this vocational education committee it was not to proceed with the venture in France in February of this year because in the past two to three weeks an entourage in excess of 60 people travelled from Westmeath to France to the official opening of this premises.  In fact, a former Minister was invited but did not travel. A number of high ranking people from County Westmeath and from other vocational education committees travelled to that opening ceremony&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputies will appreciate that I must be careful because we are talking about unaudited figures.  I have asked questions of the vocational education committee and I am awaiting its reply.  In regard to the French matter, the vocational education committee was told some time ago that it could go ahead and provide the VTOS module in France providing it was done within normal funding available to the VTOS.  I would remind the House that we have students on other schemes, Erasmus, Lingua, Petra &mdash; Members will be familiar with them &mdash; and, therefore, the constraint that was put on the request concerning the French module was a financial one. It was not the case that the Department of Education indicated that it could not and should not operate a module in France.  Indeed, not only is the Westmeath Vocational Education Committee interested in this but other vocational education committees believe that students who are availing of the VTOS scheme could benefit.</P>

      <P>The provision of a post-graduate course which would enable university graduates to train as primary teachers has been approved in principle. My Department is currently in discussion with the colleges of education for primary teachers with a view to agreeing details of the implementation of the proposed course in the colleges.  At this stage, while full details are not yet available, I can say that it is intended to take on 180 graduate students on the proposed course.  Discussions with the colleges involved have not been completed and the duration of the course is one of the matters still under consideration.</P>
      <P>The proposed intake for 1994 is 800 for the higher diploma course, the largest number of places available, with the exception of 1993, since 1988.  The number of places on post-graduate teacher training courses in 1994 will therefore be 980 including the 180 graduate students on the primary teaching course.  This is a reduction of 47 on the total number of places for post-graduate teacher training in 1993 and an increase of over 200 for 1991 and 1992 and, indeed, is a significant increase for all the years back to 1988.</P>

Why was the number of places available for people to train as primary teachers not increased?  The Minister is now taking people whose second choice may be primary teaching.  They will be <Col N="708" /> given a type of crash course in teaching methods and turned out as primary teachers.  Will the Minister, in her negotiations on this course, bear in mind that graduates spend three years training to be primary teachers?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 13, 17, 32, 46 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>I have taken the following steps to assist schools in providing the transition year programme.</P>
      <P>I have increased the rate of capitation grant for voluntary secondary schools generally by £8 per pupil and of disadvantaged secondary schools by £23 per pupil from January 1994.  These increased rates apply to all pupils including those taking the transition year programme. The budgets of community and comprehensive schools and of vocational education committees were also increased.</P>
      <P>Some additional accommodation will be required.  Schools should make application to my Department where additional accommodation will be required to cater for the extra pupil numbers arising for the transition year programme. These applications will be dealt with as part of the second-level capital programme.</P>
      <P>An in-career development programme for the teachers in schools which have opted to offer the transition year programme is already under way as part of the £3 million in-career development programme at second level to be spent in 1994.</P>
      <P>I have established two monitoring groups, one within my Department and one including representatives of managerial authorities, teacher unions and parents, to keep all aspects of the implementation of the senior cycle restructuring under review.</P>
      <P>Provision of the transition year programme will involve the development of school based curricula.  Based on guidelines issued by my Department, schools will select and adapt the curriculum content of the transition year programme, having regard to the interests of pupils and the views of parents, the possibilities offered by employers and other work-providing agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> The need for further resources for the transition year, including the question of additional teaching hours in respect of coordination work, is under consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ended her brief reply by talking about the prospects for schools next year.  Many schools are completely in the dark because they cannot plan.  I speak as one looking forward to personal experience of the transition year.  It is very difficult for schools to plan for the transition year unless they know they can secure a grant, for example, and have a co-ordinator for the year.  Will the Minister be more specific about what may be made available and how soon so that schools may be able to plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Resources are being made available for schools who opted to provide a transition year &mdash; 575 schools expressed the wish to offer the transition year programme from 1994.  Of those, 416 are offering it for the first time.  We are talking about 24,000 extra pupils. Each pupil will receive the increased capitation grant while in the transition year. The departmental committee take on board concerns expressed by a committee planning to make the best use of the transition year.  They are planning the in-career service and building requirement. I am aware that the Department is being asked for extra teaching resources &mdash; I do not say we are not considering it &mdash; and I would refer the Deputy to the departmental communication sent to schools in December 1993.  It was stated that no arrangements were made for additional grants to schools specifically for the transition year.  Students on these programmes will, of course, count for standard teaching allocations and grants towards recurrent costs.  Schools applied on the basis of that information.  The Department will spend £3 million on in-career development this year.  Money has been put aside in the capital building programme if requests for additional accommodation are received.  We are looking at aspects that the managerial <Col N="712" /> bodies and teachers unions have asked us to consider.  This information was offered to those schools which opted to provide a transition year last December and they were asked to plan on that basis.</P>

      <P>Many schools request funding from parents for the transition year. If it is to be used in a proper, structured and cohesive way the money must be forthcoming.

      <P>Any contributions of a voluntary nature sought by any school must be voluntary.  Each pupil participating in the transition year will receive the normal capitation grant given to any student.  Where contributions are requested from parents they must be voluntary. Parents should be aware that each student in a transition year class receives a capitation grant for their attendance at school.  It applies equally to them as it would to any other pupil attending any other year.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify for the Deputy that some 70 national schools have been closed over the past five years but not all of these have been sold.  It is estimated that some 50 schools have been sold in that period although some of them may have been closed prior to the period in question.  I am aware that the Deputy has been promised in this House precise details of the number of schools sold over the past five years.  It has proved difficult to extract the information from the Department's records but every effort is being made to collect it and to have it forwarded to him.</P>
      <P>In many cases where national schools are closed the Department initiates the closure.  The school authorities may decide to sell the premises but, if so, they must seek the Minister's agreement to release her interest.  It is usually at this point that a financial consideration arises having regard to the amount of the State investment in the buildings over the years.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out in this regard that State investment will have been in the buildings only.  The site will have been provided through local sources without any financial contribution from the State.</P>
      <P>Because of all our concerns about the State's investment in schools my Department is at present engaged in discussions with the managerial association for primary schools on the whole issue of the de-vesting and sale of former national schools with a view to arriving at transparent and possibly formula-based arrangements acceptable to all parties.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply, but I am at a loss to understand why it has taken the Department of Education two years to establish exactly the number of schools which have been sold. Since she is on public record as stating that the State will recoup all of the money due to it from the sale of primary schools, will she tell the House her estimate of the <Col N="714" /> amount of money owed to the State from the sale of primary schools, the number of schools of school authorities which have been contacted and asked to repay money to the State and the amount of money involved?</P>

      <P>That is not acceptable. This question, which was tabled properly on the Order Paper for reply today, asked specifically for information regarding the amount of money involved.  The Minister will have to appreciate that she is accountable to this House and that when Members ask for information on public money the least they are entitled to is that the Minister research the matter and give them the reply.

The process of compiling the information is ongoing and I will come back to the Deputy on it.  I share the Deputy's concern about the sale of properties &mdash; it is a common concern &mdash; and instead of waiting for the information, which I will come back to the House on, I have initiated talks with the managerial authorities so that we can put in place a formula which will allow us to dispose of primary schools in an orderly and transparent way.  Having regard to demographic trends, we can expect the sale of more property in the primary school sector.  I will continue to seek the information and will come back to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I want to correct a point made by the Minister.  The first question relating to the position during the past five years was not put down on 4 May but, from memory, was put down in October 1992.  Will the Minister agree that her Department has not made any attempt to recover the moneys owed to the State from the 50 schools which have been sold?  While I appreciate her announcement that she is putting in place procedures to deal with the future sale of schools, both she and her Department have been remiss in not seeking a refund of the moneys owed from those schools which have been sold.  She is not even in a position to tell us the amount owed to the State; there is not even an estimate on the amount owed to it.  Will the Minister agree that it is very difficult for those communities which are seeking new primary schools or funding for the refurbishment of existing primary schools to stomach a situation whereby educational resources are being sold from under the Minister's nose and she does not even know the loss to the State?</P>

I said in my reply the <Col N="716" /> information was not readily available, that I was having the matter examined and would communicate with the Deputy.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if it is her Department's policy to restrict 10 per cent of all staffing in community and comprehensive schools to a 10 per cent quota of temporary whole-time and part-time teachers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 615 of 26 January 1994.  As I explained at the time, the staffing approved in any one year for community and comprehensive schools is expressed in wholetime teacher equivalent units.  Ninety per cent of staffing allocation is used to make permanent wholetime appointments, and the remaining 10 per cent may be used only to make temporary or part-time appointments. This is necessary to give school managements flexibility to plan their programmes and to cater for the broad range of subjects offered.  It is also necessary to take account of the effect on the annual staffing allocation of short term fluctuation in student numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position currently adopted is that approximately 10 per cent of the approved teacher allocation should be used to make temporary or part-time appointments only.  However, in accordance with the provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> my Department will be entering into discussions with representatives of management and of teacher unions with a view to agreeing a ceiling on the percentage of part-time teaching posts in <Col N="718" /> post-primary schools and third-level colleges. I do not wish to pre-empt those discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister laid down a criterion that 10 per cent only of the staffing levels in these school be allocated to part-time teachers.  Surely local needs warrant local authorities and schools being in a position to take those kinds of decisions, ascertaining how to respond?  Is job-sharing included in this 10 per cent ceiling the Minister is imposing because there is a great need for it in the teaching profession? It is already very successful in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice to respond in a flexible manner to curricular demands in approved teacher allocations for 10 per cent of the school year or activity, a good example being the range of subjects offered in community and comprehensive schools and within the vocational education committee sector.  At present within the secondary schools sector that flexibility does not exist, although there is a scheme which provides for the redeployment of teachers.  Therefore, there is a different relationship between teachers in the voluntary schools sector and those in community, comprehensive and the vocational education committee sector. There has been discussion about this and an interest was expressed at the time of publication of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  There have been discussions with management and teacher unions to agree a ceiling on the percentage of part-time teaching posts.  I do not want to pre-empt these discussions but I am sure, on their finalisation, I will be able to spell out precisely what is included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to ascertain the Minister's thoughts on this subject.  Would she be happy to see an increase in the incidence of part-time teachers, or does she perceive any value in allocating part-time teachers to a school?  Does she consider they have any <Col N="719" /> potential contribution to make to the variety of subjects being made available within a broad-based curriculum, when perhaps a teacher, working ten hours per week, could add a continental language or some other subject to that school's curriculum which would be advantageous, rather than imposing this 10 per cent ceiling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>While a Minister may express preferences when arranging talks between parties and giving each a role, it would be pre-emptive of me to be prescriptive about any outcome I might wish. Indeed the 10 per cent in specific sectors has allowed flexibility, generally accepted by those involved.  While the managerial authorities accept the need for flexibility they have expressed the view to my Department that the level of part-time and temporary teaching posts should be reduced.  I am talking about community and comprehensive schools forming part of the ongoing negotiations that arose from the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  Within the timetable, curricula and subjects available in schools, there is the ability to respond flexibly with a percentage of part-time teachers but that precise percentage is at present being discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government states that the Government will provide an extended and strengthened in-career development programme for teachers.  As Minister for Education, I have announced a programme of in-career development which will meet the needs of the education system and the needs of schools and individual teachers. The programme is being put in place in consultation with the two representative advisory committees &mdash; one for primary and one for second-level &mdash; which I have established to advise and recommend on all aspects of teacher in-career development. I am confident that teachers will be prepared to fully participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>Among the incentives being offered to teachers at present are extra personal vacations for primary teachers arising from attendance at summer in-career development courses; travel and subistence for attending certain courses; no course fees in respect of attendance at certain categories of courses; accreditation arising from attendance at particular courses.</P>
      <P>Important curriculum changes are taking place at first and second levels which necessitate extensive teacher in-career development.  The manner in which the in-career development activities are delivered will have a significant bearing on the question of absences of teachers from schools.  This is an area which is being examined by my Department in consultation with the advisory committees whose terms of reference include advising and recommending on modes of delivery.</P>
      <P>In the context of this examination, the extent of the provision of substitution to cover for the absence of teachers from school on in-career development courses will also be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main concern, as Minister for Education, is to ensure that as much as possible <Col N="721" /> of the money available for in-career development is spent on the actual delivery of a high quality in-career developments programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I am amazed the Minister is talking about summer courses because they have been in operation for many years.  If this is an effort to recharge teachers' batteries, it comprises the usual bad value in that teachers forego five days of their summer holidays and are given three days later in the year, good value from the Department's point of view.  The Minister should treat this matter very seriously by running such courses, within school time, nationwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Over £30 million will be made available for teacher in-career development over the next six years under the terms of the National Development Plan which constitutes an extraordinary investment in in-career development.  Therefore, we must be very careful to ensure that as much as possible of that investment is expended on delivery of high quality in-career development programmes.  I have established representative committees within my Department to advise on how best we can deliver on those programmes, under which all primary schools are to be invited to submit proposals for their in-career development programmes which will be based on their local, individual identified needs.  My Department will be prepared to facilitate and fund these programmes, otherwise schools would have to pay for them or do without.  The incentive is their own professional development. I have set in train a two-pronged process, to ensure that the expenditure of the money will be done in close collaboration with those who deliver the courses and we have invited schools within the different sectors to seek departmental funding for new programmes which they consider meet their local needs.  I take the point made by Deputy Browne about the delivery of such programmes locally.  Teachers centres and colleges of education nationwide <Col N="722" /> have been asked to submit proposals for courses for primary teachers in the autumn term, which we envisage would take place outside school time and would respond to the Department's published list of priorities, in respect of which fees will not be charged to participants.  I hope, by being flexible and close to the teaching profession in the matter of planning, that all teachers will benefit from this first time investment in in-career development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask two brief supplementaries.  Are the teacher unions represented on those two advisory bodies and, if so, to what extent?  Will the Minister say whether the £5 million allocated this year is divided evenly between the primary and second level sectors?  In other words will there be £2.5 million for both sectors?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The teacher unions are represented on the committees.  If the Deputy wants a breakdown I can give it to him.  I should say they are satisfied with their representation on the committees. Without giving an exact breakdown of the moneys available for this year a higher proportion will go to in-career development at the senior cycle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have put in place extraordinary changes at the senior cycle. Because of the demands that will be made on the teaching profession for those delivering on the senior cycle of second level education the Department must respond.  We made money available for teachers who had accepted the invitation to be involved in the transition year.  The bulk of the activity for delivery this year is at the second level.  The unions involved, represented on the two committees, have accepted the invitation extended to them. They are advising the Department on how best we can serve the teaching profession and, ultimately, the students involved with this massive investment the Government is making in in-career development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to specifically ask about the curriculum changes and the arrangements being made for the in-service training of teachers.  Is it the intention that the in-service training for teachers will be provided within normal school time and that training will be carried out by members of the teaching profession? If so, what arrangements, if any, have been made for the release of those teachers from their normal teaching duties to prepare for and carry out the training exercises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The responses from the teaching profession to avail of this training have been flexible.  As I said in my reply, there are different ways of doing it.  I would welcome a specific question on the content of in-career programmes. I will avail of any opportunity offered to spell out the many ways in which we are responding to the different needs.  The first tranche of the moneys available for in-career development went towards training principls.  We were involved in the preparation of trainers for the transition year.  Different groups are responding to each of the changes being introduced and the development programmes available.  Others are making programmes available to be able to respond to suggestions and programmes. We now have six months work under our belt and we are putting a formula in place.  We have not completed the formula because we have invited teachers to express their needs.  A formula is being put in place as to how best we can invest the money on which the teacher unions and the committees are advising the Department but specific responses are awaited.  A sum of £6 million is to be spent over a six year period on different programmes.  I know I will be satisfied that we will have not only the goodwill of the teacher unions but that we will be working with them to ensure that their members benefit from this investment in in-career development. Until now, except for teachers who volunteered to do summer courses and the small number involved in retraining, many more left the training college and <Col N="724" /> went into the classroom and the curriculum did not change.  Now the curriculum has changed and the Department and the Minister have a responsibility to ensure that teachers can avail of training, respond positively to the curriculum changes at second level and make the school curriculum relevant to the growing numbers of children remaining on in our schools.  At present 73 per cent of the school cohort remains on until leaving certificate but I hope it will reach 90 per cent.  To put the matter in perspective when I did my leaving certificate, 40 per cent stayed on.</P>
      <P>We are changing the curriculum and giving people different options.  We are telling the teaching profession that we appreciate they will deliver that change and as a Department ensure that we invest wisely, on their advice, on their in-career development needs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I accept readily that even a bicycle gets rusty after ten years and teachers are in the same position.  I am worried that, as usual, the goodwill of teachers is being cashed in on by the Department.  The Minister referred to summer and evening courses and the vast sums of money being spent on training.  Surely serious thought must be given by the Minister's advisory group to full time training and, if necessary, close schools to allow teachers to attend courses on so called in-service training.  Is it not time teachers were treated seriously and that their goodwill was not always used as an excuse for not looking after them properly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>

We asked the schools to submit proposals and I am sure the concerns of Deputies will be expressed by the teachers who are now responding to the invitation issued by the Department.</P>

    <P>Any planning permission conditions in respect of car parking requirements are a matter between Cumman Luthchleas Gael and Dublin Corporation.

      <P>As this question was raised during the debate on the Estimates I have some idea of the way the Minister of State is thinking.  Is he aware that when there is a match in Croke Park the local community is under siege, that many people cannot gain access to their own homes, that people drink late into the night on the pavement and that there is a major problem with litter?  There is a feeling in the community that the Minister of State in disbursing these funds could be of assistance in impressing on the GAA that there is a need to do more and to implement in full the conditions attached to planning permission for the extension.  Will the Minister of State keep the promise he made during the debate on the Estimates and have a further word with the GAA about this matter and its impact on this settled and quite community which has hosted this important institution for a long period, not without significant cost?</P>

Is the Minister aware that there is a sense of outrage that £5 million of taxpayers' money is being given to the GAA for this development without the Government availing of the opportunity to ensure that the GAA authorities make some reasonable effort to deal with the massive problems caused for residents when a major sporting event is held in the stadium?  As Deputy Flaherty said, streets are strewn with litter after the event and the area is choked with traffic.

The Deputy referred to a specific region.  As representatives from that region met the committee, I am sure it will be considered.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 51 together.  The ordinary fees payable by school candidates for entry to the 1994 certificate examinations are as follows: leaving Certificate, £44; junior Certificate, £41.  In relation to pre-examinations I presume the Deputy is referring to examinations organised in schools prior to the leaving and junior certificate.  The position in relation to these examinations is that my Department neither arranges nor charges a fee for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department implements a scheme to provide alleviation of fees in the case of any pupil attending school who is experiencing particular hardship.  For this purpose a total of more than £374,000 has been allocated to recognised schools and vocational education committees in respect of the 1994 examinations.  The amount of the reduction in the case of any individual pupil concerned under this scheme is determined at the discretion of the school authorities subject to the total amount of such deductions not exceeding <Col N="733" /> the specified amount already notified to each school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees of £44 for the leaving certificate and £41 for the junior certificate may not appear huge sums of money in terms of individual pupils. However, they present major difficulties for many low income families who have to pay mortgages, water charges and medical expenses, but who do not want handouts.  I was told recently of a boy who had been paying his fees by instalment who was sent home from school because the final instalment had not been paid.  He lives approximately five miles from the school, was discharged at approximately 10 a.m. and the first his mother knew was at 2.30 p.m. when a teacher from the school telephoned to know if her son had arrived home.  I would like to hear the Minister's views because that type of conduct is totally out of line.  How does the Minister propose to assist families who do not qualify for a medical card but who are on a low income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why, under this scheme, the amount of the reduction in the case of individuals is determined at the discretion of the school authorities subject to the total amount.  The criterion in respect of medical cards is not the only one which applies.  The amount allocated to schools to cater for cases of particular hardship is related to the amount allocated to the school or committee for the purpose of the scheme.  School authorities are advised that, for the purposes of the scheme, a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where general hardship exists because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, a large family with inadequate means, single parent status, where more than one child is sitting an examination and other circumstances which would denote a similar degree of domestic and financial hardship.  The terms are flexible, it is up to us to ensure that school authorities are aware of the scheme and the criteria involved and that cases such as that outlined by the Deputy do not arise.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Will the Minister accept that it is penal for some parents to come up with this money?  The so-called free book scheme has been in operation for many years and schools are allocated a certain amount of money, but they cannot possibly cater for those on low incomes who do not qualify for medical cards.  Those administering the scheme will not have enough money to deal with genuine hardship cases where children are frequently embarrassed because they do not have the money to pay these fees.  It is not their fault they do not have the money to pay for examinations.  Perhaps we should consider reducing examination fees.  Why should we generate an income from those sitting examinations?</P>

      <P>It is not a profit-making business.  In 1993 the total amount collected in examination entry fees was £5,450,000.  The amount spent by the Department, in the main on the remuneration of examiners and superintendents, was in excess of £10 million and this was exclusive of the salaries and expenses of the Department's examination staff.  Taking everything into account, the total cost of holding examinations was in excess of £13 million in 1993.  Let me reiterate that it is not a profit-making exercise.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy of the criteria, mentioned in my previous reply, that allow schools to respond in a flexible way to the needs of the most necessitous pupils.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Will the Minister accept that there will never be enough money?

We have been able to take this step because of the enhancement of the primary school capital programme.  Not only will we be able to plan for general purpose rooms but also to expand the minor and emergency grant scheme and this year 206 schools will have proper sanitary facilities.</P>
      <P>We are surveying the existing accommodation and this will allow us to plan on a more orderly basis than previously.

    <P>I have arranged for a review of the recruitment procedures, deployment and <Col N="737" /> working practices of the inspectorate with a view to having a gender equitable system and to encouraging more women to apply for posts within the inspectorate.</P>
    <P>I have recently received from the Minister for Equality and Law Reform a copy of the report on a survey of equal opportunities in the public service.  The report highlights the virtual absence of women from senior management in the public sector.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to set a time limit.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has been in touch with other Departments on equal opportunities in the public service.  I have given a commitment to work with him in order to ensure that women are promoted in the public service.  I take on board the Deputy's remarks that inspectors are important role models.  The two challenges are that women have an opportunity to seek promotion and that promotion in the public sector is open not only to their male colleagues but to women.  In schools we are educating people to take their place in society and it is important that they have role models. I can assure the Deputy that I will be co-operating fully in the introduction of progressive policies because I accept that the current inequality in the public sector is a matter of concern.</P>

Will the Minister <Col N="738" /> take on board recommendations from teachers that certain inspectors ought to be well briefed on sexist language as in carrying out their functions they should not make sexist remarks?  I have heard from teachers that the word &ldquo;chick&rdquo; has been used by some inspectors when referring to women.  Until equality is achieved, it might be worthwhile to circulate a memorandum to the inspectorate to ensure they are made aware of the need to use non-sexist language.</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's remarks about the relationship between the inspectorate and the teaching profession. I would welcome specific details from the Deputy if he wishes to make them available.  In tackling the challenge of gender equality, we have in place information packs which emphasise that teachers should realise the importance of their relationship with the children.  I was disappointed to read in a survey made available to me in the Department prior to Christmas that sexism and children's ideas about themselves can be formed as early as senior infant level.  If the Deputy has specific worries I will take note of them and pass them to the relevant authorities. Relationships between adults are role models.  We aspire to educate children to live in the world where equality is the norm rather than the exception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Rabbitte will be able to recommend a suitable printing machine.</P>
      <P>I propose to avail myself of the opportunity which the debate on this motion present to do three things.  First, I want to outline the nature and operation of the scheme to which the motion refers and which has been operated by successive Governments since the scheme was introduced by Government in the 1980s. Second, I propose to set the record straight concerning extremely serious allegations made about the grant of naturalisation in the case of two persons who have been named publicly &mdash; allegations which are based on misinformation and which appear to be grounded on nothing more or less than pre-election posturing and politicking.  Third, I want to talk about changes in naturalisation and citizenship arrangements generally since this Government took office and I became Minister for Justice early last year.</P>
      <P>First, to the scheme itself.  Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, which was inserted by section 5 of an Act of the same name in 1986, provides that the Minister for Justice may in his-her absolute discretion grant a certificate of naturalisation where the applicant has &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;, even if the other conditions for naturalisation, or any of them, are not fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the policy and practice of <Col N="853" /> successive Governments, from all sides of the House, to give favourable consideration to applications for naturalisation in the case of persons making or facilitating substantial investments in the State, where such investments have the aim of job creation or the preservation of jobs that might otherwise be lost.  The consistent view, again of successive Governments of all political hues has been that, by being prepared to make a substantial investment in jobs in this country and by purchasing a residence here, applicants for naturalisation, assuming of course that there are no serious impediments to naturalisation on other grounds, should be deemed to have the &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; necessary for the grant of citizenship.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that certain other countries, including EU countries, follow a similar policy and I believe that it would generally be considered to be more in accordance with the intention of the Legislature and the spirit of the legislation that we should, as a matter of normal practice, grant applications in such cases rather than refuse them in the knowledge that the grant will secure investment and the refusal may see the investment move elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am taking it that the correctness of the principle whereby foreign nationals who make substantial investments of this kind may be granted naturalisation is not in serious dispute.  I do not see how it could be, given the record of successive Governments and the inherent good sense of interpreting the legislation in a way which would allow substantial investors in Irish jobs to be naturalised on the basis of Irish associations.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, open to people to have different and legitimate points of view about how far we should go in this State in the use of the possibility of Irish citizenship to encourage investment by non-nationals. The reality is that this type of scheme is operated by many countries who are in competition with us in trying to attract foreign investment and, indeed, it would appear that the schemes available in some of these countries are far less rigid than ours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> Whatever about making adjustments to the existing arrangements &mdash; as I will explain later I had made some myself before this present situation blew up &mdash; I doubt very much if either those seeking investment in Irish business or the people out there looking for jobs would welcome a policy shift now which saw this country spurn substantial investment offers rather than grant naturalisation to the potential investors involved.</P>
    <P>Many favourable naturalisation decisions were made over the years under the legislative provisions I have just mentioned &mdash; they run about 20 successful applications per year.  The critical issue in all cases is whether proper procedures have been followed and whether the standard of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;, accepted by successive Justice Ministers and Governments, has been met.  This brings me directly to the second issue, that is to the case which has been the subject of widespread and misleading publicity in recent days.</P>
    <P>First of all to the facts, on which there is, I believe, a considerable amount of confusion and, as I have said, misinformation. My Department's files shows that on 10 July 1992 the managing director of a consultancy firm, which has submitted other, unrelated, applications for naturalisation, forwarded an application for naturalisation to my Department on behalf of the two persons whose names have been in the media and have been mentioned by Deputy McDowell. The consultancy firm submitted these applications through the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith. The applicants were a mother and her son &mdash; not husband and wife as some appear to be assuming &mdash; and the application was based on the fact that, between them, the two people concerned had earlier invested £1.1 million in job creation in C &amp; D Foods Limited.  The company itself has confirmed that these jobs were created and maintained and confirmation was received by letter dated 15 July 1992 from a large and reputable firm of solicitors in Dublin that the husband of the woman and father of the man who had made the aforementioned <Col N="855" /> investments had purchased a residence in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to that &mdash; on 25 November 1992 &mdash; the two investors made the required Declaration of Fidelity to the Nation and Loyalty to the State, in the District Court, in accordance with law and both were granted their naturalisation certificates on 15 December 1992.</P>
    <P>There was nothing out of the ordinary or underhand, in other words, about the way in which this application was dealt with.  It was not unusual for the company which submitted the application on behalf of the mother and son to make such applications; it was not unusual that the application would be submitted, in the first place, through another Minister; there was a substantial job creating investment involved; there was the family investment in a residence and the declarations required by law were made in court.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have been Justice Ministers since this investment/naturalisation scheme was introduced, irrespective of their political colour, will know full well that they have granted several applications in similar circumstances once the relevant requirements were satisfied. Deputies who served as Ministers in other Departments, together with some, indeed, who did not serve as Ministers at all &mdash; again irrespective of their political colour &mdash; will also know full well that they have supported such applications.</P>
    <P>If the representative of any party which has been in Government in that period is tempted to stand up and challenge what I have just said, I would strongly advise him or her, right now, to remain seated and have a word instead with his or her senior party colleagues.  I would also strongly advise that they ask their colleagues whether any of them ever sought to extend the scheme so as to allow for the grant of naturalisation applications on the basis of investments not necessarily falling into the direct job creation category &mdash; for example, for investments in golf clubs.  If they are told the truth about this they will also be told that <Col N="856" /> the Government, on the recommendation of a Fianna Fáil Justice Minister, opposed the golf club move and that it failed.  Deputy McDowell will not require cross-party consultations to get the facts, if indeed facts are of any interest to him.</P>
    <P>Before I go any further, there is one sideshow which needs to be disposed of, that is the suggestion that there were Cabinet discussions on the application and that this somehow confirms that there was an element of chicanery afoot. While restricted, by law, in what can and cannot be disclosed about Cabinet meetings, I believe that it is not illegal for me to confirm that the issue was not submitted by my Department as an item for consideration by the Government. There was simply nothing for the Government to consider.  There were informal discussions about the operation of the scheme from time to time, as there are about many other things not immediately before the Government for decision, but there was no Government decision &mdash; and none was required &mdash; concerning this particular application.</P>
    <P>Proceeding further with the facts of the particular case, there is one fact which has not I believe so far emerged but which will surely demonstrate to any fair minded person that proper procedures were followed in this case.  The man who is husband of the woman and father of the man granted naturalisation, himself applied &mdash; again through Minister Smith &mdash; for naturalisation in October 1993 but was routinely advised by an official of the Department of Justice that it could not be granted on the basis of the £1.1 million investments made by his wife and son or on the basis of the fact that they had acquired Irish citizenship. He was told that he would have to make his own investment if he was to qualify. The legislative term &ldquo;Irish Associations&rdquo;, in other words, is, as a matter of normal routine, construed quite strictly by the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>That should clear the air in relation to the fact that Deputy McDowell has consistently said that a Mr. and Mrs. Masri are concerned in this instance.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that the man concerned was not put off by the strict requirements involved.  He subsequently invested £1.5 million in forestry &mdash; an investment estimated to produce 50 jobs and welcomed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry &mdash; and he has indicated that an investment of equal amount &mdash; a further £1.5 million &mdash; will be made in another suitable venture in this country. On this basis I am prepared to grant naturalisation to him as I would to any other person who satisfied the relevant conditions.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell's headline grabbing exercise, in other words, was just that and no more.  While we do not know exactly what he wishes to achieve in introducing this Bill &mdash; because we have not seen it &mdash; if one is to judge from newspaper reports this, too, is no more than a headline grabbing effort in that its main purpose seems to be to put in place that which is already part of law and practice.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside political gamesmanship, by which many Deputies may be tempted in the run-up to elections, I am surprised that Deputy McDowell lent himself to this particular effort.</P>

In fact, he admitted as much on radio this morning.</P>
      <P>I also find it hard to believe that the Deputy would land himself in a piece of naked politicking which, though the allegations on which it is founded have no substance whatsoever, has succeeded in attracting unfavourable attention to a very respectable family &mdash; identified by name &mdash; who have done no more than provide substantial investment in job creation in this country and apply for naturalisation on that basis, like many others &mdash; in accordance with the law of the land.</P>

      <P>I earlier asked Deputies who may have been tempted to get in on this particular bandwagon to talk to their party colleagues and consider what they are told before they too are led on a wild goose chase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternative is for me to mention the names of other investors, other naturalisations and other political parties who operated the naturalisation arrangements which are the subject of discussion here.  It has been long standing practice in my Department not to discuss individual cases.  It is a practice which exists for very valid reasons as anybody who has served as Minister for Justice will know and much as one might be tempted to refer to other cases to set some balance on the totally misleading nonsense we heard from Deputy McDowell and others in recent days, I will stick with the principle of preserving the privacy rights of the persons concerned.  I would like to assure them and others who may be thinking of investment in this country that we will not trade their privacy rights in an attempt to score political goals &mdash; in Deputy McDowell's case an own goal.  I would like to assure them also that the very sensible scheme fully operated by successive <Col N="859" /> Governments will continue to operate here as it does in other countries which need and value job creation opportunities for their citizens.</P>
    <P>The third matter I want to mention is the action I have taken, with Government approval, since I became Minister for Justice, but first I want to say why I thought it desirable to look at the whole area of naturalisation and citizenship and to see whether change was called for.</P>
    <P>I was aware, like everybody else in politics, that concerns have been expressed &mdash; particularly in relation to refugees &mdash; and that there was need generally for more transparency and openness. I was aware also &mdash; and this is true of legislative schemes of all kinds, whether in the area of naturalisation and citizenship or otherwise &mdash; that it is necessary to ensure that the various checks and balances are kept under review, so that unknown to anybody and despite the best intentions of those operating the systems, something has not begun to go astray.</P>
    <P>In the very area we are dealing with, for example, the scheme under which naturalisation may be granted on the basis of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; following a substantial investment, I was as much aware as everybody else of allegations of non-permanent investments at a discounted interest rate and so on.  I discussed this within my Department and it was clear that there was no really effective way of establishing absolutely that a loan that appeared to be above board and completely bona fide was not in fact as described.  In other words, money put into a company for the purpose of securing naturalisation and then subsequently withdrawn with limited or no benefit to the company when naturalisation had not been granted.  My Department simply does not have the follow up mechanism to check on each and every one of these investments and, although, I had no specific reason to believe &mdash; in the sense that I was not aware of any particular case &mdash; that something had gone or was going astray &mdash; I thought it prudent to introduce a system whereby other Departments with access <Col N="860" /> to relevant information would have a direct say in relation to granting these applications.</P>
    <P>On my recommendation the Government agreed last April to set up a committee consisting of representatives of my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Department of Finance &mdash; and the Industrial Development Authority, which will have the function of examining each of these applications and making recommendations on them to the Minister for Justice.  When that decision was taken, I immediately sought nominations from those concerned for the new committee and I have since obtained them.</P>
    <P>Although I do not, as I say, have information which would suggest that matters had or have gone wrong in relation to this particular category of naturalisation applications, I will certainly be glad to investigate any complaints brought to my notice.  If it becomes apparent that any individual or group of individuals have knowingly provided false information about investments for the purpose of supporting their naturalisation applications, then I will have no hesitation in taking whatever action is necessary to deprive them of the very considerable and valid status of Irish citizenship.</P>
    <P>I have taken other steps also in the whole area of naturalisation and citizenship. Deputies will recall that quite recently the Oireachtas enacted the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  That Act remedied a situation which had emerged a few years ago which led to the unacceptable position that some thousands of people who had applied for citizenship in due time and in compliance with the relevant law could not be granted it because their applications had not been processed by the relevant authorities within the time limit imposed by the previous Irish Citizenship and Nationality Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>When that problem &mdash; which had existed for some time &mdash; was brought to my attention I did not sit upon it.  I acted to remedy the problem by bringing before the Oireachtas the necessary <Col N="861" /> amending legislation.  As a result of the enactment of that legislation the way was opened for some 4,000 persons, who had fully complied with the law and who had been deprived of their statutory rights by the inability of the relevant authorities to deal with their applications in time, to acquire the citizenship to which, under the law, they had proved themselves entitled.  The enactment of that legislation was welcomed by Deputies from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to refugees and asylum seekers Deputies will be aware the Programme for a Partnership Government contains the following statement:</P>
    <P>Our policy towards treatment of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants will meet the highest international standards.  Procedures will be introduced to guarantee rights of hearings, appeal, access to legal advice and access to the Courts.</P>
    <P>In May last year the Government appointed an interdepartmental committee of senior officials to examine policy and practices with regard to non-Irish persons who are resident in the State and in the area of persons who apply for refugee status.  Last November the committee presented an interim report dealing with applications for refugee status and that report has been published.</P>
    <P>My Department drafted a general scheme of a Bill taking account of the recommendations in the interdepartmental committee's interim report.  The Government, having considered the proposals, gave formal approval on 1 March last for the drafting of a Bill.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Bill will give effect in our domestic law to the provisions of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees.  It will provide for a statutory basis for examining applications and there will also be an appeal procedure.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be major legislation and will bring our law, practice and procedure in relation to asylum seekers into line with the best practices in other countries. The Bill will ensure that all applications <Col N="862" /> for refugee status will be examined by an independent body and that there will be an appeals mechanism operated by a second independent body.  The Bill will also ensure that the system for examining refugee application will be transparent and that applicants will be given all possible reasonable assistance in framing their cases.  There will be legal provision that they are told of their rights to seek asylum, of their right of access to legal advice and to the use of an interpreter.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also recognise the role played by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees dealing with application for refugee status.  In this context I would like to place on record my appreciation of the advice and assistance given by the office of the High Commissioner dealing with applications currently and also, in particular, in giving advice on matters to be covered in the proposed Bill.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the Bill will be introduced as soon as possible and when the work on the drafting of the Bill has been completed I will arrange for its immediate publication.</P>
    <P>I should remind the House that the terms of reference of the interdepartmental committee extends beyond the area of refugee and asylum seekers. The full terms of reference of the committee are as follows: to examine and restate present policy and practice in relation to the admission to, residence and right of work in the State of EU and non-EU nationals from the point of view of general aims of policy, clarity, consistency, efficiency of application and appeals mechanisms; to examine, in particular, the transparency and efficiency of arrangements which exist for dealing with special categories of immigrant e.g. asylum seekers and refugees; to make such recommendations as are necessary for the development of a system of treatment of immigrants which is consistent and transparent, having due regard to the commitment in respect of refugees and asylum seekers which is contained in the Programme for Government and to make recommendations on the most feasible way of dealing with the problem of immigrants <Col N="863" /> who have illegally resided in the State for considerable periods of time.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee is continuing its work.  As soon as it publishes reports or makes further recommendations to me I will study them and act on them as soon as possible in each case.</P>
    <P>I have responded at some length to this motion, because I believe that extremely serious damage may be done to job creation prospects in this country, that serious injury may be done to the privacy rights of individuals if the kind of wild speculation which has been let loose in recent days concerning our naturalisation law and practice is not brought in check by means&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter I wish to raise are the menaces made by the Minister in the course of her speech where she said implicitly she had access to secret files, which she has as Minister, <Col N="864" /> and that any Member who dared to make allegations might have those used against them in some fashion that would compromise them.  That is a breach of privilege. It is an attempt to curtail the freedom of Members to ask relevant questions if a Minister is essentially menacing the Opposition saying: do not ask awkward questions about these matters because we have information on file which might be embarrassing to you or to some of your colleagues.  That is a breach of privilege.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a political response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have expected the Chair to curtail it but he did not do so.  I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>There are five problems with the scheme.  First, no one is accountable to the public for any of these decisions, and that is bad.  Secondly, there are no published rules governing the issuing of these passports.  Decisions made which are of financial importance and discriminate between one individual and another should be made in accordance with rules, and there are no published rules in this case.  Thirdly, the decisions appear to be made by Ministers acting alone.  That is wrong.  Ministers are politicians and are subject to all the pressures politicians are subject to, including the necessity to raise funds for elections.  If decisions of this kind are taken by Ministers there should be an independent oversight of those decisions on a <i>post hoc</i> basis to ensure they were made at arm's length without fear or favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fourthly, there is no appeals procedure against decisions taken.  One person could have their application for naturalisation granted and another could be refused.  As there is no one to whom they can appeal there is no case law underlying the appropriate reasons for refusing or granting an application.  The existence of an appeals procedure leads <Col N="865" /> to the establishment of case law and clear rules that people understand.  As there is no case law or appeals procedure, there is complete discretion and decisions can be taken without the need for transparency.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is no requirement for people to live here.  The Minister referred to this matter here on 9 March &mdash; column 342 of the Official Report &mdash;</P>
    <P>If a foreign national is prepared to be associated with Ireland by making a substantial financial investment, purchasing a home and living here, he or she should be considered for naturalisation by my Department.</P>
    <P>Did the applicant in this case purchase a home here?</P>
    <P>The Minister said she is setting up a committee, representative of a number of Departments, to assist her in making such decisions.  She mentioned Departments which presumably would have some expertise in these matters. However, that seems to be only in relation to the making of the original decision.  There does not seem to be any procedure to ensure that if money is invested in this country in order to buy a passport it stays here.  The committee to which the Minister referred does not seem to have power to ensure the money is not recycled out of the country through a bank account once the passport has been obtained, with a brokerage fee having been paid to someone along the way.  No such follow up procedure seems to exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the managing director of a consultancy firm made an application on behalf of C &amp; D Foods Ltd. What consultancy firm was involved? Does it specialise in passport applications? The consultancy firm submitted the application through the Minister for the Environment.  Why?  What has the Minister for the Environment to do with the matter?  This firm is not in north Tipperary and had nothing to do with the Minister in his capacity as a constituency Deputy.  Why was he chosen to process this application?  That is not explained.</P>
    <P>I note the investors in question made <Col N="866" /> a declaration of fidelity to the nation. That seems to be above board.  As regards the investment in C &amp; D Foods Ltd, did the investors receive shares in the company?  If not, how could this be described as an investment?  Do they have representation on the board of the company?  If not, how do they protect their investment?  If they do not have shares or are not directors, is it a genuine investment?  Were fees paid to any brokers in regard to the passport application, in other words, is it the case that there is profit to be made in facilitating a passport application?  If that is the case, is it desirable?</P>
    <P>Did the IDA recommend these investors in the case of C &amp; D Foods Ltd?  Did C &amp; D Foods Ltd. go to the IDA or just directly to the Minister, Deputy Smith? If they did not get the IDA to vet and approve this application for a passport, why did they not do so?  Why are the accounts of C &amp; D Foods Ltd. not up to date in the Companies Office?  Do the accounts show the investment by the two Arab gentlemen and, if not, why not?  Is there any connection between this investment and the money lent to C &amp; D Foods Ltd. by Fóir Teoranta before it was wound up?  If not, why not?</P>
    <P>Did the Taoiseach know this application was being made given that his spouse is a director of the company and his son is managing director?  Did he make any informal representations about this matter at any stage?  Does he maintain any ongoing contact with the affairs of the company?  Does he stand to benefit in any way from this investment?  These questions need to be answered.  It is impossible to draw any conclusions, favourable or unfavourable, on this matter until we have the answers.</P>

      <P>The Minister said she had the files and was able to look at applications made by Members and if they or their secretary wrote a letter which might compromise them she was ready to produce the goods.</P>
      <P>I want to say openly that when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I wrote to the then Minister for Justice suggesting that there should be a facility of the kind we have for the granting of passports to those who invest in Ireland. I made this suggestion because during a visit to Hong Kong as Minister for Industry and Commerce I was told that there were substantial investors who would be willing to invest in this country &mdash; some of them subsequently invested here &mdash; and would be interested in obtaining Irish passports.  I have no fear about the publication of anything relating to this by anybody if it is in any way helpful to the Minister.</P>

As the House will soon discover I have no interest in any companies whatsoever; my sole interests are agricultural.

      <P>We are concerned about a particular case.

    <P>Curiously the Minister said that a man was denied citizenship even though he was the owner of the house in which he and his wife and son resided in Dublin and that he was required to make a further investment before he would be considered for naturalisation.  How low can one go?  How can one say that this man's wife and his son are eligible for naturalisation as Irish citizens but that the man who owns the house in which they are supposed to reside must pay more money before he can become a naturalised Irishman?  The Minister should be <Col N="871" /> ashamed of herself.  This is not a defence; rather it compounds the low standards being applied by her Department.  I notice that the Taoiseach is smiling.</P>

We now know from the financial controller of the Taoiseach's family firm that the investment was made in 1992, after the Taoiseach was appointed.  The Minister for Justice reiterated that this matter was not dealt with in Cabinet.  However, when one looks carefully at the script it is clear that this matter was discussed in Cabinet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My next point relates to the Taoiseach's public assertions on this matter.  He has asserted that he has had nothing to do with C &amp; D Foods Limited for 14 years.  This is not true.  Reference has been made to Fóir Teoranta and the assistance given by that concern to this company.  In 1986 the Taoiseach was represented to Fóir Teoranta as being, with his wife, the proprietor of the entire shareholding in the company.  As the Taoiseach knows well, during the same year he was in negotiation with British supermarket firms to carry the products of that company.  He knows that this is the case and that people <Col N="872" /> have been actively and deliberately misled by being given a completely different view of the realities on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I make no secret of the fact that my Bill proposes to bring to public attention a major abuse of citizenship and naturalisation by certain members of the Government, and I make no apology for doing so.  I am not, to use the Taoiseach's words, playing politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather I am trying to establish and vindicate basic political standards which are obviously absent in the Government and which even the recently published Ethics in Public Office Bill does not even attempt to address.</P>
      <P>Acquisition and loss of Irish citizenship, under the Constitution, are entrusted to the Oireachtas for legislation. In turn we have delegated significant functions in this respect to successive Ministers for Justice.  Under section 15 and 16 of the Irish Citizenship and Nationality Act, 1956, as amended, the Minister for Justice of the day is given wide discretion, in certain circumstances, to confer citizenship on people who have Irish associations.  Nobody in this country opposes the granting of citizenship to foreigners under a genuine, above board, business migration scheme where there is transparency and accountability.  If any one wants to establish or join an Irish business, to create jobs in the process, to live here as part of our political and economic community and, within that context, to assume the obligations and duties of an Irish citizen, including the right to vote at elections, there should be a mechanism to enable that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not prejudice the operation of a proper business migration scheme.  In the context of those beliefs I tabled questions to the Minister but was denied straightforward and truthful answers.  I have since come into possession of a document prepared in the Department of Enterprise and Employment in September 1993 which summarises the position in relation to <Col N="873" /> citizenship in return for investment. Again I will make a copy of that document available to any Member or any other person who wants to see it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes it very clear that the Department of Enterprise and Employment is wholly opposed to the notion of giving people who make financial investments, as opposed to entrepreneurs, any citizenship in this State.  Second, it makes it very clear that the interdepartmental group of which the Minister spoke issued an invitation to one of the consultants-intermediaries we have just heard about to address that group on the method by which foreign people could obtain Irish citizenship and that this was the cause of major dissatisfaction within the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice's statement of intent, as set out in that document, and the conditions laid down for granting Irish nationality and citizenship to people proposing to make an investment in this country have been totally flouted in the case of the Masris to whom the Minister referred.  There has not been even an attempt to establish, first, that there was residence in this country for two years; second, that there was any intention to bona fide reside in this country and, third, that there was any intention to make a genuine business investment in the sense that most normal people would consider that term to mean something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know now that the loan made to the Taoiseach's firm was not an investment in share capital and we know, that like every other loan, in the last analysis it can either be brokered through a third party or, alternatively, repaid.  That is not what successive Governments regarded as the appropriate method of investing in this country for people who wanted to come here as business migrants.  Nor is it suggested for one moment that the people in question &mdash; whom we now hear are the son and wife of the person in question &mdash; intended to <Col N="874" /> make Ireland their place of residence, to become part of our political and economic community.  There was never a hint of that, there still is not, and the Minister knows well that that is so.</P>
    <P>Then there is the position of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith. As Deputy John Bruton said, the reason he was selected to act as an advocate at the highest level of this application for citizenship is obscure.  However, it is relevant to point out, in the context, that the Minister for the Environment represented to the Department of Justice that he was prepared to support the application for citizenship from: &ldquo;personal knowledge of an intimate acquaintance with the man in question and to vouch for his good character.&rdquo;  I challenge whether that was anything other than a gross deception of the Department of Justice.  I suggest that he was introduced to this man by a consultant, with whom he had no personal connection except in this context, that he had had no personal dealings with this man.  I challenge the Minister for the Environment to come into this House and state clearly when he first met Mr. Masri, in what context he met him and what dealings he had with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>What dealings had he with this gentleman?  Why did he have dealings with him?  Were they economic or purely social dealings?  A Minister who makes a representation to the Department of Justice, by way of reference, that he is an intimate acquaintance of a person, cannot stand up in this House and say that he was introduced by a citizenship broker as part of a deal to get that person naturalised in Ireland.  That is what happened in this case and the Minister knows it well.  He also knows that the representations made by the Minister for the Environment to her Department grossly exaggerated any knowledge he had of this person and were designed to prevent the Department from conducting a searching examination <Col N="875" /> into the person's background; that is what they were for; they were designed to have that effect.</P>
      <P>I come then to a point which the Minister, in all the bluster, threat and menace contained in her remarks, deliberately ignored, that unlike any other case in which an application for citizenship has been made in this State, on this occasion, £1.1 million have been invested in a family business of a member of the Cabinet and, as we now know, the Taoiseach. When I asked if that could be the case the Chair suggested that it would be a personal imputation even to ask it.  Now we know it is true.  We know that this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not be deflected by your ruling.  It is an insult to people's intelligence that members of this Government are asking us to accept that the financial controller of C &amp; D Foods Limited, out of the blue, should receive in September 1991 a proposal to lend £1.1 million to his company by a man with whom the company had no previous connection of any kind.  I find it incredible that we are asked to accept that he and all those involved did not realise this person was being introduced for the purpose of getting flag of convenience citizenship.  It is also incredible that the Taoiseach would not have been informed or have become aware of this loan in March 1992 <Col N="878" /> or earlier.  I suggest he would also have immediately realised that the motive of the intermediary and the lender was to obtain Irish citizenship for the lender; that the Minister for the Environment, a long time friend and associate of the Taoiseach, could write to the Minister for Justice to the effect that he could vouch for the lender from personal knowledge and intimate acquaintance with him while the Taoiseach claims he has never laid eyes on this man.  I find that fantastic and incredible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that the Taoiseach has never seen this man but the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, is certainly no intimate acquaintance of his and the Taoiseach knows that quite well.  I also find it incredible that the issue of citizenship would arise nine months after the loan which, according to all those involved in the loan transaction, had nothing to do with it and was never discussed.  I also find it incredible that it should be suggested it is simply coincidence that the matter was dealt with by members of the Government when they were acting as caretakers, having resigned their seals of office in the interregnum between one Government and another.  I do not accept it was a coincidence or that most people in Ireland could possibly view it as such.  This is not a court of law but if there was a jury it would not even retire to consider its verdict on those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice cast doubts on Commissioner Flynn's assertion that the matter was dealt with by Cabinet.  The Taoiseach has been prevaricating as to precisely to whom he mentioned it and who mentioned it to him.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, has publicly relied on Commissioner Flynn's assertion that it was dealt with at Cabinet, in debate with me on the radio yesterday. Who is telling the truth?  The Minister for Justice also asserted on television that <Col N="879" /> the loan had gone through before Deputy Reynolds became Taoiseach.  We now know that assertion was wrong.  Why did she make that assertion?  Who put her up to it?  Who fed her false information and put her in front of the cameras to give the people such a misleading account? Are we to accept that the Taoiseach was kept in the dark throughout 1992 about the naturalisation proposal?  Are we to believe &mdash; and I ask this in all seriousness &mdash;that this country has descended to such depths that a son and a wife of a man who live in a flat owned by him, which apparently is not used by any of them in this country, would be accepted for citizenship because they put £1.1 million into the Taoiseach's family firm?  The man himself would be told: &ldquo;You do not qualify, hold me up another £1 million and then we will see if we can deal with you&rdquo;.  What kind of squalid little banana republic with a Papa Doc Duvalier regime have we when that is the kind of deal we do?  We say: &ldquo;Put up your money and we will give you more and, sorry, we will not give you citizenship even though your spouse can have it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one final point, that is, the &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; which we are told was carried out into the investor.  In the newspapers last weekend the spin doctors had their day.  We were told that the person who was investing in this country was a millionaire, a trillionaire, but he still cannot come up with the money to buy his own citizenship, he has only managed instalments for his wife and son. What due diligence was carried out into the reference in the newspaper to his banking relatives in Jordan?  If an investigation had been carried out it would have been discovered that the man referred to was a former Jordanian Cabinet Minister and head of the Arab bank there, a Mr. Rashid Al Masri.  That man was found by an American security and exchange commission report to have recently accepted a bribe of $2.4 million. I ask that this House go back to the basic issue.  The Taoiseach received into his family firm £1.1 million in exchange for two passports for the son and wife of a <Col N="880" /> person from whom they want more money before they will allow him become a citizen of this country.  They have a flat in Dublin but have never been resident in this country.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;expresses its serious concern at the operation of the Business Investment Scheme which has enabled wealthy foreign investors to by-pass normal procedures and effectively purchase Irish passports and acquire Irish citizenship simply by virtue of their wealth;</P>
      <P>&mdash;expresses particular concern at the circumstances in which passports were issued to two investors in the family firm of An Taoiseach and calls for a full disclosure of all of the circumstances in which these passports were issued;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;and, while accepting that Irish citizenship should be available to foreign investors who genuinely wish to promote economic development and take up residence in Ireland, believes that the naturalisation process should be applied equally and fairly to all applicants irrespective of wealth and accordingly instructs the Dáil Committee on Legislation and <Col N="881" /> Security to undertake a full review of the Business Investment Scheme and to make recommendations as to appropriate reforms.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, finished her script with the remarks that there are Members of the House who thought they had dug out what looked like a gold nugget which turned out to be nothing but brass.  The Minister for Justice has a brass neck in attempting to come into this House and present this scheme as if it was something known to the public.  It is not known to the public.  I have a document here that I want to read into the record of the House because some concession has been given to the notion of this kind of business investment scheme.  A valid argument can be advanced for such an investment scheme but not the kind of investment scheme we have here and certainly not the manner in which it is implemented in this jurisdiction.  This document was given to me today and has been circulated by an international lawyer seeking investors under the existing business investment scheme.  Such is the obsessive secrecy surrounding the scheme that in this memo the country involved is referred to, all the way through, as Greenland, although there is no doubt to which country it refers.  The document reads:</P>
    <P>Greenland is an English speaking common law country with a residency system of taxation.  It is a neutral state and is not a member of NATO, although it does provide men and materials for UN peace-keeping operation in Lebanon.  It is a full member of the European Union (formerly the European Economic Community) and its citizens have therefore complete freedom to live and work anywhere within Europe.</P>
    <P>This project offers naturalisation to an investor, his wife and minor children, in return for an &ldquo;approved investment&rdquo; of £500K in local currency a risk capital in a specified local enterprise. The project is so structured that <Col N="882" /> it is for the Government's economic advisers, and not the investor, to source and select a suitable investment that conforms to the Government's job creation criteria.  Furthermore the £500K will be invested in its entirety and no amount will be sidetracked by way of commissions and fees to third parties.</P>
    <P>There is an agreement in principle to preserve the anonymity of the investor and therefore the approved investment can be made by his own (offshore) company incorporated for that specific purpose and whose beneficial owners (as opposed to legal shareholders) need not be a matter of public record.</P>
    <P>The political sensitivity of this project is enormous and a high degree of confidentiality is therefore essential...</P>
    <P>Applications from individual investors will not be considered and we are at present getting together the next group of four investors who we are calling &mdash; Project...</P>
    <P>An investor of Chinese origin or from the Indian sub-continent is not acceptable.  An investor of Middle East origins might be acceptable provided he/she was already legally resident in a developed country.  Nor, for political reasons, will the Government consider any investor from another European Union country.</P>

      <P>As well as completion of a simple application form, and the execution of a declaration of allegiance, each investor will be required to provide the following documentation:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Birth certificate of himself, his wife and minor children, marriage certificate, notarised copies of the existing passports of himself, his wife <Col N="883" /> and children, confirmation of the deposit of £500K.</P>
    <P>An offshore shelf company will be purchased which will open an account with a specified local bank.  We will retain shareholder and directorial control of that company at all times.  The investor will transfer to that company's new account (anonymously) if he wishes £500K.</P>
    <P>The Investor will transfer to that company's new account (anonymously if he wishes) £500k...  We will then deliver photocopies (not originals) of the documentation requested.  Shortly thereafter the Investor should receive a letter confirming his application is acceptable and requesting him and his wife to attend court to make a declaration of allegiance and to submit his original documentation.  The Investor and his wife will then have to come to Greenland to each sign an original application form in the presence of a Greenland notary and to make the required declaration of allegiance. This can all be accomplished in a one day visit.  Approximately 21 days later we will receive a photocopy (not original) of the naturalisation certificate of the Investor, his wife and children.  We will check these photocopies against our records to ensure they are correct. ...Once the entire transaction has been completed and documentation (naturalisation certificates and passports) has been issued to the satisfaction of the Investor, the Investor will have no further personal liability associated with the enterprise into which his investment has been made, nor will he have any fiscal liability within the State....  Our fee will be £25,000 for each Investor and payable in advance; although we will undertake, should citizenship be refused, to return this fee less any properly recorded expenses, including the incorporation and winding up of the client's offshore investment company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This House and the public are being asked to believe that an Arab businessman sought out an investment project in Ireland and settled on a project in Longford which happens to be in the ownership of the family of the Taoiseach; that this Arab and his mother were subsequently granted Irish passports, that these events are unconnected and merely a coincidence.  The Taoiseach came to power when he acted in concert with Ministers Flynn, Smith and Geoghegan-Quinn. Together this so-called gang of four succeeded where so many others before them had failed &mdash; they successfully toppled the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey.  All four are implicated in the passports for sale affair.  Perhaps this, too, is no more than a coincidence.  It is perhaps another coincidence that a significant benefit was conferred on the family business of the Taoiseach on the decision of former Minister, Flynn, and on the recommendation of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith.</P>
      <P>According to Mr. Flynn in a statement in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> cases such as this involving job creation, or a jobs maintenance element, would have been discussed by Cabinet.  Yet, in a statement issued on Sunday the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, said it would be unusual for such a case to come before the Cabinet.  Which is it?  Was there a job creation element?  How much did the Cabinet know and what precisely was the involvement of the Minister for the Environment?</P>
      <P>It now emerges that the Minister for the Environment gave the Masris a character reference to facilitate their citizenship application.  I find this to be curious.  When and how did the Minister meet the Masris or did he give them a reference unseen based on the colour of their money?  After all, the Masris appear to be extremely elusive characters &mdash; now you see them, now you do not.  The Taoiseach has claimed that he has never seen or met them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted that on a previous occasion the Minister for the Environment has taken to presenting himself <Col N="886" /> as a world weary monsignor.  The case of his intimate knowledge of the Masris raises questions about whether this is the first time Rome has met Islam with such a happy outcome.  As usual, the Tánaiste finds himself perched on the horns of a dilemma.  His long awaited Ethics in Public Office Bill covers just about everything but the situation being debated in the House.  We will no doubt shortly have the entertaining spectacle of the Tánaiste and his colleagues rushing to plug the ethical loopholes, but it is too late.  Two years ago the Fianna Fáil horse and the Labour as combined to produce a governmental jennet and now that jennet has bolted with the Government's moral aspirations.</P>
    <P>Passports Unlimited Incorporated is yet another murky chapter in a tale of shady cover-ups, a tale which included Goodman International, Telecom Éireann and Greencore, a tale which the people thought we had put behind us. The only difference is that while those cases were largely concerned with money and money men the present case involves citizenship and nationality and this strikes at the heart of our body politic.</P>
    <P>Passports Unlimited Incorporated, also known as the business migration scheme or in its most recent incarnation, pet food for passports, is a squalid business providing a refuge for dubious individuals &mdash; Deputy McDowell has outlined for the House some of the background of the beneficiary in this case &mdash; whose only character reference is money. By selling what amounts to citizenships of convenience, Ireland is taking its place among the world's shadier nations, countries which dole out everything from passports to shipping flags and company registrations provided that the price is right but there is one significant difference between Irish citizenship and that of, say, Panama.  By attaining Irish citizenship the holder automatically becomes a citizen of the European Union and £1 million is a small price to pay for such a coveted scrap of paper.  One wonders how our European partners will view the operations of Passports Unlimited Incorporated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> This motion addresses the citizenship granted in 1992 to an Arab gentleman and his mother &mdash; and the prospective award to Mr. Khaled Masri &mdash; two individuals of Palestinian origin who must be suffering from an identity crisis given that they already hold Saudi Arabian and Jordanian passports, as well as Irish passports, a privilege not allowed by this jurisdiction to any citizen of any member country of the European Union.  If French nationals seek to acquire Irish citizenship they must first shed their French citizenship.</P>
    <P>The citizenship laws provide for naturalisation at the Minister's discretion of those with Irish associations.  Since last March when parties, including my own, sought to raise this matter it has become apparent that the term &ldquo;Irish association&rdquo; is infinitely expandable and functions as a handy catch all for various opaque dealings. A willingness to grant a soft loan of £1 million to a pet food company which, coincidentally, happens to be owned by the family of the Taoiseach, can scarcely be construed as an Irish association unless it is accompanied by a manifest desire on the part of the applicant to put down Irish roots and contribute on an ongoing basis to the economy.  The pet food connection apart, these two individuals' Irish associations are tenuous in the extreme.  I understand that Mr. Masri and his wife are based in London and that as recently as last year in an interview with <i>Business Middle East</i> Mr. Masri expressed his patriotic intentions to invest in the Palestinian homelands.</P>
    <P>This affair gets more curious.  According to the Minister, as quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, the procedure normally adopted in these cases is simple: companies in financial trouble or seeking to expand would be identified once the Government has received an approach from a potential investor and the IDA would then investigate the job creation potential of the investment.  It would appear that this is perfectly straightforward and above board except that in the case of C &amp; D Foods it did not work like that.  It appears the IDA was not <Col N="888" /> involved.  Instead, depending on which report one believes, Mr. Masri's investment was brokered by a bucket shop or he was struck by the sudden visions of crocks of gold to be made in the midlands. According to the first report the pet food for passports deal was brokered by what appears to be an <i>ad hoc</i> citizenship bucket shop run by a trio of Americans and Irish businessmen.  It is undoubtedly a most lucrative brokerage as can be seen from some of those who have got in on the act.</P>
    <P>To give a flavour of the scheme, I have read to the House a document from an international lawyer seeking potential investors.  It is my understanding that the typical scheme involves three-quarters of the money advanced as a soft loan at a very preferential interest rate and the remaining quarter of the investment goes to purchase preferable shares which are redeemable within three to five years.  In return, the company is required to set up a sinking fund to which money is paid on a regular basis so that the shares can be redeemed at the end of three to five years.  The investor, however, must reside in this jurisdiction for a minimum of 60 days in a two-year period.  That has not happened in this case and, as far as I am aware, neither is it happening in many other cases.  The management of a large hotel in this city could tell us about this type of investor booking in for ten days over Christmas to claim entitlement to this scheme and the biggest task for the consultants is to find a race meeting or some other entertainment to which to take the investor over the ten days.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come in here today and read to the House a script which does not deal with the obvious questions which arose as a result of this affair.  I fail to understand &mdash; and the Minister has not explained &mdash; the conflict between herself and the former Minister, Pádraig Flynn, who said it would have been normal for this matter to come before Cabinet, but the Minister has said that is not the case and that the decision was made in 1990. We now know from the financial controller of the company that the decision <Col N="889" /> was made in March 1992, a short time after the Taoiseach took up office, and in the same month he recruited consultants for the beef tribunal, which is the subject of a separate inquiry in this House.  An explanation has not been given for the involvement of the Minister for the Environment.  He has chosen to absent himself from the House for this debate. Why did the Minister for the Environment have such an intimate knowledge about the Masri family, how could he vouch for their probity in the manner required by the legislation?  We know nothing about that Minister in this regard.  However, we know that there is a cabal of Ministers in this Cabinet who saw eye to eye, at least under the Kinsealy regime, and all four of them are involved.  The decision was made by the former Minister, Pádraig Flynn on the recommendation of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, to the benefit of the family enterprise of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, came in here trading on her well merited reputation of being a open and helpful Minister in most matters, and presented this matter as normal.  This is anything but normal and the scheme is anything but acceptable.</P>
    <P>This is extraordinary in the context of an experience I have had, and I am sure many other Members have had similar experiences.  At precisely the same time as this matter was being considered by the former Minister, Pádraig Flynn, I was pleading with the Minister on the Adjournment of this House for recognition on behalf of an Iraqi gentleman in my constituency.  Following the Gulf War this gentleman was told his entire family had been wiped out but he subsequently learned his 17 year old brother was alive in a camp on the Saudi border after he had responded to American leaflets to defect.  The gentleman in question was a businessman in this city and offered to take in his brother at no expense to the State or even merely to take him out of the camp where he was living in deplorable conditions.  I pleaded with the then Minister for Justice privately and on an Adjournment debate of this House and <Col N="890" /> the Department of Justice said what it normally does to the economically dispossessed, it ruled the matter out of order and said it could not be entertained for all sorts of reasons.  The gentleman in question went to Mayo and camped on the doorstep of the then Minister for Justice and after some nine months eventually got a temporary exit visa which allowed his brother to be taken out of the camp.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Tánaiste, members of the Labour Party have gone on radio talking about one law for the rich and another for the poor, as if something will be done about it.  A different law is applied to people who are economically dispossessed and refugees who arrive into Shannon.  In this case, we are asked to believe that the character reference of wealth is a matter of coincidence.</P>
    <P>The scheme is open to corruption and potentially will create a conflict of interest for Ministers.  Rather than coming in here with a blasé motion, the Minister and Government should address the scheme urgently so that there will not be potential conflicts of interests for Ministers and to ensure the scheme is not open to corruption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to respond to a number of the points that have been raised by Deputies and I am speaking as Minister for Enterprise and Employment. As Deputy Bruton and others who have had the honour to hold the post of Minister for Industry and Commerce will be aware, since the mid to late 1980s a scheme similar to that which operates in other OECD or European countries has been in operation here.  It is my understanding <Col N="891" /> that when an application is received from the Department of Justice for such a business passport it is referred to the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  In most cases, if not all, the IDA is asked to give an evaluation as to the quality and appropriateness of that type of investment and on its recommendations the Department, in turn, forwards its recommendations or comments to the Department of Justice where the final decision rests.</P>
      <P>I recently defended a decision of the IDA in this House not to go ahead with a scheme in Kilkenny which promised to create more than 500 jobs because the terms and conditions which the IDA had set down in respect of granting taxpayers' money to that worthwhile investment in terms of jobs were not being adhered to. The House will recall that the conditions which the IDA sought to impose were standard conditions of compliance designed primarily to safeguard the duration and quality of the investment.  I outline that case merely to indicate that the purpose of the scheme is to ensure that inward investment has the desirable objective &mdash; with which I am sure nobody would disagree &mdash; of achieving sustained employment in this economy.  In fairness to Members who have spoken, that matter is not in dispute.  Following the Maastricht Treaty and the establishment of the European Union, access to an Irish passport involves the question of European Union citizenship and the many rights and entitlements which that involves in the global market and world in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA and I share a continuing desire to maximise the level of investment &mdash; from whatever source &mdash; into this country if the money invested will result in sustainable employment. Deputy Bruton made a measured contribution in that regard.  It is the policy of the IDA and my Department to ensure that such investment is made on terms and conditions that are in accordance with established procedures which comply with sustainable employment.  By definition, soft money wheeled in on a <Col N="892" /> Monday and out on a Friday would not qualify for that type of criteria.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Rabbitte or anybody else can point to such kinds of investment in the past, notwithstanding any guarantees or undertakings that were made or commitments undertaken, and can provide such information I will bring it to the attention of the IDA and the consequential benefits and other grants that may have been given to the recipient of the investment will be considered because it would appear to have been in breach, as I understand it, of the terms and conditions of such investments.</P>
    <P>I have spoken, as the Minister for Justice has already indicated, about my concern to ensure that there is a coherent and effective system of evaluation of such investments.  As the Minister for Justice said in her contribution, in April of this year on her initiative following informal discussions she got the agreement of the Government to establish a committee consisting of representatives of the Departments of Justice, Foreign Affairs, Enterprise and Employment and Finance and IDA Ireland whose function will be the examination of each of the these applications and the making of recommendations to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the committee are as follows:</P>
    <P>To examine and restate present policy and practice on the admission, residence and right of work in the State of EU and non-EU nationals from the point of view of the general aims of policy, clarity, consistency, efficiency of application and the appeals mechanism.</P>
    <P>My Department is responsible for granting work permits, a function of the former Department of Labour.  A substantial number of those work permits allow people the right of residence in the Republic of Ireland.  As a consequence of living in the country for a certain period those people qualify, by virtue of their residency, to make an application for naturalisation.  My concern in all of this, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is to ensure that under the right conditions and the <Col N="893" /> right terms, subject to the evaluation of the IDA as conveyed by my Department of official level to the Department of Justice, a proposal for investment that would consequently qualify for Irish association and enable the Minister of the day in the Department of Justice to grant a passport is carried out on the highest and most stringent IDA criteria, the standard of which I have given tangible reference in respect of the most recent Kilkenny case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What has happened during the past week or so on this issue has totally discredited a policy of successive Governments that should be of benefit to this country.  The Taoiseach's lack of candour and the efforts by the Minister for Justice during an interview on Sunday stretches credibility to its absolute limits &mdash; to expect the Irish public to believe that the Taoiseach would not know that an investment of £1 million was being made in his own firm, even though he lives with members of his family who are now the directors of that firm or that his wife, Mrs. Reynolds, would not have told him that it is proposed to invest £1 million in the business. I do not believe that the Taoiseach could not have known about this investment.</P>
      <P>I wonder why the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, contributed to the debate because he did not answer any of the questions that were raised by Deputy Bruton and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the IDA consulted about C &amp; D Pet Foods?  We are not talking about the policy in general but about a specific case.  Was the Department committed to this investment?  Why were not these questions answered?  Did the Minister bother to check the files before coming into the House.  I thought the Minister would give us some information. Has C &amp; D Pet Foods repaid the Fóir Teoranta loan to which Deputy Bruton referred?  These are questions that must be asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I look at Deputy Quinn and the <Col N="894" /> Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on the benches opposite I realise it must be very difficult for them to listen to this debate because when in Opposition in November 1992 they came into this Chamber and protested that they could not participate with a party such as Fianna Fáil.  The French put this best when they say <i>plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose</i>&mdash; the more things change, the more they stay the same.  I hope the Labour Party in Government will ask themselves the same searching questions that have been asked here today.  Will they stay in Government with a party they know they cannot trust any longer?</P>
    <P>The timing of the issuing of these passports reminded me of the famous Baskin pipe which the Department of the Environment had refused to sanction for three years but during the honeymoon period of the then new Government in 1987 the then Minister for the Environment &mdash; by coincidence the former Deputy Flynn &mdash; sanctioned it under the instructions, I understand, of the then Taoiseach, the former Deputy Charles Haughey.  There seems to be great similarities with this case today.</P>
    <P>A few more questions need to be put. How many passports have been issued since this scheme was initiated?  How many of those who were granted citizenship and received such passports now reside in Ireland?  If they no longer reside here can the Minister for Justice tell us how long they resided in Ireland?  In response to Deputy Bruton's question about the purchase of a residence, she said that a residence has been bought but she did not say whether the people had lived in it.  What checks had been carried out on the relevant businesses since the investment was made?  Were the total investments made in those companies? Since 1986 how many consultants have listed in their tax returns moneys earned from such consultancies?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the period of investment?  I believe the Minister for Justice's lengthy reference to the Refugee <Col N="895" /> Bill, interesting though it was, was an attempt not to answer some of these questions and in some way throw dirt at the Opposition parties who had granted citizenship to people who had properly invested in this country.  I thought the Minister for Justice would give a full list of instructions from the Department and from that of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on how the scheme worked.  I have a copy of the criteria for a similar scheme in the US.  The criteria for establishing a new commercial enterprise are clearly laid down in legislation: the creation of an original business, the purchase of an existing business.  It also says that substantial change means a 40 per cent increase in the net worth.</P>
      <P>I understand that about 30 or 40 such applications have been granted during the Fianna Fáil Party's period in Government. Can the Minister confirm this?  I understand also that very few companies here can take on the full investment of £1 million.  Will the Minister confirm that the £1 million is grabbed, as it were, and invested and then that different Ministers decide on the disbursement of the moneys in some kind of largesse, in £100,000 moieties, for instance?  In 1955, when this legislation was introduced, the then Deputy Stephen Barrett said, column 1008 of the Official Report, &ldquo;We should in some way try to define `Irish associations', there is nothing in the definition section about it and I think it is a bit wide and that the House should not allow the Bill to become law without in some way defining for the Legislature and for the State ...&rdquo;  We should have taken heed of that at the time and this Government has not done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of this debate is in the 1986 Act, which amends the 1956 Act.  It is unfortunate that some Members have not read it. Section 4 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, sets out the conditions for the issuing of a certificate of naturalisation.  Section 5 of the 1986 Act deals with the power to dispense with <Col N="896" /> conditions of naturalisation in certain cases.  One of the cases in which the Minister has absolute discretion to grant an application is where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish association.</P>
      <P>It is the question of Irish association which seems to have come in for some scrutiny, but what I would like the general public to consider when listening to this debate is the consistency of approach of successive Governments in issuing certificates of naturalisation which can under law be dispensed with under the 1986 Act.  They should also consider the inconsistency of members of parties in Government at that time who never questioned it, who were happy not only with the consistency of the Government's approach, but sponsored and proposed applicants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That has been the consistent approach of every Government, including those of which Deputy Molloy was a member.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I joined the Coalition Government of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil I was informed by the then Taoiseach of the business investment scheme and how it operated.  If people wished to make substantial investments in any of the projects related to the Department for which I had responsibility there were certain conditions under which naturalisation could be extended.  So far as I recall, during my time as Minister for Energy there were two occasions where I met people who intended to invest in energy projects.  I complied with the requirements of which I was informed by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, that the people should reside in the country for a substantial period each year and own a residence; the investment has to be substantial and each case was to be brought to his notice so that he might adjudicate on it and pass the matter to the Minister for Justice.  As a member of the Government I understood the scheme was controlled by the Taoiseach, to whom I brought parties. He discussed with them in great detail their investment and subsequently on two occasions made recommendations for granting naturalisation.  I was astonished to hear that the present Taoiseach approved the granting of naturalisation to persons who had in the past made investments in his family company.  We <Col N="900" /> have heard an extraordinary outburst from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, which I consider is totally irrelevant.  The point at issue is the propriety or otherwise of what the Taoiseach did, the standards people in Government apply to the decision making process, their fulfilment of the duty of the high office to which they have been elected and the trust they must hold on the part of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hypocritical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a Taoiseach or a member of a Government was in a position to influence a decision as important as this, one would have expected basic standards would have been adhered to in order to ensure this procedure would never apply to a company where there was an iota of association with a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Labour Party has sat through this debate.  The contribution from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, ignored the principle raised by the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael and Deputy Rabbitte.  It reflects sadly on the standards applied by those in control in Government at this time.  They have reneged on the responsibilities of their office and on the trust put in them by the electorate.  I call again for the resignation of the Taoiseach in view of the circumstances which have been confirmed during the debate and by statements in newspapers today.  The Taoiseach cannot put his head down and ride this out.  If the Labour Party is prepared to continue to support him in Government in the hope that this will be no more than a storm in a teacup, that it will blow over, and to pretend the Progressive Democrats are only raising this issue because of the forthcoming election, it is making a serious mistake.  It is a sad day for Irish politics if the Labour Party continues to support the Fianna Fáil party and the Government led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  During my years here there have been few occasions on which I have felt as upset by the blatant attempt <Col N="901" /> to cover up gross abuse of office by the Taoiseach of the day.</P>

      <P>I resent strongly Deputy McDowell's antics in recent days, particularly his attempt to cast a slur on my character and good name.

      <P>Deputy McDowell's attempt to hype up this issue during the European elections campaign is nothing but a desperate attempt by a desperate party racked by internal dissension to find something which would revive their flagging political fortunes.  A measure of their political plight is the Progressive Democrat's alliance with Democratic Left.  Deputy McDowell and Deputy Rabbitte are the new 1990s version of the odd couple.</P>

Deputy McDowell appears to find it extraordinary that a Minister other than a Minister for Justice would have anything to do with such applications. Deputy Bruton has disposed of one bit of confusion, once and for all. There was nothing bogus about the scheme itself.

I intend to concentrate mainly on the contributions of Deputies Bruton and McDowell. Where Deputy Bruton went slightly astray was when he prepared his statements and questions without knowing what I was about to say.  He referred to the need for accountability, for rules and so on, and I do not dispute this.  However, the point is that successive Ministers for Justice have operated on the arrangements which exist in which there are informal rules.  Is the Deputy saying that all of those are to be faulted now for the fact that they did not operate in accordance with rules which did not exist?  When I say there were informal rules in operation I do not want to imply that it was a matter of doing as one wished or that it was an exercise totally devoid of conditions.</P>

      <P>A fundamental condition was that there would be a substantial investment in job creation and another condition was that a residence would be purchased.  Both of these basic conditions were fulfilled in the case which has been disgracefully portrayed as an example of abuse.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton also complained of the fact that decisions were made by a Minister acting alone.  That is the law of the land.  Anybody who listened carefully to my opening remarks will know that, although it is the law of the land, I have specifically proposed &mdash; and the Government accepted my proposal in April last &mdash; that the advice and expertise of agencies outside my Department would be made available formally to the Minister in making these decisions.  The Government, in April and before the present difficulties blew up, agreed that in future the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Justice, Enterprise and Employment and the Industrial Development Authority will specifically be asked to give advice on all of these cases.  With regard to residence, I have made it clear that the requirement is that applicants display an intention to reside in the State for a reasonable period of time and that they do this at the time of the application. There is no mechanism whereby we can actually bind somebody by contract to spend all of his or her time in this country. We do the next best thing, that is &mdash; and here again I am referring to successive Governments &mdash; to require them to purchase a residence.  That is what the family concerned in this case did.</P>
      <P>Neither I nor the Government have any difficulty with the idea that procedures should be more formal or that there should be more rules.  However, I want to underline again that the Government operated properly in accordance with the arrangements that are already in being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether there were or are any fees paid to brokers who submit applications for naturalisation on behalf of applicants, that may well be the case; but, again, I am sure that any fair-minded person will recognise that, whether they approve it or not, this is a completely private transaction outside the control of the Government There are certainly no <Col N="908" /> State funds paid to the people concerned, but what may or may not be paid for services of any kind provided by persons in the private sector is something of which I have no direct knowledge, If Deputy Bruton or anybody else believes that somebody has acted improperly in taking payments for submitting applications to my Department, let him say so directly rather than leave something in the air which, however unintentional it might be, appears to attach a smear to my Department, to any Minister or Department or to the private individuals who have been granted naturalisation in the past.</P>
    <P>On the various questions concerning the Taoiseach's interest in the company, which is the subject of the investment, Deputy Bruton has already given eloquent testimony to the Taoiseach's honesty in matters of this kind when he acknowledged, quite fairly, that the Taoiseach had been open and frank in making disclosures concerning his business interests.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has been open and frank in this instance also.  Deputy McDowell's contribution was of a different order.  It was evident from what he said that he has found himself in the middle of a swamp that he now wishes he never entered.  I believe Deputy McDowell did not know that we were dealing not with a husband and wife but with a mother and son and that the husband, whose name is plastered all over the newspapers, is not an Irish citizen.</P>

      <P>I believe it came as a total surprise to him to hear that my Department was so strict in its application of the Irish associations requirement that it refused naturalisation to a man who was allegedly on some sort of inside track and told him he would <Col N="909" /> have to make his own investments. Deputy McDowell could not think of what he could possibly say when confronted by this fact and was reduced to the incomprehensible and totally illogical observation that it was lower than low for my Department to insist that this individual make his own substantial investment while he appears on the other hand to be implying that the family got what I call inside track treatment simply because they made a substantial investment in a particular firm.</P>
      <P>The Deputy seeks to make much of the fact that I said at some point &mdash; I do not know whether he is right &mdash; that the naturalisation application was granted in 1990.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell made outrageous allegations, implying that there was something inappropriate or underhand about the fact that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, supported this application.  It is odd he should have made this remark, given that Deputy Bruton openly acknowledged, as could many Deputies in this House, that there is absolutely nothing underhand or sinister about the fact that a person outside the Department of Justice, including other Ministers, might support applications of naturalisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will call two speakers only, the proposer and the opposer &mdash; Deputies McDowell and Rabbitte. The only motion before the House is that leave be given to introduce a Bill, in effect, that the Bill is allowed to be printed and circulated.  The motion to introduce the Bill is of limited scope especially as Members have not yet seen it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leave be granted to introduce a <Col N="913" /> Bill entitled an Act to amend and extend the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 to 1994.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes the following: where a certificate of naturalisation was given in the past in respect of an investment in this country, the Minister should publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the details of all such investments within one month of the passing into law of this Bill.  It has been suggested in newspapers that is redundant. That is not the case as the Minister made clear today.  She considers this to be a private and confidential matter and I propose that it should be made public.</P>
    <P>On future naturalisation, where the name of the person who is naturalised is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the nature of the investment in cases where it is an investment naturalisation should also be published.  The third feature of the Bill is to make it mandatory on the Government, where a certificate of naturalisation has been made in respect of an investment in a company in which a member of the Government or a person connected with them has held any beneficial interest, to require that matter to be declared in public.  This is not redundant as section 14 of the Ethics in Public Office Bill would not cover the matter the House dealt with today.</P>
    <P>Section 5 requires people who are naturalised by reason of investment to make a declaration of loyalty to the nation and fidelity to the State in court. Under section 16 the Minister is entitled at present, although I understand it is not the practice, to dispense with that requirement.  Section 15 permits any of the provisions in that section to be relaxed at the discretion of the Minister in the case of someone who has Irish associations.</P>
    <P>The sixth provision is one I will amend in view of the revelations made by the Minister.  It deals with the naturalisation of two named persons.  I understand from the Bills office that the Bill in its present form leaves something to be desired.  I will have the happy opportunity to regularise the provisions in section 6 in order <Col N="914" /> to comply with the facts as we know them and the rules of the House.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Investment&rdquo; is given a wide meaning in the Bill because it is expressly intended to cover the acquisition of any interest, legal or equitable, in any company, firm, business, land or assets for any consideration and also includes any business loan or credit facility.</P>
    <P>I seek leave to introduce the Bill and hope it will be debated on Second Stage. I hope on that occasion the Minister for the Environment will have an opportunity to elaborate on the questions he had so much difficulty with at the end of the last debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the printing and circulation of this Bill because I do not like the notion of citizenship being revoked.  If it is granted it ought not easily be revoked.  However having listened to the arguments made by Deputy McDowell and what transpired during the last debate there is much substance behind the Bill.</P>
      <P>The scheme which is the subject of the Bill is a lousy one.  A majority of Members believe that to be the case.  If it were a legitimate business scheme to secure investment from abroad it would not be open to the potential conflicts of interest which this scheme manifestly is open to.  I note Deputy Cowen shakes his head.  I read a document into the record which is a typical contract prepared by an international lawyer inviting investment in the scheme.  It is riddled with loopholes and is open to corruption.  It invites potential conflicts of interest and ought to be dramatically and radically changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the scheme was introduced some Members made very strong arguments that should be the case.  For example, let us look at the Tánaiste's remarks in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times.</i>  He said <Col N="915" /> his understanding was it required a substantial investment, an element of residence and that there be significant job creation.  In this case we have not clarified &mdash; the Minister has not helped us &mdash; if there was any kind of investment not to mention a substantial one.  It appears to be a package of soft loans.  There is no evidence that preferential shares on a redeemable basis were purchased by the investor.  I do not want to question whether the job creation we were told was associated with the investment transpired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot rebuke the arguments made by Deputy McDowell that there ought to be transparency about the investment, the amount and who handled it.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the Bill be circulated and debated on Second Stage because it raises fundamental questions which this afternoon's debate did nothing to clear up.  It was the most remarkable contribution made by a series of Ministers I have heard.</P>

      <P>No, I said it was open to corruption.  No other Minister, including the Minister for Justice, sought to reply to any of the pertinent questions.

      <P>Having listened to the argument put forward by Deputy McDowell there are compelling reasons why the Bill ought to be published and debated on Second Stage.  The Minister chose to give information that had nothing to do with the pertinent issues which this case gave rise to.  Since Ministers seem to be too concerned about the election they might be willing in a post election climate to address the serious merit of this Bill and the need for the radical overhaul of a scheme which is open to corruption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the <Col N="919" /> Government to publish this week the revised national plan showing clearly each alteration in any paragraph or commitment that is now different from the National Plan Programme originally submitted to Brussels.</P>
    <P>This national plan has been doomed from the beginning for a number of reasons. In its preparation the type of proposals and method of preparation for which the Labour Party, in Opposition, had called in the preparation of the last development plan &mdash; real, effective consultation with groups outside this House, with all groups nationwide who would benefit from it &mdash; did not take place.  There was a charade of consultation, certain committees were established although, as usual, late.  My information from people who served on those committees was that there was not really any effective debate on the kinds of projects which would assist areas from where these people came.  Therefore, the seeds of the destruction of the plan were already there.</P>
    <P>It was not as though the Government had not been warned of the need for consultation with local groups.  It was clear that when the last national plan was submitted to Brussels, questions were asked about how effective local consultation had been.  Therefore, the Government should have been forewarned, but was not and did not participate in effective consultation.  No doubt, when replying, the Minister of State will endeavour to say that is not true, that lots of people were consulted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless, the Minister of State served on Dublin County Council, as I did, and would have decried the lack of real consultation with it in the preparation of the last development plan. I am disappointed that she, and others like her, did not insist on this type of consultation when the plan was prepared. As though that were not enough, the <Col N="920" /> Taoiseach returned from a Summit meeting in Edinburgh and uttered the immortal words: &ldquo;The £8 billion is in the bag&rdquo;. Of course, he did not tell us that, in making that statement, he did not have any written confirmation, that he had gleaned it from discussions he had on the margins of the Summit meeting.  We all know what happened subsequently &mdash; there was a hole in the bottom of the bag through which the money disappeared. Then we had the unseemingly and discrediting débácle month after month, first by the Tánaiste, then the Taoiseach and followed by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, all adding to discrediting Ireland's name within the European Union.  The Tánaiste said that while we might not get £8 billion we would get in excess of £7.4 billion. Eventually, when the plan had to be submitted to Brussels &mdash; belatedly, the Government announced that it had to be in Brussels by the end of September 1993 &mdash; my party called for the recall of the Dáil so that we could discuss it before its submission.  The Government, in the manner in which we have become so familiar, told us not to worry that it had an excellent, well researched and prepared plan which did not need any advice or scrutiny by the Opposition parties, this from people who, in their Programme for Government, had said this would be a Government of transparency and openness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the months passed, we realised that those two words no longer existed in the lexicon of the Government; sadly, we no longer see any transparency or openness.  The Government did not recall the Dáil, it would not allow anybody to see this gold-wrapped plan before its submission to Brussels.  In October 1993, when we eventually debated the plan already in Brussels, it transpired that the Government, in submitting it, knew it would not get the £8 billion on which it was based.  Nonetheless, the plan was submitted, supposedly warranting an allocation of £8 billion.  Try as we would, we and other Opposition parties could not extract the truth from the Government, which was that the money would be reduced.  In accordance with any <Col N="921" /> mathematical calculation, if one was not to receive £8 billion, having submitted projects costing that amount, some of them would have to be omitted, cut back or rephased.  They said, &ldquo;never mind, we are not getting £8 billion but we will wait for the half-term review&rdquo;.  We had been warned that the half term review would not yield the same benefits as the half-term review in the previous plan had principally because other countries had learned how to prepare proper national plans.  The reason we got money in the first mid-term review was that some other countries had prepared plans that were less than adequate and could not draw down the money.</P>
    <P>Despite the warning that this money would not be available at the mid-term review the Government forged ahead and in the House in October 1993 conducted a false debate by implying that the plan would remain as it was irrespective of the loss of between £800 million and £1 billion.  We had further unseemly action when it became clear that the money was not available.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, like a petulant schoolboy went to Brussels in January and decided to blame the officials for losing the £800 million.  There was not a word of guilt by the Government that it knew it would not get this money; it blamed the officials and created great embarrassment and great discredit on the country that we could not add and subtract properly.</P>
    <P>It was not until the end of February last that the Government admitted &mdash; it was almost like extracting a tooth from a duck &mdash; that there would have to be rephasing, maybe some rebalancing and changing of the plan.  The Government is caught up in putting &ldquo;re&rdquo; in front of so many words as if somehow it could not bring itself to say it will have to cut out, reduce or rewrite the plan.  Instead it &ldquo;rephases&rdquo; and finds some other way of making the language unclear to the public as to what exactly is happening.  In doing that it has discredited Ireland's role in the preparation of national plans.  We know that the actual figure is £7.2 billion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> This motion calls on the Government to present the plan.  Let us see what exactly is proposed in that plan.  The Government is hiding behind its cowardly exteriors by saying it has no right to publish the plan and yet, in the past few weeks, and I am sure in the remaining seven or eight days before the by-elections, the Euro elections and the urban elections, Ministers will continue to announce all types of projects that they think will give them votes.  We do not know what sum of money is available for national and secondary roads or whether the Dublin light rail system will be built. Neither do we know how much money for the Tallaght Hospital project will come from Brussels and what amount will be required from the Exchequer.  However, Ministers feel confident in announcing all types of projects in their constituencies.</P>
    <P>We are deeply concerned that this revised plan is ministerially and constituency driven where there is a certain amount of bartering and exchange of goodies from one Department to another. Ministers appear to be saying: &ldquo;If you give me some of your money towards one of my projects, I will give you some money towards one of your projects&rdquo;. That is not the way to prepare a national plan.  We can only go on the information we have because the Government will not announce the details of the revised plan submitted to Brussels.  No amount of speech-making will convince us that there has not been a material change in the plan as published last year.</P>
    <P>The Government will be out of office after a number of years and will disown the fact that certain projects could not be proceeded with.  We will be told that projects had been re-phased, nothing happened and all the money was used. Ministers will say they did not get the mid-term review extra help they had expected.  That is not credible politics and it is bringing discredit on the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the effectiveness of the plan.  The 1989-93 plan set out to create 175,000 jobs.  I realise the Minister of State present is from the Labour Party and so was not a party to the 1989-93 <Col N="923" /> preparations.  That plan created 80,000 jobs in a period when 70,000 jobs were lost, thus leaving a net increase of 10,000 jobs.  If ever we needed a warning that the last plan should not be used as a blueprint for the present plan that was it. In the meantime while those 10,000 jobs were being created, 98,000 people emigrated and 63,000 people joined the dole queues.  If that is progress and value for money from the 1989-93 plan I am a Dutchman.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the last plan was not a blueprint for creating economic activity here or for improving the quality of life for people on the margins or for improving our infrastructure.  We got some new roads but there are many things we did not do with that money.  The warning must go out loud and clear that this is the last major tranche of money we will get as a result of our membership of the EU. We must use and invest it wisely and ensure that at the end of the five year review the credit column will be healthier than the debit column.  As this plan has been bungled so badly I have no confidence that the position will improve.</P>
    <P>The National Plan outlines four priority strategy goals: to strengthen the productive capacity of the economy &mdash; in other words create jobs; to improve economic infrastructure; to support local initiative for economic development and to develop skills and aptitudes of the workforce.</P>
    <P>There are serious question marks over the Government's proposals to develop the skills and aptitudes of the workforce. The Minister of State may shake her head but that was one of the programmes the Commission questioned.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State should not tell me to wait and see.  The Government should publish the revised plan so that we do not have to be all hopes, promises, ifs, buts and whens.  Let us see the plan.  The Minister is afraid to <Col N="924" /> do so before the European elections.  If the Government was not afraid that plan would have been published.  If it contained good proposals it would be published in order to gain benefit.  Clearly the downside of that plan is greater than the upside.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give us some information and announce that she will make the plan public so that the public can see what her trials and tribulations have yielded.  So far the Departments of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste's Office and every Department has been covered in shame on how this plan was prepared and changed and how we lost money.  We do not know from where the local contributions will come.  It is a matter of fudge.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that Fine Geal had to table a motion calling on the Government to publish an amended national development plan.  It is regrettable also that the National Development Plan published last October can be discarded. Officials and sub-regional groups throughout the country put much effort into joining the various pieces of the jigsaw which they hoped would ultimately make up the national development plan which was published with a fanfare.  I thought that the consultative process would have proved to be most rewarding for those engaged in it but when one examines the plan as published it is difficult to believe that the views of the sub-regional groups were taken into account by the Government which has not implemented its commitment to create a link between the people and power.</P>
      <P>Parts of the National Development Plan are supposed to have been taken from the submission of the south eastern regional sub-group with which I am familiar but it includes projects not recommended by that group.  The Government also failed to include many of the projects it recommended and wanted to see included.  This proves that the consultative process was just a sham as Ministers and officials in Merrion Street made the decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Development Plan <Col N="925" /> should include more than a list of priorities over the six years of the plan.  One would have thought that the Government would have learned from its mistakes in the last round of Structural Funds from 1989-93 and realised that throwing money at a problem in the economy would not necessarily yield a return in terms of growth and employment.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael firmly believes that European Structural Funds will be wasted unless they act as a catalyst in the economy. Barriers to growth and job creation should be removed by domestic policy makers.  In typical Fianna Fáil and Labour fashion this plan, although aspirational in terms of its likely impact on the economy, does not address the question of competitiveness, reducing the overall cost structure of the economy to sustain permanent employment rather than temporary training schemes.  The current round of Structural Funds provides a unique opportunity to link people with power by ensuring that decisions with respect to the formulation of plans and the disbursal of funds are made at local level rather than in Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that this is likely to be our last major opportunity to achieve significant transfers of resources through the Regional and Social Funds it is crucial to get it right and learn from past mistakes. Unfortunately, it appears that the Government is committed to maintaining centralised control over the allocation and distributions of those funds.  Instead of offering participation the Government proposes to consult the people.  This flies in the face of statements made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, in respect of the information campaign he has been seeking to wage about Europe during the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>Local people are not being given any opportunity to make a meaningful input to the way in which plans will be implemented at local level.  Is it any wonder that the Government has to expend considerable resources to ensure that the public knows what is happening in the European Union, that people feel alienated and that there is apathy about the European elections?  Instead of <Col N="926" /> devolving decision-making powers the Government is offering a confusing picture of more boards, authorities and fora which will not be held accountable at local level and to which local people will not have access.  An initiative which would have provided a mechanism to draw local communities into the European process in a meaningful way has served to reinforce the concept of Europe as distant, impersonal and imposing where power resides with the Eurocrats, not people.  Local involvement and participation have been marginalised in favour of centralised control.  Cosmetic efforts have been made to consult local people to see what their priorities are. This decision should be reversed in the amended National Development Plan to give local people more discretion.</P>
    <P>While there has been consultation in other European countries the National Development Plan was not debated in this House before it was published. Greece, for example, debated its plan for a considerable time.  In Northern Ireland, the business community and voluntary groups were asked to make submissions to the Minister of State with responsibility for its national development plan which were later discussed with them.  A balance was struck between the needs and aspirations of all sections of the community and the State.  That is a model we could have used in terms of consultation and participation by local communities.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the need for clarification in the Northern process and for North-South co-operation and institutional arrangements.  I was the only politician who discussed the National Development Plan with officials in Stormont despite the fact that there is a chapter on North-South co-operation. The Government missed an opportunity to enter into meaningful discussions to see how economic cohesion and integration can be promoted between both parts of the island to the advantage of Border areas.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State to publish the amended National Development Plan immediately and to stop playing politics because people have a right to <Col N="927" /> know.  I was impressed by her yesterday when she stated she would like to see open and transparent Government and that that was why she supported the Ethics in Public Office Bill.  She should not be afraid to publish the amended National Development Plan and not hide behind bureaucrats in Brussels and excuses that certain matters have not been resolved.  The people are now deciding how they should vote in the European elections.  This gives us an ideal opportunity to have a proper debate on European issues and on how we should spend the moneys we received from Europe.  The Minister of State should take the opportunity, therefore, to publish the amended National Development Plan this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy for members of the Government and those sitting on the Government benches who have shown a lack of imagination in some instances and too much imagination in others.  Members of both parties in Government, without exception, have ample opportunities to career around the country with gay abandon to deliver the goodies from Castlebar to Wexford and from Louth to Kerry; there is hardly a person who has not been the beneficiary of some announcement during the past few weeks.  As election day draw closer commitments are being made with increased rapidity.  It is amazing that this should happen at election time.  I suppose it is purely a coincidence and that Ministers would have done this in any event. Group water schemes, hospitals and road works have been promised but, lo and behold, the framework for expenditure in the next four years is missing.  The much vaunted national plan was examined in great detail by Members seeking inspiration but they failed.  The people in Brussels also failed to find inspiration because they had to curtail the fervour of some of the people who contributed to its construction with the result that we are poorer now than in December 1992 or January 1993, as outlined in April 1993 by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and <Col N="928" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State present.  Having discovered that we are less well off then we thought, the Government in its wisdom decided to examine the next way of deluding itself &mdash; it is not deluding anybody else &mdash; and decided not to publish the revised plan because the unfortunate people of this country might then be as wise as it in regard to its intentions.  That could not be the case because, notwithstanding the commitment to ethics in Government and so on, it would be terrible if they knew the intentions of the Government.  Publication of the revised plan is far from the minds of those in Government.</P>
      <P>It is understandable that at election time this might happen, but with the high mindedness and standards set by both parties in Government and their commitment to such ethics, the Government could depart from tradition in this case and publish the plan so that we would all know the areas in which there will be a shortfall.  However, the Government did not do that.  God help the poor people of this country, whether they live in constituencies where by-elections are about to take place or elsewhere, because ultimately some area will lose.  Somebody will be codded, but who?  Will it be the unfortunate people in Tallaght whose long awaited hospital has commenced construction, the unfortunate people of Castlebar who were promised a hospital yesterday, the mentally handicapped or those on training programmes?  What Department will be involved, what Minister will be weakest when it comes to kicking shins under the table?  What Minister will fall victim and pay the highest price?  The Government has not published its revised plan because it has not agreed on the victim.  I am sure that, as knives are being sharpened and shoes primed for the kicking sessions, a number of people will be lined up and targeted by both parties with a view to determining that they alone will get the biggest slice of the cake and under no circumstances will they be the victims of the campaign they are about to undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us are naive despite our years <Col N="929" /> here.  I was naive enough to believe even at this stage that there was some semblance of truth in what the Government has been telling us about ethics, transparency and so on for the past number of years, but I have been disappointed in that regard.  I canvassed in the west Mayo area in the past few days and met people who were the victims of the recent agreements on fishing rights.  They said that Government Ministers told them the Government was not responsible in that regard, that the bad, bold Europeans exerted the heavy hand and put a clenched fist on the poor unfortunate Irish people negotiating and fighting valiantly for the rights of their people.  Needless to say it took me some time to explain that the Government was responsible for creating a position whereby an Irish delegation was not well received in Europe. The Europeans are sick to the teeth of the bowing and scraping, the cringing, the tearing of hair, the beating of breasts, the olagóning and the begging bowl tactics. The Irish delegations negotiating in Brussels have lost credibility because the Irish have outlived their welcome there. They have spent too much time in the past six months whingeing, whining and calling for more.  Oliver Twist would not hold a candle to them.</P>
    <P>Irish Ministers should have identified the correct amount in the first place but instead they damaged our image and standing in Europe.  I hold both parties in Government responsible for that and the price will have to be paid for many years to come.  The Government does not care because it believes its destiny is to be revered in the future as &ldquo;the great white hope&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That would be acceptable if we were playing parish pump politics but they will not work in Europe.  The people in Europe are past masters in that regard, they recognise parish pump politics at a glance and know how to deal with people who embark on them.  They will laugh and neatly side-step them, as they did in this case.</P>
    <P>The revised national plan has not been published, the Government claims it is prevented from doing so by the nasty <Col N="930" /> people in Brussels who do not believe in transparency.  However, after 9 June word will filter through and there will be some indication as to the full extent of the shortfalls and their location.  We will then hear Ministers from both Government parties howling about who was hard done by.  That will be a pretty sight, one would love to be a fly on the wall when that debate takes place at Cabinet as accusations and counter-accusations fly as to who misled whom and by how much. The unfortunate victims will be the people and our standing in the European arena.</P>
    <P>I hope that somebody will resurrect a semblance of the halcyon days when both parties expressed high ideals at every available opportunity before going into Government and restore public confidence in the Government.  What I gleaned from the public on the hustings in the past few months does not indicate a great degree of confidence in the ability of the Government to do anything at any level, not even at the parish pump and that is regrettable.</P>
    <P>It is also regrettable that the Government will have to crawl back publicly from its exalted position in respect of the so-called £8 billion.  There was nothing wrong with the amount being offered in the first instance, we were delighted with it but we should not spend so much time whingeing and begging for more.  Surely we have a little pride in ourselves.  It is not good for one's dignity to be seen to be adopting such postures in the world arena during the bargaining process.  Our experiences of negotiations in the past few years have not been good &mdash; this does not apply to the GATT negotiations &mdash; but the Government parties have not shown themselves to be expert in this arena.  It behoves them to remember this because in time people will ask why different agreements were entered into and the answer will be that was the way the Government of the day handled the negotiations.  That was the way the Government handled it but the country paid the price.</P>
    <P>I hope cuts will not be made in the <Col N="931" /> health services, for example in services for the mentally handicapped, the elderly, for those in psychiatric institutions or those about to be transferred from institutional care to care in the community. I hope that vulnerable services will not be cut.  I hope also that cuts will not be made in retraining programmes and that the Government will not continue with its charade of pretence.  In suggesting there will be no change it is as if the Government is in a dream but at some stage it will have to face reality. Perhaps after the European elections, the two by-elections and the elections to urban authorities some member of the Government will tell the people that because of the shortfall in funding certain programmes will need to be cut.  I hope we will have a debate on the issue then and that we will no longer continue to live in the world of make-believe where the Government believes but does not make and is clearly seen to be lacking in its commitment to identify goals and objectives.  We have had enough of pretence.</P>

      <P>It does not matter if one project is funded 80: 20 by the Exchequer and the European Union and the other is the opposite as long as the total adds up the same way.  I am <Col N="933" /> delighted that all our flagship projects are in place.</P>
      <P>Since the plan was drawn up conditions have changed.  Our economy is a great deal better than anticipated.  Since we entered Government we have seen a rapid fall in interest rates, an upturn of confidence in the economy and an upturn in the number at work.</P>

      <P>Last month the number of unemployed fell by 6,000 and there was an increase last year of 16,000 in net non-agricultural employment.  I am sure Deputy Owen will be delighted at the announcement of an extra 2,000 jobs in north County Dublin and as a fellow Dublin Deputy she will welcome that announcement.  As the economy is doing well we are in a position to ensure that if we have to proceed more slowly than originally anticipated, the Exchequer will be in a healthy position.  The paper by Mr. Patrick Honohan in the recent ESRI medium-term review states that if an investment yields a return that is higher than the cost of funding it, that investment makes sense for the Irish Exchequer.  I made this point repeatedly in the House.</P>
      <P>Discussions are almost completed with the European Commission on the National Development Plan prior to agreement on the Community Support Framework which will set out the broad national and sectoral strategies for the use of Structural Funds.  We are at the stage of dotting the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and crossing the &ldquo;t's&rdquo;, filling in the final details.</P>

      <P>They may not have <Col N="934" /> listened to our discussions on the subject. Negotiations have gone extremely well in Brussels and the shape of the Community Support Framework will reflect the National Development Plan.  There is no question of a separate revised National Development Plan.  National authorities decide their development strategy and on the basis of this put forward their proposals for expenditure in the structural area, including the use of Structural Funds and domestic resources in the National Development Plan.  The plan is then discussed with the European Commission and following those discussions the Community Support Framework is agreed.  It will set out <i>inter alia</i> the development objectives, the priorities adopted for Community assistance and the indicative financing plan.</P>
      <P>Following adoption of the Community Support Framework, the operational programmes are approved.  These set out in more detail the objectives and measures for each of the main sectors. The programmes are the legal basis for the commitment of EU aid.  As I told the House on several occasions, we agreed the financial details with Brussels and at this stage we are filling in the small print.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan and the Community Support Framework are separate documents representing different stages in the process.  The question of a revised National Development Plan does not arise.  As I will explain later, the publication of the Community Support Framework will be a matter for the Commission in due course.</P>
      <P>In addition to expenditure proposals which will be aided under the Community Support Framework, Ireland's plan includes investments to be aided by the Cohesion Fund, under the Structural Funds Community initiative programmes and under the EFTA Cohesion Fund in the 1994-1999 period.  Those are governed by different administrative procedures to the Community Support Framework and are not part of the current negotiations.  The plan also includes eligible national structural expenditure not proposed for EU aid and 1993 expenditure, including 1993 EU aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> As Deputies are aware, the allocation of resources to Ireland agreed by the Commission in July 1993 falls within the range 8.1 to 9.3 billion ECU in 1992 prices.  Converting to Irish pounds and to 1994 prices, this is equivalent to a range of £6.9 billion to £8 billion.</P>
    <P>In October 1993 the Commission decided the amounts on which it would negotiate Community Support Frameworks for the disbursement of the Structural Funds in the period 1994-95.  These amounts do not cover all the resources in the range because 1993 Structural Fund resources were already allocated and Community initiatives and Cohesion Fund moneys are treated separately.</P>
    <P>Community Support Frameworks are broad statements of priorities and commitments and the indicative amounts of Community assistance contained in them may be subject to adjustment during the implementation period.  For Ireland, the Community Support Framework amount expressed in 1994 prices is 5.62 billion ECU or IR£4.54 billion, that is the figure we understood we would get on 24 October.  As regards Community initiatives no allocations to member states have yet been made.  Cohesion Fund resources over the period 1994-99 are expected to be in line with the figure included in the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>The allocation approved for Ireland under the Community Support Framework fell short of the amount which the Government had included in the plan in respect of the Community Support Framework element.  This shortfall was recognised and acknowledged by the Government from the outset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to distinguish between two different issues. The Community Support Framework has to be agreed now on the basis of the EU aid allocated by the Commission at this stage.  Accordingly, adjustments have been made to the expenditure allocations to take account of the shortfall in EU <Col N="936" /> aid.  That will be done on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. It is our belief and expectation that we will do better over the period.  We will continue at every stage to maximise the aid for Ireland.  We have no intention of taking our plan off the table.  However, the Community Support Framework has to be agreed on the basis of the aid now available.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan represents a set of strategies and priorities carefully chosen by the Government.  The Community Support Framework has been agreed on a <i>pro rata</i> basis reflecting those carefully chosen strategies and priorities.  As the Dáil has been previously informed, the Government has decided that in the light of the shortfall, there should be a <i>pro rata</i> reduction in the allocation to Departments under the plan.  That reduction was applied to combined EU aid and Exchequer totals.  I am somewhat amused by Deputy Durkan's description of people kicking and screaming because the agreement had been reached.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan was submitted to the Commission in October 1993.  Since then discussions have proceeded with officials and they have gone extremely well.  The detailed discussions on the Community Support Framework began in February 1994.  Agreement was reached on the major substantive issues and on the financial allocations in April. Since then officials in the Commission and in the Government Departments concerned have been working on the preparation of the text and sorting out issues of detail &mdash; literally the small print. The final items relating to matters such as the completion of the list of development indicators to be included, verification of some statistics and fine tuning of the text are being wrapped up at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft Community Support Framework is likely to be submitted shortly by the Commission services to the Commission for approval.  Following Commission approval, the draft Community Support Framework will be sent to four Community level committees which deal with Structural Fund matters for their opinions.  That procedure is likely to take <Col N="937" /> about three weeks.  The Commission will then formally approve and publish the Community Support Framework.  Therefore, it is not possible at this stage to give a precise date on which the Community Support Framework will be published; I hope it will be early July at the latest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have nothing to hide.  We put our figures on the table and put forward a <i>pro rata</i> proposition which has been agreed by the Commission and the information is available.  It is now a question of publication by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the Structural Funds state that unless otherwise agreed with the member-state concerned, the Commission shall take a decision approving the Community Support Framework not later than six months after receiving the plan.  The process has proved to be more time consuming than has been expected on either side.  That is not only the case for Ireland, the same applies to other member states.  We are anxious to wrap up the matter, draw down the money and move on.  There is no delay on our side.  I would have been happier if it could have been published before now.  It is important that the officials take the necessary time to ensure that the detailed work is finalised properly. Although it has taken a little longer to finalise, that should not be a matter of great concern.  Our operational programmes were submitted before the end of April and detailed work on them has been on a parallel line with that of the Community Support Framework. Expenditure from 1 January 1994 is eligible for EU assistance.  Furthermore a significant part of the expenditure is Exchequer-financed and expenditure in areas such as roads, sanitary services, industry, agriculture, training and education has been provided for in the normal Estimates process and has been going ahead from the beginning of the year, even if final agreement with the Commission has not been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Government <Col N="938" /> has some reason to delay the publication of the Community Support Framework, but the opposite is the case. I am anxious to get it up and running. The Community Support Framework will demonstrate how wrong Members of the Opposition were in their prediction in previous debates on this matter.  Our negotiations have gone extremely well in Brussels.  I listened to some fiction about the description of the discussions between the officials in my Department and the officials in Brussels, which have been extremely business-like.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The attack by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, on officials in Brussels is not fiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The priorities we have addressed are included, particularly our strong emphasis on education and training, which was endorsed by the independent study of the plan sought by the Commission and carried out by Philip O'Connell and Patrick Honohan in the ESRI.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan said that competitiveness was not taken on board.  One of the four pillars of the plan is to improve our competitiveness and make Ireland a better place in which to do business by reducing costs, particularly in the area of transport and communications.  Regarding the involvement of local communities, this plan places radical emphasis on the area of devolved local development. Community and voluntary sector interests will be formally represented, as appropriate, on the monitoring committees and on the sub-regional committees set up under the regional authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Durkan about the need to maintain and increase expenditure for the mentally handicapped. Since we entered Government we have made this a priority.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, has ensured that we are spending an additional £25 million in the area of mentally handicap.  I hope we will be able to improve on that as we draw down additional funds under <Col N="939" /> Community initiatives and allocate the fruits of increased economic growth to caring for people who are not in a position to fight for themselves.  I endorse his plea in that area.  He can be assured that plea will be answered.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy as set out in the National Development Plan has been endorsed by the Commission and the discussion has been marked by a large measure of agreement.  All the key elements of the plan are in place.  The total amount of EU aid is less than we expected, so the pace of implementation may be affected.  I agree with Members opposite that we need to ensure value for money.  We do not want any more Kilrush marinas or projects which do not provide the best value for public money.  Because of our healthy economic position it will be more difficult to get as generous a share of EU aid in the next round.  We must ensure that we spend each Ecu in the most effective way possible.  I have asked the Department of Finance to draw up revised guidelines for the appraisal and management of projects and they are at an advanced stage of preparation.  We say loud and clear to those concerned with spending these moneys that we want value for money.  We want each project judged to ensure that the correct amount of money is spent and no more.  We do not want Rolls Royce projects where a more modest specification would ensure effective value for public money.</P>
    <P>We want rigorous appraisal and management of all aspects of projects to see they are designed and implemented in the most economical, efficient and effective way possible.  Within the fixed allocations for each sector it is obvious that any over design of excess capacity built into projects or inefficiency in project management will reduce the overall number of projects that can be undertaken over the period and this must be avoided.  It is important to secure better value for money than we got in the last round of the Structural Funds.  That message must be got across and clear to ensure that we get the best value for our investment in terms of a long term contribution to <Col N="940" /> Ireland's output and economic performance. That is the purpose of the plan and on what we will deliver.  We have nothing to hide and are anxious to publish. We were looking for <i>pro rata</i> and we have got that.  I am very happy that we will get that in the context of the very substantial local development programme slightly increased over what we looked for.  There was very substantial local consultation and involvement, something that is new in this plan, a particular focus on unemployment black spots.  I hope that in the better economic climate to which we look forward we can ensure that those most in need are not left out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of participating in the debate on the motion before the House.  The National Development Plan is a substantial programme of investment of £17 billion, the biggest investment in the State since its foundation and an achievement of which the Government can be proud.  The impact of spending such funds, if invested wisely, will be considerable.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Government addressed all major national interests in the plan and focuses on the need to create an environment for sustainable employment. It is a challenge to any Government to have such funds available for investment in the country.  In Ireland there is a great fund of talent and it is hoped that with that mix we will get the cocktail right in the coming years.  Under this and the last Government Ireland has an outstanding record of achievement. This has been the case under Fianna Fáil-led administrations since 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us clear the decks on this.  The Deputy's party said publicly that the amount would be £3 billion and other parties suggested different figures. In those negotiations Ireland proved the most successful in terms of funds per head of population.  Fine Gael criticised the Taoiseach on that occasion.  When it was deemed necessary to reduce our allocation slightly Fine Gael took the opportunity yet again to jump on the bandwagon.</P>

      <P>People listening to a debate of this nature do not want to get into the politics of politics because they do not like it.  Perhaps it is because of its tactics that the Deputy's party is hovering at around 20 per cent in the opinion polls regardless of what it does.  It is attacking a national development plan which addresses all the major national issues <Col N="942" /> and addresses the issue of singular concern to everybody in Ireland today, that is, the need to create the right environment for sustainable employment. What does Fine Gael do except bash the plan and the fact that the Taoiseach was so successful in getting such high funding for Ireland?  If one wanted to make comparisons one could look at what the Fine Gael-led administration did while in office.</P>

      <P>Post Leaving Certificate programmes were developed as part of the second-level education system and are provided by second-level schools throughout the country, in over 200 different locations, thereby maximising access by students and facilitating responsiveness to local needs.</P>
      <P>At present, in excess of 17,000 students participate in Post Leaving Certificate Courses which are provided in schools as an integral element of the Vocational Preparation and Training Programme (VPT2) operated by my Department with support from the Structural Funds of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The cost of delivery of these courses is provided by my Department through the payment of teachers' salaries, grants for equipment and inservice training for teachers.  I have secured over £30 million for the next six years, in the National Development Plan, to fund a major programme of inservice education of teachers, at first and second level. Teachers engaged in the delivery of PLC courses are part of the target group which will benefit significantly from this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that a means tested grants scheme to cover both fees and maintenance for PLC students would cost £10 million.  In the case of the PLC courses it has been considered more important to concentrate on improving the quality of the system, through investment in national certification and assessment arrangements, in programme development, in inservice training, and <Col N="740" /> in ensuring that those courses continue to be available in a wide range of disciplines for as many students as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not have any proposals at present to initiate a study on the level of <Col N="741" /> permanent suspensions from primary and second-level schools.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with management authorities, teacher unions and parent representations, my Department issued &ldquo;Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline&rdquo; to schools in 1990 and 1991.</P>
      <P>The guidelines do not include a system of reporting suspensions to the Department. They do provide that, where parents feel aggrieved with a decision to expel a student, they may bring the matter to the attention of my Department which arranges for appropriate investigation.</P>
      <P>However, the question of suspensions and expulsion from school were among the issues considered by a working party which was set up to review the School Attendance Act 1926.  The report of the working party contains a number of relevant recommendations.  The report was published in April 1994 in order to stimulate wider debate in the issues concerned. This report and comments on it from interested parties is under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>I might add that the position paper on regional education councils which I published in March 1994 suggests that the regional education councils could provide parents with an appeal forum on issues which had been raised and not satisfactorily resolved at school level.</P>

      <P>The data available to me indicate that the 1983 level of student maintenance grant when adjusted for movements in the consumer price index (CPI) is within 0.5 per cent of the 1993 grant level.  The data also indicate that if one were to compare the grant level in 1980 adjusted for CPI movements the 1993 grant level would represent an increase in real terms of nearly 8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to fees the increase between <Col N="746" /> 1983 and 1993 was 116 per cent.  However students who qualify for a maintenance grant also qualify to have their fees paid in full.  Increases in fees, therefore, do not adversely affect such students.</P>
    <P>Overall expenditure on third level student support has increased from some £15 million in 1983 to over £85 million in 1993, an increase of £70 million or 467 per cent.  The increase in real terms is 290 per cent.  The number of students in receipt of grant aid has increased from around 18,000 in 1983/84 to over 52,000 in 1993/94.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed under the Programme for a Partnership Government to continuing improvement of the schemes of third level student support to ensure that no student is deprived of access to third level education because of his or her financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>Among the improvements I have already announced in the 1994 student support schemes is an increase in the maintenance grant in line with inflation and in the income limits in line with the increase in the average industrial wage. In addition I have also provided £200,000 in 1994 to establish a hardship fund with the third level institutions.  I will review the adequacy of this provision on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The Government is continuing its study of the other significant findings of the Advisory Committee on third level student support.</P>

      <P>I welcome the survey in question as an addition to the information already available to my Department.  In relation to the 170 schools identified by the INTO as being substandard, the position is as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;20 have already proceeded to construction as part of the 1993 capital programme</P>
      <P>&mdash; 23 have had their problems addressed by a project already underway or already sanctioned under the minor and emergency works scheme</P>
      <P>&mdash;42 are on the list of major projects to go to construction in 1994.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining 85 schools</P>
      <P>&mdash;65 are under consideration for inclusion in the programme of major works in 1995 or under the minor and emergency scheme</P>
      <P>&mdash;19 are schools in respect of which no application for improvement has been made</P>
      <P>&mdash;1 school is due to close in 1994.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently launched a comprehensive national survey of primary school accommodation following an initial pilot study scheme in approximately 20 representative national schools.  It is intended that this national survey will be completed by July of this year.</P>
      <P>As I have said in reply to previous parliamentary questions, I accept there is an urgent need to continue a high level of investment in the capital programme for primary schools.  The <i>Programme for Government 1993-1997</i> reflects this necessity by undertaking that there will be increased expenditure in each of those five years on the school building programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made and continues to be made on the upgrading of primary school accommodation. The capital funding for the national <Col N="749" /> school building programme in 1993 was £19.1 million and the allocation for 1994 is £26 million, an increase of 36 per cent. The 1994 programme has provision for 73 additional contracts for major building projects and it is expected also that upwards of 1,500 other schools will have grants approved for a range of improvement and refurbishment works.  This includes a special programme for the upgrading of sanitation facilities in schools where these have been identified as inadequate.  I am satisfied therefore that everything possible is being done to meet the accommodation needs of primary schools.</P>

      <P>My Department has not had discussions with the Department of Equality and Law Reform on the gender balance of senior officer positions within my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I was pleased in August of last year to respond to the invitation of my colleague the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to nominate a representative of my Department to the Monitoring Committee on Implementation <Col N="751" /> of the Programme drawn from the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>All Departments including mine were asked to respond to the recommendations of the commission which fell within their terms of reference.</P>
    <P>One of the areas addressed by the commission was the low proportion of women on school inspectorate staff.  The commission recommend that my Department should review the recruitment, deployment and working procedures of primary and post-primary school inspectors with the aim of increasing the number of women inspectors.  This review is now in place and I would hope to see a substantial improvement in the gender balance both at recruitment and more senior levels.</P>
    <P>I have recently received from the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, a copy of the report on a Survey of Equal Opportunities in the Public Sector.  This report causes great concern as it highlights the virtual absence of women from senior management in the public sector. The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has sought and will get my cooperation in the introduction of progressive policies of equal opportunities to ensure that the current pattern of inequality within the public sector is effectively reduced.</P>
    <P>My Department is an equal opportunities employer and fully subscribes to the Equal Opportunities Policy and Guidelines for the Civil Service.  The objective of this policy is to ensure that all staff have an equal chance to develop their potential and to advance on the basis of merit and ability.</P>

      <P>The Higher Education Authority <Col N="752" /> has instituted a unit cost project in the university sector.  The process is being refined over time and is being used at present to inform funding decisions by the authority as well as by university management.</P>
      <P>No unit cost exercise has yet been carried out in the regional technical colleges. I consider that any such exercise should wait until the process in the universities has been sufficiently developed, refined and evaluated.  However a cost effectiveness measure &mdash; teaching hours per annum per student &mdash; is being widely used within the regional technical college sector and by my Department to assist in the management process.</P>
      <P>The two sectors within higher education have a common concern to provide the highest quality education for their students and to act as catalysts of social and economic development in their regions and nationally.  Both sectors seek to realise these aims through complementary but different and distinct programmes and activities in teaching and research.  Any valid unit cost comparison would necessarily have to take into account the complementary but different roles of the two sectors.</P>

    <P>It is anticipated that about 4,580 superintendents <Col N="753" /> will be employed in connection with the written examinations for the 1994 junior and leaving certificates. The exact number will not be known until after the examinations are over as it will be necessary to open special centres during the examinations to cope with candidates who fall ill and cannot be accommodated in ordinary centres.  A further 1,000 or so superintendents will be employed in connection with the practical examinations.</P>
    <P>Superintendents of written examinations are appointed by my Department. Superintendents of practical examinations are appointed by school principals and vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The total number of examiners required to cope with the oral, practical and written examinations for the junior and leaving certificate examinations will be 7,320.  All will be appointed by my Department.</P>

      <P>With a view to minimising the financial burden on parents in the provision of school text books for their children my Department has been recommending the establishment of book rental schemes in schools for some years now. To facilitate the introduction of such schemes guidelines for the operation of book rental schemes were issued to all schools in August, 1991.  A significant <Col N="754" /> number of schools already operate such schemes.</P>
      <P>The main finding in the consultant's report referred to in the Deputy's question was that book rental schemes are the most practical method of reducing the cost of school books to parents.  Copies of the report have been sent to all schools with a view to stimulating the establishment of rental schemes in schools which do not already have them.  The report contains a number of useful suggestions including a code of good practice for the successful operation of book rental schemes.  In the final analysis, the establishment of a rental scheme is a matter for decision by each individual school.</P>
      <P>The provision of seed capital for the start-up of book rental schemes is a particular problem for schools in disadvantaged areas.  As an initial step to address this problem, I am making £65,000 available this year to help schools classified as disadvantaged, which commit themselves to book rental schemes, to overcome the problem of seed capital.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>At present, over 17,000 students attend PLC courses as part of my Department's vocational preparation and training programme.  These courses are delivered in second level schools and colleges and have been developed as part of the second-level education system, with substantial support from the European Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>The third level student support schemes do not apply to PLC courses. The Deputies should be aware that a means tested grants scheme to cover both fees and maintenance for PLC courses would cost of the order of £10 million per annum.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies will appreciate the need to strike a balance between competing demands for resources, both ESF and Exchequer, in the education sector &mdash; between funding for the different levels of the system, between initial and second chance education, between student supports, investment in quality assurance, and special measures to combat disadvantage and underachievement.</P>
      <P>In the case of PLC courses I consider it more important to concentrate on improving the quality of the system, through investment in national certification and assessment arrangements, in programme development, in in-service training, and in ensuring that courses continue to be available in a wide range of disciplines for as many students as possible.</P>
      <P>As part of the National Development Plan, I have secured substantial resources for the development of authoritative, national certification for vocational education and training programmes, including PLC programmes, and for the provision of a major programme of in-service education for teachers at first and second-level, including teachers delivering PLC courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the National Council for Vocational Awards will this year commence the award of nationally accredited certification to <Col N="756" /> students completing PLC courses.  This is a significant contribution to enhancing the status of these programmes and will be of considerable benefit to students.</P>
    <P>The Deputies have not given particulars of the courses in Northern Ireland and Great Britain to which they refer in their question.  They will appreciate, therefore, that I cannot comment in detail on them.  However, what I have outlined are my current priorities for the development of this sector, having regard to what best serves the varying needs of all students at the different levels of education and having regard to making the best use of available resources.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to establish league tables of competence at languages of whole peoples in the states of the EU.</P>
      <P>There is a perception that speakers of English in general, and not only Irish people, are weak in their speaking ability of continental languages.  Much of the extensive language teaching in the past was less concerned with speaking ability than with reading of literature.  It has been observed that such activities as marketing have been adversely affected by our inability to speak fluently in continental languages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second level schools are encouraged in a variety of ways to promote the teaching of continental languages.  Language programmes are in place at junior certificate and leaving certificate levels.  The study of a continental language is a compulsory part of the leaving certificate vocational programme.  Arrangements have been made for the <i>ab-initio</i> study of a continental language at senior cycle, that is where senior cycle pupils can begin the <Col N="757" /> study of a language and sit the junior certificate examination paper in that subject at the time of sitting their leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>In addition to standard staffing and financial resources made available to schools, my Department is prepared, in certain cases, to sanction extra part-time teaching hours for the introduction of continental languages.</P>
    <P>Resources are also provided for the professional development of language teachers, including grants to enable teachers to attend courses in teaching and methodology in a target language country.  These teachers are replaced during this time by a native speaker who is a qualified full-time teacher in his-her country.  In addition, each year foreign language assistants who are usually trainee teachers from mainland European countries are available to work in our schools alongside Irish language teachers and under their guidance.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made under the LINGUA and other EU programmes for teacher exchange and for teacher and pupil exchange.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 54 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>I did not have any plan to remove grants from second level schools that operate selective entrance tests based on academic ability.</P>
      <P>In discussions between my Department and the managerial bodies, and in the subsequent discussions on a draft agreement, the official side did suggest that financial sanctions might be necessary to ensure compliance with the proposal to abolish the school entrance tests &mdash; a proposal which was shared by all parties to the discussions.</P>
      <P>The management side assured my Department that financial sanctions would not be necessary and agreed to establish monitoring committees.</P>
      <P>The objective of abolishing selective entry tests based on academic ability has been achieved by agreement.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the INTO criticism.  My Department has responded to the INTO, informally, in the above terms.</P>
      <P>The agreement covers fee-paying schools as well as schools within the Free Education Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any second-level school which still continues to hold entrance tests.  Should such a case be <Col N="762" /> brought to the attention of the Department, the monitoring process built into the agreement with the managerial associations would be invoked.</P>

      <P>Art, craft, design is available as a subject in 90 per cent of the post-primary schools and is taken by some 45 per cent of the relevant students.</P>
      <P>This is a very satisfactory situation considering that no school could provide every option from the very wide range of options available and that, in any event, time constraints would make it impossible for all pupils to avail of all options.</P>
      <P>Specialist facilities for art, craft, design are provided in all new schools.  The planning and building unit of my Department considers applications from the authorities of existing post-primary schools for extensions which include provision for the teaching of art, craft, design.  Any application which is received from a school which is unable to provide the subject because of a lack of facilities receives special consideration.</P>
      <P>My Department has been very supportive of art, craft, design by way of incareer development, publications, advice and encouragement from inspectors, the introduction of a new and exciting syllabus and providing a very elaborate examination process.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 56, 58 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>As you are aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to the introduction of intermediate education structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was requested at the National Education Convention, which was held last October, to prepare a position paper elaborating my thinking on intermediate education structures.  This was an input into the consultative process.  Extensive roundtable discussions, involving the concerned interests including representatives of the Church of Ireland, were completed last Thursday.  Professor John Coolahan, Secretary General to the Convention, who chaired the relevant &ldquo;Analysis of Issues&rdquo; group and Dr. Séamus McGuinness who acted as rapporteur <Col N="765" /> to the group, are acting as chairman and rapporteur of the Roundtable Group.  I now expect a report of their discussions very shortly.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the paper are an input to an ongoing consultative process, initiated at the National Education Convention. They are clearly neither final ministerial nor Government proposals.  It is made absolutely clear in the paper that final decisions will be informed by the views of all concerned and that these decisions will be made by the Government on proposals from myself, as Minister. The purpose of the paper is to give the interests an opportunity to influence the outcome.  In approaching the preparation of the White Paper, I have sought to provide all concerned interests with the opportunity to make their views and concerns known.  I have undertaken to listen carefully, and take full account of, the views of all relevant interests.</P>
    <P>I am confident that given the very constructive nature of the debate to date and the very high level of engagement among the partners with the issues, the publication of the paper and the ensuing debate will greatly facilitate both myself, as Minister, and the Government in finalising proposals on this key issue.  The arrangements for the funding of intermediate education structures will be addressed in the White Paper, which will contain the final policy decisions on the matter.</P>

      <P>Figures on the lines requested by the Deputy are not available within my Department.  The purpose of the third level student support schemes is to facilitate access to third level for students who because of low personal or parental income would not normally be able to support their attendance at third level.</P>
      <P>In 1992 major changes were made to the income limits applicable under the third level student support schemes.  The limits were increased by 40 per cent which, for example, enabled a family with one to three dependent children to qualify for a grant of full fees and maintenance on an income of £15,000 compared with the previous income limit of £10,787.  These limits were further increased by 3.4 per cent in 1993 and 5.4 per cent in the 1994 schemes.  These increases represent significant improvements in the third level student support arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already announced a number of improvements in the student support provisions for 1994 in relation to the attainments requirements, second chance students, increases in the maintenance grant and income limits and the establishment of a hardship fund.  The <Col N="767" /> hardship fund will be administered with third level institutions for the benefit of individual students already attending college where assistance on a flexible basis is required because of exceptional unforeseen circumstances and where assistance under the general student support schemes is not available or is inadequate.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the various initiatives and improvements is that the provision for third level student support in 1994 is over £101 million and some 60 per cent of third level students are expected to receive grant aid in 1994.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Education, I am implementing a broad range of measures in the context of an extended programme of in-career development for teachers, including teachers dealing with the needs of children with learning difficulties.  My Department has issued priority lists for the attention of course providers at both first and second levels.  Identified priorities include literacy and numeracy; special education; the identification, remediation and prevention of learning difficulties in pupils; providing for children with special needs and with specific disabilities in mainstream national schools; the education of traveller children; special school requirements; psychological and guidance activities.</P>
      <P>In addition, courses dealing with the following specific needs of children with special needs and those with specific learning disabilities are planned, many on a cross-sectoral-primary second level basis: revised programmes of training in remedial education, courses for teachers of severe and profoundly mentally handicapped children, courses for teachers of special classes at post-primary level, courses for resource teachers and visiting teachers, courses for teachers of travelling children, courses for teachers of the emotionally disturbed, visually and hearing impaired and physically handicapped, courses for teachers involved in the home-school liaison scheme and courses for teachers of migrant children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the examinations, my <Col N="769" /> Department operates a scheme of special consideration which is intended for candidates who, because of a physical or psychological disability, would be unable to demonstrate the knowledge they have learned to an examiner and is aimed, as far as possible, at removing the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance. The scheme is currently under review and among the items under consideration is the question of whether reference should be made on the certificate to any special conditions under which the examination was conducted.  The present practice is not to refer in any way to such matters on the certificates.  This practice will be continued in 1994.</P>
    <P>With regard to the future, I can certainly assure you that no change in current practice will take place without the fullest consideration of all the issues involved and that, if any change is determined, schools and candidates will be advised well in advance of examinations.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be well aware of my commitment to the on-going improvement of educational services for all children with special educational needs. Since assuming office, I have sought to ensure that additional resources have been targeted on areas of educational disadvantage.  In the remedial area, for example, I allocated an additional 80 posts to national schools in 1993 and recently announced a further allocation of 100 such posts from September next. As a result of these allocations, the total number of remedial posts in national schools will have risen to 1,133.  This in turn will mean that 2,046 schools with approximately 84 per cent of primary school pupils will have access to a remedial service.  I will also be allocating an additional 120 posts to the special education area from September next. The precise deployment of these posts is being actively considered at the present time in order to ensure that they are targeted on areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>In addition, I recently announced a range of radical increases in the rates of special capitation funding provided for pupils with special educational needs. These new rates not only include major <Col N="770" /> increases for all recipients of special capitation funding, but incorporate, for the first time, specific higher rates for pupils of post-primary age.  Nor are any of the foregoing measures being introduced on an <i>ad-hoc</i> or haphazard basis.  I am guided in my actions by the recommendations contained in the report of the Special Education Review Committee, which represents the most comprehensive examination of the special needs area ever undertaken in the State. The report of the review committee in turn is part of a development process centred on the forthcoming White Paper on Education and the Education Act which will follow.  I can assure the House that this basic framework for the future of our education service will have as one of its basic objectives to make appropriate provisions for all children with special educational needs.</P>

Schools authorities were formally notified of this decision and advised that the posts would be allocated to schools based on need and existing remedial provision.

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the significant increase in the employment of unqualified persons as substitute teachers in that on average each day about 200 people without formal training or qualification teach about 6,000 children; if the employment of so many unqualified people is satisfactory; the steps, if any, she intends to take to ensure that children will not be left in the hands of unqualified persons; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that boards of management of primary schools in certain <Col N="773" /> areas are having some difficulties in obtaining the services of qualified substitute teachers.  Each board of management which employs an unqualified person must certify that every effort has been made to obtain the services of a qualified person.  Such certification is required by my Department before payment in respect of the substitute is issued. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have initiated a number of measures to alleviate these difficulties as I believe that every effort must be made to have qualified teachers teaching in the classroom.</P>
      <P>A pilot supply teacher project was established last September.  Under this pilot project 30 temporary teachers are providing substitute cover for short term certified sick leave in three designated areas.  The pilot project will operate for two school years.  On completion its results will be carefully considered in my Department.</P>
      <P>Last September the intake to the colleges of education was increased substantially. I have also approved the establishment of a special primary teacher training course for graduates.  I propose that more than 100 graduates will be trained in this way to be available for the commencement of the school year 1996-97.  These measures will significantly increase the number of qualified teachers.  I should say however, that it will not always be possible to provide substitutes at short notice and particularly for absences of short duration.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 95, 110 and 347 of 6 October on the matter of stress and burnout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that reply I stated that improvements which I am making in the education system at school level will have a beneficial effect in reducing stress in the <Col N="775" /> teaching profession.  The following initiatives, which will, I believe, help the teachers, are in place: the pupil-teacher ratios have been improved at both primary and post-primary levels; I have introduced a scheme of job-sharing for all post-primary teachers; under the terms of the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i> ex-quota vice-principals have been appointed and additional guidance services provided in the larger schools; home-school-community liaison schemes have been introduced for primary and post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas; and my Department has issued comprehensive guidelines on a code of discipline for schools.</P>
    <P>The introduction of revised and alternative curricula at both junior and senior cycle of second level education will give pupils a wider choice of programmes suitable to their needs and abilities and provide greater motivation for all students to take an active part in school life.</P>
    <P>I believe that these initiatives will help to reduce major causes of stress which have been identified by teachers themselves.</P>
    <P>Much publicity has been given to the demands for early retirement in the context of increased levels of stress experienced by teachers.  The teacher unions have claimed enhanced early retirement arrangements for their members.  Negotiations on these claims are taking place within the Teachers' Conciliation Council. Under the terms of the Conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers, the proceedings of the council are confidential.</P>
    <P>The council has issued a statement indicating that all sides have agreed to participate in a working group of the council at which all outstanding aspects of the claims can be examined.  All parties agreed that discussions in the working group will be substantive and will be concluded by 30 September, 1994.</P>
    <P>A working party consisting of representatives of management, teachers and my Department is being set up for the purpose of bringing forward proposals for the establishment of a welfare <Col N="776" /> service for teachers.  The question of stress and burnout will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 189 together.  Detailed information is not available on the number of schools in Cork damaged by vandalism, the extent of such vandalism or the cost of repairs.</P>
      <P>Security of school buildings is a matter for the school authorities in the first instance.  In the case of primary, secondary and vocational schools the cost of repairing damage from vandalism is borne by the schools' insurance and my Department is not normally provided with details.  There are therefore no specific figures available in respect of those schools for the costs arising directly from vandalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At post-primary level all new schools and major extensions are designed with provision for intruder alarm systems. Alarm systems may also be provided as resources permit in existing second-level schools where the need is established. Grants are also provided for such systems in national schools in high-risk urban areas.  In addition security lighting and perimeter fencing is provided where the particular circumstances of the school <Col N="777" /> warrant it.  Many schools, particularly in the large urban areas, have also found it necessary to employ security guards to protect their buildings.</P>
    <P>In the case of ten schools in the Finglas area of Dublin, which have been heavily vandalised, a pilot scheme on school security is being operated to provide night security involving a guard and guard dogs.  The scheme is being monitored on an ongoing basis and will be reviewed at the end of the current school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of the ECU as a parallel rather than a replacement currency was considered in the period leading up to the Treaty on European Union, but the member states decided to take a different route.  This is set out in the Treaty. In brief, it requires the substitution of national currencies by a single currency in stage three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), when the participants in European Monetary Union will have achieved the required degree of convergence in their economies.  The single currency will thus be based on a firm foundation of sound and convergent economic performance by the participants in European Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>The single currency will be administered by the European Central Bank. The main advantages of a single currency are of course the elimination of exchange rate risk and transaction charges in trade between participating countries and the provision of low interest rates and a stable environment for investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A parallel currency would not offer such advantages.  Furthermore, its introduction <Col N="779" /> would be inconsistent with the fact that monetary policy will remain the responsibility of the member states until the beginning of stage three of European Monetary Union, and would require the creation of a new central authority, complete with adequate resources, to administer it and support its value.  I see no desire among member states to take these steps.</P>
    <P>The European Central Bank provided for in the Treaty will be established only when the decision to move to stage three of European Monetary Union has been taken or, at the latest, immediately after 1 July 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82, 83, 84, 87 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>In an effort to assess the impact of tourist shooting particularly on migratory species, returns of game bags were requested from promoters.  A total of 57 returns were received for the 1993/1994 hunting season.  In addition the National Parks and Wildlife Services (NPWS) Rangers regularly check shooting parties and inspect game bags.  An analysis of both of these indicate minimal impact on numbers.  I believe that these are very important measures in assessing the impact of commercial shooting on wild birds particularly migratory species over the years.</P>
      <P>Thirty-seven licences were issued to hunt pen-reared hen pheasants during the open season for cock pheasants from 1 November 1993 to 31 January 1994. Twelve licences were issued to hunt pen-reared pheasants after the open season closed on 31 January 1994.  These licences ranged from five to 28 days and averaged 13 days.  Three licences were issued to hunt pen-reared partridge up to 31 January 1994.</P>
      <P>The assessment and allocation of &ldquo;gun-days&rdquo; to tourist shoot promoters by the NPWS does not involve the award of a contract by the Commissioners of Public Works and, consequently, does not fall within the ambit of the tax clearance procedure for public sector bodies and I have no plans to extend this procedure to such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourist shoot promoters have to submit details (leases, maps, etc.) of their shooting rights to the NPWS so that these can be assessed for &ldquo;gun day&rdquo; capacity and hunting licences are granted or refused with reference to these assessments. Maps are requested to assist in identifying lands, but in most cases shooting lands are well known and long established. In particular copies of Coillte leases which do not contain maps are <Col N="781" /> usually sufficient to identify the lands. In the 1993/1994 season 12 tourist shoot operators submitted maps.</P>
    <P>Gun days are issued based on an assessment of the shooting capacity of the lands in question.  In general allocations would be based on 1,000 acres per day per three guns.  However, if a considerable amount of commonage is included, the number of guns would be reduced to one-two guns per 1,000 acres.  With regards to Coillte lettings, the general rule of thumb would be 140 acres per day per gun. These are general criteria and each case is assessed on its own merit at the time.</P>

      <P>Tax clearance procedures have been in operation for public contracts and grants since June 1986 and March 1988 respectively. In 1992, I announced that tax clearance would be extended to a broad range of licences concentrating initially on licences issued by the Revenue Commissioners. The scope of the tax clearance procedures as a means of ensuring that tax obligations are complied with is kept under active review.  I have no plans at present to extend tax clearance to the area of tourist shooting.</P>

      <P>Under the legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) Scheme, people in full-time employment are excluded, in all but exceptional circumstances, from receipt of an allowance.  People in part-time employment may qualify for assistance under the SWA scheme including rent supplements, subject to the normal rules for the scheme.  For the purpose of SWA part-time employment is employment of less than 30 hours per week.</P>
      <P>The extension of entitlement to rent supplements and other assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to people in full-time employment would have major financial implications for social welfare and assistance with housing costs.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement (FIS) scheme is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.  At the end of April 1994 there were 9,741 families in receipt of a FIS payment compared to 7,187 at the end of April 1993.  I will be increasing the qualifying income limits for the scheme by an additional £10 from the end of July 1994 which will ensure that the uptake of this employment support is extended to more families on low incomes.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> As I indicated in response to question 102 from the Deputy on 19 April 1994, I have undertaken to inform the relatives of the victims of the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings of my evaluation of the Garda assessment of the contents of the Yorkshire Television programme on the bombings before issuing a public statement on the matter.  Out of courtesy to the relatives and in the interest of making a comprehensive public statement in due course, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to respond to the detailed questions now being put by the Deputy.  As stated in the reply to the aforementioned question, I have sought certain additional information and advice to enable me to comply with the undertaking I have given.  I can assure the Deputy that everything possible is being done to fulfil this undertaking as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>It is not the usual practice for Ministers for Justice to make statements to the House about matters of this kind. However, in view of the insinuation contained in Question No. 101, I consider it appropriate, in this instance, to state that the Garda authorities have no evidence of such an incident having taken place at the time specified.  The only other comment I would make is that this Government, like all its predecessors, would be opposed to any practice which would tend to undermine in any way the principle of police primacy in this State.</P>

        <i>Wexford):</i> The European Communities (Dangerous Substances and Preparations) (Marketing and Use) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No. 79 of 1994), which were made by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on 6 April 1994, give effect, <i>inter alia,</i> to certain provisions of Council Directive 91/157/EEC concerning the marking and marketing of <Col N="799" /> batteries and accumulators.

      <P>Discussions have been underway for some time at EU Council level on a proposal from the European Commission for a carbon-energy tax.  The Irish position is that we would be prepared to support the introduction of such a tax provided certain concerns are satisfactorily addressed.  These concerns relate to ensuring that any agreement takes account of the different levels of economic and social development in individual member states; satisfactory provision as regards the impact on the peat sector and the maintenance of the competitiveness of EU industry generally <Col N="800" /> and of energy intensive industries facing competition from firms not subject to similar charges.</P>
      <P>The Greek Presidency proposals on the carbon-energy tax will be considered at the Committee of Permanent Representatives on June 1 before being examined by the Environment Council on 8-9 June.  The Irish position will be framed having regard to the concerns which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>In so far as I have a function in this matter it derives from my statutory role as licensing authority for all fish farming operations governing their location, management, fish husbandry and production parameters.  The use of all veterinary medical products is regulated under legislation administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, while the National Drugs Advisory Board is the competent product-licensing authority under EU and national legislation.</P>
      <P>An organo-phosphorous insecticide based on dichlorvos &mdash; tradename Nuvan &mdash; has been used for some years by the salmon farming industry to control sea lice on farmed salmon.  The National Drugs Advisory Board, as the assessor for the product licence for Nuvan, approved its use in the aquatic environment. International findings indicate that, properly used, dichlorvos poses no risk to public health.  There is also no evidence to suggest that its use in fish farming has had an adverse impact on fish or on the environment.  The active ingredient does not persist in the marine environment.  Very little dichlorvos enters the salmon flesh where, in any event, it would be broken down rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sea trout task force in its report published last March recommended that the elimination of sea lice on and in the vicinity of sea farms should be a constant priority of management and regulatory practice.  In line with those recommendations <Col N="803" /> every effort is being made to ensure that sea lice levels at fish farms are controlled through the use of effective treatment and other lice-eliminating measures.  Ongoing results from the Department's lice monitoring programmes show that lice levels are being controlled at satisfactorily low levels. Enhanced fish farm management and fallowing strategies are also being deployed in controlling lice levels and should commensurately reduce the need for applied treatment for lice control.</P>

      <P>The expert group on the food industry, which was established in response to a recommendation of the Culliton report, undertook a comprehensive review of the Irish food industry.  A key recommendation of <Col N="810" /> the expert group's report was the need to support food research and development activities.</P>
      <P>The group also recommended the drawing up of a new national programme for the food industry.  This programme, which will take the form of a special sub-programme in the next round of the Structural Funds, includes support for research and development, as well as providing assistance for capital investment, marketing and promotion and human resources.</P>
      <P>Research and development will be aided in two ways.  Funding will be provided for both institutional and in-company research and development.  The £7 million funding which was announced recently concerns institutional research and development and represents the allocation for 1994.  Pending finalisation of negotiations with the EU Commission it is not possible to confirm in precise terms the total amount of funding which will be available for food research and development activities for the period 1994-1999, but it is expected to be substantial.</P>
      <P>Any research institution with a food project can apply for funding.  A research committee with a predominant representation from the food industry has recently been appointed to assess these projects.  This will ensure that public good research will take due account of market requirements.</P>

Although he was paid on 50 cows in 1992 his quota premium rights are 48 as he was required to surrender two rights to the national reserve.  He was paid the final instalment of £1,423.62 due under this scheme on 48 cows on 24 April 1994.</P>

      <P>The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is an autonomous international governmental organisation founded in 1957 under a decision of the United Nations.  It has 113 members and Ireland has been a member since 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the agency's mandate generally is to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear <Col N="820" /> energy, a number of aspects of its work are of interest to Ireland, mainly nuclear safety and radiological protection matters and nuclear non-proliferation.  In particular, Ireland has been actively involved in the development of a safeguards system which protects against the diversion of nuclear material from peaceful purposes to uses in nuclear weapons proliferation and in the drafting of new conventions relating to nuclear safety and to liability and compensation in the event of a major accident.  In addition we benefit from access to the agency's information systems which are of value to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and from a mutual assistance convention in the event of a serious radiological accident.</P>
    <P>Membership of the IAEA also proves an important forum for Ireland to express its concerns on nuclear safety in general and to highlight particular concerns in relation to safety aspects of the UK's nuclear industry, including reprocessing and the Sellafield-THORP plant.  Our concerns in this area, and in particular about THORP, were raised at recent meetings of the general conference of the IAEA and at board of governor's meetings.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the IAEA's main deliberations are focused upon the strengthening of the safeguards system and completing the work on developing the nuclear safety convention and the convention on liability and compensation for nuclear damage in the event of nuclear accidents.</P>

    <P>With regard to orthopaedic surgery generally, the Deputy will be aware that last year I approved the filling of a fifth consultant orthopaedic post in Cork on a permanent basis.  In addition, the Southern Health Board has appointed a locum consultant orthopaedic surgeon who will take up duty on 1 July 1994.  Approval was also given to the Southern Health Board in 1992 to provide new clean air theatre facilities at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher.  The first theatre is expected to come into operation at the beginning of July of this year and the second theatre should be completed in September.  I am satisfied that the fifth consultant post, additional <Col N="825" /> locum post and new clean air theatre facilities will have a significant impact on the level of orthopaedic activity in the Southern Health Board area with a corresponding positive effect on the orthopaedic waiting lists in the area.</P>

These data are set out in the following tabular statement.  Most of these posts are filled on a full-time permanent basis.</P>
      <P>Rationalisation of the Department's health service personnel census grade categories to facilitate more precise analysis has meant that the data for particular categories given in the following tabular statement are not entirely comparable. Thus, the figure given for the nursing and allied grade category for 1988 includes nurses aides and other staff not included in the nursing category for other years.  There was, in fact, a significant increase in nursing numbers over the period 1988 to 1992.</P>

      <P>The Accident and Emergency Departments of the six major hospitals in Dublin operate a 24-hour service.</P>
      <P>Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments at any particular time.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.  Because of the unpredictable nature of the workload which may present, it can happen that on occasion patients must be placed in temporary accommodation pending the availability of more appropriate beds.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every endeavour is made to make patients as comfortable as possible in the <Col N="829" /> accident and emergency departments and I understand that food is provided to patients who are awaiting admission for a hospital bed and is served at the usual meal times.  All patients, whilst in an accident and emergency department are under the care of medical and nursing staff.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis. In this regard, shortly after coming into office I approved a sum of £500,000 to provide an immediate response to a problem of this type.  In December 1993, following further discussions, I allocated an additional £250,000 to the Eastern Health Board to enable the pressures on the accident and emergency hospitals to be eased.  This was achieved through the placing of more than 100 patients from the six major accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin, who were no longer in need of acute hospital care, in stepdown accommodation more appropriate to their condition.</P>
    <P>The change which I have recently announced in relation to the charge for attendance at accident and emergency departments is intended to create an incentive for patients to attend their general practitioner in the first instance, in cases where their condition would be most appropriately treated at this level. I am hopeful that this change will help to ease the pressure on hospital accident and emergency departments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187, 202 and 209 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a regional technical college in Dún Laoghaire and other locations has to be considered in the context of the future development of the higher education sector in Ireland.  I have asked a steering committee, established under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority, to advise me on this.  The <Col N="831" /> steering committee will prepare projections to the year 2015 of the total potential enrolments in higher education and the corresponding needs required by the sector to facilitate these enrolments.</P>
    <P>The committee will carry out a comprehensive needs analysis of higher education requirements.  Its remit includes the overall needs of society and the economy as well as regional, socio-economic and equality considerations together with the needs of students and the world of work.</P>
    <P>It will also focus on the appropriate provision for mature students as well as the need to provide access to third-level education for disadvantaged students.</P>
    <P>As previously indicated by me in the Dáil, the work of the committee will have to be informed by, and take account of, budgetary and financial considerations.</P>
    <P>The Committee is due to complete its deliberations in December and submit its recommendations to me.</P>
    <P>When I receive their recommendations I will give them my urgent attention.</P>

      <P>It is my view that all children who are considered as having a need for psychological assessment, should have access to such a service as early as possible in their school careers, with the permission of the parents or guardians.  This may well mean having such assessments carried out at an age earlier than seven years.  However not all children require individual psychological assessment. <Col N="832" /> Assessment and identification of a pupil's strengths and weaknesses has always been an integral part of teaching, with a view to adapting and providing teaching approaches related to the needs of pupils. For the generality of children this type of teacher assessment is what is required.  It is my aim to help schools and teachers to refine and develop their assessment procedures.</P>
      <P>I have announced my intention, in line with the Government commitment on the matter, to extend a schools psychological service to all primary schools on a gradual basis.  I intend to recruit a further ten (10) psychologists for the schools' service this year.  Advertisements for these posts have appeared recently.  This will ensure that children who need psychological assessment will be able to receive it if their parents or guardians so wish, as the service becomes available to primary schools generally.  In addition, this service will assist schools in developing and refining their own internal assessment procedures.</P>
      <P>With regard to tests used as part of psychological assessment, the choice of test instruments and procedures is a matter for the professional judgment of a psychologist.  The tests in use are regarded as the best that are available currently.</P>

This excellent scheme, administered by the Music Association of Ireland, gives students an opportunity to hear classical, traditional and jazz musicians, live, in familiar surroundings. At present, only post-primary schools benefit, but it is hoped to involve the primary sector, as well, in the near future.  Within the past year informal discussions have taken place between the director and education officer of the Arts Council and officials of my Department.  Both sides are agreed on the need for mutual consultation on the promotion of the arts, including music, in the education system.</P>
      <P>Further co-operation will, also, be most welcome.  For example, I understand that the members of the new Arts Council are currently formulating a three-year plan.  My staff in the Department will be available to discuss this, generally, with them and, also, their ideas on music education, in particular, when mutually convenient.  I believe combined efforts like this are the way forward.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to remind the Deputy that, on several occasions, I have reiterated my commitment and wholehearted support for the development of music and the arts at all stages of our educational system.</P>

      <P>My Department's responsibility in this regard is to ensure that an adequate number of teachers is available to cater <Col N="839" /> for the educational needs of pupils at second level.</P>
      <P>The pupil/teacher ratio at second level was reduced in 1991-92, in 1992-93 and again in 1993-94.  A further reduction will occur in 1994-95 as a result of the allocation of additional ex-quota vice-principal, guidance and remedial posts and additional disadvantaged posts.  The question of reducing the pupil/teacher ratio still further has to be considered in the context of competing demands for the resources available for education generally.</P>
      <P>The number of teachers required depends on a number of variables, including the approved pupil-teacher ratio, the total enrolment, the courses being offered and the subject choices of the pupils.  In the circumstances it is not possible to be precise in relation to future needs.</P>
      <P>On the basis of projected enrolments and having regard to the current pupil-teacher ratio and education policy the projected numbers of teachers required are as follows:</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to replies to Questions Nos. 17 and 53 of 19 April and Question No. 148 of 26 April last.</P>
      <P>In those replies I mentioned the &ldquo;School Attendance-Truancy report&rdquo; which was published on 8 April 1994. Copies of the report have been made available to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The report shows an average pupil absence level from national schools of approximately 7 per cent in the school year 1992-93.  There is no comparable school attendance data for post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>I am making copies of the report widely available, and I will be happy to receive the considered views of all interested groups.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to <Col N="844" /> a special job-creation scheme introduced in 1979, under which my Department funded the allocation of child care assistants to selected special schools.  A range of schools, including those catering for pupils with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities, were allocated posts.</P>
      <P>The embargo on public sector recruitment in place since 1987 has meant that no further appointments could be made or vacancies filled.  However, as I indicated in my budget announcement, it is my intention to allocate an additional 50 child care assistants to the special education area in the current year.</P>
      <P>These new appointments, which will be in place from September next, form part of an initial response to the recommendations of the special education review committee and will be of significant benefit in assisting teachers in dealing with special needs children.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently assessing levels of need for child care support in the special education area in order to ensure that the additional posts now available are used to best effect.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House on 18 May last, I am aware of the difficulties faced by the pupils and staff of Ballyowne Meadows special school and of the need to reach an early solution, particularly in view of the special needs of the pupils concerned.</P>
      <P>In this connection, my Department is fully committed to assisting the patron of the school, the Eastern Health Board, in meeting its responsibility to secure suitable alternative accommodation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> As part of this process, my Department has assisted the health board by identifying a range of possible alternative locations for the school.  These efforts have focused on a number of existing schools on the west side of Dublin with surplus accommodation.  Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, all of these options have been found unacceptable by the school authorities or by the health board.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, regular contact is being maintained between my Department and the health board and a number of other possibilities for permanent alternative accommodation are being actively considered. In the interim, I understand that the health board is arranging to have the existing building repaired so that the pupils can return to school for the remainder of the current school year.</P>

When agreement is reached on the school's needs and how they can best be met, architectural planning proceeds. When the project is ready to proceed to construction its inclusion on the building programme is considered in the light of all relevant educational, financial and architectural factors.</P>
