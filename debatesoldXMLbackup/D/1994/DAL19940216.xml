      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 8 form a composite proposal and amendment No. 9. is an alternative. I suggest, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 1, 8 and 9 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Combat Drugs Fund&rsquo; means a fund established under the terms of this Act for the allocation of certain moneys raised under the Act to organisations or groups working to combat the medical or social effects of drug abuse;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We debated this matter on Committee Stage.  What is at issue here is the desirability to use the money raised through the confiscation of the proceeds of crime, in particular the proceeds of drug trafficking, in the fight against drug abuse and the sale, distribution, trafficking and pushing of drugs.  Similar legislation was introduced in the United Kingdom some time ago and as a result considerable sums of money were raised from the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking. Between 1986 and the last date for which figures are available, it has been established that £20 million had been confiscated from the proceeds of drug trafficking.  As a result a debate took place in the United Kingdom as to what use the money should be put.  In the Bill it is proposed that the proceeds should be used in the administration of the systems which will be established to deal with the problem, but it is likely that even allowing for that, money will be available to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money confiscated should be used in the fight against drug abuse, to assist the Garda in its fight against drug pushing and trafficking and to undo some of the damage done to unfortunate victims who are hooked on drugs.  For example, many parts of the country and this city do not <Col N="1915" /> have drug treatment centres.  As a result people must leave their immediate communities and travel to centres in the city centre to avail of treatment which means those people are going back into an environment, company and climate where they will be exposed once again to drug abuse.  Many parents have told me that the absence of a drug treatment centre in Dún Laoghaire means that people with a drug addiction must travel to the centre of the city where they are exposed to the availability of drugs and the associated climate and culture.  Those who work in the area have called for more resources to be made available for drug treatment and the rehabilitation of drug addicts. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the moneys raised from the confiscation of the proceeds of drug crimes should be ploughed back into drug treatment and that is what this amendment proposes.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister drew attention to two matters.  In regard to my suggestion that the money collected should be directed to the Department of Health, she stated that would not be a good idea.  On reflection, I am not sure it is a good idea and I am happy to concede on that matter.  I assure the Minister that I do not have a particular preference for the Minister for Health over and above the Minister for Justice in that regard.  I am simply making the point that the money should be allocated for the treatment of people with drug abuse problems.</P>
    <P>In response to the Committee Stage debate the Minister pointed out that this could be approached in an inter-departmental manner and I am happy to go along with her suggestion.  She said she would consult with her colleagues before Report Stage with a view to introducing an amendment.  I did not notice an amendment tabled by the Minister for Justice addressing this point on the supplementary amendments circulated, that is why I asked about the nature of the amendments.  On Committee Stage I understood the Minister was receptive to the idea that moneys raised in this way would be used for the purposes of treating <Col N="1916" /> drug abusers.  I propose a special fund should be established to be used in a variety of ways to provide additional resources for the treatment of drug abuse.  Has the Minister had further thoughts on this issue since Committee Stage?  The principle of what we were attempting to do was agreed and established on Committee Stage and we debated the mechanism by which this measure should proceed.  There is support for the legislation across the House. It is important that legislation is in place to effectively deal with the position whereby people can make a great deal of money through drug trafficking, its accompanying human misery and the laundering of such moneys through a variety of means.</P>
    <P>People can establish themselves in respectable businesses and enterprises and continue to inflict misery on the unfortunate people hooked on drugs or victims of criminal activity.  There is support for legislation which will provide for seizing ill-gotten gains.  We need to address not just the necessity to seize those gains but to use the proceeds of crime in a way that benefit the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a valid case for allowing part of the proceeds confiscated from criminals involved in drug pushing to be applied in the treatment of victims of drug pushers.  The Minister for Health should be empowered to direct that moneys recovered in respect of a confiscation order be applied to meet the expenses of drug rehabilitation institutes or bodies as he or she may specify.  In terms of GNP some countries are exporting more in illegal drugs than by way of legitimate export products.  That may seem an extraordinary claim but it is supported by documentation presented at a Christian Democratic Conference held in Santiago, Chile, last year.  When countries are distorted by the production of such a level of illegal drugs, which are stored in warehouses and distributed throughout the world it is inevitable that countries such as Ireland, will become awash with drugs, which is the case at <Col N="1917" /> present.  People are making substantial money from this process.  Honest, hard working politicians, judges and policeman living in the source countries of those drugs, such as Columbia, are being assassinated and members of their families have been murdered and intimidated because they dare to stand up to those people.  In this and other countries on the receiving end of those drugs, drug barons are reaping the benefits, not just of the terrible tragedies in the source country, but also of victims here.  The drugs cycle is a tragedy involving vulnerable and innocent victims.  There is little we can do in the area of confiscation to assist victims in source countries; that is a matter for their national Governments. However, it would be justice here, where we are on the receiving end of those drugs, to allow the courts not just to confiscate those moneys but for the Minister for Health to allocate them to the treatment of victims of drugs.</P>
      <P>There are some appalling cases.  I have met families in my constituency where two and three members have had the HIV virus and two have died.  Those deaths were drug induced and people profited financially.  It would be wrong to confiscate the proceeds of drug trafficking and put it into the Exchequer for day to day purposes.  Some of it should be earmarked by the Minister for Health for the service of the victims of drug pushers, the rehabilitation of drug dealers and to assist institutions, bodies and societies who voluntarily, some statutorily, work to assist those people with this terrible affliction.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.  I tried to persuade her of its advantages on Committee Stage and she has had an opportunity since then to consider it.  Bearing in mind that this House decides what happens with the confiscated proceeds of drug trafficking, I ask her to ensure that the spirit of this amendment is taken on board.  It would be an act of justice to accept the proposal in the amendment and I commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported these <Col N="1918" /> amendments on Committee Stage and I do so now.  Since then has the Minister considered the proposals put forward by Opposition Deputies in relation to the good use to which such moneys it is proposed will be seized under the legislation will be put?  This legislation is our first opportunity to discuss such measures as seizing criminal assets.  It begs the question as to what is the best use to which the proceeds of crime can be put.  It has been proposed to allocate such moneys to services related to the rehabilitation and treatment of victims of drug abuse. There are many educational needs at secondary level which must be addressed here in relation to the abuse of solvents, drink and hard drugs.  The Minister for Education is currently reviewing a series of proposals relating to improving education for life in secondary schools.  With the increase in the use of drugs by our adolescents it is time that money and resources are ploughed into educational services by way of seized proceeds of crime to allow targeted and sophisticated programmes to be taught in secondary and vocational schools.</P>
      <P>Recently local councillors in the inner city brought to the attention of Dublin Corporation the fact that the drugs problem is exacerbated by the policies of the corporation in relation to tenancies. Residents of flats complexes have pointed out that in many cases they are powerless to evict drug pushers because of the stringent laws in this regard.  The people who live in these flats have become politicised in the face of such intransigence by Dublin Corporation in dealing with this problem.  Councillors have been told that 40 drug pushers are operating in Meath Street on a daily basis.  These are shocking figures and it is understandable that residents have taken to the streets to try to have something done about the matter.  About 250 residents of the combined St. Catherine's community marched to City Hall in November protesting at their perceived lack of power in dealing with drug pushers in the flats in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some excellent centres in the <Col N="1919" /> city dealing with this problem, such as the Rutland centre, the Coolmine centre and the Merchant's Quay project, but much of their energies are spent trying to raise money to improve their facilities to cater for IV users and heroine addicts, many of whom are young women with children.  There are very few residential places that will treat these people without separating them from their children.  We have spoken in this House about the fact that the majority of the female population in prisons are IV users and these women are also separated from their children while in jail.  One wonders whether prison is the appropriate place to treat such people, who are usually there as a result of recurring shoplifting offences carried out to feed their drugs habit.  This whole question must be considered.</P>
    <P>In section 18 it is proposed that moneys confiscated from drug pushers will be used to meet the expenses incurred in exercising the powers under the Bill.  If we are successful in implementing this legislation the money collected in this way will be sizeable.  However, the money should not simply flow into the Department of Finance to be disbursed willy nilly.  A plan should be devised for the use of this money, as in the case of the tax amnesty money which was targeted in a once-off measure to pay the debts of health boards.  Such a once-off measure would be an appropriate use of ill-gotten gains rather than simply constituting an extra resource for the Department of Finance.  It would not be acceptable to leave this money sitting in bank accounts, as happened in the past in relation to funds, allegedly related to terrorist activities, which were deposited in a bank account in Navan.  I would be interested to hear what specific plans the Minister has in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I support this amendment.  I welcome the proposal to confiscate the assets of drug pushers, people who represent the lowest form of human life.  It may be unfair to describe some of them as human because they destroy many lives, particularly of <Col N="1920" /> young people, and wreck many families. The money confiscated should be used to help drug addicts to kick the habit and to assist organisations who work with addicts.  As a result there would be less demand for drugs.  There would be certain constraints on the Minister in this regard but I would like to see him helping to put an end to drug abuse by ensuring that it is not worthwhile for people to sell drugs.  I wholeheartedly recommend this amendment and hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support this amendment which proposes that a combat drugs fund be established.  I supported this idea when the matter was discussed in committee and I will briefly summarise my reasons.  Many Members have expressed optimism in that they expect a great deal of money will become available as a result of confiscating the assets of drug dealers. However, I am not quite as optimistic in view of the record of convictions of major drug dealers in Dublin.  If that poor record continues we will not have to worry about how such a drugs fund should be spent.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister is showing great interest in this matter and that many Members wish to find a solution to the drugs problem, perhaps we will begin to put behind bars drug dealers who are operating relatively freely at present.  If we are successful in taking possession of the assets of drug dealers, it is essential that the money realised in this way is spent on their victims.  It is a great shame that in my area of the north inner city of Dublin, one of the areas hardest hit by drug dealers, due to a lack of resources there are as many people on the waiting list for the Eastern Health Board treatment centre in Amiens Street as there are people being treated in the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other areas in the city with no treatment facilities whatever.  If money becomes available as a result of confiscation of assets of drug dealers, that money should go towards providing new treatment centres where needed and enhancing existing centres with a view to reducing the long waiting lists of people <Col N="1921" /> looking for treatment and ensuring that staff is available to provide treatment on demand.</P>
    <P>There are community groups in my area dealing with this problem, one of which is the Inner City Organisations Network, a network of community organisations who set up a sub-committee to work with the Garda, health boards and Dublin Corporation.  They had hoped to work also with the Department of Justice, but regrettably the Department does not see fit to allow a representative to participate in the working group on the basis that it is some kind of lobby group.  That is not the case; this is a study group set up to monitor the drugs problem in the north inner city. I hope the Minister will reconsider her decision in this regard.  Like the Eastern Health Board and Dublin Corporation, perhaps she will consider sending a representative from her Department to work with that working group which is concentrating on some of the hardest hit communities and flats complexes in the north inner city where 10 per cent or more of young people are using heroin. This working group is trying to devise some strategy which will take those young people off the drug and prevent others following in their footsteps.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I said I believed the heroin scene in Dublin was worse now than it had ever been and that parts of the inner city were &ldquo;swamped with heroin&rdquo;.  That may not have come across as a realistic assessment of what is happening but within a short time of that statement the Garda seized a quantity of heroin in Dublin which had come into Ireland from Britain via Dún Laoghaire. The value of that seizure was estimated at between £500,000 and £1 million, one of the largest quantities of drugs ever confiscated in Dublin city.  That heroin was on its way to a relatively young and relatively small time drug dealer on the north side of Dublin who does not himself use heroin and who has bought from the proceeds of his drug dealing a private house in the north city centre area.  Until recently he lived in a corporation flat.</P>

He does not use heroin or any other type of drug and is involved in sporting activities with young people.  Most of the people who know this individual are not aware of his involvement with hard drugs.  Yet, without any visible means of support, he has been able to buy a private house and fit it out, as one person recently said to me, like something one would see on &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;.  I hope that this legislation will deal speedily with the type of activity in which this individual is engaged, but he must first be caught and convicted.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 9, when these issues were discussed on Committee Stage I stated that they raised a very specific point in regard to actions for compensation. The rest of that amendment and Deputy Gilmore's amendments Nos. 1 and 8 essentially relate to what should be done with the proceeds of confiscation orders.  Whatever about differences in wording, I do not think there is very much difference between the thinking behind the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I referred to some difficulties which I thought might arise in regard to the proposals put forward by Deputies Gilmore and Mitchell for the disposal of the funds which might be realised under a confiscation order provision of the Bill.  Given that our health and criminal justice services are funded directly from the Exchequer I did not think there would be much wrong with the idea of returning the proceeds of confiscation orders to that fund, as provided for in section 18 of the Bill.  In <Col N="1924" /> addition, I drew attention to the problems which could arise because there could be no certainty about the level of funding which would be available from the proceeds of drug trafficking and other offences.  I agree with Deputy Gregory that it remains to be seen whether the huge largesse predicted by people in this House and elsewhere will be realised, as we all hope it will.</P>
    <P>I also indicated, as Deputy Gilmore reminded me earlier, that I did not have an entirely closed mind on the subject &mdash; I was receptive to the proposal in the amendments &mdash; and I asked for time to consider the matter and, in particular, to consult with my Government colleagues. I have raised with the Minister for Finance the question of applying the proceeds of confiscation orders directly for drug-related projects or other specific projects.  He has informed me that he would be opposed to any such proposal. His reasons for adopting that view are not related to the merits of what the Deputies have proposed or the worth of that type of expenditure.  He said that as a matter of general policy any proposal to create a fund or other mechanism whereby money which accrues to the State could be expended in any way other than by way of the Estimates which are approved by Dáil Éireann could not be supported by him.  He also pointed out that any departure from the normal Estimates procedures would create difficulties from the point of view of accountability and would undoubtedly be of concern to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  While I have a certain sympathy for the Deputy's amendments, in the light of the views which have been expressed by the Minister for Finance I do not think I could accept them.</P>
    <P>One part of Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 9 raises a separate issue in regard to a court directing that money paid under a confiscation order should be paid into court in connection with legal proceedings which a victim may have initiated and the use of such moneys to satisfy such judgment or orders as the victim may obtain.  I appreciate what the Deputy is trying to achieve but I believe <Col N="1925" /> the matter is already covered in so far as it would be practicable to do so under the existing provisions of the Bill.  I should make the distinction between a civil suit for compensation, where victims on their own initiative take separate proceedings for compensation, and compensation payable under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993.  Under the 1993 Act a court, on conviction of any person of an offence, may make an order requiring that person to pay compensation to any person who has suffered such injury or loss as a result of the particular offence.  One of the purposes of making such provisions in the 1993 Act was to remove the need for victims of crime to have to take civil proceedings in order to secure compensation from an offender.</P>
    <P>A compensation order under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, would normally be made at the time of sentencing. Confiscation proceedings arise after sentencing and, therefore, are separate proceedings. Section 10 (3) (b) of the Bill provides that before a court makes a confiscation order it must take account of any order, including a court order, involving any payment by the defendant.  This would mean that in assessing the amount of realisable property of a defendant a deduction would be made in respect of a compensation order which had been made under the 1993 Act.</P>
    <P>On pending civil actions for compensation, section 10 (1) provides that when considering whether to make a confiscation order, the court may take into account any information placed before it showing that a victim of an offence to which the proceedings relate has instituted or intends to institute civil proceedings against the defendant in respect of loss, injury or damages sustained in connection with the offence.  That provision will ensure that the interests of parties who initiate civil proceedings against offenders are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>In his amendment Deputy Mitchell has proposed that we should allow the proceeds of confiscation orders to be available for the satisfaction of civil judgments obtained at any stage by victims.  This, in effect, would mean that confiscated <Col N="1926" /> proceeds could be tied up indefinitely because of the possibility that a claim might be made against them in relation to a civil action taken against the offender.  In my view this would not be a realistic course to follow and I could not accept it.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, section 10 provides substantial protection from the effects of a confiscation order for compensation payments which may be due to the victims of crime whether they arise under compensation orders made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993 or out of civil proceedings initiated by a victim.  I consider the provision we have made in this part of the Bill goes as far as would be practicable and, accordingly, I would not be prepared to adopt the Deputy's proposals.</P>
    <P>I have done what I promised on Committee Stage, which was to consult Government colleagues and obviously the primary and most important Government colleague to consult with was the Minister for Finance.  In the event he has decided that he could not go along with the proposal for the valid reasons he put forward.  I am prepared to consult with him again and put the views expressed this morning which were similar to those articulated on Committee Stage. However, I would not hold out much hope that there would be a possibility of him changing his mind because I made the case to him quite strongly as did my officials to his officials.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance appreciated the merits of the case put by the Deputies but for the very good reasons he set out he was not prepared to accept the Deputies proposals.  In the light of that there was little point consulting with any other Government colleague because as we all know in relation to moneys and financing Government Departments, any changes that might be contemplated in the financing of Departments is purely a matter between the Minister of the Department and the Minister for Finance. I regret I am not in a position to accept the three amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I now call on <Col N="1927" /> Deputy Gilmore to reply to the debate on his amendment No. 1.  I advise the Deputy that if his amendment No. 1 which is now under discussion is negatived, his amendment No. 8 cannot then be moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed at the Minister's response. While I accept that she did, as she undertook on Committee Stage, consult with her colleagues and made the case to the Minister for Finance, I am disappointed that the net effect of her response is to oppose the amendments.  I am particularly disappointed because it would appear that is being done by proxy by the Minister for Finance.  I do not accept the arguments made by the Minister for Finance in this case.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage also we pointed out to the Minister for Justice that a criminal injuries compensation facility existed up to 1986, when it was abolished. In response the Minister made the point that she had consulted with the Minister for Finance to seek to have that facility, or one similar to it, re-established and that that was turned down.  The Minister for Finance is now taking the view that the moneys raised from the proceeds of crime under this legislation must go back into the great maw of the Exchequer and cannot be used specifically to address drug abuse problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that there cannot be special funds; special funds exist right across the public service.  In our taxation system we have a health levy, a levy for youth employment and various special levies introduced from time to time, a form of central taxation.  Of course, a variety of special levies have been introduced at local level, for example, by local authorities.  Hospital charges are a taxation on illness which is used for a specific purpose, namely, the provision of health services.  The principle that the polluter pays is a well-established principle in environmental legislation.  We are dealing here with a form of social pollution and the people who are engaged in drug pushing are social polluters.  The same <Col N="1928" /> principle should apply; the pollution they cause in communities and the moneys made from that should be used to deal with the problem.  I do not accept the argument being made now by proxy by the Minister for Finance that a fund of this kind cannot be established.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the degree of scepticism in this regard.  Deputy Gregory mentioned his concerns that the high expectations for the amounts of money that might be raised by this legislation may not be realised.  I am concerned that the Minister would now appear to be sharing that degree of scepticism and if that is the case, this legislation will not address the problem.  It is an established fact that large sums of money are being made by drug barons who are importing drugs into this country and who are arranging for their distribution both within the State and, indeed, for passing them on to the wider European community.  If moneys are not raised through this legislation, this legislation will not work and I am concerned about the degree of scepticism that exists.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of frustration among the public about what is perceived to be the growth in the drugs abuse problem and the apparent failure to deal with it effectively.  A number of colleagues referred to the extent to which the drugs problem is growing again.  The Garda Síochána report on crime of 1992, for example, indicated that drug abuse offences increase by 13 per cent on the previous year and drug seizures increased by 20 per cent.  The National Drug Treatment Centre reports that it is treating as many patients now as it was in the early 1980s when the centre was the only such centre in the country.  A number of other centres have been established but the national centre is still treating the same number of people and the number requiring treatment from the centre is on the increase.</P>
    <P>There is much frustration among the public, particularly in deprived communities, where drugs are available on the streets and the drug pushers are known to the local community.  The local community brings that to the attention <Col N="1929" /> of the Garda, the local authorities and anyone who will listen and identify where the problem exists.  There is great frustration also that the many problems associated with drugs abuse, including the lack of treatment facilities and the adequate resources, are not being addressed.  It is easy for Members of the House, particularly those of us in Opposition, to come in here from time to time and propose that additional resources be provided for this, that and the other.</P>
    <P>This is a specific case of a Bill which proposes the seizure of assets and gains made by people engaged in drug trafficking. What is being proposed is not that the State should incur any additional expenditure &mdash; but that the money raised from these seizures be used to tackle the drugs problem.  Certainly there is agreement <Col N="1930" /> about the Bill before us.  We all hope that its provisions will contribute to the curbing of drug trafficking but we also have an obligation to ensure that the public, who are experiencing this problem actually see some results.</P>
    <P>I intend to press my amendment because it enshrines an important principle. I had hoped for a more positive response from the Minister.  It is a pity that the Minister for Finance has not given her the kind of support and clearance she needs.  It is unsatisfactory that we should spend a lot of time in Select Committee and on Report Stage dealing with issues only to find that a principle such as this, which is acceptable to everybody involved in the debate, is blocked by another Minister.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 15, after &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to the provisions of section 4 (6),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment.  Section 4 (6) of the Bill introduced the question of the balance of probabilities.  I suggest, subject to the provisions of section 4 (6) that these words should be inserted in section 5 on the assessing of the proceeds of drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (6) states:</P>
      <P>(6) The standard of proof required to determine any question arising under this Act as to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  whether a person has benefited from drug trafficking, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the amount to be recovered in his case by virtue of this section, shall be that applicable in civil proceedings.</P>
      <P>What is applicable in civil proceedings is the balance of probabilities.  I suggest that the same requirement should be inserted in section 5 (2) so that &ldquo;the court shall, subject to the balance of probabilities, for the purpose of determining whether the defendant has benefited from drug trafficking&rdquo; etc. would be the wording of this section.  It is a technical amendment and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister undertook to have this amendment, which the Deputy also put down on Committee Stage, further discussed with the draftsman.  The position remains that section 4 (6) to which the amendment refers sets out the standard of proof required to determine any question arising under the Act as to, among other things, the amount to be recovered by virtue of that section.  That standard is the one used in civil proceedings which as Deputy Mitchell said, is the balance of probabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" /> Section 5 which is sought to be amended deals with assessing the proceeds of drug trafficking in the context of making a confiscation order under section 4 and, accordingly, it is clear that section 4 (6) already applies to it.  Deputy Mitchell's amendment, strictly speaking, is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am advised that there would be difficulties in accepting the amendment in that by including the specific reference contained in the amendment in the section there could be doubt as to whether the provisions of section 4 (6) applied to other sections of the Bill. Section 4 (6) sets out the standard generally. That standard will apply to the situation adverted to by Deputy Mitchell. There is no need to write it specifically in the Bill as it could give rise to doubts as to whether it applies only to that situation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 19, to delete &ldquo;on indictment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seek to delete the words &ldquo;on indictment&rdquo; from section 7 of the Bill.  This section deals with confiscation orders: offences other than drug trafficking.  However, summary offences should be covered by this section.  In any of the circumstances where cases are brought before the District Court the same provisions, as in section 7 for non-drug offences, should apply.  I do not see why the section is restricted to persons convicted on indictment only.  I pressed the matter on Committee Stage and the Minister undertook to again examine it.  I will not be repetitious because I want to deal with other sections of the Bill but I ask the Minister to accept this amendment, or, if not, to explain the difficulty in applying the provisions of this section to summary <Col N="1934" /> offences as well as to those where there is a conviction on indictment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister explained on Committee Stage, the intention of the Bill is to ensure there is a mechanism available whereby people who have been convicted of serious crimes can be deprived of any material benefit accruing to them as a result.  Very elaborate procedures are proposed to try to achieve this situation.</P>
      <P>The District Court is a court of summary jurisdiction and, by definition, the offences with which it deals are less serious in nature.  It has a wide variety of options to ensure that a person does not benefit from an offence.  In particular, this can be reflected in the level of fine which the court may impose.  Moreover, under the terms of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, it is open to the District Court on conviction of any person of an offence to require that person to pay compensation in respect of any loss arising from the offence.  For example, if a person is convicted of larceny of, say, £100 from an individual, then the court can order payment of that amount to the victim by way of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key question which must be addressed in relation to Deputy Mitchell's amendment &mdash; the Minister and I very much appreciate the thinking behind it &mdash; is whether the balance of advantage lies with providing a confiscation facility for the District Court in addition to the range of options already available to it.  There are, of course, clear advantages with a court of summary jurisdiction, it enables relatively minor offences to be dealt with expeditiously. There must be doubts, however, about whether the use of the confiscation procedure would be appropriate in such courts particularly given the danger that because of the nature of the procedure it might contribute to clogging them up.  In addition, the detailed investigation of an offender's means and so on, which would usually be required for a confiscation order to be made, could be greatly disproportionate to any benefit <Col N="1935" /> that might be gained in the case of minor offences.</P>
    <P>Serious offences are generally dealt with by the Circuit Court and the confiscation procedure will, of course, be available there.  The District Court has already available to it the options which I outlined and in deciding whether to proceed by way of summary trial or by way of summary trial on indictment, the Director of Public Prosecutions, in exercising his discretion in these matters, could take into account whether there would be an advantage in proceeding by way of indictment in terms of a subsequent application for a confiscation order.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances the Minister believes that our key concern to ensure that people do not benefit from the proceeds of crime can be met without accepting the terms of the amendment.  As a general point, I would prefer to deal with the provision of any further options being made available to the District Court in the context of the forthcoming Law Reform Commission report on sentencing generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are essentially a tidying up exercise.  On Committee Stage an amendment added the words &ldquo;save where it appears to the High Court that it would be reasonable in the circumstances&rdquo; in section 11 (5).  That section provided, in effect, that confiscation proceedings in relation to somebody <Col N="1936" /> who had absconded would not arise until two years after the date on which he had absconded.</P>
    <P>As I understood it, the purpose of the amendment on Committee Stage was to allow the court discretion to allow confiscation proceedings at an earlier stage where it considered it reasonable to do so.  There was general agreement on the desirability of that approach.  However, it appeared on re-examination that placing of the additional words may have led to ambiguity and that the purpose of the original amendment would be clearer by moving the words in question to the end of the sentence.  We accept the principle of the amendment proposed by Deputy Mitchell, we are merely moving the words to the end of the subsection.  It is merely a tidying up exercise.</P>

      <P>Section 15 (3) which is sought to be amended arises where, under section 15 (2), the Director of Public Prosecution reports to the High Court that any or all of a confiscation order remains unpaid and the court is considering whether to make an order for imprisonment.  Section 15 (3) allows an opportunity for the defendant to make representations as to why he or she should not be imprisoned.  The court is obliged to consider those representations as well as any by the Director of Public Prosecutions in reply.  The Minister has consulted the draftsman further about this matter and the position remains that the use of the words &ldquo;in reply&rdquo; is <Col N="1937" /> necessary to ensure that the DPP will be given an opportunity to comment on the representations by the defendant as to why imprisonment should not be imposed in addition to whatever comments the DPP made in reporting the matter to the High Court in the first place.  It is reasonable that the DPP should have this opportunity, and accordingly I am disposed to let the words stand.</P>
      <P>I understand fully the effect of Deputy Mitchell's amendment which is that the DPP can make his representations and that the accused person can make counter representations.  We are allowing the DPP to answer the counter representations. Deputy Mitchell thinks it should be a matter for the DPP to make the initial representations and for the person, who is the subject of a confiscation order, to reply.  The decision is to let the procedure, as originally proposed, stand.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 47, after &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including a court audit&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the section to which I wish to devote time.  I am proposing that under the legislation the court should have the power to appoint an auditor of seven years standing qualified under the Companies Acts to act as a court auditor. So-called drug barons have become very wealthy, some being millionaires, and often they are caught for one or two <Col N="1938" /> offences and can afford to serve their sentences or to have some of their assets confiscated.  The assets of such people are very difficult for the Garda to trace as we are living in an era of electronic funds transfer.  People can take funds to Amsterdam to buy drugs and funds can then be electronically transferred to Switzerland.  How can a court determine where the assets to be confiscated are? We need somebody to find that out on behalf of the court and the person best qualified to do so is a trained auditor.</P>
    <P>The court should have the power to appoint such a person to audit the finances of a convicted drug pusher to find out the extent of the assets.  Auditors are skilled in pursuing audit trails.  They know were to look &mdash; bank accounts, bonds, diamonds or property.  It will be difficult to find all the assets of a drug pusher even if this section is incorporated but if this new section is not incorporated it will not be difficult for mega-wealthy drug pushers to fool the courts so that only small amounts of their assets are confiscated.  The courts will not be able to identify the full extent of accumulated wealth.  Wealthy drug pushers can afford to ditch a shipment of marijuana off the Cork coast and they would be sufficiently well equipped to go back later and recover it from the seabed.  This is big business and megabucks are involved.  In many cases there is good reason to suspect &mdash; and this is the trend all over the world &mdash; that money derived from drug pushing is laundered and is used to compete with legitimate taxpaying business men.  There is a double offence here in that drug pushing is also contributing to a distortion in competitive procedures. Only a trained auditor can trace the money from its subterranean sources into the legitimate bank accounts where drug barons transfer money.  Neither judges, the Director of Public Prosecutions nor the Garda can do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister might say that we already have two or three accountants in the fraud squad, that it would cost money to hire people from the private sector and point to the complaints about the Beef Tribunal.  In my amendment I do not say <Col N="1939" /> that the auditor should be a permanent member of the public service or should be hired from the private sector.  That is left with the Minister.  If the Minister believes that it is cost effective to employ ten accountants in the fraud squad or five in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or if she feels it is better to hire someone from the private sector, I will be happy with that.  We should not get hung up on our experiences with the Beef Tribunal and other cases.  The cost of paying the court auditor could be recouped from the confiscated assets of the criminal.</P>
    <P>Only an auditor is qualified to audit the wealth of the drug barons.  I see this gap as a major omission in the Bill.  How can a court become aware where the assets of a criminal lie?  The criminal will not tell the court, the gardai cannot deal with existing fraud problems and nobody in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions can do this job.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  The principle of this amendment is central to the efficient working of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment in principle, if not in detail.  There is a weakness which we identified on Committee Stage.  After all the intellectual investigations and work put into this Bill by the Law Reform Commission initially, and the report on confiscation on the proceeds of crime, and work by officials in the Department of Justice on this complicated legislation, the end result may be marred by not appointing a sufficiently focused and accountable person to bring the matter to fruition. The Minister referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions as the person to make inquiries in relation to confiscation orders but I am worried because the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is not accountable to this House. That independence is essential at the pretrial stage but these procedures relate to confiscation order after a guilty verdict has been given in other proceedings.  The necessity for independence from the Minister is not so strong in this case.  The <Col N="1940" /> problem with the legislation in England has been found principally in its enforcement.</P>
      <P>It is right to put all these complicated procedures in place for confiscation orders and the seizure of the proceeds of crime, including drug trafficking, but if at the final hurdle an appropriate person to see the matter through is not appointed this legislation will lack the necessary vigour.  I supported this amendment on Committee Stage and I do so on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the appointed three new members to the Garda fraud squad who will be available to the DPP to investigate and carry out an audit trail as required.  With the greatest respect, I do not think the three members appointed to the fraud squad will be sufficiently resourced or independent to enter into the quagmire of moneylaundering activity.  It is a sophisticated international operation and, because of the technology involved in the transfer of funds, a different expertise is needed from investigative skills.  It would require a highly skilled person to pull the skills of all the others together.  Has the Minister considered this amendment further since Committee Stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that while I appreciated the thinking behind the amendment I did not believe we should proceed with the appointment of court auditors as envisaged in Deputy Mitchell's amendment.  I continue to hold that view and sufficient powers for appropriate persons are in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill, it will be a matter for the DPP to initiate proceedings for confiscation and those proceedings, although separate, follow on from court proceedings the prosecution would have taken in the name of the DPP.  It seems that not only would the DPP be best placed to decide on whether confiscation proceedings would be worth while but also that this decision is one that should very definitely lie with the independent law officer.  In relation to the assembling of evidence in connection with possible <Col N="1941" /> confiscation proceedings, the DPP will of course, rely on the Garda Síochána to carry out all the necessary inquiries.</P>
    <P>Under section 50 and 51 a member of the Garda Síochána can seek orders to make material available in connection with such inquiries and also for the issue of search warrants.  Under section 9 the court may order the defendant to provide information.  In these circumstances it would appear that the only possible advantage that might be argued in favour of the appointment of auditors of the type envisaged in the amendment is that they would bring a level of expertise to these matters which might not otherwise be available.</P>
    <P>As I explained on Committee Stage, in reality the matter can be dealt with administratively and I do not belive any provision is needed in the Bill to achieve this.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, as part of the recent law enforcement package the Minister announced a decision to recruit three professional accountants to the Garda fraud squad.  Their expertise will, of course, assist other members of the force but there is no need for this to be placed on a statutory footing.  Equally, professional accountants could be used where necessary to assist in investigations arising from the Bill without impinging on the role and powers being given to the Garda and the DPP.  For example, if it were to be decided to set up a special unit in the Garda Síochána to deal with confiscation proceedings all relevant expertise could also be made available, including the appointment of accountants.  The fact that it would be a matter for the Garda Síochána or the DPP to go into court would have no implications for the effectiveness of such accountants.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much that this is a matter on which Deputy Mitchell, in particular, has very strong views but for the reasons I outlined today and on Committee Stage, and in view of the fact that I have had an opportunity to talk to my officials and to the Garda Síochána on this matter, on balance the amendment will not add anything of value to the Bill. Indeed, the designation of powers and <Col N="1942" /> functions in the Bill is much more appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the appointment of three accountants to the fraud squad.  If these accountants are to be promoted, they will have to leave the fraud squad at some stage simply because there are not sufficient promotional outlets in that squad for people of that calibre.  The fact that these three appointments are being made does not mean that we will have three permanently and it is obvious that will cause problems.</P>
      <P>I am not talking about an administrative facility.  In my amendment I propose that we employ people who will be directly available to the court before it passes sentence.  That is not a matter for the Executive &mdash; the administrative arm of Government but for the courts.  The judge who convicts a person of the serious crime of drug pushing will be able to find out before passing sentence the precise extent of the ill-gotten gains of the guilty person.  At present judges are not in a position to pursue that line or to find out the position.  The judge may go back to the Garda Commissioner who in turn may ask the Minister for permission to hire auditors to do this job but the Minister may well say that it is not provided for in the budget which is an interference with the independence of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are empowering the courts to pass sentence and to confiscate assets, the court should be empowered to find out the precise extent of those assets.  It should have that power independent of the Executive.  The only way to do that is to allow the court to appoint auditors. Under the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, the court has the power to appoint inspectors without reference to anybody and why should it not under this Bill be empowered independently to appoint auditors?  This is the only way to hit hard these mega millionaire drug barons so that when the law goes after them it is tough and through.  Should the court find that these barons have £10 million it should be empowered to confiscate <Col N="1943" /> that amount and not a contribution of £50,000 or some similar amount of money, which would be perceived as a contribution to be thrown into the poor box.</P>
    <P>This provision could well pay for itself and would mean from the outset that when somebody is convicted of drug pushing the court, if it deemed fit can <Col N="1944" /> appoint a qualified auditor of good standing to establish the audit trail and, as far as possible, establish the full wealth which would be confiscated on passing sentence.  That is a function of the independent judicial arm of Government.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the Bill is greatly undermined by the absence of such a provision and, therefore, I will be pressing my amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to see penalties on summary conviction greatly increased from £1,000 to £5,000 and from 12 months imprisonment to two years.  That is the objective of these amendments.  A fine of £1,000 on summary conviction is a joke when compared with the sort of money these drug pushers are making.  We discussed this on Committee Stage and the Minister said there was a Supreme Court ruling which she subsequently circulated to members of the Committee.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to consult the Attorney General and is it open to us to insert these penalties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The penalty should be at least £5,000 and two years imprisonment to show that we consider this form of crime an outrageous and separate offence from any of the other crimes dealt with at District Court level, that it is one of the most heinous crimes that can be dealt with at that level.

There may be some difficulty which the Minister sees, but if those difficulties do not exist I urge her strongly to agree to these amendments because a fine of £1,000 is a very light penalty.  The strongest penalties possible must be imposed for such crimes.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to look carefully at what Deputy Mitchell has said on these amendments.

      <P>There are a number of court decisions dealing with the penalties that can be imposed by a court of summary jurisdiction.  I circulated copies of these judgments to members of the select committee after our last meeting.  In the meantime I have had the opportunity of talking to the Attorney General and my officials have spoken to officials in his office.  I am advised quite strongly that the net effect of the judgments I have referred to is that increases of the kind proposed by Deputy Mitchell would be unlikely to withstand constitutional challenge in the context of their appropriateness for courts of summary jurisdiction.  Because of that strong advice which I have from the Attorney General's office I am not in a position to accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice if a judge of the District Court feels that an offence is so serious that the sanctions available in the District Court are insufficient, the judge has the <Col N="1948" /> power to refer the case to a higher court where the penalties could be increased.  I share the views expressed by Deputies Browne, Mitchell and Fitzgerald that we must send a strong message to people involved in this despicable type of crime. On the other hand, I must take account of the Attorney General's advice that insertion of such provision in the Bill would not withstand a constitutional challenge.  For that reason I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This raises a very important point.  We are the legislators, the people whose job it is to make the laws of the country and we are bowing to what the Supreme Court interprets as its right to interpret the Constitution.  This is undemocratic and a departure from the essential principle that it is our right to decide what penalties are reasonable, not the right of five judges of the Supreme Court.  In this case a penalty of £5,000 is relatively small given the amount of money drug pushers make.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the matter can be dealt with by the District Court &mdash; if it cannot impose sufficient penalties &mdash; referring it to a higher court.  It is very rare that a court, having heard a case and found a person guilty, will send the person to another court for sentencing. Will a judge have to decide before he or she hears a case that the person is guilty and should be sent to a higher court for sentencing?  That will not happen in practice and a penalty of £1,000 on summary conviction is inadequate in this case.</P>

    <P>There is an important principle involved and I hope Supreme Court Justices and the Attorney General read the record of this debate.  This is an infringement on our rights and they are overstepping the mark by making judgments which state we cannot decide the penalties that should be imposed by District Courts.  Every Member who knows the reality of the crime problem and the true value of the money made by drug pushers will agree that the District Court should be able to impose a fine of up to <Col N="1949" /> £5,000 and/or two years' imprisonment on drug offenders.  That is a reasonable proposal.  The cosy arrangement between members of the legal profession whereby they believe they can make the laws is unacceptable.  We make the laws and I want to put down a marker that it is time the House examined that area.  The Supreme Court should keep its nose out of the business of the Legislature.  We should stand up and be counted in regard to that principle.  I am sure every Member agrees.  Deputy Fitzgerald, on a cross party basis, very eloquently supported that view and I suspect the Minister would also support it if the Supreme Court ruling did not apply.  If the courts interfere with the Legislature, the Legislature will have to do what is done in the United States and vet judges before they are appointed.  Judges are overstepping their mark in this regard.  It is our constitutional, legal and, above all, democratic right to make these decisions.  It is unacceptable that cases should be sent to the Circuit Court and High Court and requests made for the appointment of more judges because of the increased workload.  We cannot continue to freely appoint judges.  These matters should be dealt with in the District Court.</P>
    <P>In view of the Minister's advice from the Attorney General and the Supreme Court ruling, I will not pursue these matters. However, I intend to pursue the principle further.  It is time legislators, particularly members of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, stood up for ourselves and told Supreme Court judges where to get off and to be more realistic about the problem people face. This matter should be dealt with by the District Court.  In the circumstances, I will not press my amendment.</P>

    <P>This amendment is designed to take account of certain banking arrangements following the adoption and implementation of the second EC banking directive. It is on the lines of amendments put down by Deputies O'Donnell and Mitchell on Committee Stage, which they agreed to withdraw on the basis that I would examine the matter further.  Given that it was related to technical banking matters, I indicated I wished to consult the Minister for Finance.

    <P>These are essentially tidying up amendments.  On Committee Stage Deputy Mitchell expressed the view that this matter would be more appropriately dealt with in section 37, which deals with the service here of a process issued outside State.  It provides for a reference to the Garda Commissioner rather than the superintendent of the district in which the person who is the subject of that process lives.  I accepted the point and agreed with Deputy Mitchell's amendment. There is a need for a consequential <Col N="1951" /> amendment to section 37 (7) and I am also taking the opportunity to use the usual legislative designation of the commissioner as Commissioner of the Garda Síochána throughout the section.

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 42, between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;44.&mdash;(1)  Nothing in this Act shall make any failure by a professional legal adviser to disclose any information or other matter which has come to him in privileged circumstances an offence.</P>
      <P>(2)  No person shall, by virtue of any disclosure made pursuant to the provisions of this Act incur any civil liability in respect thereof, save only where the matter purported to be disclosed by such a person was to that person's knowledge false.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We discussed a similar amendment on Committee Stage and the Minister expressed some understanding in respect of the issues I raised.  There are two aspects to my amendment, the first of which relates to clarification of the aspect of legal privilege.  Traditionally, under common law there is an absolute privilege attached to any correspondence, information, communication or document between solicitor and client in regard to legal proceedings.  The section with which we are dealing relates to the obligation of disclosure.  It should be clarified that matters which are the subject of legal privilege will not be damaged by the obligation in section 44 to disclose information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of legal privilege is <Col N="1953" /> accepted and recognised in various sections of the Bill.  Sections 43, 50 and 51 acknowledge the absolute privilege attached to legal documents.  The Minister accepted that the amendment I tabled may be too broad.  Documents and communications may commence with the benefit of absolute privilege but may subsequently be used, for example, where a solicitor is involved in or complicit in a crime being investigated.  Has the Minister discussed this matter with her officials and will she clarify to the House the matter of legal privilege?</P>
    <P>The second part of my amendment is of more general interest.  It relates to the exposed position in which bank officials and those working in the financial services sector may find themselves having regard to the onerous obligations to disclose information which they consider indicative of suspicious transactions.  The penalties are quite severe.  A penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment may be imposed in respect of people involved in illegal transactions or who had knowledge that transactions were of a criminal nature.  Further down the line, young bank officials who believe there is cause for suspicion and understand they have an obligation to disclose information, may be afraid to carry out their civic responsibility and disclose such information to their superior because if they are wrong and there are no grounds for suspicion, they may be subject to slander or libel proceedings.  I tabled this amendment to protect bank officials and to have their position clarified.</P>
    <P>We have the benefit of dealing with this Bill at a time when other jurisdictions have passed similar legislation in line with Article 9 of the EC Money Laundering Directive.  This section represents a major change in the culture of our banking system and financial organisations. An established system and culture of confidentiality exists between banks and their clients.  In pure banking terms, this legislation highlights issues which will require intensive training of bank officials and, a changing of the internal reporting system in banks.  Having started my career in a bank I am aware of the need <Col N="1954" /> for intensive in-house training of officials as to how they might report suspicious transactions.  There should be a central reporting system.  It would not be appropriate for junior bank officials to ring the local Garda station in regard to suspicious transaction.  A sophisticated reporting system is needed which will ensure that a bank official will not be subject to legal proceedings as a result of a report made in good faith.  I note the Minister has tabled amendments which include this provision.  It is important to clarify that point.  If young bank officials are placed in an exposed position with the threat that if they do not disclose information regarding suspicious transactions they will be liable to a term of imprisonment of five years, there should be a corollary guaranteeing that they will not be exposed to civil litigation by bank clients.  That point highlights the intent of my amendment.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has accepted part of my amendment.  I look forward to hearing her response regarding legal privilege.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The debate on the amendment is similar to that on Committee Stage.  The position is that of a paradox or oxymoron.  People who have no information are not guilty. On Committee Stage I made a case for the innocent bank official who did not suspect that a lodgment originated from illicit dealings.  I was told that a bank official who accepted a lodgment of £60,000 which was subsequently found to be part of an illicit £250,000 deal would be guilty under section 44.  I argued that a bank official who did not realise the money being lodged was obtained illegally should simply be told that he or she was inefficient.  However, a solicitor who is told that money is the proceeds of <Col N="1955" /> an illegal drug deal will be protected.  I have no interest in punishing solicitors but that section highlights a contradiction. A person who knows that a serious crime has been committed and who does not give evidence to this effect will be protected, while an innocent bank official who does not realise, but should realise, that the money lodged was obtained illegally, from the sale of drugs of another transaction is not protected by the Bill.  That highlights a contradiction. The Minister might clarify whether it is a paradox or an oxymoron, but there is something wrong with that type of justice.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware from the debate on Committee Stage that Deputy O'Donnell's amendment raises two distinct issues.  The first relates to the protection of material which is legally privileged and the second, which covers the same ground as official amendment Nos. 21, 22 and 23, is concerned with the implementation of Article 9 of the EC Money Laundering Directive.  On Committee Stage I indicated that I was well disposed towards the idea of a specific exemption for items subject to legal privilege which might be caught by section 44.  I also pointed out that there could be difficulties with the wording the Deputy proposed because it could protect from disclosure material which originally came into the hands of a solicitor under the conditions of privilege and was subsequently retained by the solicitor for the furtherance of a criminal purpose.  In the circumstances, I undertook to consult the draftsman in order to prepare an appropriate amendment for Report Stage along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  In fulfilment of the undertaking I gave on Committee Stage, I have raised this matter with the draftsman. Despite detailed consultation which involved the draftsman, the Office of the Attorney General and my Department, we have not as yet been able to agree on wording which would achieve what the Deputy has sought without leaving possible loopholes which might be used to get <Col N="1956" /> around the provisions of section 44.  I am prepared to continue with this task and if suitable wording can be found I will be happy to incorporate it in the Bill on either Committee or Report Stage in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The second part of Deputy O'Donnell's amendment is an alternative to the official amendment in my name.  While I have no difficulty with what the Deputy has proposed in this regard, I believe the official approach is more appropriate, given that the effect of my amendments will be to reproduce into section 44 the exact wording used to deal with this area of exemption from liability in the EC Money Laundering Directive.  In the light of what I have said in relation to amendment No. 20, I hope Deputy O'Donnell will agree to its withdrawal and I hope the House will accept my amendments.</P>

There has been a number of such cases.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking on board the substance of the second part of my amendment relating to the onus of disclosure on bank officials and others involved in this area.</P>

Technical advice and resources should be available, particularly to the main Opposition spokespersons, to assist us in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party is very supportive of this legislation. Various reports on the criminal justice system, particularly the Whitaker committee of inquiry into the penal system, focused on the fact that we should look to alternative sanctions for people who commit crime rather than relying heavily on prison sentences.  The seizure of assets obtained through criminal activities should be a sanction in itself. Perhaps we can move away from relying solely on prison terms, particularly in relation to white collar crime.  The seizure of assets would be much more threatening to many people than imprisonment. Our party has always supported this type of legislation.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill so quickly before the House and on being so accommodating in accepting Opposition amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 2, line 12, after &ldquo;SAOTHAIR&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE MAKING OF REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE MANNER OF RECRUITMENT OF APPRENTICES&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arose as a result of a long and fruitful debate on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  The Bill as laid before the House was a short technical Bill.  I forecast that the word &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo;, its meaning and impact on young people as well as its potenital, which is not yet realised, would provide for a very wide debate.  There were two courses open to me, one of which was to stick rigidly to the technical nature of the Bill, which perhaps would have been the correct procedure.  In that case I could have simply stated that this is a technical <Col N="1960" /> Bill dealing with the imposition of a levy; it is merely a financial measure. However, I wanted to hear Deputies' views on this matter and to contribute to the debate and so the concept of the Bill was widened.</P>
    <P>That gave rise to a later amendment which I know will not meet the demands of Deputies Bruton and Quill, but it is a step along that road.  I saw no way of achieving what I wanted other than by introducing this amendment.  As this is a technical Bill, I was advised by the draftspeople to insert in the title the following:</P>
    <P>AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE MAKING OF REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE MANNER OF RECRUITMENT OF APPRENTICES.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the long title of the Bill is necessary because of the new section 4 which will be inserted by way of a later amendment.  That new section will enable the Minister to make regulations relating to the manner of recruitment of apprentices.  As it will change the entire scope of the Bill the parliamentary draftsman's office has advised me that it is necessary to amend the long title of the Bill to take this change into account.  The amendment to the long title and the new section 4 will substantially change the nature of the Bill from being a technical Bill to one dealing with the much wider issue of apprenticeships.  Amendment No. 1 allows for the insertion of a new section 4 in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In other words, we have only one shot at it.  The procedure for dealing with amendments on Report Stage frustrates me.  I think all Opposition parties would agree that this amendment deals with the core issue in the Bill, the equity of access to apprenticeships. It is frustrating for Opposition Deputies to find themselves in the situation on Report Stage where they can make one contribution only, even though they may not be happy with the Minister's reply.  I think the Minister would agree that this is not a good way to do business. On this core issue we should have the opportunity to cross examine the Minister on what she intends to put in place by way of regulation.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister has explained the expansion of what is a technical Bill into a wider Bill which deals with the key issue of apprenticeships.  If any of the Minister's predecessors thought they could introduce a Bill dealing with levies in regard to apprenticeships without dealing with equity of access they would have fooled themselves and would have made a cod of reform.</P>
      <P>The Minister said she did not expect the Opposition to be satisfied with her amendments.  I am not satisfied.  This amendment, which deals with the core issue in the Bill, has been introduced at five minutes to midnight, so to speak, and the enabling provision regarding the making of regulations does not give us a real glimpse of what the Minister has in mind.  We have to take on faith what she may do in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision in amendment No. 7 which proposes that the regulations under the section will have to gain the positive approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is as it should be.  I should like an assurance from the Minister <Col N="1962" /> that the Bill will not proceed until such regulations are in place.  It would be unsatisfactory if we gave the green light to the financial side of the Bill without an assurance from the Minister that the issue of equity would be dealt with.  The levy is ill-conceived in the sense that it will give employers, who will only pay a very tiny portion of the cost of these apprenticeships&mdash;the State will pay approximately 90 per cent of the cost&mdash;the right to act as gatekeepers in determining access to the apprenticeship schemes as it is currently set out.  I am not happy with this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I said on Committee Stage that what we have been told about the apprenticeship scheme is totally unsatisfactory. Under the provision as it now stands FÁS will not sponsor any apprenticeships under the new system.  Under the old system people who were not well connected and did not have friends or relatives in a trade were able to apply to FÁS and have some chance of getting an apprenticeship.  This possibility has been scrapped under the new system where all people wishing to take up an apprenticeship must be sponsored by an employer.  Anyone experiencing difficulties in finding an employer will be able to register with FÁS their interest in an apprenticeship and FÁS will bring this register to the attention of employers on request.  The reality is that FÁS will have a register with thousands of names on it and no employer will make a request to see the details.</P>
    <P>If we want to ensure fair access to apprenticeship we have to go back to the proposals put forward by a former Minister in 1989 in the discussion document &ldquo;Apprenticeship &mdash; A New Approach&rdquo;.  In dealing with the recruitment process the then Minister said that two options were proposed for consideration. Under option one there would be initial screening by FÁS, using aptitude tests to identify persons capable of undertaking an apprenticeship, and employers would recruit only from this pool.  Under the second option companies would interview applicants who met the minimum educational requirements <Col N="1963" /> and who were over 16 years of age and only those chosen by companies as suitable for their needs would be aptitude tested.  Although the document went on to say that option one was preferred as it was equitable, the Government favoured option two which was cheaper but inequitable. I could not spell that out better than it was spelled out by the Government when it considered this issue in 1989.</P>
    <P>We need a system under which FÁS will short list and interview those applicants which it believes are suitable and have the required qualifications and employers will be required to recruit from that list.  Persons not on the list should not be considered for apprenticeship. Such a system would be equitable in all the circumstances, particularly since the taxpayer will be footing 90 per cent of the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I accept that employers must be given some freedom of choice in terms of whom they take on as apprentices.  After all, apprentices will be their employees.  This could be accommodated by FÁS presenting a short list of possible apprentices and employers having absolute discretion to choose from among those who are regarded as suitable.  If we do not take this route we will further discredit FÁS in the eyes of many people.  At present FÁS comes in for a lot of undeserved criticism because of the sort of things it is forced to do by the Government.  This is yet another case where FÁS will be forced to keep a register, people will put their names on it and FÁS officials will know that they are wasting both their time and the time of the applicants in keeping such a register.</P>
    <P>I hoped to have heard from the Minister today that she has an idea as to how this will be dealt with.  At a minimum I thought the Minister would have indicated that option one, as set out in 1989, was the proper way to proceed.  I admit that the issue of apprenticeship has been affected by the difficulties of negotiation between the social partners and that progress has been difficult for the Government to secure.  However, to have <Col N="1964" /> entered into and completed negotiations, as would appear to have happened, on the issue of levies and reform and not to have come up with a solution to this problem does not speak well for the Minister's predecessors.  In terms of dealing with this Bill it is wholly unsatisfactory. The Minister is aware that before she can produce regulations she will have to go back, cap in hand, to the various social partners and try to obtain an agreement.</P>
    <P>We are also aware that reform of the outmoded apprenticeship scheme was first mooted about 1975.  I do not want another 20 years to pass before a Minister comes into this House and proclaims he or she has the regulations that provide for equity in access.  I know the Minister's capacity for dealing with problems is well beyond that of her predecessors over the past 20 years who failed to resolve this problem.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not be deceived by appearances.  I feel strongly about this issue which is the core of this Bill.  I am not saying my amendment is ideal but it provides that we should ensure that under the proposed apprenticeship arrangements for the designated trade, all suitably qualified applicants will have an equal chance of obtaining a place on an apprenticeship, decided against criteria which are clearly set out and available for public inspection. That is more specific in its intent than the Minister's amendment which provides for requirements to be complied with for the purpose of ensuring that the recruitment is carried out in an equitable and fair manner.  What constitutes equitable and fair should be clarified in the way I seek in my amendment.  We should say that all suitably qualified people will have an equal chance of obtaining a place <Col N="1965" /> on an apprenticeship scheme decided against criteria which are clearly set out and available for public inspection.  The Minister will recognise that my amendment is more explicit and gives more direction to the Minister and her Department in the type of regulations she should draw up.</P>
      <P>While I realise it is difficult for the Minister on Report Stage to accept an amendment, I feel strongly enough about this issue to put it to a vote.  I am determined that we should give the Minister today explicit instructions on this issue.  I am convinced that the Minister's views in this regard coincide with mine and, indeed, with the Opposition in general. As Dáil Members we should give the Minister instructions as to the direction in which we want to see this issue go that are clearer than in her amendment.  I hope that the Minister can accept my amendment or at least incorporate some aspects of it into her amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I also tabled an amendment on this issue.  It asks the Minister to put in place a formal procedure that will ensure equity of access to all eligible applicants for apprenticeships.  In a sense, the Minister has gone much of the way to meeting my request.  She certainly has met the spirit of my amendment in the manner in which she extended the Title of the Bill. That must be welcomed as a signal of the Minister's intention to proceed in this direction.  However, putting it down on paper and meeting the requirements of my amendment are two different issues. I am not certain that the full extent of my amendment has been met in the Minister's amendment which disappoints and surprises me.  I agree with everything Deputy Bruton said and I will not delay the House by repeating points already made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of equity was the key consideration in the contributions of all Opposition Deputies.  In turn we pointed out to the Minister how, in our experience, the existing system was unsatisfactory and unfair.  We asked the Minister particularly to address points made to her on Second Stage and in our <Col N="1966" /> amendments on Committee Stage.  We expected her to make a more comprehensive response.</P>
    <P>The reality&mdash;this was spelled out by another Deputy who is not present&mdash;is that it is easier for a young person to secure a place in medicine at third level than to secure places on many apprenticeship courses.  Part of the reason for that&mdash;it is not the main reason&mdash;is that whatever else is said about the CAO system, it is open, transparent and fair. The same cannot be said about entry to any of the apprenticeship schemes and it was that issue, more than any other, which we sought to have addressed in this Bill.  We felt any improvement that might be brought about in apprenticeship schemes&mdash;there is scope for major improvement &mdash; hinged on this key requirement.  That ought to be settled and put in place at this stage in the development of apprenticeship schemes. People must have free and open access to places on these schemes and any improvements envisaged by the Minister in the context of this Bill must be equally available to eligible young applicants.  I am not convinced that is being done.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Second Stage debate, I suggested that FÁS be required to draw up a list of eligible applicants.  I accept that could be perhaps unattractive to employers but it should be possible to perfect the system.  In addition to drawing up a list of eligible people who meet the basic requirements set out in law and who might also be subject to assessment criteria, FÁS, which has much expertise and experience in this area, should categorise these young people into areas such as crafts and trades where opportunities exist.  Therefore, if an employer was considering taking on a young apprentice, he or she would not have to go through a list of hundreds of young people.  For example, young people who expressed an interest in the plastering trade would be put on a list which would be available to employers.  Those who expressed an interest in hairdressing would be put on another list.  That concept is so self-evident it should be taken on board.</P>

      <P>As is customary for St. Patrick's Day each year, the Government will send high level representatives to attend parades and other ceremonies to mark the celebration of Irish identity and heritage in the countries of the Irish diaspora.</P>
      <P>Again, as is usual, the high level profile of St. Patrick's Day will be availed of by Ministers to promote Irish products and services and to promote Ireland as a location for manufacturing industry and investment.</P>
      <P>This year, Ministers will also have the role of relaying to the wider Irish community the significance of the Joint Declaration as a means of healing the divisions among the people of Ireland by establishing the first step towards lasting peace with justice in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The individual programmes of those Ministers who will represent Ireland abroad have yet to be finalised but, as of now, representation will be along the following lines: United States: Minister for Finance; Minister for Justice; Minister for Enterprise and Employment; Minister for Equality and Law Reform; Minister of State Brennan; and Minister of State O'Rourke</P>
      <P>United Kingdom: Minister for Tourism and Trade and Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>

    <P>I will be in Washington on St. Patrick's Day where I will meet President Clinton and attend a State banquet as his guest.  I will use this visit to brief senior American and Irish-American politicians extensively on the development of the peace process in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have further engagements around this date in New York, Chicago and Hartford, Connecticut on IDA-related business and the general economic and trade promotion of Ireland.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1972" /> As I indicated to the House on Tuesday last, I will meet the British Prime Minister in London on Saturday next to review recent political developments relating to Northern Ireland.  I will be joined in the discussions by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs while the Prime Minister will be accompanied by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  The meeting will be of an informal nature.  It should, therefore, be regarded as complementary to the regular twice-yearly meetings between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>Our discusisons will focus primarily on developments relating to the Joint Declaration. We will review progress, share assessments of the current position and examine approaches towards attaining our common objective of lasting peace with justice in Ireland.  In this context, the advancement of political dialogue through the three-strand talks process will also be discussed.</P>
    <P>Clarification on the Joint Declaration have been sought and given to assist the wide-ranging debate now taking place in the Republican movement.  I have already made clear on a number of occasions that the Joint Declaration can be clarified or explained authoritatively by either Government.  This is accepted by the British Government.  In his address to the Association of American Correspondents on 10 February, the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, acknowledged that the public statements on the Joint Declaration made on behalf of our respective Governments have been within its parameters and spirit.  In his interview in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday last, he referred positively to my address on 20 January to UCD law graduates which dealt in great detail with the principles of self-determination and consent.  He confirmed that self-determination can lead to a range of possible outcomes, including a united Ireland, that the British Government were persuaders for agreement and that they could not &ldquo;revert to a system of government in Northern Ireland with which only part of the community can readily identify&rdquo;. All these points closely parallel <Col N="1973" /> statements that I have been making since the Joint Declaration.  I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the overall tone and balance of Sir Patrick's recent remarks.  They address the fears of Nationalists, who felt that there has been in the immediate aftermath of the Joint Declaration too much of a one-sided emphasis on Unionist fears and concerns. They go a long way to making up the perceived deficit of assurance to Nationalists, and recognize the breadth of Nationalist support for the Joint Declaration.</P>
    <P>The Irish people, North and South, want peace and they deserve it.  They want its permanency assured through establishment, by agreement, of equitable political arrangements to which each tradition can give their support and allegiance.  For our part, the Government will continue to make every effort to advance these complementary processes.</P>
    <P>Regarding my forthcoming visit to the United States on 13 to 19 March, the House can be assured that I will avail of every appropriate opportunity to present and promote, in a fair and balanced way, the complexities of the Northern Ireland conflict, as well as our efforts towards its peaceful resolution.  This will be of particular importance in my discussions in Washington with President Clinton and prominent Congressional leaders.  I will also have engagements in New York and in Chicago aimed at enhancing bilateral relations in the economic and trade areas.</P>

Can the Taoiseach realistically tell us what he thinks the prospects are that IRA-Sinn Féin will accept the view of 95 per cent of the people of Ireland and declare a cessation of violence?  The Taoiseach mentioned clarification in his reply.  Does he consider that, from his own point of view or the point of view of the UK, full and adequate clarification has been given and there is no further case for clarification? What is his view on that matter?  On the <Col N="1974" /> basis that there may not be a cessation of violence, does he accept that a course of action should be agreed with the UK this weekend on the steps to be taken to reinvigorate the three strand talks process and enable that process to get under way quickly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospects are difficult to evaluate but my judgment is that there are still reasonable prospects of a permanent cessation of violence.  I have no evidence to suggest that I should be anything other than what I have been for some time and that is cautiously optimistic.</P>
      <P>On the question of clarifications or explanations, I regard all the clarifications and explanations I have given in a variety of statements, in answers to questions in the House and in reply to the letter from Mr. Gerry Adams as adequate.  It is true that for some time, and especially in the immediate aftermath of the Downing Street Declaration of 15 December, some statements emanating from the British Government were perceived by Nationalists to be rather one-sided and unbalanced.  In their view, some doubt was being expressed from time to time that the British Government were really serious about standing over the Joint Declaration and its contents.  In recent times the many statements made by Sir Patrick Mayhew and his interview in <i>The Irish Times</i> have made the British position very clear.  They stand fully behind the Joint Declaration and they do not refute anything I have said in clarification.</P>
      <P>As I have made clear, clarification by either Government is authoritative when both Governments agree as to what the contents really mean.  That should be clear to everyone now, especially in view of the recent confirmation by Sir Patrick Mayhew of many points in the Joint Declaration. His recent statements and his interview should he helpful in clarifying any outstanding matters.  Everyone in the Republican movement should be in a better position to make a final assessment on it and give a positive response as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> Work is continuing between the two Governments on the three strand talks process.  That matter was the subject of discussion between the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Sir Patrick May hew at the recent Anglo-Irish Conference and no doubt we will review our position at our meeting in Downing Street next Saturday.</P>

      <P>In view of the intimations from the Irish and British Governments that it was intended to give the Provisional IRA until the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis on Saturday week to come to a decision about the Joint Declaration and in view of the fact that they have announced they will not reach a conclusion on it until some time in March or later, can we take it that the Governments of both countries will now proceed to get the talks between the democratic parties under way?  Can the Taoiseach indicate if the draft paper which Sir Patrick Mayhew has indicated he has submitted to the Irish Government has been considered?  Does the Government consider it is the basis for making progress in relation to political arrangements on this island between Ireland and Britain? When he is in the United States does he intend to avail of television and radio broadcasts to refute the phoney image Mr. Adams presented when he was in New York that he is a peacemaker when he and his organisation have never refuted the use of violence in Northern Ireland and, in fact, continue to support the use of violence by the IRA in the North?</P>

      <P>I will take every opportunity I get with the media on the occasion of my visit to Washington and other cities to present a balanced viewpoint on the conflict in Northern Ireland, as I have always done.  I will take the opportunity to answer any outstanding questions the Americans may have in relation to the present position of the Joint Declaration and what we expect from others in relation to it.  As regards the document sent by Sir Patrick Mayhew <Col N="1976" /> to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, he has made it clear that it is a check list of items and is not a document which one would consider to be the basis for going ahead in relation to a talks process.</P>
      <P>We have made it clear at all times that we regard the Joint Declaration as the starting point for the talks process, whenever resumed.  So far as the Irish Government is concerned, so long as it is clearly understood that it is a three stranded process, that it is on the basis of the statement of 26 March 1991, that the starting point is the Downing Street declaration, that we try to build on the good foundation laid in that declaration, we are ready to start any time.  I stress again that we do not see the Downing Street declaration, as being in conflict with or in any way holding back the resumption of the talks process.  We have never seen it in any other way, except as being complementary to it.  Deputy De Rossa raised another point about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Neither I nor &mdash; to the best of my knowledge &mdash; the British Government has ever set down the specific deadline of the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis. I have said on a number of occasions that people are looking towards the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis as an ideal opportunity for that type of response.  I have never set the deadline of the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis nor am I aware that the British Government has.  I said there was an indefinite timescale.  I understand that the internal debate is continuing and that it may take some time but the prize of a permanent cessation of violence and the stopping of the killing of innocent people is such that a couple of weeks one way or the other will not make me change my mind or set down a specific guideline. Both Governments will be in a position to judge, when the time comes that there is not going to be either a positive or a negative response, if any.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat concerned at the use by the Taoiseach of language such as &ldquo;the armed conflict in Northern Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;peace with justice&rdquo;, both of which are Provo-speak for an attempt to justify their campaign of terror in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.

If the Taoiseach said the declaration was complementary to the whole process of political development with regard to Northern Ireland, that it does not stand in the way of talks and there is no reason talks should not get under way even without a decision from the Provisional IRA or Sinn Féin, will he take an initiative now to get talks under way?  Even talks about talks would help stem the dissipation of the peace momentum generated by the declaration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The momentum generated by the declaration still continues apace.  In my view the declaration continues to gain momentum every day.  The talks about talks are continuing between both Governments.  It was a matter for discussion at the last meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  Officials of the Irish and British Governments are in continuous discussion in relation to them but other parties are required to be at the table for the talks process also.  It is a matter for the British Government to engage in that aspect of it.  We have asked time and again for meetings with the leadership of the Official Unionist Party but we have not been successful as yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the use of language, nobody owns any language.  The Deputy can use whatever words he wishes.  To describe the situation in Northern Ireland as an armed conflict is purely to describe the factual position.  That is what it has been for the past 25 years or more and it is a conflict that has continued for centuries. <Col N="1978" /> During the past 25 years I do not think anybody would describe it otherwise than as an armed conflict.  If the Deputy wished he could probably take exception to some of the language used by Sir Patrick Mayhew; indeed, he could probably take exception to some of the language I use.  Everybody chooses their own language but it is the factual description of what has been going on in Northern Ireland for the past 25 years.</P>

Has the Taoiseach any views as to what additional measures might be taken in Northern Ireland, from the point of view of warding off these threats to the members of the SDLP? Has he any views as to what steps could be taken in the Republic which would be of assistance, for example, by getting the new Extradition Bill on the Statute Book quickly or other measures of that kind?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe when he talks about the recent insidious developments of violence from Loyalist paramilitaries.  It is regrettable that that is happening, especially at a time when no single life has been lost at the hands of the Republican movement since 1 January 1994.  One would hope for a de-escalation on both sides.  Unfortunately, that is not happening in relation to the Loyalist paramilitaries.  I will certainly put that matter before the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, on Saturday next and I look forward to hearing the views of the British Government and what they propose to do about it.  The <Col N="1979" /> attacks on democratically elected people or representatives of local communities at different times are regrettable and are shown to be a threat to the democratic system.  We will certainly ask for action from the British Prime Minister in that regard.</P>

The Irish Government will be realistic about the talks and we will be realistic in considering what will work and what cannot.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was happy to launch the report <i>Developing the West Together &mdash; A Crusade for Survival,</i> because it stemmed from a sincere local wish for development, focused by the Bishops of Connacht and Donegal, the staff of Developing the West Together and all of the core groups of local people in the west who contributed to the report.</P>
      <P>The report contains 140 major recommendations and these are now receiving a thorough study by the appropriate Government Departments.  This is taking place against the background of the National Development Plan, which provides for EU and Irish expenditure of some £3 billion over the years 1994 to 1999 in the area covered by the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has considered the broad institutional issues arising from the report.  It has decided that it would not be appropriate to have a Minister for the <Col N="1982" /> west in view of the functional rather than geographic basis for ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to appoint a high level task force consisting of local and regional representatives drawn from the steering group for the report, representatives of the local and regional authorities, of the county enterprise boards and of area partnership companies together with senior civil servants from the office of the Tánaiste, the Departments of Finance, Enterprise and Employment, Environment, Trade and Tourism, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Social Welfare and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The task force will be chaired by a senior civil servant from my Department.</P>
    <P>The Government has given the task force the following terms of reference: to co-ordinate action on the assessment and implementation of the report and, to make recommendations to Government on the most appropriate permanent institutional response to the report.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that it would be unwise to put any particular regional institutional structure in place, as recommended in the report, without a thorough assessment of the options available.  The assessment will now be undertaken by the task force and will take into account experience of the operations of the new bodies just recently put in place, in particular the new regional authorities, the county enterprise boards and the area partnership companies.</P>
    <P>The Government has asked the task force to complete its work and report back to Government within two months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the title of the report says it all, that we are talking about the survival of a people and of a region?  Would he agree, in view of the fact that the population of the west dropped by 130,000 since 1926, that 779 townlands are literally dead and that the facts in the document come from a concerned group of Bishops?  Will the Taoiseach agree that what is needed is dynamic decisive policy and that unless we have it, irrespective <Col N="1983" /> of the task force, the west will be as dead as a door nail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at any Deputy from the west pronouncing death on his region.  It indicates a lack of confidence in himself and the ability of elected representatives to give leadership in the development of the west.  The report was very well put together and is very welcome.  All the issues dealt with in the report will be addressed by the task force.  The Deputy will agree that requesting the task force to come back with a report on the 140 recommendations within two months shows that we are treating this as being of the utmost importance.  The Deputy, and the west, can be assured that they will get a full hearing in relation to an action programme for the region.  The report has also been taken up at European level to see if the goodwill expressed there can be translated into additional action.</P>

      <P>It is nice to talk about appointing a Minister for the west but what we really want is action.  The people with whom I discussed this in Castlebar could see the logic of my points that such a Minister would have to take some of the functions away from almost every Minister of State, that legislation would be required for all this reorganisation, that Ministers were not appointed on the basis of geographical representation but on the basis of functional representation and that it would take some time to get to the end of that process, time during which action could be taken.  The people I spoke to want action and not just another structure.  Every Minister has responsibility <Col N="1984" /> for certain aspects of the west of Ireland.  We want to look at the recommendations and ensure that the objectives in the plan are carried through.  We do not want to appoint somebody for the sake of appointing him.  The job could be well on its way by the time we would make all the necessary functional changes on foot of the Deputy's proposal.</P>

Why did he not mention it then? Are there any schemes?  Did the Taoiseach hear about the Leader scheme that Father Harry Bohan has to save west Clare?

I have launched the report on Leader 1 and I made clear where the Government stand in relation to Leader and that it is our view that is an excellent scheme.  The Government is fully supportive of Leader 2 and the sooner the European Union approves it, the better. There is no question of turning off the tap on the life blood of rural communities, their preservation and development, as represented in the Leader programme.  If Deputy Carey read the National Development Plan he would see the scheme for the west.  As soon as the plans are approved by Brussels, the Government will have pleasure in announcing them.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment is very supportive of the relocation of families who wish to move to the west.  It is quite true that in some areas this has made the difference in allowing the local primary school to retain its second teacher or a school remaining open.  A number of families has been relocated in my own County Longford, indeed one from the Deputy's consistency.  As the Deputy comes from the west I know he has a good knowledge of what will help to regenerate it.  Certainly the relocation of families who choose voluntarily to move to the west should be encouraged and the Minister for the Environment takes that view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 7, 14, 17, 19, 21, 27, 31, 43, 46, 50 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy will be discussing later today, in the context of, a Supplementary Estimate for my Department, the provision of £8 million for tourism promotion and development purposes which includes the consumer advertising campaign in the US and the £5 million recently announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>As the House will already be aware, the advertising campaign in the US market is specifically aimed at securing additional tourist business to Ireland in 1994 and represents a unique response by the Government to an innovative proposal by the industry involving a partnership by my Department and the industry in a joint marketing campaign. The campaign is being co-funded by the Exchequer, the European Union and the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Advertising has been identified as the most effective means of generating incremental travel and the intensive media campaign, which will supplement Bord Fáilte's regular expenditure in the US market, will commence on 21 February with commercials on national cable and network television highlighting Ireland in a vibrant way.  The television campaign will also be complemented by extensive advertisements in magazines and newspapers.  In addition, a special 16-page full colour brochure &ldquo;Ireland Vacations '94&rdquo; has been produced featuring <Col N="1990" /> airfares and packages.  This will be available for distribution to inquirers.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the efforts being undertaken in the campaign will result in a resurgence of interest in Ireland.  The campaign target is an incremental growth of 45,000 in vacation visitors.  Combined with the growth forecast by Bord Fáilte an overall increase of 57,000 in visitor numbers from North America is expected, generating over £20 million in additional tourism revenue.  This initiative was considered to be opportune given the strengthening of the US dollar, positive economic recovery in the US, the anticipated growth in visitors travelling to Europe and of course our participation in the World Cup.</P>
    <P>The Irish tourism industry has been one of the most successful sectors of the economy in recent years and the Government's commitment to developing the sector further has been reaffirmed in the recent budget where an additional £5 million was allocated for a special tourism promotion and development programme. These funds will be under my direct control and I would like to outline to the House the new initiatives which I propose to implement.  Essentially, the fund will be targeted at: intensified promotional campaigns aimed at the UK and other European markets; increased marketing to support and extend common air fare rating of Ireland with a number of European destinations, particularly London, so that more long haul tourists visit Ireland; innovative marketing programmes linked to sporting or artistic events; and projects coming on stream from the tourism council.</P>
    <P>Tourism has been singled out by the Government as a target area for the generation of wealth and employment.  Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in the world and the measures which I have just outlined are intended to capture an increased share for Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the policy of using funding through his Department is a further diminution <Col N="1991" /> of the role of Bord Fáilte and is part of an obvious campaign to make it irrelevant?  Will he confirm that it is the intention to set up a special marketing unit in his Department to administer these funds?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are later questions on the role of Bord Fáilte tabled by the Deputy and others.  This particular question relates to the provision of £8 million for tourism promotion and development.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that I intend to sideline Bord Fáilte, as the Deputy seems to indicate.  Last October I announced a £3 million marketing drive, which would be funded from the industry, Bord Fáilte, the Exchequer and European funds. People in the industry had been saying for years that if they had control of some funds they would do things differently. This campaign provides them with an opportunity to put their money where their mouths are.  While the campaign will be administered by a senior civil servant in my Department, the initiative was taken by the industry.  The additional £5 million for tourism announced in the budget by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, will be aimed mainly at the United Kingdom and European market to complement the activities of Bord Fáilte.  As Minister for Tourism and Trade I want, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, to get more people in the industry involved.  A fair proportion of the £3 million will be put up by the industry itself.  This was its idea and we will see how it will work.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the vast potential which South Africa may present to Irish exporters in the future, the plans, if any, he has to open a Bord Tráchtála office in South Africa; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish trade with South Africa is currently at a relatively modest <Col N="1993" /> level, although our exports have shown encouraging growth in recent years. Exports in 1992 were worth £39.6 million and imports £13.4 million.  There is undoubted potential for significant further development with the normalisation of the political situation and the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round.</P>
      <P>The enhanced trade prospects presented by the new situation was a significant factor in the Government's recent decision to open a resident embassy there.  The new embassy will be an important additional resource for An Bord Tráchtála in its trade promotion efforts in South Africa where it already employs a resident trade consultant base in Johannesburg.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála will, of course, be keeping the situation and their scale of operations under careful review to ensure that the interests of Irish exporters are fully catered for.  To further develop commercial links between Ireland and South Africa, I will be leading a multi-sectoral trade mission there later this year.  The mission is being organised by An Bord Tráchtála with the co-operation of the recently established Irish South African Trade Association.  This will be the third trade mission since November 1991 and is further evidence of our ongoing commitment to developing this increasingly important market.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Tourism and Trade should also be the Minister for Foreign Affairs but if he brings back good news that would be as good a reason as any for going to these countries.  Does he agree that exporters will have vast potential to secure markets in South Africa, especially in electronics, pharmaceuticals and food products, particularly food ingredients?  Does he agree also that if we do not maintain a presence there, in other words, a Bord Tráchtála office, we could lose some of the potential market share to competitors?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that exporters have vast potential <Col N="1994" /> as can be seen from the growth in the figures from a very small base.  The fact that An Bord Tráchtála does not have a full-time office in South Africa at present &mdash;although we do have a trade consultant &mdash;is not deterring exporters from doing business there.  We will be in a better position to assess the situation after the elections this year.  If we deem it necessary, we will open a full-time office as South Africa could become a major outlet for exports.  I intend to lead a trade mission there later this year but the dates have not yet been set.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10, 33, 34 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's objectives with regard to the future promotion and development of tourism have been stated unequivocally in the National Development Plan and, most recently, in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> To achieve these objectives my Department's Estimates for 1994 include an allocation of £21.7 million to Bord Fáilte towards their overseas marketing and promotion.  There is also a provision of £1.6 million to Shannon Development who are responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for traffic and tourism development at Shannon and in the mid-west region.  In addition a further £8 million is being made available for a tourism promotion and development fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism is a key sector with considerable potential for generating significant growth in overseas revenue and a high level of sustainable employment. Tourism services are labour intensive and have a low import content.  Revenue growth translates directly into job generation. <Col N="1996" /> As the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> states: &ldquo;tourism also acts as a powerful instrument of regional balance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Strategically, it is my intention to create the conditions necessary for the tourism sector to realise and hopefully exceed the key tagets set for it in terms of visitor numbers, revenue and employment for the end of the decade, which are: increase overseas visitor numbers by 1.7 million; increase overseas revenue by £1 billion; provide 35,000 new jobs, including 6,000 in construction.</P>
    <P>I propose to meet these challenges by: reviewing the effectiveness of promotion and marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination; supporting the development of the Irish tourism product in quality, variety and value for money; improving the seasonal spread of tourism through marketing, product development, access and competitiveness programmes; improving training and quality standards in tourism; and ensuring the most effective use of EU Structural Funds for tourism.</P>
    <P>Success in all of the above factors will be critical for Irish tourism, not only in terms of achieving the targets set but, even more importantly, in setting a solid basis for ensuring sustainable, quality, growth into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>Consistent with this strategic perspective, I have systematically, since my appointment as Minister for Tourism and Trade, gone about encouraging all economic operators in this industry &mdash; which has unparalleled potential &mdash; to work as a powerful, cohesive unit.  I have, for example, taken the most careful soundings in the industry about its future development and I have formally established a channel of advice from the industry directly to me in the form of the tourism council, which I chair.  I have also taken a hard look at institutional roles in so far as they make a significant impact on the future development of the sector. For example, I have reviewed and reorganised the operations of my Department in regard to its tourism policy functions. I have reorganised the regional tourism structure.  Similarly, I plan a significant review, with CERT, of manpower <Col N="1997" /> policy and training needs for the tourism sector, within a perspective focused on high standards to be realised by the end of this decade.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously &mdash; I made no secret of this &mdash; I have been looking at the role of Bord Fáilte Éireann, as much in terms of its future potential and the sector's future requirements, as in terms of its historical performance or its current structure.  The fact is, Bord Fáilte was established in 1939 under the Tourist Traffic Act, a full five and a half decades ago.  Indisputably, in that time, Bord Fáilte has done much excellent work and while it has grown and developed organisationally throughout that process, it has done so much more in an organic fashion rather than in a way that might realistically be described as strategic response to great change. One has to ask the question if the organisation has fully and appropriately adapted over the years to the challenges of marketing Ireland as a tourist destination in the new, highly competitive, conditions that now prevail for tourism internationally. Put another way, bearing in mind the dictum that structure follows strategy, one can say that while we now certainly have a clearly defined strategy for tourism development, have we got the right structures to see it through?</P>
    <P>In my opinion, Bord Fáilte is rightly regarded highly as a promotional body. But yet, it has many other functions &mdash; such as investment and product development, the provision of information services, the registration and regulation of accommodation and so forth &mdash; which, though very important in their own right, are not necessarily supportive of a promotional function.  In fact, it could even be said that they could contribute to a significant deflection of team effort and commitment from the core promotional function.</P>
    <P>This, then, is one of the key questions which I must seek to resolve.  Namely, should all of these functions, ideally, be invested in one body at a time when the country has perhaps never required more of a single minded, dedicated, commitment to promoting our tourism potential abroad?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> Another key issue is whether there are any special reasons why Bord Fáilte should be located in Dublin as opposed to some location outside of it.</P>
    <P>I have been considering all of these things since my appointment as Minister for Tourism and Trade and I am very alive to the view that it may be unwise to draw firm conclusions one way or another in the absence of a comprehensive review of Bord Fáilte, with the assistance of consultancy expertise.  I plan to take a final view on this matter in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Overall, however, I am sure the House will agree that none of us, and no organisation concerned with tourism development, should be free from review and reassessment given that it is in the nature of change to require constant renewal and that change affects us all.  If we do not get our policies, programmes and institutions right during this decade we will have ignored the demands of the new competitive environment and will untimately have served the promise of our tourism sector very badly indeed.</P>

      <P>The first half of that reply was waffle.  It consisted of a repetition of what was in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work which, in turn, was a repetition of what was in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The Minister did come towards the point in the second part of his reply.  Is he saying that we will have another review of Bord Fáilte before it is decided to finally wind it up?  Is he aware that a review was completed as recently as 1986 which looked at the question of Bord Fáilte very thoroughly?  What exactly is he saying about decentralisation?  Is it being <Col N="1999" /> decentralised and, if so, where to?  How does the Minister account for the major difference in the Supplementary Estimate that was circulated yesterday, incidentally before leave was given by the House to introduce it?  It was quite different from subhead B3 where the £8 million will not now be granted to Bord Fáilte although the original Estimate said that it would.  Is there any significance in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that I would wind up Bord Fáilte.  I took the opportunity today to say what I have been doing as Minister in the past year to get the structures right.  I said on a number of occasions, here and outside the House, that Bord Fáilte is not immune from review and some changes. I said in the past fortnight that in the near future I would be coming forward with proposals for Bord Fáilte, and I will do that.</P>
      <P>The question of decentralisation can be considered in the context of the review.  I will not pre-empt the review of Bord Fáilte but I may come to the conclusion that it would be better to decentralise it and I am sure the Deputy's region would be a live candidate for the decentralisation if it were to happen.</P>
      <P>I will be answering the last question asked by the Deputy at the meeting to discuss the Supplementary Estimate today.  When the Minister for Finance announced an additional £5 million for tourism in his budget it was decided to amalgamate the £5 million and the £3 million under the control of the Department of Tourism and Trade.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade is responsible for tourism policy and the Deputy should have no illusions about that.  The role of Bord Fáilte is as my executive agency.  Many <Col N="2000" /> years ago the late Seán Lemass defined the role of executive agencies which I very much subscribe to.  I am the Minister responsible and I will define policy and Bord Fáilte Éireann and other bodies under my control will carry out that policy.  The role of Bord Fáilte at present is as it has always been.  The role of the tourism council is to act in an advisory capacity to me.  It brings together the State agencies, the industry and the Department in one forum so that the people in the industry have a direct channel of communication to the Minister to bring forward their ideas.  Let nobody be in any doubt about who is responsible for tourism; I am responsible for it.  Bord Fáilte is the executive agency charged with the promotion of Ireland abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 28 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> The GATT Uruguay Round Agreement, on which substantive negotiations concluded on 15 December last, is the biggest trade agreement ever concluded in the history of world trade.  It is a major victory for multi-lateralism over unilateral solutions to trade problems, and incorporates the biggest single reduction ever achieved in trade tariffs.  The scope of GATT has been expanded to include, for the first time, major sectors such as services, agriculture and textiles.  Trade related intellectual property measures have been covered and a new world trade organisation is to be created, the provisions of which will be legally binding on its members.</P>
    <P>The outcome will create confidence and buoyancy in the world economy from which we will all benefit.  The European Union stands to gain most from the agreement and significant opportunities for investment and the expansion and development of exports should result. These opportunities will, if exploited by Ireland, lead to significant growth in our exports and in foreign earnings which will benefit the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Irish manufacturing and traded services sectors will gain substantially in terms of output and employment from the increasingly liberalised international trading system arising from the agreement. The consultancy study which I published in December last concluded, using rather conservative assumptions, that the Irish economy stood to directly gain in excess of 20,000 jobs from a GATT agreement.  This is in comparison with a scenario in which trade hostilities and a proliferation of protectionist measures would have followed a failure to reach an agreement.</P>
    <P>Although the negotiations generally on the round were brought to a close in December of last year, discussions have continued since then on details, in particular on finalising the market access part of the agreement.  It is a matter now for the GATT secretariat in Geneva, assisted by the delegations of the contracting parties, to complete the text of the agreement in the form of a final act <Col N="2002" /> to be presented for ministerial approval in Marrakesh on 12 to 15 April next.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the agreement are scheduled to come into effect progressively from 1995 but, even in advance of that, the conclusion of the agreement has had important effects in boosting confidence in the prospects for trade growth and in recovery from the international recession of recent years.</P>
    <P>The importance of the Uruguay Round Agreement lies in the liberalisation of trading conditions and in the achievement of the greater security for traders which comes from extension of the multi-lateral rules-based system which will be overseen by the new World Trade Organisation.</P>
    <P>In many cases, the effects of the agreement will be invisible to individual traders, but cumulatively they are of fundamental importance in providing the basis for economic growth and prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the report by the economic consultants, Fitzpatrick and Associates.  Is it not the case that the GATT agreement was not concluded when that report was compiled and that the report was published the day the agreement was made?  I suspect this report was rushed as a result of pressure in this House because of the lack of a sectoral measurement of the impact of GATT prior to the conclusion of the agreement.  When will we have a serious discussion in this House on the impact of GATT on the various sectors of our economy?  Has a study been carried out in the Minister's Department, other than this preparatory document, on the precise outcome?  For example, will the multinationals be the main beneficiaries, with an insignificant impact on indigenous industry?  Will the Minister agree that the impact on small farmers in disadvantaged areas could be very negative? A range of important issues arise as a result of the GATT round which were never discussed in this House and the Minister did not give any indication in his reply that serious work is being carried out in relation to measuring its impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2003" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised many questions.  The consultancy report to which I alluded was prepared by Fitzpatrick and Associates and commissioned by my Department earlier in 1993.  It was updated at various stages throughout the year, but at that stage those economic consultants gave their best estimate of the likely impact of a successful conclusion of the GATT round.</P>
      <P>The GATT round commenced in 1986 and was concluded last December.  The Deputy is correct in saying that more work must be carried out betwen now and 12 April next, when the final agreement will be signed in Marrakesh.  The meeting in December was fast-tracked by the US Congress and a deadline was set for receiving offers.  There have been various teething problems but the agreement will be signed in Marrakesh on 12 April next.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on GATT have been ongoing for the past seven years.  Therefore, the likely outcome of the final GATT round was known and taken into account in the Fitzpatrick report.  The report was not published until December because we were trying to get the best deal possible in other areas, particularly agriculture.  The Fitzpatrick report concluded that the successful conclusion of the GATT round would be of immense benefit to the Irish economy, but there were a few negative aspects in relation to agriculture which we were able to overcome in worth-while negotiations between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the EC Commission.</P>

      <P>We then published the Fitzpatrick report.  I have no objection to a debate in this House on the impact of the new GATT round on this economy. That matter can be discussed by the Whips.  I would remind the Deputy that in Private Members' time last November <Col N="2004" /> or December we discussed many aspects of the GATT round.  If the party Whips agreed to another debate, I will not object.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not state whether he proposes to publish details of the various matters to which Deputy McDowell referred in Question No. 28, for example, details about when the various provisions agreed in the round come into effect and if he will publish a document for the guidance of manufacturers, traders, farmers and others to enable them to assess the effect of the round on their particular businesses. Will the Minister give a general assessment of the effect of the round? Deputy Rabbitte referred to the Fitzpatrick report, which the Minister agreed was compiled before the conclusion of the round.  Now that the round is concluded will the Department give a general assessment of the impact of the round especially as it is no longer necessary for political or other reasons to hold a particular point of view on the matter? Can we have an objective assessment of something which will have a profound effect on our economy in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The compilation of another report would not benefit tax-payers. When the Fizpatrick report was prepared in 1993 most of the details of the GATT round were known.  At that stage we were mainly discussing agricultural measures.  Matters relating to trade were taken into account in the consultant's report.  It would not be beneficial to carry out a new consultancy study following the signing of the agreement in Marrakesh because, as indicated by the various industrial organisations such as IBEC, the details of the report were known earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I replied to Deputy McDowell's question in the later part of my reply.  It is not necessary to carry out the full assessment <Col N="2005" /> to which Deputy McDowell referred because the GATT agreement relates primarily to the regulation of trade between states rather than to business. As a result, its effect will be indirect and at times nebulous and they will unfold over time.  There will be few provisions of specific interest to individual traders and it would not be suitable for a compaign of mass communications. When the final details of the agreement are settled officials of my Department will work in conjunction with members of IBEC to explain relevant effects to the various busineses.  I appreciate Deputy McDowell's concern, but as Deputy O'Malley is aware from his dealings with the GATT negotiations, the final GATT round will not be relevant to specific businesses. It would be more beneficial to disseminate information on the agreement through trade organisations such as IBEC.  However, if it is necessary to hold seminars or information campaigns for particular sectoral business interests, I will consider the matter but I will not do so now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised by the Minister's reply.  At this stage the Government should be aware of the sectors that will be affected and are under threat resulting from this measure.  Is the Minister aware that last week 150 jobs were lost in Klopman, Tralee, one of our main textile units, and that jobs are under threat in Pretty Polly, Killarney?  What measures are the Government taking to ensure that industries, which are suffering a loss in jobs, will be cushioned from the effects of cheap imports from Third World countries which will be allowed in here following the GATT agreement?  What is the Government doing to improve our cost structure, to reduce the cost of employing people and so on to ensure jobs in those vulnerable industries will survive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have a broad economic debate, more appropriate to the budget, on the various measures the Government is putting in place to improve business.  The Fitzpatrick consultancy <Col N="2006" /> study &mdash; many Deputies, highlighted the effect of not having a GATT agreement &mdash; would have resulted in the proliferation of trade disputes and protectionist measures which would do untold damage for Ireland.  We depend on the export market more than our European partners and many other countries. It is common sense that a more liberalised trading regime would benefit Ireland, particularly in respect of the industries referred to by the Deputy.  The problems in some of those industries resulted from a liberalising of world trade conditions.  However, a more liberal trading regime for Ireland, as recommended in the Fitzpatrick report, will be of immense benefit to the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply to Deputy Deenihan's question is not satisfactory. Our textile industry, which employs thousands of people, has been in decline in recent years.  I asked the Minister to give a specific answer.  He stated that the impact on certain industries would be indirect and nebulous.  I suggest it will be neither indirect nor nebulous in regard to the textile industry and the agricultural industry as it relates to the economic position of small farmers. The House deserves more thorough and better researched replies than the Minister has given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The final agreement on the GATT negotiations was a big improvement on what was on the table in the first instance.  When the GATT negotiations concluded Professor Seamus Sheehy, not known to be a supporter of the Government, said the deal for Ireland and our European partners was far better than could have been expected; it was a tremendous achievement. Deputies Connor and Deenihan raised the question of jobs in other sectors. Ireland depends on trade and we are not immune to conditions worldwide. We will not be able to protect various sectors of the economy in the present competitive world.  Unfortunately, that is the harsh reality of economic life today.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that if the economic position is country-to-country trade and we are to exploit it to the optimum, Deputy McDowell's question inquiring if the Government will publish a document for the guidance of manufacturers is very pertinent?  The Department's report, and other economists' reports, advise on the need for domestic policy reforms as a result of globalisation.  Is the Department contemplating any domestic reforms?</P>

      <P>The economic position is one of country-to-country trade.  Individual businesses involved in such activity usually assess changes through their organisations or through groups such as IBEC.  If I consider it is necessary to have a broader information campaign regarding specific sectors, I will provide for that. I understand that there is no demand from business people for the type of campaign which Deputies McDowell and Rabbitte mentioned, but if such demand arises my Department will consider organising one.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1</P>
    <P>In page 2, line 12, after &ldquo;saothair&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and to provide for the making of regulations relating to the manner of recruitment of apprentices&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the intent of my amendment No. 6.  She has done this in two ways; by extending the title of the Bill and by way of her amendment No. 4.  As a result the Bill is greatly improved. However, I am disappointed the Minister has not given a clear indication as to how she intends to respond to the need spelt out by all Deputies to put in place a fair and transparent system of recruitment to apprenticeships.  On amendment No. 4, the Minister said she intends to make regulations and lay them before the House for approval.  The issue which initiated the Bill was the proposal to introduce a levy.  I understand that measure is to be introduced on 1 April. The Minister should have ensured that the entry regulations were in place before the levy is introduced and employers are required to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public representatives should know the context of those regulations.  We should be satisfied that they will meet the requirements highlighted during the debate on Second and Committee Stages. We are asked to take that matter on trust. Considering how full the agenda is with legislation it is unlikely that the Minister will have the regulations prepared and laid before the House for approval by <Col N="2049" /> 1 April.  That is unsatisfactory.  We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke.  There is no justification for having to come back on another occasion to deal with the regulations.</P>
    <P>This is a small Bill and the Minister has had a number of weeks to respond to the amendments put down by Deputy Bruton and myself in respect of this issue.  It is not unreasonable of us, or of Deputy Rabbitte who is also present, to expect that whatever the Minister intends to do by way of regulation would be clearly explained to us so that we can give our view on it.  She has failed to demonstrate that whatever mechanism she has in mind will meet the clear requirements we spelt out in previous debates on this issue. There is little point in having in place an approved scheme of apprenticeships if the system of entry to apprenticeships is not clear, fair and transparent.  The system should be vastly different from the present one whereby in many cases a person's qualification, aptitude or wish to find a place in a course is not the determining factor when looking for an apprenticeship but rather it is a case of who you know or who your father knows. This is a very sore point with parents and young people in my constituency and I am not convinced that we have advanced a sufficient response to that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It has taken us more than a decade to introduce this fairly simple, straightforward, modest reforming measure.  It is regrettable the Minister did not seek to take on board the spirit of the amendments from Deputies Bruton and Quill.  She seemed enthusiastically to agree on Committee Stage that the question of equality of access was central to this matter and indicated that she would be very forthcoming in that regard. She even pointed out that we are not talking about the number of places available but about equity of access on the basis of criteria which, as Deputy Bruton outlined in his amendment, are clearly set out and available for public inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's amendment proposes that the Minister may introduce regulations, <Col N="2050" /> the purpose of which would be to ensure that such recruitment is carried out in an equitable and fair manner.  I agree with that aspiration, but is it any more than an aspiration in that it does not say what the criteria will be?  I acknowledge that the Minister has the same good intentions in the matter as the rest of us, but I do not believe this Bill will tackle the problem of discrimination in the present system.</P>
    <P>There is abuse in this very important area.  At the end of the day our health as an economic trading country, depends on the skills and competence of our workforce, and our ability to compete internationally is determined to a large extent by the skills and competence of these people.  On Committee Stage I remarked as a trade unionist, that the trade unions cannot wash their hands of responsibility in this area because they were part of the old boys' network that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As the Minister said, there were very few girls, and that is the subject of a separate amendment.  No serious impact has been made by young women in this area and therefore it is even more important that the Minister take on board the arguments with which she agrees.</P>
      <P>The Minister has promised to introduce regulations, but I do not know when that will take place.  Having regard to the fact that it is a decade since we all agreed that such progress as is represented in this Bill was desirable, how long more will it take us to produce regulations? The Minister is asking us to take on faith what will be in the regulations.  This is the Paul Daniels school of introducing amendments: now you see them, now you do not.  I did not hear the Minister spell out what will be in the regulations or whether they will address what is a very important question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy could not have heard me explaining that matter earlier because I did not have an opportunity to do so, I simply moved one amendment.  I mistakenly believed that one addresses each amendment separately before addressing the group of amendments.  Therefore, I spoke only on amendments No. 1, an amendment to the title which reads: &ldquo;In page 2, line 12, after &ldquo;SAOTHAIR&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE MAKING OF REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE MATTER OF RECRUITMENT OF APPRENTICESHIPS&rdquo; I was advised by the draftsperson that, since the whole thrust of the Bill had been altered from being a purely technical Bill of financial substance to a Bill of much wider scope, it was necessary to insert this wording.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be scurrilous, to sound like a school teacher or to in any way lay down the law; I wish to set out the facts. It would have been very easy for me, and I would have been entirely within my rights, to say that this is a technical Bill and therefore we can talk only about technical matters.  The whole issue of apprentices is very much a Chinese box &mdash; when you open one box there is another inside.  In my five years in the Department of Education, a time in which I encountered a myriad of challenges and difficulties, no issue took up as much of my time as the question of apprentices, and I am only a little way along that road.  Deputy Bruton said that reform in this area started in 1975 while Deputy Rabbitte talked about a decade of such reforms.</P>

      <P>That is very unusual. Reference was made to a discussion document of 1988 in which many vistas of delight were held out to us along the primrose paths of apprenticeship. However, that was not the case when I took over responsibility for labour affairs in the Department of Enterprise and Employment where there was a lot <Col N="2052" /> of work to be done.  I am not casting any aspirations on past or present officials and Ministers or on FAS.  I am stating the facts.  I was determined to use this Bill to make some progress along this road.  I accept that the Bill may not be as comprehensive as we all would have wished &mdash; large bodies move slowly.  My concerns about equity in the areas of apprenticeships are well founded and have been voiced also by other people. The Government and the Opposition may have the same point of view on the issue but, of necessity, we may have to approach it in a different way.</P>
      <P>Apprenticeships are the Cinderella of the training-education system.  They have not always been seen as all-embracing, as they should have been.  When I discuss the issue of apprenticeships with the trade unions, IBEC, the CIF, and the TUI it is like opening Pandora's box. Too much emphasis was placed in earlier agreements under the Central Review Committee on increasing the number of apprentices.  Unlike me, nobody has looked at the number of apprentices who have completed their apprenticeships, the number who have their papers, the number who sat their final examination, the number who are now redundant and the number who did not complete their examinations are now quasi-apprentices, so to speak, who may be employable in Ireland but not in other countries.  The subject of apprenticeships is very vast and even if we were to discuss it from now until St. Patrick's Day we would not cover all aspects.</P>
      <P>I presume there is no objection to amendment No. 1 which merely extends the long title of the Bill.  Amendment No. 6 proposes to insert a new section 4 in page 4, between lines 9 and 10 as follows:</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may by regulations provide for requirements to be complied with for the purpose of ensuring that in respect of the recruitment of apprentices in one or more than one designated sector of industry specified in the regulations, such recruitment is carried out in an equitable and fair manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> (2)  Where regulations under this section are proposed to be made, a draft of the proposed regulations shall, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>I want to reply to the points which have been raised by the Deputies opposite.  I appreciate that the Bill does not cover everything the Deputies would wish it to cover.</P>
    <P>I have indicated on a number of occasions during the course of the debate on this Bill my concern about the need for greater equity in the recruitment of apprentices.  I have noted also that this concern was shared by a number of Deputies in their contribution to the debate.  I have had discussions with FÁS as to how best this problem might be addressed and I have met also with representatives of IBEC, the CIF and ICTU on several occasions.  All are agreed that the current inequities need to be removed from the system but there are different views on how this might be done.</P>
    <P>Naturally one needs to be sensitive when dealing with complex issues such as contracts of employment between private individuals, the employer and apprentice. Many of the employers involved run small operations and, therefore, it is important that any solution we come up with would not alienate potential employments, particularly during the transition period from the old to the new system.  Nevertheless, I felt strongly enough about the matter to contemplate the possibility of bringing in a legislative provision which would give compulsory backing to an equitable recruitment regime.  I believe the State would have the right to do this given the investment it is making in the traning of apprentices.</P>
    <P>On balance, and in the light of my discussions with the social partners who feel that the compulsory road would be premature at this time.  I propose to hold off on such an approach for the moment. <Col N="2054" /> However, I am proposing to introduce a new section 4 to the Bill which will enable the Minister to make regulations to provide for conditions of recruitment of apprentices to provide for conditions of recruitment of apprentices.  I will come back to the details of my amendment later.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it is proposed to develop and operate over a trial period a code of practice to be followed by employers in the recruitment of apprentices.  The code has been developed by FÁS and has already come before the board of FÁS.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the new <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> commits the social partners to the adoption of this code of practice.  The objectives of the code will be to achieve equity through recruitment by open and fair competition; to ensure equal opportunity through filling apprenticeship vacancies on the basis of individual merit and to promote the use of sound recruitment procedure.  The code will also endorse a degree of positive discrimination aimed at getting under-represented categories of society into traditional apprenticeship vacancies.</P>
    <P>Under the code, the recruitment practice would be that a person specification should be developed at the outset for any apprenticeship vacancy that arises.  The specification would set out the educational, knowledge and aptitude requirements of the job as well as the minimum statutory entry requirements. The code would require that a number of applicants should be sought for any vacancy, that this should be done on the basis of public advertisement and that such advertisements should contain the clear message that canvassing will disqualify.</P>
    <P>It is recognised, of course, that public advertising may not always be the most efficient or effective means of recruitment for all employers.  Accordingly, the FÁS employment services will be proposed as an alternative option, in which FÁS will either supply a list of persons who have expressed interest in obtaining an apprenticeship or, indeed, will undertake <Col N="2055" /> the recruitment process for the employer.</P>
    <P>The code will also provide for the use of application forms, give guidance on selection methods, selection should and on aptitude testing and ultimately will provide that the final selection should be based solely on the extent to which candidates meet the requirements of the job as determined by the selection process.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, FÁS will be a proactive participant in selling this new code and would envisage being in a position to offer, for example, model packs of appropriate advertisement samples, proforma application forms, etc.  FÁS will also be a monitor in relation to the active adoption of the code by employers.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day the success or otherwise of the voluntary code of practice will very much depend on its adoption and implementation by the social partners, particularly by those on the employer side.  I readily admit &mdash; this has been alluded to by Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; that the responsibilities in this respect are joint ones and that there have often been lacunae on both sides.  I appreciate that there can be a degree of scepticism about the effectiveness of codes of practice generally but, in deference to the concerns expressed by the social partners about the too early advancement of the compulsory route, I am prepared to operate the code for a trial period.  I have to say I am heartened by the positive reaction I have received from the social partners to the concept of the code.  When I first proposed a code of practice I was told by many seasoned observers in the apprenticeship field that I would find it hard to make any inroads in this area, that it was, in effect, a closed shop.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to be seen as wielding the big stick, the prospect of a compulsory approach remains open if after the trial period the code is not seen to be effective.</P>
    <P>My proposed amendment which introduces a new section 4 to the Bill will enable the Minister to make regulations governing the recruitment of apprentices <Col N="2056" /> to ensure that such recruitment is undertaken in a fair and equitable manner.  I am also proposing in subsection (2) of the amendment that a resolution, approved by both Houses, will be necessary before the regulations can be introduced. Accordingly, Deputies would have the opportunity to discuss any such proposed regulations.  I put forward my amendment to the House but of course I understand the democratic process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has outlined to us is not satisfactory.  At this late stage we are being offered a voluntary code which, we are told, goes against the Minister's own instincts and on which it appears she has been unable to get agreement from the social partners. It is quite clear that she has the agreement of the House to proceed on the basis of something other than a voluntary code.  If she produced her amendment in a way that gave legislative force to this measure, she would have the support of the House as far as I can ascertain. It is a sad reflection on the concept of social partnership if we are required to make do with second best.  What has dogged the apprenticeship system is that everyone has had to be satisfied in respect of every change and as a result, an extremely conservative attitude has been taken to the development of the apprenticeship system in general.</P>
      <P>While I understand the Minister is telling us we will have a trial period and we will come back to the issue again, she is telling us also that we will have no control over that.  It is only if the Government decides at some date in the future that the voluntary code has not worked satisfactorily that she will come back to the House with regulations to implement, in some satisfactory form, what we all require to be done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sceptical about the procedure the Minister has outlined.  Specifying the requirements for a vacancy, placing public advertisements in regard to how canvassing will disqualify and FÁS having the opportunity to provide lists of available applicants are all inoffensive measures but they will not guarantee equality of access.  They give an appearance of fairness but they do not provide any guarantee and, as the Minister knows, we as taxpayers are paying 80 to 90 per cent of the cost of the training involved.  It will be easy to give the appearance that the code is being complied with when in fact what will happen <Col N="2060" /> is that the person to be selected for the apprenticeship will be known in advance, a certain procedure will be followed to give the appearance of fairness but in fact it will not be under the control of FÁS. The procedure will be entirely left to the discretion of the employer; one would hope the employer would offer some evidence that he or she has tried to secure equity but that is all that will be offered. I cannot see this as a major reform of a system which we know has been working unsatisfactorily.  If we were trying this <i>ab initio</i> and did not know the extent of inequality in the system, perhaps we could accept the notion of a trial period and see if this voluntary code works. However, during the 50 year period of the scheme we have always had the problem of inequity and I do not believe we are facing up squarely to the issue.</P>
    <P>Let us be very clear on the value of apprenticeship to young people. Nowhere is that better illustrated than by the figures in the case of State agencies that have a clear, equitable and fair way of competing for apprenticeships.  I refer to Dublin Corporation, the ESB, CIE and the Army in which case Deputy Jim Higgins illustrated, on Second Stage, there were 16,500 applicants for a mere 170 places.  That demonstrates the level of demand there is for these opportunities and how important it is that, if we are to have 3,500 places, as the Minister promises on the programme those places be allocated in some manner seen to be clear, fair and above board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte identified a feeling that partnership Government amounts to talking to the social partners and, if it all squares up with them, that is fine.  It should be remembered that we are the people's elected representatives and proposals have to square up with our desires and hopes.  So far as I can detect, from both the Government and Opposition sides of the House, this is not what we want.  We are having to tack to winds that are not of our choosing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's voluntary code, with its accompanying trial period, would be all right if we were initiating a new scheme. However, we know that there have been <Col N="2061" /> many warts in this scheme over the years and what we are really doing now is endeavouring to deal with them.  It is not good enough to say we will let them continue for another while, hoping there will be sufficient paper work produced to give the appearance of fairness.  We will not be convinced and I do not think things will change on the ground.</P>
    <P>The Government is proceeding with change on a piecemeal basis whereas we were promised there would be a proper White Paper to assess the method by which manpower training should evolve. Had we had that White Paper in advance and teased out the policy issues we would not be in the predicament in which we now find ourselves.  To be fair to the Minister, she is trying to unpick something she inherited from her predecessors which is wholly unsatisfactory.  Had the Government proceeded by way of White Paper and not come into the House until this issue had been properly teased out in a policy fashion, we would not be in the present mess.</P>
    <P>I am not moved to accept this.  I should prefer to proceed with a more clearcut amendment, giving clear instructions to the Minister as to what this Chamber wishes her to do in relation to reform of the apprenticeship programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am disappointed with the Minister's response to the very strong case made by all Opposition spokespersons on this issue on perhaps three separate occasions in the course of our discussion on this Bill.  I find her response weak and predict it will be ineffective.  It is a poor prescription to deal with a very serious position.  It is like offering a blood transfusion to a man in need of a heart transplant.  The Minister should have followed her own good instinct, expressed clearly and repeatedly in this House, and gone for some kind of compulsory scheme.  It would appear she was overinfluenced by people with a vested interest in maintaining the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the situation is delicate, that a number of employers think that the taking on of apprentices is something of a nuisance.  That is wrong for a number <Col N="2062" /> of reasons.  This year alone more than £30 million of taxpayers' money is invested in the scheme and taxpayers have a right to expect a better return.  It is time that firm and clear measures were taken to change the attitude and approach of employers.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of reference to the German system on Second Stage when it was pointed out quite clearly that in Germany, where there is a very highly skilled workforce&mdash;I might add one with which our young people must compete in the open market conditions now prevailing &mdash; there is also a very strong commitment among employers to take on and fully train apprentices.  That appears to be endemic in work practices in Germany. We do not appear to have anything approaching that level of commitment on the part of Irish employers.  It is about time we began the long haul, putting in place here the kind of culture that would emulate the German system.  It will take time but the journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.  We have been afforded an opportunity here to take a step in that direction.  I am sorry that opportunity has not been grasped.  Employers will have to be reasoned with and reckoned with. It will have to be pointed out to them that no one generation eats the seed corn of the next, that every generation has a right and responsibility that must be discharged in relation to the upcoming generation of young people who have a right to a proper system of training within the apprenticeship scheme so that they will have the skills to build the Ireland of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>That is a philosophic argument but it has to be made.  Every opportunity that presents itself to advance that argument to the people who are resisting it must be grasped.  This was one such opportunity. Had the Minister given us more time to study this amendment she would have received a much more coherent response than she will receive from me.  I have been given this amendment only now.  That is not the best way to do business at any time but particularly when we are discussing an issue as serious as the skill base of the Irish workforce.  It was a huge issue in the Culliton and a number of <Col N="2063" /> other reports.  There is a remarkable resistance on the part of employers to take on apprentices in any large measure. This occasion ought to have been used to convince employers that the obligation is theirs and that that obligation must be met.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us, in the course of her introductory remarks, that the social partners feel the compulsory road would be premature at this time.  Therefore, they are acknowledging that the compulsory road may be inevitable at some time.  What are we to do?  Are we to wait until the position becomes infinitely worse?  Is that what we are waiting for?</P>
    <P>We must remember that a difficult pay deal has recently been settled, that we will not have comprehensive discussions with the social partners, for some time.  I should have thought that the discussion just brought to an end was the proper context within which to advance this argument more fully.  Could it be, perhaps, that there was nobody at those discussions speaking for the vast army of young people who want to find places on apprenticeship schemes, who have the will and skill to work for the future of this country but who cannot find places? Can it be that there was nobody participating in those recent discussions directly representing them?  Is that the weakness in the whole process?  It would appear that it is.  Therefore, the social partners have decided that we should hold off, that it would be premature to introduce a compulsory element now, that we could do it at another time, like Mr. Micawber, waiting for something to turn up.  I wonder when that other time will arise.  This is the time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised the fundamental question as to who is taking these decisions.  I would have thought the Minister would have taken on board the points made by us public representatives, representing impartially, without a vested interest of any kind.  I should have thought that the Minister would have stood her ground and emerged from the social partners with a system that would remedy the problems outlined so clearly <Col N="2064" /> and categorically.  This is wimpish.  It is similar to using a bandage when what is needed is a new limb.  It is weak and is unacceptable and I am very disappointed. It is supposed to develop and operate the voluntary code over two years.  I predict that nothing substantial will happen.</P>

That cannot be said of entry into an apprentice scheme.  It is about time it was remedied and not addressed in this weak, half-hearted way.  I am disappointed and I do not think this amendment will make any difference at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for circulating the documents. What has happened is worthy of note because I suspect it has not dawned on the Minister that what was done, far from offering an insult to the Opposition, is becoming the norm.  The Minister made a strong statement in her opening remarks when she said she felt so strongly about the issue of equity that she favoured a legislative provision which would give compulsory backing to an equitable recruitment regime.  To sustain her argument <Col N="2065" /> she said the reason was that the State was paying the piper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxpayer is paying £30 million of it.  That is a good philosophical base for the Minister's case that a legislative provision may be desirable. She then said that on balance and in light of her discussions with the social partners she decided to go the voluntary road.  It is interesting that the Minister found time in her busy schedule to discuss this issue with the social partners but not with the Opposition spokespersons.  They were rather hastily summoned when the previous business finished earlier than anticipated. We did not have the Minister's text, yet the issue could be discussed with the social partners.  I do not say that in a confrontational way.  We do not object to the Minister discussing it with the social partners and I know that irrespective of whether we did, the Minister would do so anyway.  It is probably a good idea but at the end of the day laws are enacted by the House.  I am not all that interested in whether the social partners think it a good idea.  I will weigh that up for what it is worth in each individual case.  As Deputies Bruton and Quill said, we are entitled to advance notice of what is happening.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The name is a mouthful but I am not sure if PCW denotes anything that would give a great boost to the economy.  This Bill is really about competitiveness and, as it has taken us more than a decade to get this far, there is a strong argument to be made for tackling the apprenticeship question in a comprehensive fashion rather than merely dealing with the levy system and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lecturer in the economics department in UCD, the economist Dr. Kevin O'Rourke, has written an interesting and relevant article on the GATT Agreement. It states that training and educational policies are exceptionally difficult to implement in Ireland.  We do not have a tradition of well-organised <Col N="2066" /> apprenticeship schemes operated by unions and firms like Denmark and Germany. Government programmes can only be a partial substitute.  In a small country like ours, without a large employment base, there is no guarantee that someone entering a training scheme will find a job on leaving it and when Government does pump money into education or training, as often as not, the newly acquired human capital emigrates to benefit other economics rather than our own.  Solving these problems will require patience and imagination.  He goes on to develop the point and the importance of the apprenticeship system in terms of competitiveness.  That is what the programme is supposed to be about. Equity is important in that context.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to see how the voluntary code of practice works.  I do not know how quickly it will be put in place.  I think it will be in operation for longer than two years before it will come back to the House for us to address the matter legislatively, if that is the conclusion we reach at the end of the day.  I do not think there is much point in pursuing the matter further.</P>

      <P>I gave a comprehensive reply on Report Stage.  I do not wish to reiterate everything I said then.  This area is a Pandora's box but the Bill is an honest attempt to come to grips with what I have found to be a very complex, multi-layered situation within the appenticeship arena.  I commend amendments Nos. 1 and 7 to the House.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with the reply.  We have well rehearsed the arguments.  I am glad the House was able to facilitate some discussion of the matter.  Having a voluntary code is trying to catch water with a sieve.  The Minister will be able to give a parliamentary reply in six months time showing that advertisements were placed or whatever.  As I believe we should deal with this in a statutory manner and proceed with regulations <Col N="2067" /> which would be watertight, I will press my amendment.  It is important that I do so because it is proposed to expand apprenticeships from their traditional areas and into all types of new areas.  In the future we will impose the apprenticeship model on areas of training not currently dealt with in this fashion.  It is explicitly stated in all brochures that the employer is solely responsible for sponsorship and that FÁS will be at a distance. The addition of the voluntary code is not sufficient to convince me that we have a satisfactory solution to the problem.  I will be pressing the amendment because if the House were to decide that my amendment was the right one we would give the Minister and the social partners the correct signal as to how this should be dealt with.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  In the making of such an order, the Minister shall at all times take full cognisance of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the emerging needs of young women,</P>
      <P>(ii)  new and emerging areas of industrial activity,</P>
      <P>(iii)  the potential for multi skilling.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a multiple amendment which seeks to improve the position of women in the context of the legislation we are about to adopt.  The low paid position of women in the workforce is widely acknowledged.  A recent statistic shows <Col N="2068" /> that on average women earn 68 per cent of the hourly male industrial wage.  That is a grim statistic and is totally unacceptable. We ought to use every available opportunity to remedy the situation. I would argue that the introduction of this Bill is one such opportunity.  Because of a direct connection between low pay and low level of skill, I ask the Minister in any order she seeks to make, arising from this Bill, that an attempt be made to remedy the situation.  Under the provisions of the Bill as drafted the position of women stands to worsen because FÁS will no longer be sponsors.  Henceforth, in the new apprenticeship scheme, employers will be the sole sponsors of apprentices.  In that case women stand to fare badly.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out in 1991 confirms that two-thirds of all women in apprenticeship schemes in that year were sponsored by FÁS, only one-third were sponsored by employers.  Clearly, there is either a difficulty or a reluctance on the part of women in getting employers to sponsor their apprenticeships.  I am concerned that the position of women, as a result of the change from FÁS sponsorship to 100 per cent sponsorship on the part of employers, will worsen.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind when she is making the orders.  It is important, in any change, that we anticipate that problems will arise for women and that the situation will worsen.  We should seek to use every available opportunity to compensate.  I ask the Minister in the context of this amendment to seek actively to do that in any order she makes.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to new and emerging areas of industrial activity that will be designated for apprenticeships as the scheme is extended.  It is important to bear that in mind, not alone as it applies to women but as it applies to the workforce in general.  There is little point in training the workforce of tomorrow for the jobs of yesterday.  Whole areas of work are beginning to emerge now for which young people here have little formal training.  Within education and within the regional colleges there is <Col N="2069" /> a much greater awareness in anticipating openings and opportunities, new areas of work and new potential areas of employment. I do not think there is the same level of awareness within our apprenticeship scheme.  Young people who choose, for one reason or another, to take the route of training and apprenticeship as opposed to the route of a formal education in college, have the same right to be trained in the skills that are likely to be the jobs of tomorrow. For example, in Germany there are now more jobs in the media, art and entertainment areas than in the manufacturing of motor cars.  That is a whole sea change for a country like Germany that patented the Mercedes Benz and made the Volks-wagen such a popular car.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They also are in trouble now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Germans are anticipating that and are diversifying and changing their training.  They are preparing their young people for the opportunities of tomorrow and we must prepare likewise.  I will not labour this point because I know from previous statements by the Minister of State and from her experience and commitment to education that she is aware of the need to designate new areas of training for jobs as they emerge.  That is very important. In that new process I anticipate greater opportunities for everybody and especially a greater number of opportunities for women.  In many traditional areas, especially the old crafts and trades, it was difficult to find suitable opportunities for women.  Many of the new crafts, skills and trades are much more suitable for women.  I ask the Minister to designate these areas within formal structures of apprenticeship training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third part of my amendment deals with the potential in all training for multi-skilling. It is difficult to accept that in any legislation we would ignore the need in all training for multi-skilling.  This was mentioned in great detail in the Culliton and other reports where it was pointed <Col N="2070" /> out that there is a deficit in training here, and that in the kind of training we have, there is a deficit in terms of the kind of flexibility that comes from the concept of multi-skilling.</P>
    <P>In the rapidly changing world in which we live, with the emergence of new technology and when the advances of the day before yesterday are almost out of date, it is important to train a workforce whose initial training is such that they can be trained and retrained.  The days of starting off work in one position and ending up doing the same kind of work are almost behind us.  We must ensure that young people have the training that will give them the flexibility to become competent in a certain skill and be in a position to take on different areas of activity. That is to take on board the principle and the concept of multi-skilling which is very important.  One of the oldest principles in learning is to learn the skills of learning. That is the basis of the whole idea of multi-skilling.</P>
    <P>Multi-skilling is important if we are to have a workforce with the flexibility of skills and mind to compete with other countries with whom we are in intense competition.  There is little point in spending a great deal of money in bringing our roads up to the standard that applies elsewhere and in bringing our physical infrastructure up to standard if we do not being our skills base up to the level that pertains in other countries with whom we have to compete in a cruel open market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly support this amendment.  On the emerging needs of young women, evidence shows that efforts made by FÁS to attract young women into apprenticeships have failed. Perhaps a score of young women were <Col N="2071" /> brought into apprenticeships but the dropout rate has been virtually 100 per cent.  Serious problems were emerging, even when there was the possibility of FÁS sponsorship for women.  If the Minister is determined to achieve the 10 per cent quota for women in apprenticeships set out in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women she would need to produce significant proposals.  I did not detect those proposals either in her Second Stage speech or in her Committee Stage contributions.  It is important to address this issue in legislation so that we can question the Minister at a future date as to what has been achieved under this heading.</P>
      <P>In relation to emerging areas of activity, we run a real danger in proposing the extension of apprenticeships into new areas, of trying to pour new wine into old casks.  The record of the apprenticeship scheme for flexibility and responsiveness to changing training needs is dismal.  The Minister's proposal to expand the apprenticeship system into new areas gives me a chilling feeling that we will find ourselves encrusting these new emerging areas in a system that has proved highly resistant to change in the past.  That was illustrated a short time ago when the Minister told us that what she saw as a desirable change in training in relation to equity of access was effectively blocked by the social partners.  The whole system of apprenticeship is steeped in the concept of having huge committees, representing a variety of views, deliberating on any change in the apprenticeship programme.  The Minister will not have the ability to press through a modern training framework in that sort of committee atmosphere where everyone has to be carried along together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Multi-skilling is an important issue. The future undoubtedly requires multi-skilling. In every other country in Europe multi-skilling is the order of the day, but we stick with the traditional demarcation into single skill designated trades.  I admit that the Minister is proposing that the modules for the future can be flexible and that the system admits of flexibility and <Col N="2072" /> multi-skilling, but is the will there among those with whom the Minister will be dealing with trying to press for such flexibility and adaptability?  That is where the question mark lies.  It is not in the desire of the Minister or the Department to see multi-skilling developed here, but will the system with a representative from every quarter respond to the need or will it be considered that traditional areas are being encroached upon?  These are important issues.  We have not had a serious policy paper on these issues to enable us see where the Minister's proposals fit into the wider evolution of our training needs.  That lack is handicapping us in dealing with this Bill and that is why we are putting forward somewhat unsatisfactory amendments in our desire to see a modern training system evolve in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate is developing interestingly.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In making such an order, the Minister shall at all times take full cognisance of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the emerging needs of young women,</P>
      <P>(ii)  new and emerging areas of industrial activity,</P>
      <P>(iii)  the potential for multi-skilling.</P>
      <P>My first instinct on reading that was to say that those points are embodied in the new standards based system.  However, when we are talking about women I hope that apart from young women we are also talking about mature people who wish to come back into the system and be trained.  We are all committed to antiageism. We do not want to suggest that because one is young, one is fit for some things, because one is middle aged one is fit for others and because one is old one is not fit for anything.  I would have some inhibition about referring just to young women because we encourage women to come back into the workforce and to be retrained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2073" /> Great efforts have been made by FÁS to try to bring this unwieldy ship around and move it in certain directions.  When one starts to categorise what one wants to emphasise in legislation, one may leave out many areas which should be addressed.  This is a preamble to my main points.  People, including State bodies, take greater cognisance when a matter is part of legislation.  I have often heard staff in FÁS refer to the legislative provisions governing them.  There is a weight attaching to legislation as distinct from advice.</P>
    <P>I have consulted with my officials briefly and I am disposed to accept Deputy Quill's amendment, subject to a slight <i>caveat</i>.  This amendment has not been submitted to the parliamentary draftsman for his scrutiny but certainly in paragraph (i) I would not like &ldquo;young&rdquo; to be retained.  I do not think we should make a distinction between &ldquo;women&rdquo; and &ldquo;young women&rdquo; and I say that in the knowledge that many women wish to enter training or retraining.  I think the word &ldquo;young&rdquo; is pejorative in itself and we do not use the term &ldquo;young men&rdquo; and so on.  The parliamentary draftsman might have to change the wording slightly.  Is Deputy Quill prepared to delete the word &ldquo;young&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

      <P>Paragraph (ii) refers to new and emerging areas of industrial activity.  This is already included but perhaps we should give it emphasis.  In the open spirit in which we have addressed the debate I would be prepared to accept the amendment subject to the <i>caveat</i> that should the parliamentary draftsman need to make textual adjustments I would have to amend it in the Seanad.  Does the Deputy accept that?</P>

It is for that reason I pressed the amendment fully.  I accept the point the Minister has made on the needs of all women, irrespective of age.  I am very pleased with her attitude and approach.  I do not anticipate that the parliamentary draftsman will have major difficulties as the ideas are very simple and straightforward.  Should it be necessary, I appreciate the Minister's offer to come back to the Seanad where elected representatives will have another opportunity to deal with the issue.

      <P>In page 4, line 18, after &ldquo;An Foras&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or by a suitable education body designated for this purpose by order of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to say much about this amendment.  In the context of the apprenticeship scheme it is not of great relevance.  I would like to see apprenticeship schemes and the system of training evolve.  I am conscious that we ought not create divisions between education and training.  We should strive to keep open the possibility that certification will be carried out by an educational body as opposed to Forfás.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am broadly supportive of this amendment.  We are providing money for a system of certification and the Bill is unduly constraining certification to FÁS.  I see no reason to constrain the system of certification in that way.  It might well be better to have independent invigilation of standards.  The amendment sponsored by Deputy Quill gives greater flexibility and is likely to be more enduring and respond to changing training needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quill's amendment is not unduly prescriptive. The funding arrangement provided that the levy proceeds could be used to cover a portion of the administration costs of FÁS.  With the levy set at 0.25 per cent the proceeds will not be sufficient to cover even the training allowances and wages of apprentices and the State would have to cover the other costs.  Deputy Quill's aim is to head off a conflict between the training authorities and the educational authorities in relation to aspects of the apprenticeship scheme. Under the original Act FÁS is the statutory body with responsibility for the operation of the apprenticeship system but it is clearly provided that there must be consultation with the Department of Education.  This consultation has somtimes been very spirited, to put it in code; on other occasions they have been fairly placid.  I would have no difficulty with FÁS and the education authorities consulting <Col N="2079" /> with each other about the apprenticeships scheme.  The officials in my Department have a joint liaison committee with officials in the Department of Education which meets frequently at assistant secretary level and downwards. Sometimes relationships are a little brittle and sometimes they are good but each set of officials seeks to do the best for the apprentices in their care.  If that is the thrust of Deputy Quill's amendment I accept that, but technically I cannot accept the amendment because the money available is in no way adequate.  I certainly accept the need for goodwill and constraint liaison between the two Departments on how best to deliver the system and certify it, bearing in mind that FÁS has the original remit in regard to apprenticeships under the 1969 Act but in consultation with the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's response to my amendment and her acceptance of its spirit.  I would like to see the existing relationship between education and training reinforced.  It is true that such relationships have been brittle at times, and that is a very charitable way of putting it.  I would never wish to see a clear cleavage between education and training.  This would benefit nobody. I hope the Minister will use every occasion to encourage good relationships between the two Departments and keep open the possibility and the certifying body would be drawn from an educational body rather than from FÁS.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a)  A procedure of evaluation of the operation of the apprenticeship programme shall be established and carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute, which shall, <i>inter alia,</i> report on&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Tentative changes are being advanced <Col N="2081" /> by the Minister to improve the operation of the apprenticeship scheme.  A satisfactory evaluation of the apprenticeship programme has never been carried out. I propose that we should include in the legislation the principle that an evaluation of the apprenticeship programme should be made by the ESRI, who have carried out a great deal of evaluation work for FÁS on different aspects of its programme.  The Minister will be aware that it is frustrating for Opposition Deputies to know that such work is being done but not made available to either the Opposition or the public in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>To what work is the Deputy referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The evaluation of existing programmes.  It has been a major blot on the Government's approach to the spending of the Structural Funds that the public at large is not privy to the apparent evaluation which is taking place.  While we are assured that money spent in our name is well spent we do not see any evidence that that is the case, other than Ministers saying they have seen material which gives them a warm glow.</P>
      <P>The apprenticeship programme needs some evaluation.  It is extremely resistant to change and has moved with the times. We are proposing to give it a greater financial base and to expand it into new areas.  However, that should not be done unless we have proven evidence that it is working well.  In my amendment I have set out the issues that would be inherent in any evaluation.  For example, there should be independent evaluation in respect of the equity of entry to apprenticeships. That is crucial since we have had to make do with the Minister's voluntary code.  If we do not have a statutory code that ensures equity we must appoint a person to evaluate independently whether equity is secured by that code. The necessity for the Minister to accept my amendment in some shape or form is more urgent in the light of her decision to adopt a voluntary code of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance between the numbers of new apprentices taken on and the <Col N="2082" /> employment opportunities for which there are not already trained workers should also be examined.  I am disturbed at the widespread evidence that many apprentices only go to a certain distance and fall through the net.  We must know exactly what is happening.  Is it because there are not sufficient places available? Are too many apprentices taken on to make the figures look good with no positions available at the end of their training, resulting in wasted investment in their future?  We must achieve the correct balance. Ministers will always want to say they have made a commitment to, say 3,500, 4,500 or 5,500 apprenticeship places, but that is pointless if we pour them in at the front end and they fall through before completing their training.</P>
    <P>The responsiveness of the apprenticeship scheme to changing training needs, such as the need for multi-skilling, has already been discussed.  It is important that we know the apprenticeship programme is responding to such changes. The programme is bound in by representative committees which have made it resistant to change.  If the programme is not capable of responding to change an independent evaluation of that fact is necessary so that the evidence is available to us.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about the certification of standards achieved, particularly in relation to off-the-job modules where, perhaps, employers are under pressure and their system of certification may not stand up.  FÁS will endeavour to ensure that the certification process is carried out in a proper manner but, in voting money for this purpose we have a right to know that it is done properly. Our training should measure up to the best international standards.  That means we must be competitive.  The Government has recognised the importance of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I have set out what I believe is a reasonable format for an evaluation.  The ESRI should conduct the evaluation and report on an annual basis on the progress of the programme against the targets that FÁS set for itself in judging the apprenticeship programme.  It is important that FÁS specify <Col N="2083" /> its targets.  If the apprenticeship scheme is working well we must know against what standards it is based and if an independent evaluation is being carried out.</P>
    <P>I was heartened on Committee Stage when the Minister said she would make available to the Opposition and the public in general any evaluations available to her.  That has not been the practice up to now.  She should go further and insert in the Bill a clear commitment to an evaluation such as that proposed in my amendment.  I am not wedded to the full details of my amendment.  If the Minister believes that some of the detail is unreasonable or unacceptable, I am open to changing the wording or the frequency with which reports should be made. However, the principle is sound and I hope the Minister can accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a worthwhile and thoughtful amendment and if its principle was taken on board and applied we would have in place an apprenticeship scheme that was good value for money and would provide the country with a well trained and motivated workforce.  As policy-makers and planners we would be more assured that we have the skills base necessary if this country is to perform well in the future.  I support the amendment.</P>
      <P>We should use every available opportunity to raise the status of training, particularly training in apprenticeships. The independent evaluation process in place in relation to education works to the benefit of all education and as a result parents have great faith in our system.  If young people attain a certain standard, parents know that it will be recognised in other countries as well as at home.  Those young people obtain certificates which carry a status when they present themselves for a job.  In most cases their qualifications are acceptable abroad.  That is due in part to the operation of an independent evaluation in our education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I favour putting in place an independent system of evaluation in relation to apprenticeship training.  It represents <Col N="2084" /> the same principle, but applied to apprenticeships.  I do not know how the detail would be worked out, but it would be a good measure.  If this scheme were introduced it would greatly improve the status of apprenticeships which would gain esteem and, accordingly, benefit financially.  In addition public representatives would be more conversant with the success of the scheme.  It would be possible to directly identify shortfalls in the scheme and to make improvements as shortfalls emerged.  Apprenticeships are under scrutiny at present and the proposed scheme is a sensible approach. I recognise a number of people, including the Minister, are concerned that we put in place here a system that adequately serves the needs of young people.  Adopting this measure would be a step in the right direction.  I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the principle behind the amendment is a good one. While the thrust of it is good I cannot accept its wording.  Perhaps we can reach a compromise and, if not, there is the democratic system.  I am sure no one would disagree with the principle of continuous monitoring and evaluation during the period of training or education and in respect of certification.  We wish to provide adequately for people entering apprenticeships.  Deputy Bruton's amendment sets out a procedure of evaluation.  Subsection 3 (a) states that, a procedure of evaluation of the operation of the apprenticeship programme shall be established and carried out.  Paragraph (i) refers to the equity of entry to apprenticeships.  The issue of equity has been overtaken by an earlier amendment which was defeated.  When the issue was keenly debated here earlier I stated our proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (ii) refers to the balance between the number of new apprentices taken on and the employment opportunities for which there are not trained workers.  There has been much talk of the German system.  I paid a brief visit to Cologne recently and having attended meetings with members the chambers of <Col N="2085" /> commerce and others, I came to the conclusion that we have a different system. Despite Germany's depressed economic position, due mainly to the unification of the east and west which is a fine democratic principle, there are more apprenticeship vacancies in that country than there are applicants.  In Ireland there are approximately 20 applicants for every apprenticeship vacancy.  Many questions would be raised if we were to report the balance between numbers of new apprentices taken on and the employment opportunities for which there are not trained workers.  For example, why are we allowing so many people to obtain medical degrees, arts degrees and H. Dips?  I remember endeavouring to tackle that question when I was Minister for Education.  I did a hasty U-turn.  One cannot dictate that only the number for which there will be a vacancy at some predetermined date will be allowed into the educational and training systems. That would be difficult to forecast and it would encroach on people's liberty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (iii) refers to the responsiveness of the programme. The measure proposed in Deputy Quill's amendment has been enshrined in legislation as it includes the word &ldquo;multi-skilling&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (iv) refers to the effectiveness of the methods of certification of standards achieved.  The principle in that measure is sound.  I will outline what steps we have taken in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (v) refers to the success of training when measured against the best international standards.  I can report progress in that regard.  Agreements on comparability of certification have been signed by FÁS with France, Germany and the UK.  I signed the agreement with France.  The German and UK agreements were signed before I took office. FÁS is exploring agreements with other countries.  While those measures do not match what is outlined in paragraph (v) <Col N="2086" /> of Deputy Bruton's amendment they are in line with his proposal.</P>
    <P>The agreements in respect of apprenticeships with France, Germany and the UK recognise our certification process and certified apprentices here are accepted in those countries as bona fide. We have a reciprocal arrangement with those countries.  Those agreements did not result simply from meetings with our French, German and UK counterparts. Experts from all countries examined the curricula, training, monitoring and evaluation processes and were satisfied that letters of credence as it were, could be exchanged in respect of apprenticeship systems.</P>
    <P>FÁS is promoting our apprenticeship scheme with other countries and it is hoped that in a short time there will be a reciprocal arrangement in respect of apprenticeship training and certification among all EU countries.  That is in line with the 1990 EC directive.  Its goal was to achieve acceptance and comparability of qualifications.  I was Minister for Education and Ireland held the EC Presidency when that directive was introduced.  I referred to European standards and paragraph (v) of the Deputy's amendment refers to international standards which has a wider connotation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) (b) states that each year the ESRI shall report progress made against the annual performance targets set by An Foras.  On evaluation all FÁS activities are subject to evaluation by the Department of Enterprise and Employment. That represents self-regulation. There has been much criticism here of such a measure in respect of credit institutions. It is as if one group within an organisation is reporting on another.  An evaluation unit has been established in the Department of Enterprise and Employment located in the former Department of Labour building.  That unit has been recognised by Europe as the evaluation office for ESF funding arrangements as they appertain to education, agriculture and so on.  The reports are submitted to the EU Commission which makes decisions based on them.</P>
    <P>FÁS has commissioned a study jointly <Col N="2087" /> by Professor Edward Kelly of UCG and Mr. Jerome Casey, independent experts to advise on the standards based system in relation to apprenticeship duration, modules, experience and so on.  There is no big secret about that study.  I informed a recent meeting of the TUI that this is being carried out and we will furnish it with the findings.</P>
    <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, I see the need to make such evaluation reports available to Opposition Deputies &mdash; they will be publicly reported on, as is the case in all these matters &mdash; so that they can be debated, if necessary, on the Floor of the House.  I accept that Deputy Bruton may wish to push his amendment to a vote, as is his right, but I have dealt already with these matters.  I have agreed to make such studies public &mdash; all studies should be publicly debated.  We have made progress on the spirit of Deputy Bruton's amendment while not accepting its precise wording.</P>

      <P>Instead we have a voluntary code of practice.  I will continue to make the argument that if we are to have a voluntary code of practice it is very important that an evaluation of the kind I have sought be carried out.  People will question the voluntary code and will want to know whether it is working and I see no way of answering that question satisfactorily unless an independent evaluation is carried out.  The Minister or her successor may come into the House and say they are satisfied with the voluntary code, but because there is so much taxpayers' money involved, it is necessary that an independent evaluation be carried out.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that because more people seek apprenticeships than the number of apprenticeship places available, we do not need to evaluate this issue, but that is incorrect.  I think the Minister will accept that thousands of people who have been introduced to the apprenticeship scheme have fallen through the system.  Something is seriously wrong when the <i>Irish Independent</i> reports that there are more than 1,000 redundant apprentices.  There is clear evidence that there is a serious imbalance between the amount of money we are pouring into the system and the number of people who are successfully coming out of it.  We need to know what is happening in that regard.  The fact that thousands of people would like to get apprenticeships does not indicate that we have the balance right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to Deputy Quill's amendment, which has been accepted.  I would ask the Minister to look back and see what she accepted.  She accepted that in deciding to introduce a trade as one in which apprenticeships could operate the Minister would consider the issue of multi-skilling.  She did not accept that the Minister would retrospectively evaluate whether that trade <Col N="2089" /> had succeeded through the apprenticeship programme in dealing with the issue of multi-skilling and responsiveness to changing training needs.  To say that the Minister will consider this issue before she introduces an apprenticeship programme is not answering the question I raise.  I want to ensure that the Minister succeeds in achieving what she set out to do.  The Minister's response, therefore, misses the point.</P>
    <P>I accept that the signing of agreements with other countries that recognise the value of our system of certification and our curriculum is a good indication that our schemes are up to scratch.  However, I would point out that in other cases &mdash; for example, in regard to training standards in our hospitals &mdash; agreements are reached only on the basis that every year or two an independent team would carry out an evaluation to ensure that standards are up to the required level.  I am open to persuasion as to whether a French or German team would come in to evaluate our system from year to year or whether a native Irish team should do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepts that the carrying out of an evaluation in the Department is self-assessment.  My information about evaluation in Ireland of Structural Funds is that it tends to reinforce what has been already decided, what people believe is the right thing to do, rather than being an independent examination of the alternatives, which is what it should be.  I think the Minister recognise that self-assessment in areas such as this is unsatisfactory. The Minister said that FÁS will commission independent experts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to consider this matter, but again that is missing the point.  If one wished to evaluate whether, for example, a school was succeeding, one would not allow the school to choose its own evaluators.  It would be preferable that independent evaluators do the work. The notion that the training body would choose the people who would carry out an evaluation of it is unacceptable.  We <Col N="2090" /> all know that people in this position &mdash; I do not wish to cast aspersions on the people who are carrying out the consultancy work in this case, both of whom I know to be excellent people &mdash; come under pressure from those who design the research work to ask certain questions, and that is not wholly satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Minister must take on board that it is wrong to presume that FÁS will be the sole provider of training under apprenticeships.  We should be moving towards a position where many of the modules are flexibly provided.  Other training agencies or educational institutions who could do the work just as well should be allowed do so.  There is need for flexibility in this area and evaluation should be carried out independently of the agency providing the training.  The balance of argument favours my amendment.  From listening to the Minister, she accepts, to some extent, the arguments I put forward and I hope that even at this late hour she will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister will say that she cannot accept my amendment.  Nevertheless, I do not think we should give the Revenue Commissioners preference in terms of sums owing by companies which become bankrupt.  This preferential treatment will leave unsecured creditors in great difficulties when such problems arise.  It will also result in the Revenue Commissioners being less than vigilant in the pursuit of their debts and leave many unsecured creditors, usually the small person who has no comeback, swinging in the breeze.</P>
      <P>I realise that a similar section &mdash; which presumably is on a word processor in the Department of Finance &mdash; is included in every Bill.  I do not think the principle behind it is correct and I should like to hear the Minister's views on it.  I am not convinced that she will accept my amendment but I hope she will at least take note of the points made.</P>

      <P>We had a fairly straightforward debate on this amendment on Committee Stage.  This is a matter over which neither the Minister nor I has any say.  This section fits neatly into every Bill.</P>
      <P>This section is designed to protect any outstanding levy owed by employers who become bankrupt or are in the process of winding-up their business.  It is a standard provision under which unpaid levies, taxes and PRSI are accorded preferential debtor status, thereby attempting to protect the State against financial loss.  As the apprenticeship levy will be collected through the PRSI system this provision in regard to unpaid levies simply treats the levy in the same way as any other levies collected through that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cognisance has been taken in the drafting of the section of companies which are winding-up for the purposes of construction or amalgamation.  This provision will give the State first call on any moneys owed to it by a company which <Col N="2092" /> is winding up.  I know that Deputy Bruton was sincere in putting down this amendment but it is not an amendment I was not moved to accept from any intellectual, financial or social point of view.  I can have no input into this matter.</P>

I also wish to thank her officials for the backup they have given and for the reasonable responses they have given to the issues raised.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to congratulate the Minister on bringing this legislation before the House.  I compliment her on the manner in which she has steered us through the debate in this House.  It can truly be said that the Bill is better than the one brought before the House last December.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister good luck in her attempts at this difficult time to put in place a better scheme of training and apprenticeship for young people.  There is a certain resistance and reluctance among employers to take on apprentices at present.  While they can justify their reasons for this, nevertheless it is an issue that will have to be addressed head on. The Minister will have to continue the very earnest efforts she is making in this area.  I am very much aware of her efforts and I have spoken to a number of groups who have met her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of this reforming legislation, a <Col N="2093" /> great deal more needs to be done.  Even after the enactment of this legislation our apprenticeship schemes will still be far from ideal.  I wish the Minister well in dealing with this difficult issue which is slow in yielding any kind of rewards &mdash; any rewards are long term.  However, the end result will be worth the effort.  I believe the Minister cares enough about the future of young people and the future of the country to make the effort demanded to reform the system.</P>
    <P>I particularly want to thank the Minister for taking on board one of my key amendments, amendment No. 3, which deals with the important issue of improving the lot of women in training and apprenticeship schemes and will help in the movement towards the creation of a multi-skilled workforce.  The day of the single skill workforce is over, and we must keep the apprenticeship schemes updated.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the issue of apprenticeships and training will come back to this House many times before we are satisfied that we have a good and comprehensive scheme in place, which will give young people the level of skill and self-confidence required to enable them to cope with the intense competition they will meet in the Single Market and elsewhere.  There is an obligation on all of us to ensure there are no shortfalls in the skills base of the Irish workforce.  This legislation is one step in ensuring that this will not happen.  Many more steps will have to be taken before we are satisfied that the skills level and skills base of the workforce is high enough to enable young people and the workforce in general attain their full potential and enable us to compete effectively in the very competitive world of trade and commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>In concluding the debate I would like to thank the members of the Opposition parties, Deputy Richard Bruton for Fine Gael, Deputy Quill for the Progressive Democrats and Deputy Rabbitte for Democratic Left, for the strong and robust way in which they put forward their points of view and <Col N="2094" /> contested mine on many occasions.  The debate was a good one and this certainly is far better legislation leaving this House than when it was introduced.  That is not to decry my efforts and those of the officials who compiled the Bill because, as I said, the Bill was originally a technical one dealing purely with the technical issue of a levy.  However, I and my officials knew that it could not remain so and that it had the potential for a beneficial debate, which proved to be the case.</P>
      <P>The committee system is very worthwhile. There used be a school of thought that when a Minister introduced a Bill, that Bill was perfect and should remain so.  I never held that point of view before the committee system was established because there is little point in having Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage of a Bill if there is no opportunity to hear other people's points of view.  We must always have that but also there must be reflection on the various points of view.  Many people &mdash; not elected Members&mdash;sometimes find issue with that and those who might ask why we bring forward amendments and deal with them in this way &mdash; a point which came up this morning in the House in regard to another Bill within our Department but not under my responsibility &mdash; should realise that it is because points of view are put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should continue with this type of debate, which I have always espoused along with the Members opposite, through Second, Committee and Report Stages because many worthwhile points will be made right throughout the debate. Some points can be accepted by way of amendment; others which might not be accepted &mdash; not through any lack of generosity of spirit &mdash; may bear fruit in other ways, namely, in directions which one can give within a Department or agency and in thoughts which lead to further debates internally and which may come to fruition perhaps at a later stage. The effect of legislation is that it makes one think, it poses questions within one's mind and it makes one reflect further on what one should or should not do. <Col N="2095" /> Therefore, the debate concerning apprenticeship and training, as both of the Deputies opposite said, is not at an end.</P>
    <P>I said earlier when we began Report Stage that in the five years I dealt with education, there was no issue to which I gave more consideration or which I knew would require unremitting attention if we are to get it right.  As Deputy Quill and Deputy Bruton said, we are at the beginning of a change over to a new system. We are taking a whole new look at how apprenticeships are run here and in other countries and lest the idea would go out to other fora that the new areas we are entering will be subject to the same arrangements as the present system, I wish to state that will not be the case.  We want to have a more open &mdash; not simply open as in transparency, one would always wish for that &mdash; and flexible way of approaching the issue of training and enable modules to be put in place which will be sufficiently broadly based to be carried into other trades but which will also be responsive to the changing needs of people within the workforce.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;traineeship&rdquo; would certainly be a better title than &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo;, which in Ireland has come to mean a particular set of faculties which one has developed, whereas the real meaning of the word is learning one's trade as one goes along.  Ideas will be coming forward on that and I look forward to debates not only in the form of question and answer, which can make it difficult to get to the heart of an issue but hopefully on occasions &mdash; not through bringing forward legislation &mdash; in debating reports or by some other mechanism whereby the views of the Opposition can be accepted.  Training and education are issues on which no one Department has all of the wisdom; they affect everyone. Therefore, it is only proper that the views of elected representatives and of the wider public be discussed and accepted at the relevant times.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for your patience as we debated these matters.  I would also like <Col N="2096" /> to thank the chairman of our committee, Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, who executed his duty in an excellent manner and also the officials in the Department who had great patience with all of us, including myself.</P>

      <P>Roinnfidh mé mo chuid ama leis an Teachta de Valera. Sílim féin gur Bille an-tábhachtach é seo atá os comhair an Tí.  Bhí sé thar am Bille mar seo a thabhairt amach agus go gcuirfí srian le cuid de na gníomhachtaí a bhí ar bun ag daoine a bhí ag tabhairt airgid ar iasacht agus go dtabharfaí tuilleadh eolais don phobal.</P>
      <P>The whole question of consumer credit and the making available of information in relation thereto has become much more important as the number of people who avail of that credit has increased. From circumstances prevailing 20 or 30 years ago, when credit was something most people did not avail of, nowadays most people regularly avail of credit in one form or another from businesses or lending agencies.  Therefore it is most important that the customer knows what he or she is getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2097" /> I would have to point out to the House that I was very surprised recently at being quoted two annual percentage rates, by a building society and a bank, to discover that the lower APR quoted actually meant a higher repayment on the same amount of money over the same term of loan.  Until then I should have thought that whenever somebody was quoted an APR and compared it with another, such comparison would have given one an exact guide as to what constituted the best value, but I was surprised to find that that was not so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the definition of &ldquo;APR&rdquo; in the interpretation section of this Bill so that we shall have a uniform description of what is involved in APR.  It is important that people who shop around in the marketplace can compare like with like, can clearly establish the precise cost of what they are purchasing, the precise cost of the money they are buying; and we must remember that when we talk about credit we are actually talking about buying money.  Therefore, it is crucial that the rates quoted be directly comparable.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision in the Bill with regard to information on credit in that there are two pitfalls into which one can fall with regard to information &mdash; it is either too much or too little.  All of us will be familiar with the syndrome of too little information; likewise all of us will be familiar with the syndrome of providing too much information.  For example, usually there is too much information provided on house insurance policies, so detailed and legalistic that the ordinary consumer does not get a chance of reading it in detail.  It is important that there be clear regulations in place stipulating that the information provided must be easily deciphered and discernible by the public at large.</P>
    <P>In that connection it is particularly praiseworthy that there is proposed to be a cooling-off period involved in all credit arrangements.  It is true to say that all of us become slightly intimidated when given a document of say, five or ten pages by somebody lending us money, who places a finger on it and says: &ldquo;Would you <Col N="2098" /> sign here, please?&rdquo;  On such occasions it is very hard to say to such a person: &ldquo;Would you give me that document?  I will take it away, read it and return it in two days time&rdquo;.  That is not the way it works.  Nonetheless, there are many people who, having signed such a document, on returning home might check out the details and arrive at a second opinion.  Therefore it is very important that a cooling-off period be provided, thereby ensuring the consumer's rights.</P>
    <P>In giving the consumer rights to information or whatever, one is in no way infringing the rights of legitimate trading. Indeed, good business people are realising ever more frequently that the fairer one treats one's customers the better it will be for one's business in the long term. The contention that in some way treating customers in an open, fair manner, ensuring that common sense prevails, acts to the detriment of good business is totally wrong.  Rather, I contend that good business and business practices will thrive where there is real trust between the business person, lender or whoever, and the customer.  I contend that the provisions of this Bill will not impose an unfair burden on those giving credit.  It will also level up the playing pitch so that the myriad of different types of credit in operation, from leasing arrangements to personal loans, loans that can be arranged over the telephone and so on, henceforth will all operate on a relatively level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>It was crucial also that the Minister dealt with moneylending because the provision of loan facilities for the less well off sectors of our society is one problem every public representative comes across all too frequently.  I have often contended that the greatest demarcation line between those people dependent on social welfare and those in receipt of a salary or wage is not the net amount they receive respectively, which of course will be different, but rather the ability of somebody with a job, an income, to borrow money at reasonable rates to carry them over bad periods compared with a person at the bottom of the pile who cannot borrow on the high street <Col N="2099" /> and who up to now has been forced to borrow in ways that have been totally unsatisfactory, at astronomical rates.</P>
    <P>This area needs to be regulated and I welcome what the Minister has done.  I congratulate the credit unions on the great work they do in providing credit on the basis of trust.  Credit unions have proved their worth.  They do not depend on the security criteria of the high street bank, rather they know their clientele. They are a great boon to society and provide a necessary service.</P>
    <P>The voluntary agencies which help those who have debt problems, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, carry out a necessary function in society.  No matter how well we regulate this area there will always be people who will borrow more than they can repay and, consequently there will always be a need for a safety net.  There is no worse trauma than to have borrowed money and not be in a position to repay.</P>
    <P>There is a huge potential for development of credit unions.  Large sums of money could be channelled through them into the development of local areas.  In rural areas people with considerable savings who are in receipt of pensions could channel such money into credit unions rather than putting it into the bank as banks do not lend money for development of local areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, for sharing his time with me.  I welcome this Bill, particularly its references to moneylending.  The issue of moneylending has caused much distress to a number of my constituents throughout the years.  This has been recognised by the Minister for Social Welfare, who, in his speech on the budget, granted an additional £250,000 for projects to combat the problems of money lending, bringing the total allocation to £750,000. <Col N="2100" /> These programmes have given real help to many people on low incomes caught in the cycle of indebtedness.  The household budgeting facility has proved to be very popular and a great success.  However, we need a radical new approach to moneylending and that is what the Bill provides.</P>
      <P>Those who work with such agencies as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Combat Poverty Agency will immediately accept the fact that most people borrowing from a moneylender are in low income groups and cannot readily obtain credit elsewhere.  Their options are limited.  The time during which they seek the aid of a moneylender is usually when they are at their most vulnerable.  Very often the consumer in such a case is unaware of his or her legal rights.  They are either too embarrassed or lack the means or knowledge to obtain such information.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to redress the social ills often inherent in moneylending by full transparency and redresses the inherent imbalance in the relationship between borrower and lender.  It creates a climate of fairness and accountability in which a moneylender must work.  In giving the Director of Consumer Affairs wide powers this Bill ensures uniformity and standardisation and that the consumer gets clear communications and a fair deal.</P>
      <P>Heretofore the consumer had to fight what seemed a lone battle to establish his or her position to ensure a fair deal.  He or she had to take action on an individual basis to attempt to redress that imbalance. Now, under the Bill, the Director of Consumer Afairs has the power to make changes from the top down.  The Bill will not only comply with the directives and update the moneylenders Acts of 1960 and 1933 but will also deliver on the commitment on unlicensed moneylending in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that applicants for a moneylender's licence must pay £1,000 for a licence to trade in one District Court district and a further fee of £500 for each additional district in which they intend to <Col N="2101" /> operate.  Under the appeals mechanism an applicant or the holder of a licence who has been turned down by the director can lodge an appeal within seven days to the appropriate Circuit Court judge.</P>
    <P>The Bill will protect the consumer by ensuring that the moneylender may not advance a loan while retaining a portion of it and eliminating the practice of retaining from a top up loan an amount in respect of an earlier loan while still basing the charge on the full loan being advanced.  The importance of the repayment book is underlined in the Bill.  The fact that the Bill sets out clearly and unambiguously the headings to be complied with protects, informs and, therefore, enables the consumer to have more control over his situation.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency has pointed out the difficulty of indentifying unlicensed moneylenders and has stressed the lack of Garda powers to confront those suspected of moneylending without a licence.  The CPA proposes that all house-to-house collectors of money carry identification.  These matters have been addressed in this Bill.  Repayments can only be made at certain times and calls are not to be made between 9 p.m. and 10 a.m. on Sundays or public holidays.  It is proposed that the maximum penalties for unlicensed moneylending will be increased to £50,000 and/or five years imprisonment.  The role of the Garda in stamping out illegal moneylending will be welcomed by all.  Such provisions will ensure rigorous enforcement.</P>
    <P>The Bill acknowledges the need to set out the essential elements for all advertisements offering credit in respect of goods and services.  It is essential that there be a warning on every credit agreement about the risks involved if payments fall into arrears.  The Combat Poverty Agency has always made the point that lenders have a duty to lend responsibly. Credit should be given with an eye to ability to repay.  Where undue regard to ability to pay was evident, recovery of the amount should be unenforceable in the courts.  Credit should be available to all provided they have the ability to pay. <Col N="2102" /> There is need to promote low cost credit options for low income households.</P>
    <P>The Bill highlights the Minister's role in regulating the form or content of moneylending agreements and advertisements for moneylending as this will ensure that the Minister and the Director of Consumer Affairs act as watchdogs for the consumer.  Perhaps one of the most important powers granted under the Bill to the Director of Consumer Affairs is the power to apply to the courts to have excessive rates of interest charged by moneylenders declared illegal and unenforceable.</P>
    <P>The Bill will lead to greater uniformity and control in the area of moneylending in what will emerge as a very strict licensing regime.  It encompasses and incorporates much of what those working in the social professions dealing directly with the problem of moneylending would wish and I know the Minister's work is, rightly, appreciated and recognised by them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I know from my experience of clinics that people can get into very difficult circumstances due to indebtedness.  As a result of their financial difficulty at the time they are unable to look ahead and see the difficulties that would arise if they were not in a position to repay the amount borrowed.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill the Minister recognises the difficulty faced by many people, particularly those in the low income groups and has tried to ensure their position is safeguarded.  That is highly desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that <Col N="2103" /> crime and its control is a problem which has increasingly affected our society. While the increase in the crime rate during the past 30 years or so is a cause for grave concern, the change to the nature of crime is a source of even greater worry.  Extremely violent crimes have become much too common.  We seem to have an increasing number of heartless criminals, who show little or no respect for their fellow citizens, irrespective of age, sex, health or status.  In many ways these developments are due to changes in social behaviour patterns which are outside the control of the legislative process. While some people may feel that too much unqualified respect was automatically given to the institutions of Church and State in the past, the reverse trend has become increasingly the norm for a certain percentage of our community. The task of effectively reducing the level of crime in our society is enormous and significant success will only be achieved through a concerted effort involving every sector of society.</P>
      <P>As chairman of the Select Committee on Security and Legislation, I find it extremely encouraging that the legislative components of the fight-back against crime continue to make substantial progress.  The Minister and her staff deserve particular credit for the steady stream of legislation which continues to come before the House.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with the overall objective of the proposed Bill in that it acknowledges the importance of accurately measuring the level of crime.  If one does not have comprehensive and accurate information on the precise incidence and nature of crime it increases the difficulty of planning effective responses to the problem.  This relates to both the reactive and preventive aspects of crime control. I fully support the concept that we must continually strive to obtain a greater insight into the pattern of crime.</P>
      <P>I should have stated at the outset that I wish to share my time with Deputy Joe Costello.</P>

      <P>Research and policy formulation go hand in hand in law as in most other areas of human endeavour.  I am puzzled that Deputy Mitchell should consider it necessary to establish another data gathering facility in order to provide such a service in the State.  In the past the Garda authorities may have had limited access to the information technology and expertise which is absolutely necessary to extract meaningful statistical information from their records.  However, tremendous improvements have been made in the level of information technology used by the force and there is every indication that the trend will continue for the foreseeable future.  We must be fully supportive of such initiatives and any proposal indicating a lack of confidence in the Garda's own potential in the use of information technology should be avoided at this time.  However, I support the view that the Department of Justice should call on external expertise such as that provided by the Central Statistics Office, if this is required to optimise the analysis of crime data.</P>
      <P>Most aspects of modern enterprise can only benefit from the combination of various sources of expertise.  As well as allowing for a more effective operation it also has the considerable benefit of avoiding the bureaucratic problem of duplication of services.</P>
      <P>The Bill is concerned with the measurement of crime.  However, the Garda Síochána record all crimes brought to their attention either by victims or by persons who are charged with a criminal offence.  This can happen when a person being charged asks that other crimes be taken into account.  If we look at the Garda Commissioner's annual report or the reports of the prisons we see a vast array of statistical data which has been collected.  The problem appears to relate more to the analysis of that data and the correlation of information available to the Garda, the courts and the prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect is the extent to which <Col N="2105" /> crime goes unreported.  The proposal contained in Deputy Mitchell's Bill will not help to overcome this problem.  In this regard, we have to consider what is a crime and what should be recorded.  For example, how many people, who regard vandalism as a crime against property, would report to the Garda if their car aerial was broken?  The official figures record crime reported to the Garda.  The information is available and what we need is a more comprehensive analysis of the statistics and also consideration of the causes of crime.  The analysis of available information is being tackled by the Minister and I look forward to the outcome of the discussions taking place with the Central Statistics Office and the deliberations of the study group.</P>
    <P>Top class research is absolutely necessary if we are to begin to significantly turn the tide of crime which, unfortunately, seems such an intrinsic part of modern developed society.  The admirable objective of Deputy Mitchell in attempting to further the case for research might be better served by suggesting specific information needs which are not being met by existing annual reports, such as that prepared by the Garda Commissioner.  I am sure the relevant research teams would appreciate any constructive comments on the nature and format of further useful statistics on crime.  I am pleased to have had this opportunity to make a brief contribution to an important debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on this issue and compliment the Deputy on the amount of activity he has engaged in since being appointed spokesperson on justice.  Another indication of the well researched contributions he has made is the National Bureau of Crime Statistics Bill, 1993.  This matter is notoriously difficult to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compilation of statistics, their accuracy, the speed or tardiness in producing them, their presentation and value is a matter which the House should debate at length to see if we can improve upon the present method of compiling statistics in the various sectors of the criminal justice system.  It can be infuriating <Col N="2106" /> when considering annual reports from the Garda Commissioner and the prisons to find that statistics do not correspond or to find that certain information is not available in the statistics. The compilation of statistics from the courts, the prisons, the Garda, the probation and welfare service should be approached in an integrated fashion.  Accurate statistics and a standard approach to their compilation are essential to proper forward planning to deal with crime, vandalism and lawlessness.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to establish on a statutory basis a national bureau of crime statistics to measure the levels of crime, to report on them and analyse them on an annual basis and to produce interim reports that might be required from time to time from various sectors of the criminal justice system.  The Bill proposes that persons and records should be brought before the bureau for examination. That is a very specific function to which I will refer later.  The Bill also makes provision for the bureau to examine and report on existing authorities that compile annual statistics &mdash; the Garda Commissioner in relation to crime statistics, the Department of Justice in relation to prison reports, the Probation and Welfare Service and the courts services from where, unfortunately, the statistics are inadequate and patchy in the context of cases coming before the courts and cases that have been dealt with by the courts. We can improve the production of the statistical information which is necessary for any society to deal in a comprehensive fashion with crime.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provisions of the Bill and I am sure Deputy Mitchell is anxious to explain some of its provisions. I am concerned that the bureau would have an overlapping function because already there are services in the criminal justice system with responsibility to provide statistical information.  I am not sure that an independent bureau would have access to the wide range of information required to do the job comprehensively. No matter which way we look at it, the bureau would be seeking <Col N="2107" /> information that is already there in the system in the courts, the prisons or the Garda Síochána and those agencies have to produce the information on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal in section 7 (2) that the bureau may compile its own statistics whereas in section 7 (1) it will report on and examine existing services who are providing statistics.  There is a certain degree of confusion.  Either the bureau does the job or it does not.  If the bureau is to do the job while at the same time supervising the others who are at present doing the job, we will have a parallel system and that would not be of any value to us.</P>
    <P>I am also somewhat concerned about section 5 where the bureau shall have the power to send for persons, papers and records to assist in carrying out its functions. That is very good in theory but I am concerned that we are setting up a form of tribunal and we will find ourselves in a role that could become very public and involve the expenditure of much time and money and consume a lot of the time of the agencies already dealing with crime prevention and with solving crime.  I am worried that the bureau would become something of a quango on the one hand or a star chamber on the other and that should not be part of the function of any bureau as it is not directly instrumental in the compilation of statistics.  What we are talking about is a scientific approach rather than an adversarial approach.</P>
    <P>Another question relates to how the bureau would do its job independently.  I am trying to image how it would have better access to information than the access already there.  I have to be convinced about the establishment of the bureau in the manner proposed here.</P>
    <P>It is important to have an integrated system which would cover the courts, the Garda and the prisons with the best technology available.  In this day and age all the records should be computerised. It is ridiculous to consider that the annual prison report is by and large compiled from manual records and that there is not <Col N="2108" /> a computerised profile of every prisoner in the system.  I would imagine that that would be a basic requirement to deal effectively with the people in the domain of the Department of Justice.  That is not the case and the work is done manually. I am sure that is part of the reason why statistics in any annual prison report do not correspond with those in other relevant reports.  I have gone through such reports dozens of times and I have yet to find an annual prison report that is anyway close to being accurate in relation to statistical information.</P>
    <P>I suggest as a first step that we need a unitary system that encompasses all sectors of the criminal justice system. People need to be trained in compiling information so that statistics are presented to those for whom they are intended.  There is nothing worse than jumbled statistics which are not presented for any purpose one can imagine.  Above all, we need to ensure accuracy.  In order to achieve coherent and accurate statistics one needs a system using the best available technology.  My approach would be to improve the present system rather than setting up an alternative bureau.  I am pleased the Minister for Justice of her own initiative has set up a study group to seek to coordinate all statistics in her Department. I hope this will be carried out along the lines I have suggested.  The Minister has to be complimented on her policy to publish promptly the 1989, 1990 and 1991 annual reports &mdash; previously we had to wait for up to four years &mdash; and we now await the publication of the annual reports for 1992 and 1993, which she promises will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Unless statistical information is made available immediately, it becomes outdated and irrelevant.  There is not much sense in spending time, energy and money in gathering statistics if they are not subsequently made available at an early stage.  The delay in publishing the annual reports of the prison service is notorious.  In addition, the information is poor and the elapse of time between events that are recorded and their eventual publication is quite unacceptable.  I <Col N="2109" /> hope the Minister will continue as she has started so that from now on we can expect the annual report of the prison service to be published shortly after the year end.  There is provision to provide monthly reports which the public is allowed to inspect, but that is not easy unless the reports are published and therefore I impress upon the Minister the need to deal with reports.</P>
    <P>Having good statistics does not prevent crime but is one step on the way to dealing with it.  I believe we have to take measures to prevent crime as well as to tackle the effects of crime, and the latter is where statistics are important.  The causes of crime are complex and multitudinous, and society has a lot to do with it.  The lack of proper planning, inadequate housing, the level of unemployment, the education service and poverty are contributory factors, and there is a correlation between a multiplicity of these factors coming together and high levels of crime.</P>
    <P>I think there is no such person as a born criminal.  Crime is not a genetic factor; people are not born as criminals but become so because of adverse circumstances that are brought to bear on them and behavioural problems that arise.  As a society we have a duty to address the issue of what we can do to minimise the factors that give rise to crime.  Many Deputies are also members of local authorities and therefore make decisions in relation to planning and development and the type of estates that are constructed in their area.  These are crucial decisions that have a bearing on the incidence of crime in our society. We can effect changes in housing and education.  For example, if classes are too large and there are insufficient remedial teachers, youngsters may get bored and be inclined to mitch.  We need to ensure there are resources to cater for such children in a caring fashion.</P>
    <P>Above all else, unemployment is a factor.  If people have nothing to do all day every day &mdash; and this is endemic in certain areas of society &mdash; ghettos are created.  This Government has at least made a commitment to tackle unemployment. <Col N="2110" /> The programme for national development set a target to create 70,000 new jobs.  We need to set targets if we are going to deal with unemployment.  It is taking a risk, but we must set out to achieve the statistical targets we have set. The recently launched Programme for Competitiveness and Work set a target to create 60,000 jobs during its three year duration.  This is a specific target.  I wish that all of the social partners were tied into the target in the same way as the Government so that there would be an onus on the employers, trade unions and farmers to meet specific targets in their area.</P>
    <P>We must deal also with drug abusers and provide treatment for them.  The recently introduced Criminal Justice Bill enables the assets of criminals to be confiscated, and this is an important measure.  The Minister for Justice has shown that she is committed to introducing legislation.  She has introduced a number of Criminal Justice Bills.  Indeed, even today we were discussing the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, 1993, and she is intent on dealing with the question of public order, an area where there has been a great number of complaints about hooliganism by small groups of people who intimidate residents in housing estates.  The Government has taken responsibility for dealing with them and introduced the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a commitment to introduce the Juvenile Justice Bill, which I understand will be brought forward before the summer.  The Minister has provided £66 million to implement a comprehensive package, with 13 points to fight crime.  This is the first package to be put forward that deals with the recruitment of Garda Síochána, the probation service, the courts, the appointment of additional judges, information technology and so on.</P>
    <P>This debate gives us an opportunity to highlight the need to ensure that the statistics are compiled in a more accurate and scientific fashion.  I suggest that the way to do this is not to establish this independent statutory bureau but rather to streamline the existing services.</P>

      <P>I am far from impressed by the Government statements that it plans to tackle the crime problem and that the matter is under control.  The figures for Dublin are increasing relentlessly.  If we could give credence to the stream of statements issued by the Minister for Justice the problem would have been resolved by now but it seems the Government is incapable of coming to grips with it.  It is the same story all over the city.  There are shutters and alarms while people are hiding behind their doors which are chained.  There is a feeling that the problem is out of control.</P>
      <P>The position has been exacerbated by the decision during the past 12 months by the Department of Justice to introduce new procedures for dealing with summonses. The Garda are frustrated when people whom they have arrested are allowed to walk free.  When this happens they have to pursue them a second time to serve a summons.  This is senseless and people are under the impression that wrongdoers can walk away.  It has created endless problems for the Garda, who may have to find people of no fixed abode. It is symptomatic of the thinking in the Department that it reacts to problems when they arise rather than responding on the basis of sound information on the nature of the crime problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend Deputy Mitchell for bringing this Bill before the House.  He has a long record of dealing with crime issues not just in a fair but in a compassionate and firm way.  When he was Lord Mayor of Dublin he instituted a commission on crime.  This was a very valuable initiative which brought together people from many walks of life to examine the crime problem in this city.  I am glad he has continued this innovative thinking by bringing before the Dáil a Bill to close <Col N="2112" /> the huge gaps in information on the extent of crime.</P>
    <P>The lack of information not only affects the Department's ability to come up with sensible solutions to the problem but leads to the production of simplistic solutions by the public.  The first step in addressing the issue in a coherent way should be the provision of information. To talk about a coherent plan without first providing basic information on the extent of the crime problem, the way in which the legal system is dealing with it and whether various sentences handed down are successful, is to set out on a trip without a proper map.  In this Bill we have set out the first step in drawing up a coherent programme to tackle crime.</P>
    <P>From surveys I have conducted in my own constituency I am convinced the vast majority of crimes are not reported.  Two years ago I conducted a survey in one of the electoral wards and discovered that 25 per cent of households had been the victims of crime in the previous year. When I compared this figure with the level of reported crimes for the same area it was clear that a significant number of crimes had not been reported to the Garda.  Were it not for the fact that there is an obligation on people to report crimes when it comes to insurance claims even fewer would be reported.</P>
    <P>Given the lack of basic information we do not know whether the figures are reliable indicators of what is happening on the streets.  It would be a sensible move to set up a National Bureau of Crime Statistics which would comprise the members mentioned in the Bill.  This would allow us to assess the extent of crime.  However, we need to go further and assess whether present sentencing practice is effective.  There is a widespread feeling the courts are inconsistent when it comes to handing down sentences and that sentences do not match the seriousness of the crime.  This has proved damaging to the legal system to which we must all look to deal with the crime problem.</P>
    <P>If people feel that white collar crime is treated differently or is considered to be less serious, or that the petty shoplifter <Col N="2113" /> is treated much more severely than the white collar criminal, confidence will be undermined.  It is important that the issue is confronted.  I am glad the Government has accepted the notion that the Director of Public Prosecutions should have the right to challenge sentences which are considered excessively lenient.</P>
    <P>There is a need for accurate information to help judges decide on the most appropriate sentence to hand down.  It would be of immense value if such information could be presented not just to the public but to the Judiciary by a group clearly seen to be independent and with no axe to grind.  This would give the public confidence that the system is not creaking at the hinges as they now believe but rather is in control, knows what it is doing and dealing in an even-handed manner with those who commit crime.</P>
    <P>It would also help to relieve the frustration felt by the public who believe that many convicted criminals are released without serving their full sentence.  The Department will always dispute that any person convicted of a serious crime is dealt with in this way, but the Department and the various arms of the justice system will be brought into disrepute unless there are firm figures from an independent body which could show on an annual basis that they are dealing with this problem effectively and there is no revolving door syndrome.  There is a widespread belief that this is the case. There may be only one or two anecdotal cases but these are the cases that convince people that all is not well.  One could go to any street and find there is a feeling that the Garda can bring a person to court and have him convicted but that he will be out the following week.  I am willing to be convinced by the Minister and the Department that this is not true, but it needs to be presented to us in a convincing way by someone with no axe to grind.</P>
    <P>The predominantly young age of the people committing these offences, and their generally deprived background, is frightening.  We need more information on that aspect of crime.  If we are serious, these problems can be tackled at the root.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> In the north inner city, an area which I have only recently come to represent, there is no school to which children with behavioural problems and learning difficulties can be referred so that emergent problems, that can otherwise be distorted and result in a life of crime, can be dealt with.  It is an indictment of our system of Government that we do not have an education system that can deal with such children.  We must look seriously at the curriculum and its suitability or otherwise for children with behavioural problems.  It is not the answer to send children out to the country to some place which is clearly divorced from their own environment and way of living.  These problems must be tackled within communities and with the support of communities.</P>
    <P>I recall an interesting report drawn up a few years ago on the level of youth crime in the inner city and how it could be dealt with effectively.  That report recommended a pre-court tribunal where educationalists, local community workers and others involved in dealing with young people in the area, would be a support to those young people at risk and to their families.  It recommended that there be a network to deal with children and stated that it would not be in the interests of the State to allocate institutions for delinquent children. Those ideas set out by community groups at the time could be greatly enhanced if this Bill resulted in the provision of a regular stream of hard information on the nature of crime and the type of people getting involved.</P>
    <P>We must also look at how people in deprived areas are disempowered.  The agencies providing services in deprived inner city areas, such as the health boards, those in the education system, the Garda and the criminal system are not under local scrutiny and are not accountable to their local communities. Often the results they achieve for their communities are not up to the standard we would demand for other areas that are more articulate in presenting their views.  Health is not the subject of this debate and I do not want to be deflected <Col N="2115" /> into it, but life expectancy is lower and illness occurs much more frequently in deprived areas than in other parts of the city, yet we are supposed to have a health system dedicated to equity and equality. Something is radically wrong and we could begin to tackle the problems if there were a sense in which these institutions were accountable in their local area.  This may be divorced from the issue of crime at this stage but it is symptomatic of what is wrong in some areas.  If we are not willing to trust people to influence the ways their areas are run, we are depriving them and creating some of the problems that we see far too often on the streets when things go wrong.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see figures for community work schemes used as an alternative to prison sentences.  These have been in operation for some time and a group such as the bureau suggested in this Bill should be examining the effectiveness of those as alternatives and promising their extension where possible.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Mitchell on proposing a crime watchdog and providing the basis of a coherent plan.  I hope the Minister will relent on the position he appears to be taking and recognise the value of what has been suggested.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy McGahon.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, on this Bill.  Without proper statistics it is impossible for the authorities to know the extent of the problem or for the Minister to know what she needs to provide to preserve the rights and privileges of people.  It is time we were given the most up-to-date information about the nature of the problems.  When one sees what our banking and other services achieved in a very short time, it is difficult to understand why the annual prison reports from 1989, have not been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know much about Dublin city apart from what my colleagues say, but in rural areas there is great anxiety, especially among the aged and those living alone, about the future.  It is very <Col N="2116" /> frightening when a person after being asked to buy something at the front door finds that behind his back everything he owned has been taken by the caller.  Such crimes are not always included in the statistics.  However, if we at least had an up-to-date report of crimes it would be easier to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear some of my colleagues give the reasons for crime, that with 300,000 unemployed it was not difficult to understand why so many were driven to crime when they have so little to do and their social welfare is so curtailed if they live at home.  We have been told how many jobs the budget will create this year.  It would be great if all the reports could do away with unemployment. A former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach said he would resign if unemployment exceeded 100,000.  Now it seems the only way to solve unemployment is to produce reports.</P>

      <P>Reports alone will not solve the crime problem.  Nevertheless, Deputy Gay Mitchell's Bill, which proposes that there should be a proper statistical data base from which to work, would go some way towards solving it.  I did not hear the Minister's reaction to the Bill, but I believe it was negative. That is regrettable.  I am a newcomer to the Dáil.  Last May the Minister for Equality and Law Reform welcomed the provisions of a Bill on occupiers' liability introduced by my colleague, Deputy Deenihan.  He said the Bill was worthwhile but not perfect and that within a few weeks he would introduce a Bill. Some 12 months later we do not know if that Bill will ever be introduced, a Bill which is crucial from the point of view of tourism and employment.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is defeated I hope the Minister will not ignore the genuine concerns of Deputy Gay Mitchell, Deputy Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i> and others.  I hope we will see realistic action in regard to the compilation of figures so that plans can be made, the prison system evaluated and all the other measures which Deputy Mitchell requested be adopted.</P>

      <P>The economy and unemployment are not the main sources of public disquiet here, rather, it is the level of crime.  I often feel that in the rarefied atmosphere of this Chamber many Deputies are in a cocoon far away from the real life.  However, they have only to read the volume of letters published night after night in the <i>Evening Herald</i> and the <i>Evening Press</i> to be aware of the frightening extent of crime and the numbers of people living in fear of their lives.  We have lost the battle against crime, and I am not blaming the present Minister in that regard.  The battle was lost because of the do-good methods adopted by bleeding hearts and naive people in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> The levels of crime in Dublin, in Deputy Kemmy's city of Limerick and in the Border town of Dundalk, where there is a cross-Border level of crime in addition to terrorism, are totally unacceptable. The Government failed to produce the prisons report simply because it does not want to lift the lid off the extent of our crime problem.  When I hear Deputies making excuses for criminals and suggesting that deprived backgrounds in some way justifies crime, I despair.  I am a hardliner in regard to crime.  There should be a deterrent for every crime in the book; but, unfortunately, we have dismantled the deterrents here.  Murder is no longer a nine day wonder and the Director of Public Prosecutions frequently reduces the most foul charge of murder to manslaughter. Rape cases dominate our daily newspapers, with variations on the theme. This whole matter is out of control.  One of the reasons is that Deputies are prepared to come in here and make excuses for people who commit crime on the basis that they had a deprived or an unsettled background &mdash; in other words, their mothers let them fall on their heads as babies or fed them on the left breast instead of the right.  We are fed a diet of farce.</P>
    <P>In the twenties or the early years of this century, when people did not even have a blade of grass on which to exist and when there was no social welfare, there was very little crime.  We have copperfastened a social welfare system here which is the best in Europe.  It is so attractive that many people refuse to take up jobs; they would rather be part of what I believe to be the best social welfare system in the world.</P>
    <P>People are not categorised in criminal classes; they do so themselves.  I recently read about a young criminal whose speciality was attacking tourists.  Having robbed an elderly tourist of her handbag containing £200, he was pursued by a detective.  He was 20 years of age and that was his 21st conviction.  That brings me to the subject of recidivism, which is rampant here and if the statistics were published they would reveal that.  The <Col N="2119" /> statistics were unacceptable when my party was in Government, but to refuse to publish them is almost unforgivable. For that reason I support Deputy Gay Mitchell's Bill.  He is street wise and fully attuned to what is happening on the streets of Dublin, where elderly women lock themselves in their homes at 4 p.m. on a winter's evening because of a fear of the criminals in this city.</P>
    <P>The system needs reviewing.  We have gone soft on criminals.  There are those who will always want to analyse them, paying little attention to the victims of crime.  I visited Loughan House on a beautiful day last October and I could not believe what I saw.  The scene resembled the campus of a university. Young men were strolling around the beautiful grounds, others stripped to the waist were playing golf and music was wafting from the windows.  I felt like booking in for a week; it was similar to a holiday camp <i>par excellence.</i></P>
    <P>Is that the way to fight crime?  Is that the way to treat a person who has committed 21 crimes against tourists?  I believe in the penitential style of punishment for people who repeatedly offend against society.  The ball and chain should be used on a young man who has 21 convictions and in addition he should get a good smack of the birch.  Unfortunately, those days have passed; we are now living in more enlightened times. The system of punishment has been dismantled by various Ministers in the Department of Justice.  Punishment in our courts is totally inappropriate to the crimes committed and a return to the penitential system is necessary if we are to make real inroads into the crime problem here.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Costello has left the Chamber.  He represents the Prisoners' Rights Society, God help us.  What rights have prisoners in society other than the right not to be ill-treated?  I am more concerned about rights for the victims of crime.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that courtesy. The Bill seeks to establish a national bureau of crime statistics.  It is proposed that it would have certain statutory functions and powers, including accurately measuring, reporting and comparing the level of crime, analysing trends and issuing reports on request to certain office holders, including the Minister for Justice, members of the Judiciary and chairpersons of Oireachtas committees. My instinctive response to this Bill is to question why most proposals made to Government and to this House, even if properly motivated as this Bill is, usually call for the establishment of yet another layer of bureaucracy?  I would sound a word of caution in that regard in relation to the proposed establishment of the bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2121" /> The Bill calls for yet another statutory body to join the army of agencies of which we have a surplus.  The aim of Deputies both in Opposition and on the Government side should be to get the Government to work better and cost less. In these times of high Government spending we should be mindful of any proposal to set up yet another statutory body which is likely to employ more people and to cost more in public spending. Even though I support the general themes in the Bill, and believe there is a need for criminological research, statistics required for policy formulation can be compiled and present systems evaluated if existing resources in the Department of Justice are co-ordinated with those of the Central Statistics Office, the prisons and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Garda are the best placed professionals to provide statistics as they form part of their daily operations.  They have immediate access to salient information. If they were properly resourced, as it is shortly planned they should be, they should be the main agency to coordinate and evaluate criminal statistics for the benefit of our legislators and policy formulators.  The Garda Síochána strategic plan, 1993-97, from which I read today, is an excellent document. There is no shortage of good reports which have been compiled over the years by the Law Reform Commission, various select committees of the House, such as the Select Committee on Crime, particularly in respect of juvenile crime.  That plan set out appropriate strategies which would transform the performance of Garda operations.  It set out targets, in terms of performance indicators, to measure achievement and prioritise tasks.  It outlines the resource requirements necessary to help achieve those targets in the most cost effective manner. We should not create more bureaucracy and greater expense for the Department of Justice in respect of compiling statistics. The resources exist but they need to be co-ordinated to make them effective.</P>
    <P>As earlier speakers said, law and order is high on everybody's agenda.  Recently, my party, as a member of the Dublin <Col N="2122" /> Transportation Initiative, carried out a survey in line with general public consultation procedures.  We were hoping to receive a response in respect of traffic management and general levels of satisfaction with public transport.  The questionnaire contained general questions, such as the issue which most concerned the citizens of Dublin.  People listed the level of crime as the main issue.  That questionnaire was not targeted to obtain that answer.  People volunteered the information that they were afraid to go out in Dublin after dark.</P>
    <P>The level of crime is a matter of high priority on the electorate's agenda.  The electorate who voted Deputies into this House expect that we will vocalise their concerns in regard to law and order. There is not only a perceived, but a real increase in the incidence of crime among communities and this is highlighted by crime statistics.  There is a tendency, which must be resisted by legislators, to call for quick fix solutions.  I disagree in principle with the speaker who referred to do-gooders and people who take an integrated approach to the problems of crime rather than proffering quick fix solutions. We must resist the call for quick fix solutions, more agencies, prisons, less respect for civil liberties and a positive howling for retribution.  Given the high level of crime such requests are understandable. However, legislators and policy makers must resist such requests. There is a need to be reflective and to adopt an integrated approach to policy formulation in relation to criminal justice. Such an approach might not get good headlines or soundbites for Deputies, nonetheless it is worthy.</P>
    <P>The Whitaker Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System was an excellent committee.  Paragraph 3.3 of the committee's report discovered, among other things, that society should be less emotional in its response to crime and more aware of the contributions to crime made by deficiencies in its own structures and operations.  We should seek to change institutional matters, as appropriate, rather than adopting a knee-jerk reaction and dealing only with enforcement <Col N="2123" /> and heavy handed tactics.  Crime is a multifaceted problem and locking people up and throwing the keys away will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Criminology is not a well developed science in academic Ireland.  Most lawyers who study law in our universities focus on the solicitor or barrister profession. Very few lawyers continue further academic studies in criminology and compare our justice system with that of other places, such as America, Scotland and so on.  There is a definite need for a criminal research centre, which could be based in universities, to collate and analyse data and to provide a dispassionate analysis of fundamental aspects of crime and punishment.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the budget recently the Minister outlined that the £66 million allocated for law and order is aimed at reducing crime and strengthening the capacity of the criminal justice system to respond to crime.  She stated that recorded indictable crime increased by 1 per cent in 1992.  The figures for 1993 are not yet available, but there is little doubt that they will show an increase on the 1992 figure.  To her credit, the Minister recognises that crime is a complex multifaceted problem and that law enforcement policies should be only a part, albeit a vital part, of the Government's response to the problem.  This brings me back to the point that the aim of any policy initiative from either side of the House should be to ensure that the system works better and costs less.</P>
    <P>The strategic plan set out by the Garda contains very interesting statistics and compares our performance in terms of criminal activity with that of other EU member states.  It has been stated that we have a high incidence of murder, but it does not compare with that in other EU countries.  There is a degree of hysteria here in terms of the statistics on some elements of violent crime.  All other EU countries have a homicide rate many times that in Ireland, some by a factor of more than six.  The rate of burglaries in Greece, Belgium, Portugal and France is lower than that here, while in the UK, <Col N="2124" /> Holland, Germany and Denmark the rate is more than twice that here.  The crime rate here doubled between 1960 and 1970 and again between 1970 and 1980.  Apart from a peak in 1983, the crime rate has stabilised since 1980. There was a 7 per cent increase in the crime rate in 1991 as compared with 1990, although it is debatable whether that is indicative of a trend.  There was a peak in the incidence of burglary in 1983 and there was a considerable reduction in 1990.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that crimes of stealing in which firearms were used increased from a virtual zero rate prior to 1969 to practically two per day in the mid-eighties.  There has been a considerable fall-off in this crime since 1988 and the use of firearms in crime appears to be waning contrary to what some people believe.  However, there has been an increase in the use of violence in the furtherance of criminal acts generally, particularly those of stealing, and the figures have been consistently high since 1982.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have all the statistics, but they need extra resources to respond to the challenges posed by the current problem of terrorism and illegal drug dealing.  Today we discussed the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill, which deals with the seizure of criminal assets relating to drug dealing.</P>
    <P>The decline in formal school control has been recognised by the Garda as one of the reasons for the growing number of juvenile offenders.  The long awaited Juvenile Justice Bill will, I hope, provide an integrated solution to the whole question of juvenile crime.  As has been mentioned, persistent long term unemployment creates the potential for a large body of disaffected youth.  This matter should be dealt with in the Juvenile Justice Bill, which will be introduced in the House soon.  I hope that we will have a civilised debate on that Bill. The committee on juvenile crime recommend that the whole question of juvenile crime should be approached in a compassionate manner.  I reject the allegation that I am a do-gooder when I say that it <Col N="2125" /> is absolutely imperative that we take a compassionate approach to juvenile crime.  Children are not born criminals; they are influenced by their environment, and we must respond to their needs.</P>
    <P>The report recognises the relationship between crime and greater urbanisation, particularly the existence of pockets of disadvantage in our bigger cities and towns.  As Deputy Crawford said, it identifies rural depopulation, which results in many elderly people living alone; rendering them more vulnerable in terms of their houses being broken into and being abused by criminals.</P>
    <P>In dealing with crime we need to pool all available resources rather than create further layers of bureaucracy.  The resources allocated by the Minister for increased Garda recruitment &mdash; 407 gardaí are to be recruited this year &mdash; are to be welcomed.  The employment of civilians on clerical duties would ensure that a greater number of gardaí are available on the streets.  There is no point training gardaí in a specialised manner &mdash; training has been enhanced and is second to none in Europe &mdash; if they are to be employed on desk duties.  The increase to 900 in the number of clerical civilians in the force is welcome.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in reply to the debate the Minister would give greater detail on the research unit which it is proposed to establish in the Garda Síochána.  The general thrust of our approach to criminal justice should be to reward the ideas that work and to get away from the ideas that have not worked.  I do not believe in the agency-led approach to policy.  There are many good people in the Garda, the prison service and the Central Statistics Office and we should concentrate on integrating the whole system.  The Progressive Democrats believe that regulatory overkill should be eliminated. There is a huge amount of red tape, some of which is necessary but much of which makes Government processes cumbersome. Anybody who has been involved with State agencies knows that red tape and regulations are prohibitive of development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to local authorities. <Col N="2126" /> Local authorities should be given greater powers to deal in a local and more targeted way with crime.  In Dublin City Council there is a crime committee which deals with specific areas of concern in the Dublin area.  Despite the fact that this committee has no real powers or resources, it is a useful committee.  The whole question of devolving powers to local authorities needs to be addressed. Local authorities are best situated to be proactive in terms of housing policy, which could have an influence on crime. When speaking earlier today about the drugs problem in Dublin I mentioned the difficulties experienced when a drug pusher moves into a local authority flats complex.  Parents who are terrified that their children may have drugs pushed on them by these people &mdash; they may be squatters &mdash; have called on the local authority to have them evicted.  Local authorities face onerous legal obstacles in trying to evict squatters.  This issue has to be looked at.  The residents in some inner city flats complexes have become so politicised about this issue that they marched to City Hall to express their outrage at the hands-off approach being taken by the local authority, the lack of response to the needs of people who want to protect their children from drug pushers.</P>
    <P>Development and land use policy have to be taken into account in any integrated approach to the planning of successful communities.  If we wrongly create, as we have done through misplaced planning policies, ghettos and disadvantaged areas where there are inadequate facilities, no playing fields and no proper public transport system we will only add to the problem. Generally we are bad at planning &mdash; we tend to prepare for the worst rather than plan for the best.  This applies in particular to the criminal justice area where we think we have to build more prisons because the crime statistics are increasing.  Instead of doing this, we should be thinking ahead, planning and integrating all our resources in an effort to improve the environment where criminals are born and reared.</P>
    <P>The residents of St. Catherine's Parish in Dublin 7, who have become politicised <Col N="2127" /> in an effort to tackle the drugs problem in their community, have recorded 40 drug pushers operating in the Meath Street area.  The local residents are seeking funding to build a community centre and to date have raised £1,000.  The cost of building a community centre should be compared to the £40,000 cost per annum of keeping a person in jail.  Young people in the inner city area cannot be blamed for getting involved in crime when adequate facilities are not provided for them.  I understand how these children can drift into a life of crime.  Many of them come from dysfunctional families, some have an alcoholic father or mother and most come from families which are under stress.  It is not acceptable for us to adopt the &ldquo;hang them high&rdquo; law and order approach to this issue.  We can see how the problems start.</P>
    <P>Even in some of the more prosperous new communities in Dublin south, for example, Knocklyon, there is a real need for the provision of adequate facilities such as playing fields for young people. Because these facilities are not available in many areas the young people go into town and many of them start stealing from shops.  We need to look at the community aspect of the problem and ensure co-ordination between local authority departments.  Targeted schemes such as these, together with community and juvenile liaison gardaí, are the answer to tackling crime on a local level.</P>
    <P>The committee on juvenile crime made some excellent recommendations when it reported in March 1993.  For example, it proposed the establishment of a local juvenile crime prevention committee within the Garda divisions in urban areas and a national juvenile crime prevention committee.  More importantly, it recommended a ban on the use of adult prisons for offenders under 17 years.  Child offenders under 12 years of age are the proper responsibility of the Minister for Health under child care legislation.  It is absolutely atrocious that any child under the age of 17 years should be sent to an adult prison.</P>
    <P>On 23 December 1993 the Department <Col N="2128" /> of Justice published its annual report on prisons for the period 1988-91.  The report highlights the ongoing imprisonment of 15 and 16 year old children in adult prisons, but shows a decrease from approximately 120 in 1987 to under 20 in 1991 in the number of children in adult prisons.  While I welcome this decrease I believe there should be a complete ban on the use of adult prisons for persons under the age of 17 years.</P>
    <P>With regard to institutional matters which cause problems in the administration of justice, the Minister will be aware of the serious concern among practitioners and the general public that people who have been convicted of serious crimes are being released from jails by way of temporary releases because of overcrowding.  This highlights the inability of jails to contain the number of people convicted of serious crimes. Undoubtedly we need more prison places.  The Progressive Democrats welcome the provision of resources in the context of the £66 million package to create 210 more prison places, including 60 places for female prisoners.  The issue of people reoffending while on temporary release is very serious and undermines confidence in the justice system.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the pressure on accommodation and the introduction of a system under which prisoners with a 50 per cent remission can transfer to open centres.  The statistics relating to full temporary releases show that a total of 1,619 people were granted full temporary releases in 1991.  This is covered by section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  The Minister is empowered to grant temporary releases in cases where a range of criteria are satisfied.  The main reason for the granting of temporary releases is the lack of prison space.  In many cases prisoners share cells.  The situation is almost as bad as that when, due to very long hospital waiting lists, people had to sleep in corridors.  Such a situation is totally untenable.</P>
    <P>The figures for individuals who offend while on temporary release are very worrying.  Of the 2,688 prisoners granted temporary release on a short-term and <Col N="2129" /> weekend basis in 1991, 302 people broke the conditions or absconded.  The figures are contained in the reports which have been published.  Consideration needs to be given to the number of people who reoffend while on temporary release. This problem has the capacity to undermine confidence in the justice system.</P>
    <P>The Minister is looking at the question of bail in the context of the Law Reform Commission's proposals.  I look forward to hearing how the Law Reform Commission will balance the need to maintain the presumption of innocence, which is fundamental, with the problem of people reoffending while on bail.  I should like the Minister to tell us the number of people who reoffend while on bail &mdash; statistics are bandied about but no one has conclusively evaluated the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted that law enforcement can only be a part, although a very vital part, of the Government's response to increased criminal activity. There is a need for some kind of criminal justice research and a full audit of our prison population.  When I visited Mountjoy Prison recently I was told that something like 80 per cent of the prison population there came from five postal districts in Dublin.  That is an extraordinary statistic if it is to be believed. There is an average daily prison population of 2,000.  It should be possible to obtain a social profile of people who end up in prison with a view to formulating some policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>I support the general thrust of the Bill but I am very concerned that it may create another layer of bureaucracy and another agency which we certainly do not need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>A proposal has been forwarded to the Minister for Arts, Culture <Col N="2130" /> and the Gaeltacht to assist Dublin Corporation acquire Nos. 20 and 21 Parnell Square, the old National Ballroom. These premises are currently owned by a trade union which is in the process of moving to another location.  This represents an important opportunity for Dublin Corporation to acquire these buildings.  It is important from a conservation point of view, because these houses are significant in terms of the heritage of Dublin, and the proposal is to have a cultural tourism project developed there.</P>
      <P>The cultural committee of Dublin Corporation, of which I am a member, has been looking at these houses over a long period and we had hoped to acquire them with a view to extending the facilities for the Hugh Lane Gallery.  We have since decided that these houses might be put to better use if we were to acquire them and develop a cultural cluster in the north inner city close to O'Connell Street which would complement facilities in the Parnell Square area, such as the Hugh Lane Gallery, the Writers Museum, the Gate Theatre and the Garden of Remembrance. We believe it would fill a void for city dwellers and tourists by providing a unique cultural and visual arts resource and exhibition centre.  It would also allow us to refurbish and make accessible to the citizens of Dublin and the public generally two beautiful Georgian houses which are over two centuries old and which contain many features worthy of preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is called &ldquo;A Proposal for Dublin Discovery&rdquo;.  It will be a multifaceted cultural tourism project which will bring together an historical interpretation of Dublin city, with a major urban folklore centre and, perhaps, a genealogical heritage centre.  It could present the contemporary aspects of Dublin's culture through a creative arts centre.  We believe it would provide a dynamic exhibition centre which would link in well with the Hugh Lane Gallery and the Irish Writers Museum.  It is an important development in terms of Parnell Square and the heritage of the city. With the help of ERD funding and the <Col N="2131" /> support of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Dublin Corporation will acquire the property and then develop it.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis has been placed on the Temple Bar development, and it is a wonderful development.  However, the north inner city needs to be nurtured also and it is to that end we hope this development would provide a unique uplift for the area.  It would be also a focal point for a north city heritage tourism centre.  This project is dependent on the acquisition of the houses from the trade union which owns them.  That trade union has now relocated to another site on Parnell Square as part of an amalgamation with other unions.</P>
    <P>We would be grateful if the Minister would favourably consider our application for ERD funding.  It would not involve a large amount of money and it is a project that would greatly enhance the city.  Unfortunately, there is a deadline for the acquisition of this property, 25 February, and we are waiting with bated breath to see if the Minister will favourably consider this proposal.  It is not often that Dublin Corporation's cultural committee requests funding for projects, but we need the Minister's support if we are to acquire these funds.  I hope he will come forward with a favourable response to this request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher, Donegal South-West) Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher, Donegal South-West)">

        <i>Donegal South-West):</i> Tá an meád atá ráite ag an Teachta Liz O'Donnell nótaithe agam go géar agus ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl di as ucht an cheist tábhachtach seo a thabhairt os ár gcomhair anocht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The premises at 20 and 21 Parnell Square are, of course, the site of the former National Ballroom.  The houses concerned are two large, four-storey, over-basement, 18th century Georgian houses located between the fine Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, the Dublin Writers Centre and the Dublin Writers Museum.  The National Ballroom occupies the full extent of the <Col N="2132" /> original garden areas to the rear of the two houses.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Mary Flaherty on 4 November last on this same project, the Minister indicated that he had received a request from Dublin Corporation to assist in the acquisition and refurbishment of these premises.  However, few details of the proposed development accompanied the request at that time.  He nevertheless indicated in the reply to the parliamentary question that on receipt of greater details from the corporation about their proposals, he was prepared to consider the matter further in consultation with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, who has responsibility for policy relating to urban renewal. Last Thursday, 10 February 1994, my Department received a detailed submission from the Dublin city manager on the proposed development at 20-21 Parnell Square.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that under the National Development Plan 1994-99, the Minister succeeded in securing significant Structural Funds assistance for investment in the arts, cultural and heritage infrastructure of this State.  In doing so he succeeded in locating arts, cultural and heritage strategies at the centre of the Government's overall economic and social strategies in the plan.  The Structural Funds which have been secured for our Department will attract part funding from the Exchequer, local authorities and the private sector.  They will allow for significant investment in our national cultural institutions, in cultural tourism projects and in a capital programme for the arts.  Deputies will accept in this context that since the national cultural institutions are all located in Dublin, we are obliged to provide some balance by ensuring investment in the regions also.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan is still the subject of negotiation with the European Commission as to the eligibility for Structural Funds assistance of the strategies contained in the plan.  This process will take some time before conclusion and it will be only after this that we will be in a position to outline the eligibility <Col N="2133" /> criteria for projects to be assisted from the funds at our disposal.  The Deputy will appreciate that demand for funds is likely to far exceed supply.  Given that the Parnell Square area of Dublin is generally in need of renewal, we propose to consult with the Minister for the Environment to ascertain whether the project could be assisted by the funds at his disposal for urban renewal generally.  This process of consultation with the Commission and the Cabinet is ongoing and it will be some time before we are in a position to make a final decision on the submission from Dublin Corporation. However, I can assure Deputy O'Donnell that I am prepared to consider this matter carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening. I spoke in the House some time ago about the problems of De Beers at Shannon Airport.  As I said then, De Beers is the most important industrial employer in the Shannon Industrial Estate.  There are approximately 600 people now employed there, and wages and fringe benefits to the local economy amount to approximately £46 million per annum.</P>
      <P>In recent times the company has been subjected to severe competition when the Shannon plant found itself competing within its own structure, within the De Beers family, in addition to competition from the United States, Japan, Korea, other eastern countries, including Romania and France.  This has meant that the management at Shannon found it necessary to restructure their entire operation. Some painful decisions have been taken, with goodwill being expressed by both sides.  I have always had great admiration for the way in which the De Beers staff and management have solved their difficulties. The company are a model in industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a slight hiccup there at present.  My purpose in raising this matter is to urge the Government to become a <Col N="2134" /> facilitator, or persuader, in this case.  I understand that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have already taken an interest in the resolution of this difficulty. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the moves already undertaken in this respect.  The House will recall that when I raised this matter here before I was told about the jobs protection unit within the Department. It had been my hope that some scheme would be devised so that talks between management and union would resolve the difficulties.  I do not want to exacerbate the situation &mdash; I know it is a very delicate one &mdash; but I should appreciate the Government taking an obvious, active interest in the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Carey's concern about the difficulties being experienced at De Beers, particularly as I, too, come from the region. De Beers has been in Shannon since 1961.  It is one of the most successful and prestigious companies in the region.  It has made an enormous contribution to the local economy both by way of direct wages and salaries and in terms of its demand for goods and services locally.</P>
      <P>The industrial dispute and threatened strike at the company arises from its proposals to reduce the workforce by 90 and to restructure pay by means of a 10 per cent pay cut and a pay freeze in 1994. There were 150 voluntary redundancies in 1993.  According to management, developments in the industrial diamond market, including the emergence of high quality, low cost producers, have left the Shannon company in a vulnerable position. I understand that manufacturing costs in the Shannon plant are more expensive than in the company's other plants in Sweden and South Africa and that failure to implement the necessary cost reductions could lead to relocation of production to one of the other plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the unions did not accept the management proposals, they did not reject pay cuts out of hand.  They indicated that they were prepared to negotiate <Col N="2135" /> a managed change in the structures of pay.</P>
    <P>The matter was referred to the Labour Court which issued a recommendation in December 1993.  In its recommendation the court accepted the need for a restructuring of pay scales and for a pay freeze in 1994.  However, the court went on to recommend that the restructuring should not take place before 1 February 1994 and that, in the meantime, the company and unions should enter discussions in an attempt to achieve agreement on alternative measures that would justify amelioration of the company's proposal. However, in the event that agreement could not be reached by 1 February 1994, the court recommended that the unions accept implementation of the company's proposals.</P>
    <P>Further discussions took place between the parties in accordance with the Labour Court recommendation.  The unions offered a 5 per cent pay cut along with a pay freeze and no incremental adjustments for 1994.  This was not acceptable to the company, however, and it has proceeded to implement the 10 per cent pay cut already proposed.  Consequently, the unions have served strike notice to expire on Monday, 21 February.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that the unions are at present considering taking legal action against the company for interfering with contracts of employment without agreement.  The unions have indicated that strike action will be deferred if such legal action is pursued.</P>
    <P>The Labour Relations Commission is in touch with the parties and is available to assist in negotiations on the issues in dispute if its services are required.  The services of both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are designed to ensure that parties have impartial, expert and independent assistance in incremental stages to reach settlements to avoid industrial action.</P>
    <P>I regret that the parties so far have been unable to reach agreement.  In view of the serious consequences a strike could have for employment in the Shannon region, I would urge all concerned to <Col N="2136" /> seek to resolve their difficulties through negotiation, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, if necessary.</P>
    <P>May I ask if the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, who has been delayed unavoidably in the Seanad, may be afforded two minutes to add to my reply?</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, for having nobly stepped into the breach.  I might explain to the House that I was in the Seanad and it was impossible, even with my powers, to be in both places simultaneously as the Vote there exceeded the time.</P>
      <P>I had a conversation with Deputy Carey about the matter earlier in the evening.  The brief just read by my colleague was the one I would have delivered. I have noted that Deputy Carey asked the Government to take an active interest and continue an interventionist role in the matter, which is in line with what he said to me earlier.</P>
      <P>I am glad to place on the record that tomorrow I will contact the Labour Relations Commission to ensure that the level of intensity and commitment of dialogue between the parties is maintained. This is most important as matters are now at an acute stage.  I shall be in contact with Deputy Carey and his office as the matter progresses.</P>

      <P>Mar is eol don Aire tá an ceantar siar ó Ghaillimh go dtí an Cheathrú Rua ar cheann de na ceantair is mó fás agus forbairt le fiche bliain.  Faoi láthair tá dhá scéim réigiúnach ag freastal ar an gceantar seo.  Idir an Spidéal agus Ros a'Mhíl is grúp-scéim uisce atá ann a cuireadh ar bun sna seachtóidí.  Cuireadh <Col N="2137" /> é seo ar bun le haghaidh daonra a bhí i bhfad níos lú ná an daonra atá ann i láthair na huaire agus níl an foinse uisce in ann soláthar ceart uisce a chur ar fáil don cheantar sin anois.  Bíonn fadhbanna móra leis an mbrú uisce sa cheantar agus freisin bíonn gearáin ó uair go chéile faoi chaighdeán an uisce féin.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil an t-uisce ar chaighdeán sásúil ach bíonn cor gearáin faoi dhath an uisce agus mar sin de.</P>
      <P>An moladh atá ann anois ná go gceanglófaí scéim réigiúnach an Spidéil le ceann na Ceathrú Rua.  Réiteodh sé seo dhá fhadhb.  Ó tharla go bhfuil fuílleach uisce ar fáil ón scéim réigiúnach sa Spidéal chinnteodh sé soláthar ceart uisce don cheantar siar on Spidéal go Ros a' Mhíl.  Freisin chinnteodh sé soláthar uisce níos fearr don chalaphort i Ros a' Mhíl, áit a bhfuil ganntanas uisce ag cur bac ar fhorbairt.  Freisin chinnteodh sé soláthar ceart uisce don Cheathrú Rua agus don Spidéal sa chás gur éirigh fadhb i gceachtar den dá cheantar.  Mar is eol don Aire tá méadú mór daonra sa phobal seo.  Mar shampla, sa 20 bliain idir 1971 agus 1991 tháinig méadú ar an daonra sa cheantar seo de 30 faoin gcéad.</P>
      <P>In ainneoin na cainte ar fad atá ar bun maidir le bánú na tuaithe, bánú na Gaeltachta agus bánú Chonamara agus an Iarthair is iontach go bhfuil forbairt agus fás daonra den chineál sin ann.  Tá sé ar cheann de na rátaí fáis is mó sa tír.  Mar shampla, sa cheantar a bhfuil Comharchumann Shailearna ag freastal air &mdash; sé sin ceantar an ghrúp-scéim &mdash; tháinig méadú ar an daonra idir 1971, an t-am a cuireadh isteach an scéim uisce, agus 1991, ó 2,402 to dtí 3,139 duine. Freisin de bharr na hoibre atá ar bun ag Údarás na Gaeltachta tá go leor monarchana sa cheantar seo agus tá gá acu siúd le soláthar leanúnach uisce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhéinn buíoch mar sin den Aire dá bhféadfadh sé tosaíocht a thabhairt don iarratas seo agus féachaint leis an bpíopa uisce seo a chur ar fáil.  Mura ndéantar é seo ní bheidh aon rogha ag Comharchumann Shailearna atá i mbun an ghrúp-scéim sa cheantar ach iarratas a dhéanamh <Col N="2138" /> le haghaidh grúp-scéim méadaithe i gceantar Indreabháin.  Ó tharla go mbeadh méadú agus feabhsú ar an bhfoinse uisce i gceist, bheadh an réiteach seo ar an bhfadhb i bhfad níos costasaí ná an moladh atá ann go gcuirfí an píopa nua siar ón Spidéal agus go gceanglófaí le chéile córas an Spidéil agus na grúp-scéimeanna atá ar bun ag Comharchumann Shailearna agus córas na Ceathrú Rua.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, ba mhaith liom iarradh ar an Aire breathnú go fabharach ar an moladh go gcuirfí píopa 10 n-orlach ar fáil.</P>

    <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, tá roinnt mhaith dul chun cinn déanta agus á dheánamh i gContae na Gaillimhe maidir le soláthar sheirbhísí uisce agus séarachais. Tá costas de bhreis agus £20 milliún ar an gceann is mó díobh seo, scéim sholáthair uisce réigiúnach an Tuaim.  Tá an scéim seo i measc na scéimeanna roghnaithe do chomhmhaoiniú le cabhair ó Chiste Comhtháthú an Aontais Eorpaigh. Críochnaíodh Scéim Séarachta Tuaim le déanaí i gcostas de £9 milliún. Chomh maith, tá dul chun cinn mór déanta i bpleanáil scéime ollmhór chun deileáil le múnlach ó Chathair na Gaillimhe agus an ceantar máguaird.  Meastar go mbeidh costas de £35 mhilliún ar an scéim seo, an Scéim um Dhraenáil Chathair na Gaillimhe agus Oranmór.  Faoin bPlean Forbartha Náisiúnta, tá i gceist breis agus £605 mhilliún a chaitheamh, i rith an tréimhse 1994-99 ar scéimeanna uisce agus séarachais araon.  Don bhliain seo amháin, tá soláthar de £122 mhilliún, an méid is airde riamh á chur ar fáil. <Col N="2139" /> Is fianaise shoiléir í seo ar Chúthracht leanúnach an Rialtais soláthar uisce de dhechineál a chur ar fáil chomh maith le fáil réidh le fadhbanna truailliú uisce.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil an dul chun cinn seo déanta, tá líon mór scéimeanna uisce agus séarachais fós de dhíth i gContae an Gaillimhe agus tríd na tíre le chéile.  Sa gcomhthéacs seo, is eol dom go bhfuil fadhbanna áirithe ag baint leis an scéim uisce atá ann ó thaobh méid agus cinéal an uisce ar fáil, i gceantar an Spidéil/Ros a' Mhíl.  Tá cáipéisí chonartha don scéim uisce á scrúdú faoi láthair i mo Roinn i gcomhthéacs an Chláir Fheidhmithe do Sheirbhísí Comhshaoil iar-1993.</P>
    <P>Táthar i mbun ullmhúcháin ar an gClár Fheidhmithe seo agus mar a chuir mé i iúl cheana, cuirfear breis agus £605 mhilliún ar fáil do sheirbhísí uisce agus séarachais idir seo agus an bhliain 1999.  Ar ndóigh, caithfear díriú ar na háiteanna is mó gá agus réimse mór nithe a thabhairt chun chuimhnimh, maraon leis an gá an caighdeán uisce a fheabhsú mar atá leagtha síos i dTreoracha an Aontais Eorpaigh. Caithfear riachtanais tionscail agus turasóireachta a thabhairt chun chuimhnimh chomh maith.  Go dtí go mbeidh deireadh leis an obair seo, ní féidir a rá cad iad na scéimeanna bheidh sa Chlár Fheidhmithe.</P>
    <P>Tabharfaidh mé an méid cabhrach agus is féidir liom an scéim sin a chur ar aghaidh go luath.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochás a ghabháil don Aire as ucht a theacht anseo an t-am seo den oíche chun an cheist seo a phlé.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to answer the point I raise on this very important issue.  My question is couched in language which suggests that the request has already been refused.  The school year 1993-94 is not over and by raising this matter I am hoping the Minister will agree to the appointment of the <Col N="2140" /> resource teacher immediately so that, for part of the 1993-94 school year, that facility will be available.</P>
    <P>A resource teacher is urgently needed to support the work of the visiting teacher who covers all of County Galway and Galway city.  There is only one such visiting teacher and there are 26 pupils who are visually impaired attending local national schools or special schools in different locations throughout Galway. The report on visually impaired children stressed the need for resource teachers to be appointed in order to support the work of the visiting teacher and I believe the intention was to appoint them to an area.</P>
    <P>Galway has a high number of visually impaired children and this warrants the appointment of a resource teacher who would be able to spend time with different children on a one to one basis and help them in their education which is so seriously affected by this disability.  As one young person said, imagine sitting in a classroom and not being able to read what the teacher had written on the blackboard.  Unfortunately, that is the position in which these young pupils find themselves.</P>
    <P>There was criticism from the parents of these children about the scant attention paid to their needs in the Green Paper. I understand that the European Union Council of Education Ministers passed a resolution favouring the integration of children with special needs.  However, in this country there is no systematic regular assessment and follow up of visually impaired children which would allow us to develop and co-ordinate an education programme.  President Robinson is quoted as having said that disabled people in Ireland exist in a legislative vacuum.</P>
    <P>The document, <i>Education for a Changing World,</i> states that other support needed to ensure a successful programme of integration will include, as appropriate, supplementary tuition, special facilities or special equipment.  There will <Col N="2141" /> be sufficient flexibility to allow an appropriate response to individual cases of special educational need.</P>
    <P>It is tragic to think how far we are from providing a successful programme of integration and of how we are continuing to neglect the special education needs of visually impaired children.  I appeal to the Minister to approve immediately the appointment of a resource teacher for County Galway and also to resolve the impasse between her Department and the Department of Health as to which of these two Departments is responsible for the provision of special equipment which is so badly needed to enable visually impaired children to derive greater educational benefit in their formative years. I understand there are nine children in County Galway in need of easy readers or the closed circuit TV technique.  This would help them greatly, but the Departments of Education and Health are passing the buck from one to another until it is decided which Department should fund them.</P>
    <P>Equality in education has been denied to these children despite a commitment to promote integration.  The lack of support staff and the non-availability of appropriate equipment is denying these young people education.  We all know that the loss of a few years in the formative childhood years can never be redeemed.  The visually impaired demand education as a basic human right.  Let us hope my plea on their behalf tonight will be responded to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline the position on this matter.  Indeed, this is the second time this matter has been raised in the House by Galway Deputies.  It is the policy of my Department to seek to encourage the maximum possible level of integration of children with disabilities, including those with a visual impairment, into ordinary schools.  I fully support the right of parents to opt for integrated education <Col N="2142" /> where this is consistent with the assessed needs of their children.</P>
      <P>At present approximately 155 visually impaired children are attending special schools which have dedicated facilities to address their needs, while a further 380 children, approximately, are attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis throughout the country.  Those attending special schools would ordinarily have a serious degree of visual impairment and such children would have access to a comprehensive range of highly-developed, support services.</P>
      <P>Under a new arrangement eight extra teachers have been added to the visiting teacher service and all 38 teachers in the expanded service, including 27 teachers who previously catered solely for hearing impaired children, are now available to support the needs of visually impaired children in ordinary schools.  These developments will facilitate more frequent visits to the children concerned. The teachers will also continue to have access to the support and assistance of the specialists in visual impairment within the service.</P>
      <P>A further important innovation was the introduction of resource teachers to assist ordinary teaching staff in dealing with the special needs of children with disabilities, including children with visual impairment.  The resource teacher model is used in particular circumstances as an alternative to the visiting teacher service. Decisions regarding the nature of support service provided in individual situations are driven by the numbers of children involved and the nature of their particular disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has received many applications for resource teacher posts, including one from the advocates for the visually impaired committee.  Because the number of teaching posts available to respond to such applications is limited, recipient schools have to be carefully selected on the basis of priority of need, following the collection of data from <Col N="2143" /> schools by my Department's inspectorate.</P>
    <P>Already 12 resource teachers have been put in place and I would hope that substantial development would be achieved in this area in the coming years. As I indicated in my recent statement on the 1994 education budget, it is proposed to allocate additional posts to the special <Col N="2144" /> education area in 1994 and I can assure the Deputy that any allocation of additional resource teacher posts will look at the particular needs of the visually impaired in Galway, as highlighted by the advocates for the visually impaired committee.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 February 1994.</P>

    <P>However, while ABT and participants consistently see trade missions and promotional <Col N="2008" /> visits as being very important for sourcing business, it is too soon yet to quantify the benefits to Irish industry from the past year's calendar of events. Some companies conclude business deals during the different trade missions &mdash; for example, when I was in Mexico last year, I was present at the signing of contracts worth in excess of 2 million &mdash; while, for others, the missions afford an opportunity to explore new markets and to identify potential business partners offering the possibility of medium to long term export contracts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>Last August, to help Irish exporters improve penetration of world markets, I launched an intensified promotion effort, which included a refinement and simplification of An Bord Tráchtála's grant schemes and increased promotional activity by ABT.  A combination of raising financial ceilings and lowering thresholds is intended to make grant schemes more relevant to the needs of as many firms as possible, while ABT is now placing a special emphasis on stimulating more sales leads and organising more visits here by overseas buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indications are that the changes have <Col N="2009" /> already begun to have an impact on our exports, indigenous and non-indigenous, despite the continuation of quite depressed conditions in many of our principal markets.  Recent ABT figures estimate, for 1993, an 8.25 per cent growth for overall exports to 18 billion pounds and an 8 per cent growth for indigenous exports to 3.9 billion pounds.</P>
    <P>The target for coming years is to achieve an increase of 9 per cent in exports each year for the duration of the National Plan.  The achievement of this target will be aided by the economic recovery now underway in many of our main markets, particularly the US and the UK, and by the successful completion of the Uruguay Round.</P>
    <P>In relation to Japan, where the market was sluggish, Ireland was one of the few EU countries to actually increase its exports in the first half of 1993.  This continues the progress made in 1992 when they totalled 480 million pounds, an increase of 40 per cent on the 1991 figure.</P>
    <P>On the question of the link between output and export growth and employment, this issue has been the subject of a great deal of examination, particularly the NESC report of December, 1992 and, while the phenomenon of &ldquo;jobless growth&rdquo; has caused much debate, no one denies that national economic advancement of any sort depends on export growth.</P>
    <P>The message, therefore, to those of us responsible for formulating national trade policy is clear enough: to continue to work towards creating the right international environment and to encourage and assist Irish industry to retain and expand its share of international markets. With our very high dependence on exports, this must be the route to maintaining and creating jobs which are really sustainable and based on market share won in competitive conditions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 18 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the serious decline in stocks which has been experienced by a number of sea trout fisheries on the west coast of Ireland since 1990.  This is a matter of great importance for tourism angling generally and is a concern shared with me by the Minister for the Marine.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, in fact, our two Departments have been in discussion, bearing in mind in particular how adverse repercussions for our tourism angling product generally can best be avoided. The Minister for the Marine has already had an action programme to address the problem of sea trout decline in operation since 1991.  That programme is targeted at conservation and protection of existing stocks; the rehabilitation of stocks; improved management strategies for fish farms and continuing scientific research into the causes of sea trout declines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Minister for the Marine established a Scientific Working Group in 1991 to co-ordinate the national sea-trout research programme.  The Working Group's report is scheduled to be published in the next few weeks.  Furthermore, a Sea Trout Task Force was <Col N="2011" /> also set up by the Minister for the Marine in July, 1993 to advise on additional measures to combat the sea trout decline. Its report is expected before Easter.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, there is a compelling need to reassure the angling tourist abroad about the many positive aspects that remain with respect to our overall angling product and, in co-operation with the Minister for the Marine, I propose to issue a statement in this regard in the coming few weeks which will be circulated throughout our main holiday markets by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Fáilte.  As far as I am concerned, we still have an excellent tourism angling product and I am intent on not only keeping it, but on developing it.</P>

      <P>As part of the National Plan 1994-99, which will be supported by the next tranche of EU Structural Funds, it is proposed that the Market Development Programme will receive a total allocation of IR£174 million over the six year period.</P>
      <P>This programme will be administered by An Bord Tráchtála and will represent a development of the successful 1989-1993 package of marketing measures, which was supported by the previous tranche of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>The measures of the previous programme have been adapted in order to meet the global marketing challenges of the 1990s.  They will continue to assist indigenous companies to improve their marketing capability in foreign markets and also to provide a series of direct grants and incentives to companies for their marketing effort.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 24 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The majority of hotels in Ireland are in the small hotel category, i.e. with 30 rooms or less.  They form the backbone of the accommodation sector and are vital to continued tourism growth.</P>
      <P>Several of the measures included in the recent budget will impact directly and positively on the small hotel sector. These include in particular: the availability of assistance under the £100 Enterprise Fund, for tourism projects; and the improved capital allowances for hotels.</P>
      <P>Other budgetary measures, such as the changes in Capital Acquisition Tax, and lower PRSI rates, while not directed specifically at the tourism or small hotel sectors, will nonetheless be of significant benefit to them.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the special marketing measures that I recently initiated will, by improving tourism performance generally, also impact positively on the accommodation sector.</P>
      <P>Finally, I am proposing that assistance under the next Operational Programme for Tourism for the development of leisure facilities linked to tourist accommodation, should be extended from large hotels to other approved forms of accommodation including small hotels.  The precise criteria which will apply to such leisure facilities under the next programme have yet to be determined and will of course be subject to agreement with the EU Commission.</P>

    <P>The relevant Community Regulation allows for the draw down of funds, committed during the lifetime of the programme, for one year after the expiry of the programme i.e. to the end of 1994.  I am confident that all funds will be drawn down within that time frame.</P>

      <P>Final figures for 1993 are not yet available.  The latest tourism estimates available from the Central Statistics Office show that visitor numbers for the first nine months of 1993 at 2.689 million were up 5.3 per cent on the same period in 1992.  Preliminary forecasts compiled by Bord Fáilte on the basis of available CSO returns put the number of overseas visitors for 1993 at 3.27 million, a 4.9 per cent increase on the previous year.</P>
      <P>Ireland is ideally positioned to increase its share of the international tourism market and there are grounds for optimism in 1994 on a number of fronts.  The present period of weak growth in the international economy seems to have reached its lowest point in 1993.  An increasingly solid expansion is underway in the United States and Canada.  The recovery in the UK seems well established and the indications are that, in some EU countries at least, the low point of economic activity has been passed. This improving international climate is very favourable in terms of the ability of the overseas consumer to consider a holiday in Ireland.  This combined with the Government's new initiatives for marketing and promoting Ireland as a tourist destination will undoubtedly result in an improved performance and growth in tourist numbers during 1994.</P>

      <P>The consolidation of Ireland's representation in New York has <Col N="2015" /> been successfully completed and all the State agencies, plus the Consulate General, now operate out of Ireland House at 345 Park Avenue.  The formal opening of the new premises will take place later this year.  State agencies already share accommodation in London, Paris, Dusseldorf, Milan and Hong Kong.  In addition, some of the State agencies share embassy premises at the following locations: Beijing, Tokyo, Seoul, Moscow, Riyadh, Madrid and Helsinki. The further rationalisation of Ireland's promotional and commercial representation abroad will be kept under constant review so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of our resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1989-1993, designated my Department as the national authority in charge of programme management. This entailed a wide range of analytical and reporting tasks, many of <Col N="2016" /> which were undertaken by the Tourism OP Monitoring Committee, but neither the Department nor this committee played any role in determining what specific applications under the programme received assistance.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the sub-committee for Sub-Programmes 1 and 2 which was also chaired by my Department and included the supervising officers in Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development in charge of programme funds as well as representatives of Office of Public Works&mdash; was required under the programme to ensure the maximum integration of measures and a standard application of assessment procedures in relation to all capital projects proposed for assistance by Bord Fáilte, Shannon Development and Office of Public Works.  In discharging their role on the sub-committee, all the other participant agencies, including my Department, commented and provided advice on the projects recommended by the individual agencies.  Ultimately, however, the decision to approve or disapprove a project rested with the agencies.</P>
      <P>Under the Global Grant Agreements concluded with the European Commission, Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development were separately responsible in their own areas for implementing the programme's grant assistance measures for private sector tourism development.  Both organisations also acted as the agencies for the grant assistance, in conjunction with Office of Public Works and ESB International in relation to their particular spheres of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the next round of Structural Funds is concerned, I propose that my Department, in its role as the initiator and custodian of Government tourism policy, should have a wider role in determining the priorities for future grant assistance and in monitoring the administration of the Tourism Operational Programme, 1994-1999.  While I do not propose to make my Department the final arbiter in adjudicating on individual grant applications under the programme, <Col N="2017" /> I am committed to ensuring that it will have a decisive role in achieving consistency and cohesion as between project assistance and overall tourism policy.</P>
    <P>As to the next Community Support Framework, the Deputy will be aware that negotiations between the Government and the European Commission are ongoing in regard to it, including the next Tourism Operational Programme.  While these negotiations are proceeding, it would be premature and inappropriate to provide any details as to exact priorities or operating structures, but the House can be assured that I will make a full announcement covering all aspects at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the comment made by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation in the context of its review of tourism performance during 1993 and priorities for 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I should mention that performance for the 1993 season is in line with the growth targets set by the Government.  According to preliminary forecasts compiled by Bord Fáilte from the available Central Statistics Office returns the number of overseas visitors is estimated at 3.27 million, equivalent to a 5 per cent increase over 1992.  Despite <Col N="2019" /> the recessionary climate in Britain and the United States and the fact that travel within Europe was stagnant total foreign exchange earnings are expected to exceed £1.3 billion for the first time ever.</P>
    <P>The prospects for further growth are good in 1994 given the economic recovery internationally.  An increasingly solid expansion is underway in the US and Canada.  The recovery in the UK is well established and the indications are that in some European countries, the low point of economic activity has been passed.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline to the House the resources that are being made available for tourism promotion during 1994.  This year, there will be £21.7 million available directly to Bord Fáilte to provide for its tourism promotional functions. In addition the House will already be aware from our discussions earlier today that a further £3 million was provided in my 1994 Estimates for special marketing programmes and more recently a further £5 million was provided in the budget.  It is also planned to make provision in the new Operational Programme for Tourism for a marketing programme over six years costing £130 million with European Regional Development Fund assistance of over £50 million.  In the expenditure of much of this additional funding Bord Fáilte will obviously be involved in the context of its operational and reporting relationship with my Department.</P>
    <P>These measures quite clearly demonstrate the Governments commitment to accelerate the development of the tourism sector and I am quite confident that, through the adequate resources that are being made available, the sector can continue to expand and increase its contribution to our national well being.</P>

      <P>There is £21.7 million included in the Estimates of my Department for 1994 which will enable Bord Fáilte to provide for its tourism promotional functions.</P>
      <P>At present the board has offices situated in Denmark and Sweden and recently positioned a representative in Norway. They are also in the process of opening a tourism facility within the embassy in Finland.  A series of trade and consumer promotions have just been completed in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland. Advertising campaigns are also planned for Denmark and Sweden and Bord Fáilte will have a stand at the main Pan-Nordic travel fair in Gothenburg during March.</P>
      <P>Overall, the Swedish market was particularly buoyant during 1993 and following a work shop last year Ireland is now being featured by more than 80 major tour operators in the Nordic countries. A charter series from Stockholm into Cork is planned for this year as well as other partcharters from Norway via London and Copenhagen in addition to a charter series from Helsinki into Dublin.</P>

      <P>In keeping with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a partnership Government, 1993-97</i>, to develop heritage attractions provision has been made in the National Development Plan, 1994-99, for a major programme of investment in culture and heritage, including waterways, costing £139 million with estimated Structural Fund support of £104.6 million.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan provides that the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will have responsibility for this programme of investment.  Final decisions on the arrangements and structures for disbursement of funds will not be known until negotiations on the new Operational Programme for Tourism have been completed with the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>Under the auspices of the Anglo-Irish Conference, two formal meetings have been held between the Irish and British Authorities to explore areas for co-operation in the development of tourism on an all-Ireland basis.  These meetings have been supplemented by regular North/South contacts at ministerial, departmental and tourist board level.</P>
      <P>Since 1988, Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board have undertaken a number of joint marketing initiatives abroad, principally in the British, Continental European, North American and Australasian markets. These initiatives have included a jointly-operated Ireland desk at the British Travel Centre in London, joint representation at Travel Fairs abroad, the production of supporting all-Ireland visual and literary material and the reciprocal stocking of literature at the major offices of the boards.  The International Fund for Ireland has generously supported many of these initiatives with more than £5 million up to the end of 1993.</P>
      <P>Co-operation between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board is also facilitating the development of the integrated all-Ireland computerised information and reservations system, known as &ldquo;Gulliver&rdquo;, which features information on many aspects of tourism, North and South.  This joint North/South project, which has been supported by both the European Union and the International Fund, will allow for the first time some international tour operators and travel agents to directly book tourist accommodation and other facilities from this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note that increasing co-operation is also taking place between the tourism industries on both sides of the Border.  We already have a number of specialist publications featuring all-Ireland tourist facilities, but the decision last year by the Irish Hotels Federation <Col N="2023" /> and their counterparts in Northern Ireland to produce this year on a joint basis an all-Ireland accommodation guide was particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be interested to know that there are various initiatives in train to promote tourism in the immediate Border area.  With the support of the International Fund for Ireland, a marketing manager has been appointed jointly by the two tourist boards to promote over a three year period the Shannon-Erne Waterways as a major new tourism facility.  This initiative has already generated substantial interest from tour operators abroad, and it is expected that many foreign visitors will use the waterway when it is opened this year.</P>
    <P>The EU-funded INTERREG Programme is also assisting the promotion of tourism on a cross-Border basis.  One of the many assisted projects in the North West Passage, a new touring route between Dublin and the north-west developed by the relevant local authorities, which highlights the wide variety of interesting tourist facilities along its route.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to explore potential areas for future tourism co-operation in consultation with our Northern colleagues and our respective tourist boards, and every effort will be made to secure funding support for appropriate projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the distribution of national lottery grants is that, while as Minister for Finance, I have overall responsibility for the national lottery, the operation of the various national lottery-funded spending programmes is a matter for each of the Ministers concerned.  In relation to the lottery funds distributed by my Department, grants amounting to £635,540 were paid in the period 1989 to 1993 inclusive.  Apart from a grant for £250,000 paid to the Irish Institute for European Affairs in Louvain in 1992, included in the above, all other payments were to Gaeleagras na Séirbhise Poiblí. The Vote for the Office of Public Works also comes under my responsibility.  To end 1993, expenditure was £8.08 million, mainly for conservation works.</P>
      <P>Details of national lottery-funded allocations and the related outturn figures for the years in question are contained in the relevant Appropriation Accounts, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Expenditure patterns on national lottery-funded schemes depend on a number of factors such as the time required for approved projects to mature for payment, national lottery sales and the carry-over from one year to another of unspent allocations.  Such factors account for the differing overall expenditure levels in 1992 and 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of anticipated revenue from national lottery sales, allocations amounting to £88.242 million were published in the 1994 Abridged Estimates Volume.  In addition, provision for further national lottery-funded expenditure amounting to £5.1 million was made in the recent budget which brings the 1994 allocations to £93.342 million.  This is an <Col N="2026" /> increase over 1993 when the outturn was £89 million.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of deserted wife's benefit from my Department at a rate of £84.10 per week (including a fuel allowance) for herself and one dependent child.  She was awarded £35 per week maintenance under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 in the Circuit Court on 3 April 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions contained in Part IX of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 specify the obligation on people to maintain their spouses and children.  Under the legislation, where a marriage breakdown occurs and a family is dependent on a social welfare payment, the person who is liable to maintain that family must contribute to my Department towards the cost of the family's income support. This liability may be offset by the transfer to my Department of any maintenance <Col N="2027" /> payments which they are making to their spouse in compliance with an order of court.</P>
    <P>When the person concerned was awarded deserted wife's benefit her husband became liable to contribute to my Department towards that benefit. Because he is paying maintenance on foot of a court order the legislation requires that the moneys payable to the court must be transferred to my Department to offset his liability.  The first payment was received by my Department from the District Court at the beginning of February 1994.</P>
    <P>The ability of the husband of the person concerned to make further contributions to my Department will be assessed now in the light of his income and household circumstances.  The person concerned will continue to receive her deserted wife's benefit in full each week from my Department while she meets the qualifying conditions.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded widow's contributory pension in 1970.  She attained age 66 in December 1985.  However, she did not apply for an old age contributory pension until September 1993.  She was awarded an old age contributory pension at the maximum rate of £66.60 with effect from <Col N="2028" /> 25 June 1993&mdash; three months prior to the date of receipt of her application &mdash; plus appropriate fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations governing the old age contributory pension scheme, a person should apply for pension within three months of reaching age 66.  Where a late claim is made, the pension may be back-dated by three months.  Where the claimant provides good cause for the delay in submitting the claim payment may be back dated for a maximum period of six months prior to the date of claim.</P>
      <P>The person concerned qualified originally for widow's pension on the basis of her husband's insurance record.  She had no social insurance contributions in her own right prior to that time.  She worked for a number of years after she became a widow thereby building up sufficient insurance to qualify her for old age contributory pension in her own right.</P>
      <P>In view of the circumstances of this case I have arranged to back-date the award of old age contributory pension for six months prior to the date of her application &mdash; the maximum period allowed under legislation.  The additional arrears of pension will be issued to her shortly.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 22 month special beef premium on 11 animals on 22 June 1993. In his application he showed these 11 animals as having been born between February 1992 and May 1992.  As it was a requirement of the 22 month special beef premium scheme that animals be not less than 21 months old at time of application and as these animals were clearly not that old, 22 month premium could not be paid on them.</P>
      <P>In case the person named inadvertently applied for 22 month premium on these animals instead of the ten month premium, my Department is now processing the application further and any advance payment due will be made in the near future.  It is possible, however, that all of the animals may have received premium already, in which case no payment will fall to be made.</P>

Under the scheme, grants up to £1,750 are available towards the cost of milk refrigeration equipment and up to £500 for maintenance of milking machines, subject in both cases to a maximum of 50 per cent of actual cost. This scheme is operated under contract to my Department by ICOS, through its members, to whom any specific inquiries should be made.</P>
      <P>It is also my intention to provide assistance to farmers, in the next round of EU structural funds, to make the changes in on-farm structures necessary to comply with the requirements of the Directive. However, it will not be possible to finalise the details of this scheme pending conclusion of discussions with the EU Commission on the National Development Plan 1994-1999.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question on 28 October last, Bord Fáilte has responsibility for Tourism marketing generally and the establishment of the product development companies is therefore a matter for the board.</P>
      <P>During 1993, in response to the recommendations of the Government Task Force on Tourism and the Programme for Government, a number of Product Groups were formed following extensive consultation with the industry.  This partnership of Bord Fáilte and the industry, which to date has focused on marketing, will achieve a much greater awareness of Ireland in our target markets, and will significantly penetrate new markets.</P>
      <P>Eleven such groups are now in existence:</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that an assessment in 1992 of 63 primary schools in County Sligo by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland indicated that over half these schools had radon levels above the reference of 150 becquerels per cubic metre, while in other areas where similar assessments were carried out, only one-twentieth of the schools were above the reference level; that in a population-weighted survey of houses in County Sligo organised by the Physics Department of UCG the average radon levels recorded were twice the national average, with one house recording 1,342 becquerels per cubic metre of air as compared with a reference level of 200 above which the need for remedial action should be considered; that, in all, 16 per cent of the 25 houses where measurements were taken in County Sligo were above the 200 reference level; if, in view of all these findings in the limited surveys to date clearly indicating very significant radon levels right throughout County Sligo with the danger to health implicit in this and with obvious need for remedial action to be taken in houses as is now being undertaken in the schools surveyed, he will consider some special scheme or initiative which would lead to a general scheme of measurement for radon being undertaken and promoted for the county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>At the request of the Department of Education the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland offered free radon measurements to all primary and secondary schools in County Sligo.  This work was completed in June 1993.  All of the results are now available and these show that remediation work to reduce radon concentrations below the 150 Bq/m³ Reference Level for schools is necessary in one or more classrooms in 33 of the 62 primary schools and 10 of the 15 secondary schools surveyed.  The Department of Education was advised of the result and I understand that work is already in hand to reduce radon concentrations in these schools.</P>
      <P>The population-weighted survey, carried out by University College Dublin (not UCG) in the years 1984-1988 involved measurements of 25 houses. The mean value was 118 Bq/m³, with a range of 6-1342 Bq/m³.  The median value was 43 Bq/m³, compared with a national figure of 34 Bq/m³.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1992 the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland initiated a national geographical survey to compile data on radon measurements throughout Ireland.  Results will be compiled on the basis of the 10 × 10 km National Grid with a view to identifying areas at greatest <Col N="2043" /> risk from high radon levels.  On the basis of existing information County Sligo was identified as one of the priority areas for surveying.</P>
    <P>At present radon measurements are taking place, or will soon commence, in over 260 homes throughout County Sligo.  Because the measurement period is 12 months, final results are not expected before 1995 and only at that time will it be possible to identify the areas at greatest risk and in which radon preventive measures may be desirable in all future housing.</P>
