      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Ruud Lubbers, in the course of his official visit to Ireland on Monday, 11 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The visit, at my invitation, enabled Mr. Lubbers and myself to have bilateral talks on a wide range of matters of mutual concern.  Given our shared membership of the European Union, we devoted a considerable amount of our talks to issues of current concern within the Union. Specifically, in this regard, we discussed the follow-up to the European Commission's White Paper on Employment, the current round of enlargement of the Union, post-Maastricht development of the Union and relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  Our talks also covered international political issues including the political and security situation in Central and Eastern Europe, latest developments in Russia and the situation in the former-Yugoslavia, <Col N="894" /> Middle East and South Africa.  I also took the opportunity to brief Mr. Lubbers on the situation in Northern Ireland.  We also briefly touched upon the excellent bilateral relations between Ireland and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>Overall the talks were very useful and constructive and have reinforced the existing good relations between both countries.  The exchanges which we had on European Union affairs were particularly useful in the context of preparations for the meeting of the European Council in Corfu in June and indeed in the context of the major issues facing the Union up to and beyond 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied from his discussions that Ireland will retain its commissionership in the arrangements to revise the Treaties in 1996?  Did he discuss the adequacy of the Community's response to the situation in Bosnia?  Is he satisfied with that response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We both agreed that the institutional aspect of the Commission, voting rights and the blocking of issues by a majority, were matters for discussion at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  We were delighted that the existing 12 member states eventually agreed to that course of action and that efforts by some countries to reduce representation of small countries were not proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach did not hear my question; perhaps I did not put it correctly.  I was asking about Ireland's commissionership which is a different issue from voting rights at the Council of Ministers.  Was the question of small countries like Ireland having a Commissioner and being guaranteed one in the post-1996 arrangements discussed and, if so, is the Taoiseach confident that we will retain an Irish Commissioner in an enlarged Community of, say, 20 member states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy did not hear what I said.  This was part of the <Col N="895" /> overall discussion.  The historic balance between large and small countries has served the Community well.  We both agreed that this is an issue to be considered and agreed upon and we will be taking that position at the 1996 Conference. As to the overall position, we are agreed that small countries need to preserve the existing balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that in 1997 we will have an Irish Commissioner?  Is he further satisfied that the powers of the Commission will be preserved and not handed over to either the Parliament or the Council of Ministers in such a way as to be detrimental to the interests of a small country like Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking me to speculate on the outcome of the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  He knows my views and the strong stand I took in relation to any interference with the representation of small nations.  I insisted at all times that the agreement reached in Lisbon be upheld and that these matters should not be interfered with until the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Prime Minister Lubbers do any canvassing for the job of President of the Commission?  If so, what was the Taoiseach's response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that Mr. Lubbers made it abundantly clear on a number of occasions that while he remains Prime Minister he will not make comment one way or the other in regard to the succession race for President Delors' job.  That remains the position and, consequently, the need for my response did not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach have discussions with our Commissioner about who we might vote for as President of the Commission?  Will he agree that it would be important for a small country to back another small county's nominee?  On the <Col N="896" /> rotation of the Presidency, will the Government insist that the Presidency should rotate on an equal basis, even with enlargement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is opposed to rotating anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners will not be electing the President of the Commission.  We expect that matter to be decided at the summit in Corfu in June.  Consequently, it will be a matter for the Heads of Government to make that decision.  I will make my decision in the best interests of this country when I see who is in the field and there is no point in speculating beforehand.  Of course we will maintain a position that will give us the strongest possible representation in the new and enlarged Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland maintains close contact with both Hungary and Cyprus, although there are no immediate plans for meetings at Prime Ministerial level.  I had intended to make an official visit to Hungary in October 1993, but the visit had, sadly, to be postponed because of the ill-health of the then Prime Minister, the late Mr. Jozsef Antall.  The President visited Hungary in November 1993, while recent ministerial visits included visits by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, in March 1993; the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, in December 1993; the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment <Col N="897" /> in March of this year.  There have been regular contacts with Cyprus at Foreign Minister level in recent years, including in New York last September.</P>
    <P>These contacts are of course supplemented by the normal ongoing bilateral contacts at diplomatic level between Ireland and the countries in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in favour of Hungarian and Cypriot membership of the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish view, and indeed the view of Community members, is that we should expand the Community, accept members from central and eastern Europe as soon as their economies have reached a state which would enable them become full members and in the meantime maintain close contact with those countries and give them every assistance possible to become market economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach given consideration to how far east the Community should go?  For example, does he believe that countries of the CIS or former USSR are eligible for membership? Are the entry criteria for the European Union solely economic or are geographical considerations also borne in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions deal with Hungary and Cyprus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the economic criteria on which the Taoiseach would be able to decide on membership of Hungary and Cyprus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware of the criteria and process involved in this regard.  It is the general view of all members, including Ireland, that new members should be accepted, but I am sure the Deputy would agree that many states are not in a position to apply for full membership and it will be a long time before some of them are in that position. In the meantime, the Community is committed to giving them maximum support and assistance to help them along the <Col N="898" /> way because it is in the interests of the Community that Europe is solidified as much as possible and that the uncertainty and instability which exists is removed as soon as possible.  Nevertheless, it is pointless talking about accepting new members that are not yet ready to become full members, but the Community is always anxious to sign trade related agreements with such countries to assist them along the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider the present position in northern Cyprus and the possible relations with Turkey an obstacle to Cypriot membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having an extension of the question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a separate question. Nevertheless, I am sure Members will agree that every effort should be made to resolve the problems in northern Cyprus, but the Deputy is well aware that the Community will not get involved in that area at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House last week, the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is intended to bring the peace process to the next step consequent on a permanent cessation of violence.  It is my belief that a clear declaration to this end would enable the Forum to realise its maximum potential in the context of our efforts to achieve by agreement a durable peace and an equitable political settlement. A decision on peace is therefore required, so as to facilitate the full participation by all parties as set out in paragraphs ten and 11 of the declaration. Paragraph ten states of course that participation is open to all democratically mandated parties on this island, which show a clear commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and to the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 11 of the declaration makes clear that it would be open to the Forum to make recommendations on ways in which agreement and trust between both traditions can be promoted and secured. Its central purpose therefore would be to assist the process of healing the divisions among the people of this island.  In my speech to the Dáil on 17 December last, I set out in more detail my views on the purpose of the Forum.  I will consider carefully any points which the Opposition party leaders may put forward in the <Col N="900" /> course of their forthcoming meeting with the Tánaiste and myself, as well as the views of other prospective participants north of the Border.  I have already spoken in a preliminary way to the leaders of the SDLP and Alliance parties.</P>
    <P>On the question of possible meetings with the Unionist parties, the Tánaiste and I have made clear on many occasions our readiness to meet the Unionist party leaders, or any other Unionist politician, at any time and in any place.  Indeed, in the past few months, I met regularly with a number of leading representatives of the Unionist and Protestant community in the North.  I am firmly of the view that such direct discussions do enhance mutual understanding, and help to dispel any misconceptions which may exist.  The deeply-held and sincere views of either party are not prejudiced or undermined in any way by such dialogue.  Indeed, such contacts and discussions, direct or indirect, were an essential preliminary to the issuing of the Joint Declaration last December, and to its broadly positive reception across the community divide.  I was very glad Councillor Michael McGimpsey was able to address the Ógra Fianna Fáil annual conference on Saturday last.  His contribution was greatly appreciated by everyone present and, indeed, I gather that he described it as a valuable experience.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always made it clear that the political future of this island must be achieved by agreement and consent. The declaration removes any element of coercion from both communities and offers a new way to democratic progress.  Whether we are considering the realities of the present situation or long term goals, we have to recognise, as the <i>Irish News</i> expressed it in an editorial yesterday, that any new relationship &ldquo;will have to be copperfastened by a system of government in which one side guarantees protections for the rights of the other&rdquo;.  Simple majoritarianism, or the principle of winner takes all, just will not work any longer, <Col N="901" /> whether we are talking about the North today or any future accommodation that may be agreed in the much longer-term. This idea has also been expressed by the Tánaiste in the form of the proposal for a covenant of rights, which would apply equally in either situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I encourage the Taoiseach to make efforts to engage in dialogue with the leaders in Northern Ireland because it appears he may be somewhat out of touch with the thinking there.  Were leaders in Northern Ireland, particularly Unionist leaders, given any intimation of the contents of the speech he made in Malahide when he promised a 30 per cent Northern participation in a united Ireland?  On reflection, will he accept that the timing of his speech was inappropriate and may have been counterproductive? Having attended a conference in Northern Ireland over the weekend I know people there are concentrating on finding a solution to the immediate problem.  The Taoiseach should focus on establishing agreed structures which address reality rather than speculating on a possible future situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept I am out of touch with what people are saying in Northern Ireland.  I have regular contact with people there and meet people from various walks of life in both communities. One underlying point I made was that in any future form of government the notion that a majority can override minorities in either Northern Ireland or an all Ireland situation must be discarded. Another underlying point was that the principle of consent must be enshrined and that the use of coercion by either community in Northern Ireland is unacceptable.  That point was accepted by Sinn Féin at its Ard Fheis held in Dublin.  Those points were clearly made and no one would say they were made out of turn.  Is it suggested the debate must be rationalised in relation to what others may think?  This is an open debate and everyone should participate in it. No Member is suggesting the position is otherwise and we all fully supported the <Col N="902" /> Peace Declaration in Downing Street on 15 December.  The many legitimate political objectives and aspirations in it should be recognised by both communities. At the end of the day it is a matter for agreement and consent between the two communities as to what future accommodation can be worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that many people consider that speculating about the details of the composition of a Cabinet in a united Ireland &mdash; which he said was an eventuality he did not expect to live to see &mdash; is not the best use of time at this stage?  Will he agree that it would be better if he devoted his energies and speech-making to creating conditions for the resumption of dialogue between the parties in Northernb Ireland about issues upon which they can agree that might improve people's lives tomorrow and next week rather than focusing on a time midway through the next century?  That would be a more sensible emphasis and lead towards greater true reconciliation between the people living on this island rather than speculating on long term constitutional scenarios.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's response to the speech made on Saturday is in stark contrast to others.  I do not accept what he said in relation to it.  Every effort is being made in all directions to move the peace process forward and work is continuing between the two Governments in that regard.  The recent statement by Sir Patrick Mayhew was a contribution that may hopefully move the process along but it is too early to speculate about that now.  This is a matter for open debate.  I do not accept what Deputy Bruton is trying to insinuate, that somebody should determine what I should say and when I should say it. I make the judgments and nobody can accuse me of being ungenerous in dealing with the situation.  Dr. Martin Smyth referred to that speech as a sign of generosity, which is far removed from <Col N="903" /> what Deputy Bruton is trying to insinuate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that if he makes a statement of this nature it is liable to be interpreted in a particular way?  Did he consult with the Tánaiste before making this proposal?  Is it a Government view or only the view of Fianna Fáil?  Will he agree that there are many urgent matters, including the treatment of the Irish language on road signs and in school in Northern Ireland, the treatment of Nationalist youths by the security forces and the adequacy of the complaints procedures in regard to the police and security forces affecting Nationalists, and that Nationalists and Unionists should meet to solve those problems?  Rather than concentrating on long term constitutional issues on which inevitably people disagree we should concentrate on solving today's problems on which agreement is possible.  The approach should be one of confidence building through small agreements rather than waiting for the ultimate Holy Grail of a comprehensive, all-embracing agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to analyse what Deputy Bruton said in the light of his full blooded support for the declaration on a number of occasions when the legitimate objectives of both communities were taken into account.  I do not understand at this stage why an approach mentioning those should be discarded. <Col N="904" /> We are well aware of the Nationalist nightmare in the North of Ireland and of the fears of both communities and how we must approach them.  It is important to let them know how we consider power should be shared in the North of Ireland and in the rest of Ireland.  I have always held the view that one should not ask someone else to do something one is not prepared to do.  It is important to signify that view at a time when the Unionist party is saying it is only interested in talking about an internal settlement.  If its view of such a settlement is a return to the old Stormont days, it is important to point out that the days of &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo; are past.  I stand over my views in that regard.  Those views have been accepted by many people, perhaps not by Deputy Bruton but he may come around to my way of thinking at a future date.  I am not prepared to believe, as Deputy Bruton may be, that an internal settlement will give the stability and peace we require on this island.  I definitely believe it will not.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify that matter.  The Taoiseach seems to be saying that a prerequisite for the establishment of the forum is a cessation of violence.  If that is the case the forum will not be established.  We are giving Sinn Féin a veto to prevent the establishment of the forum.  Rather than putting forward unreal proposals the Taoiseach should move ahead with practical proposals such as the establishment of the forum and proposals from the Government on North-South institutions.</P>

      <P>I would like clarification on one aspect of the Taoiseach's remarks in Cork on Friday night, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday <Col N="906" /> last.  The Taoiseach said that the peace process could be moved forward if the British Government agreed to clarify for Sinn Féin the Joint Declaration.  Does the Taoiseach believe there is something missing in the clarification process? Would he agree it would be better, in pushing forward the peace process, for both Governments to be seen, at least in public, to be on the one word?</P>

I have also said I would not in any circumstances contemplate a renegotiation of the Joint Declaration and anything that amounts to such a renegotiation will not be supported by me.

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree it is perfectly rational to proceed on foot of the Downing Street Joint Declaration first to achieve peace by the abandonment of violence on the part of the paramilitaries involved and second to move into the talks process via the forum and talks with all parties?  There is nothing incompatible in proceeding in <Col N="907" /> these two directions at the same time. Would the Taoiseach agree it is evident that, in order to achieve accommodation which we all wish between the traditions on this island, there must be partnership at regional government and administration level and at overall island government and administration level and that partnership or power-sharing involves give and take between the two traditions?  That is consistent with what the Taoiseach advanced in his speech on Saturday, with seeking to achieve a sharing of responsibility, which will be essential to the talks process, the abandonment of violence and the achievement of peace.  The eventual conclusion will be reached within a framework which caters for the two traditions in partnership with a sharing of responsibilities between the representatives of the two traditions at regional and overall island level.</P>

Would he consider inviting Jim Molyneaux, as a leader of the Unionist people in Northern Ireland, to address the Dáil?  The Taoiseach seems to believe in consensus government &mdash; he is talking about partnership &mdash; but would it not be better for him to confess that he believes explicitly in power sharing rather than promise a show boy performance by involving all parties in partnership Government on this side of the Border and asking Unionists whether they want to be part of this <Col N="908" /> process?

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>the responsibility she has for the proposed syllabus changes for junior and leaving certificate examinations which are to be introduced in September 1995; and the effect these changes will have on students, teachers and parents.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My responsibility as Minister for Education is to lay down the policy parameters within which syllabus changes take place.  Changes in the curriculum are arranged in conjunction with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and with the National Council for Vocational Awards.  The Department of Education provides the necessary support and facilities for the implementation of syllabus change such as an in-career development programme for teachers, suitable arrangements for assessment and certification and appropriate accommodation and other resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revised junior cycle syllabi have already been introduced for the junior certificate examination.  The senior cycle is being re-structured on a phased basis to provide, within a three-year cycle, the option of a Transition Year Programme to all schools from 1994 and a two-year leaving certificate with three orientations, that is, a revised and expanded <Col N="910" /> leaving certificate vocational programme, available from September 1995, a new leaving certificate applied programme &mdash; LCAP &mdash; to be introduced in September 1994, and the standard leaving certificates programme for which revised syllabi will be introduced in nine subjects in September 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that there will be nine syllabi-changes from September 1995 and that there is a huge cost involved in the purchase of school books.  It costs a leaving certificate student approximately £150 to purchase books.  The Minister is authorising nine changes in September 1995 and this will place a huge burden on the parents involved.  Does the Minister intend to put forward any proposals to reduce this burden?  Surely these nine changes could have been phased in so that the burden of purchasing new books would not be imposed all at once?  I recall from my school days that books were passed on, in many instances, from one generation to the next.  Today books tend to change frequently.  Will the Minister outline her proposals to ease the huge cost burden that will have to be met by parents from September 1995?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Statements made by Deputy McGrath on this matter surprised me.  Rather than frighten parents who are concerned &mdash; we agree on this &mdash; about the cost burden, the Deputy should have made inquiries as to what will happen. The overall revision of the leaving certificate subjects began in 1992.  A plan of work was approved by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, which has a representative from the National Parents Council, and it is aware of the phasing in of the changes.  There has been no review of the nine phase 1 subjects for 20 years and, for example, there has never been a change in the accounting syllabus.  The changes in Gaeilge were proposed in the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in the four modern languages are combined to arrangements for the assessment of pupils and related <Col N="911" /> teaching materials.  The overall revision for the leaving certificates, which has to be welcomed, is one of the good news stories from the Department of Education. We are looking for a continuity programme in the junior certificate syllabus and a development in the leaving certificate curriculum that would be relevant to the needs of all pupils.  Following the initial briefing with the NCCA and the Irish education publishers, no new textbooks will be required in five of the nine phase 1 subjects, namely, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Physics. The position in regard to Chemistry is unclear but if new textbooks are required in this subject, I will inform the Deputy. There are 31 subjects in the leaving certificate and I would suggest a phased revision of syllabi to take place in an orderly and planned way so that we can minimise, for all concerned, the costs associated with periodic revisions of the curriculum.  We are talking about the beginning of a phase, which includes those five or six subjects not requiring new textbooks, that will not take place until September 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the Minister mislead the House, and I do not believe she would wish to do that, two subjects in particular have had curriculum changes in the past four years and not 20 years as the Minister indicated in her reply.  Also, the subjects to which the Minister referred are the minority subjects; she did not refer to Irish and English, which are subjects taken by 50,000 students, and the additional costs that will be imposed on those students because of the curriculum changes.</P>

The membership of the School Books Review Committee includes parents, publishers, teachers and management.  It will not only seek to review and discuss the contents of school books coming on the market, but will also address the question of value for money.  I share the Deputy's concern about value for money but I do not want to temper that concern by suggesting that changes in the syllabus should not be implemented because there may be an extra cost imposed on parents.  These changes, which began in 1992, are taking place on a phased basis.  Accountancy is the subject that has not undergone any change in 20 years.  There has been much planning with the teachers and management and through the NCCA, with the parents.</P>

I am satisfied that, in general, these schools are providing a good education for the children concerned and constitute an important part of rural life and of the educational system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard it as essential that there be smaller numbers in multi-grade classes and my Department recognises this fact in providing for a reduced maximum for these classes.  I am aware, however, that, in view of such factors as &mdash; the declining pupil population at primary level, the provision of specialist services, such as remedial teaching, within schools and the expectations of parents that their children should receive the optimum education <Col N="913" /> at primary level, there will be cases where the rationalisation of smaller schools into larger units will arise for consideration by my Department.  My Department is committed to examining each such case on its merits, taking into account educational, social and economic factors and in the light of consultation with management, parents and teachers. In any such examinations great importance will be attached to the views of the local community.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Cuirim fáilte roimh an dearcadh sin, I am glad the Minister is adopting a positive attitude towards smaller schools because they do excellent work.  Where a school might be one short in September, and with the future trend rising, will the Minister accept that if a new principal is employed in a three teacher school resulting in one of the long-serving assistant principals losing a job, rigidly adhering to the number requirements in such a case may not be in the best interests of either the children or the teachers in that school?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Rigidly adhering to specific numbers is not something with which I would like to be associated. There has been reduction this year in the pupil-teacher ratio.  Where 39 pupils were required in 1993-94, only 37 pupils are now required.  In the case of two consecutive grades, where 37 pupils were required for 1993-94, 36 pupils are now required.  Where 35 pupils were required in multi-grade classes in 1993-94, only 33 pupils are required for 1994-95.  Not only do the larger schools benefit from the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio, but there is a recognition that we should remove as much burden from the teachers as possible, particularly in the multi-grade classrooms in one and two teacher schools.  In recognition of that, I was pleased to announce those changes for 1994-95.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I welcome any reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio but I ask the Minister to take special <Col N="914" /> note of situations where the shortage of one pupil in the quota can lead to a reduction in staff in a three teacher school and cause much inconvenience.  Where a two teacher school is closed down and a bus service is provided to another school that can lead to much inconvenience and expense, as the Minister of State will understand.</P>

      <P>We all must realise that there has been a dramatic reduction in the school population, particularly at primary level.  Major rationalisation took place following an OECD report in 1960. At a recent convention, the issue of school rationalisation was addressed.</P>
      <P>People were concerned that we should meet pupils' needs.  There was an interesting discussion about the need to have a school which was viable in terms of numbers and in providing for the needs of different children.  I am conscious of the positive effects on a community of having a primary school but we must recognise that there has been a dramatic fall in the number of primary school pupils.  While the Department will not rush in to close schools many issues must be taken into account.  The benefits I have been able to establish by reducing the pupil-teacher ratio while keeping 700 teachers in the system was as a result of the reduction in the number of primary school pupils.</P>

      <P>The composition of the group is as follows: a primary inspector from the Department of Education who will chair the group; a senior psychologist from the Department of Education; two parents, one each from the National Parents' Council &mdash; Primary and the National Parents' Council &mdash; Post-Primary; four teachers, one of whom is vice-chairperson of the NCCA, one of whom was a project officer during a previous initiative on relationships and sex education in the 1980s, one who is extensively involved in providing courses in this area and one of whom has worked with the North Western Health Board in this area.  I expect the group to report within two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interests of making progress without delay on this important and urgent issue, I have now decided to proceed <Col N="916" /> with the establishment of the expert group under the aegis of the Department.</P>
    <P>It is not and has not been my wish or intention to exclude parents, teachers or school managements from involvement in this initiative.  The work of the expert group is one part of a process.  Representatives of the teacher unions have not been included in the membership of the committee as I consider that a small expert group as proposed is the most appropriate one for this stage of the process. The NCCA, which is representative of all the major partners in education, will have an opportunity of considering and expressing its views on the report of the expert group.  Further stages of the process will involve consultation to encourage everyone involved in this most important area to play their part in full.</P>

      <P>We should welcome that the difficulties regarding the sex and relationship programmes in our schools are recognised.  Will the Minister agree that some difficulties might have been circumvented if she had included representatives of the unions and management of schools?  When will the programme be implemented in schools and will be compulsory?  She said the committee will report within two months.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for recognising that there may be difficulties in this area.  There is much disparate activity in this area and I thought I could expedite matters by involving the expertise I mentioned in a committee.  I will then involve the NCCA in the process. There is always much discussion when setting up a committee which is representative.  Seven people already sit on a committee.  It is open to any Minister to take the course of having expertise available in an internal committee which is not representative.  By inviting those people to serve on this committee I felt I could tap in to some of the work already done and to the experience of those members.  I hope to be in a position to move forward by the autumn.  I expect the committee to keep to the two month timetable and I will then ask the representative <Col N="917" /> council available to me as Minister to discuss that brief.</P>

The Minister is aware of the difficulties and the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of programmes engaged in by schools.  The Minister is misguided in not involving the unions. Will she agree the INTO led the way on gender equity and that it would have been valuable to involve them as a coordinating body?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if it has been the policy of her Department in recent years to reduce the number of pupils attending seventh class/repeat sixth class in primary schools; her views on this policy; and if she sees any merit in a pupil attending such a class.</Quest>

      <P>The primary school curriculum is designed to enable pupils to complete the primary cycle in eight years.  The normal position is that a pupil is promoted to a higher standard at the end of each school year and enrolled in a post-primary school after completing sixth standard.  In some circumstances it may be desirable that a pupil be retained in a class for a second year.  However, the number of such cases should be small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has become aware in recent years that a small number of <Col N="918" /> schools are conducting repeat sixth or seventh classes.  My policy is that such classes should be phased out in agreement with the boards of management of the schools.</P>
    <P>Where learning difficulties are identified in children they should be dealt with as early as possible and retention for a second year in any class is not usually an effective solution.  On the rare occasions where pupils must be retained, the retention should take place in the lower classes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has reechoed the contents of a 1967 circular. Surely the thinking in 1967 is now very much outdated.  Is she aware that the number of children in seventh class, or repeat sixth class, has more than halved during the last seven years for which figures are available?  A very small proportion of school children &mdash; approximately 1-1.5 per cent &mdash; are allowed to repeat sixth class.  Pupils who are not mature enough to attend secondary school and may not be able to cope with ten or 12 different teachers may need to spend time in seventh class. Will the Minister agree that an extra year in seventh class or repeat sixth class would be of benefit to such students, not only in secondary school but throughout the rest of their lives?</P>
      <P>The decision made by the teachers and parents, in consultation, about whether a child should repeat sixth class should be respected by the Department.  If the parents and teachers decide that a child would benefit from spending a year in seventh class the Department should not use the heavy hand and say that this cannot be allowed and the child must proceed to secondary school.</P>

      <P>We are moving towards a three-year cycle for leaving certificate students.  Approximately 4 per cent of students spend an extra year in sixth class.  There is no seventh class; it is sixth class.  Children who have been hospitalised or have suffered from a long illness can be accommodated on an individual basis.  It has been the practice to request pupils who have not achieved a certain academic standard to spend another year in sixth class.  This does not develop the full potential of a child with a certain level of academic maturity.  The practice whereby 4 per cent of students repeat sixth class will be phased out over the next two years.  The teachers who will be released as a consequence will probably be available in the system for the remaining 96 per cent of pupils who leave primary school after sixth class. These students will enter a very different second level educational environment from the one which pertained in 1967.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>I hope the House will bear with me if my reply is rather lengthy &mdash; this is the first opportunity I have had to refer in the House to the report on truancy.</P>
      <P>A working group in my Department has presented me with the &ldquo;School Attendance/Truancy Report&rdquo; which I published on 8 April 1994.  I ensured that copies of the report were provided to the Dáil Library and will be happy to make further copies available to the Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>School attendance figures quoted in the report for children aged six to 15 in Dublin city for the school year 1992-93 indicate an average non-attendance rate of 7 per cent.  This is in line with the equivalent national rate which has been estimated at approximately 30,000 pupils per day.  The data available is for school attendance in total and does not differentiate <Col N="921" /> between the varying causes of absence from school.</P>
    <P>The report notes that there is a tendency among commentators to categorise all non-attendance problems as truancy, a term which fails to acknowledge the complex nature of non-attendance problems and the possible underlying causes. The more serious form of non-attendance which we term truancy involves premeditated action on the part of pupils in absenting themselves from school for casual or extended periods.</P>
    <P>The report accepts that truancy ultimately may be linked to problems relating to family, peer pressure, juvenile crime or school-related difficulties.  The unanimous view emerging from the working group's discussions with relevant agencies and interest groups is that in the vast majority of cases, serious non-attendance is linked to disadvantage.  The experience of school attendance officers is that the problem of truancy or persistent non-attendance at school is concentrated in areas of economic and social disadvantage where families are experiencing complex and difficult problems, often centred on issues of poverty and relationships.  There is no evidence to suggest that class size or the quality of school accommodation exacerbates the problem.</P>
    <P>The report acknowledges that home/school community liaison teachers may intervene with and support families where the children's school attendance is a problem.  In recognition of the value of this scheme in enhancing educational participation of young people, I have in the current school year placed this scheme, which had been operating on a pilot basis since 1990, on a formal footing within the educational system.</P>
    <P>I have also taken a number of initiatives to target areas of disadvantage and the report acknowledges that additional teachers and resources allocated to schools in disadvantaged areas has assisted them in meeting the needs of socially disadvantaged children.  I also believe that a school psychological service can play an important role in this area and I recently announced the <Col N="922" /> appointment of an additional ten psychologists as part of the phased implementation of a national psychological service for primary schools.</P>
    <P>The report provides a basis on which I can frame new legislation and develop new structures and procedures to reflect modern thinking on social, cultural and educational issues.  The issues raised in the report are complex and are of fundamental concern to all those concerned with the education and the welfare of children and I know that Deputies will read the report with interest.  I am anxious to tap the knowledge and expertise of all relevant interests in developing my proposals on school attendance and to this end I am making the report widely available and encouraging all interested groups to submit their considered views on the report's contents to my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the extent of the problem, particularly in Dublin city, is totally unacceptable? While the average of 7 per cent is unacceptable, it should be remembered that the percentage of children on the streets in disadvantaged areas is much greater.  While the Minister indicated that truancy is concentrated in disadvantaged areas will she agree that the recently appointed schools attendance officers appointed in Dublin face an impossible task because of years of neglect?  Will she also agree that most of the children not attending school but remaining on the inner city streets and other areas of the city will not be reached but will become the victims of crime, drugs and other forms of abuse?  Does the Minister accept that the only way in which to respond to a massive social problem &mdash; I observe it on the streets even driving to this House at 10 o'clock in the morning, when I see young children who should be at school out on the streets in my constituency &mdash; is through the provision of adequate numbers of home-school-community liaison teachers, child care workers and to the INTO survey of schools which they consider to be seriously substandard? Many schools in my constituency are <Col N="923" /> badly affected, they have not had school attendance officers and a huge number of children are not attending&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Gregory.  My office is in Marlborough Street and if I walk on O'Connell Street I meet children who should be at school. I fully realise they are my responsibility and I welcome the availability of this report.  I have taken measures to alleviate disadvantage.  Although this report said there is no specific evidence to demonstrate that school buildings exacerbate the problem, it does not take from the fact that we need to invest in the primary schools' building programme, which I am doing.  I welcome the appointment by Dublin Corporation of school attendance officers within the past week.  In addition to my programme to combat disadvantage it is suggested in the &ldquo;School Attendance/Truancy Report&rdquo; that legislation should be introduced, the provisions of which would recognise the real social problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister committed to equality of educational advantage? If so, surely she agrees there is a need not merely to talk about or give commitments to it &mdash; one might almost say devote lip service to &mdash; but to concentrate on home-school-community liaison teachers, child care workers and additional staffing in the schools most directly affected in disadvantaged areas, many of which ask the Minister continuously to retain staff members so that they will not lose already inadequate staffing numbers?  Surely there is a need to re-examine and concentrate on such <Col N="924" /> schools, providing them with the resources and staff they so badly need?</P>

      <P>I do not merely pay lip service to such problems; I ask the Deputy to withdraw that accusation. Indeed I have a record which has drawn criticism from other sections of the House of over concentrating on disadvantage. Therefore, it is fair to outline areas to which I allocated resources, which have not been readily available to this Government, to be channelled towards education, now being specifically targeted at disadvantaged areas, including the announcement of the 15 new home-school-community liaison teachers, extension of the designation of disadvantaged schools under which an additional 50 schools will be so classified and the capital programme which sets out a clear scale of priorities.  There was a programme of action last year and another is under way this year.  There has been a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio, the appointment of 100 additional remedial teachers and a disadvantage fund increased by 40 per cent.  I will continue to be very proud of the record of this Government in that we are prepared to take disadvantaged areas and target resources at them so that we can cherish all the children of this nation equally.</P>

      <P>How many prosecutions were there last year under the existing school attendance legislation? Furthermore, will the Minister agree that the School Attendance Act, 1926, is hopelessly outdated in terms of the penalties it provides and in its powers generally? They deal merely with the areas defined at that time whereas there are now huge, sprawling suburbs of this city with unemployment of frightening proportions and social problems.  There are no recreational facilities and, as Deputy Gregory rightly said, many &ldquo;Fagins&rdquo; are bred on the streets simply because there is no follow-up of school attendance.</P>

      <P>I do not know how many prosecutions there were in the past year but I will ascertain the figure and <Col N="925" /> convey it to the Deputy.  There is recognition that the school attendance legislation is totally outdated.  That is why I welcome the presentation of this School Attendance Truancy report, not only its recognition of the fact that there are different types of school absences but, with specific regard to truancy, that the areas of greatest disadvantage are also those that appear to suffer most.  There is also in the report a suggestion of where legislative changes are needed.  I assure the House that I will be introducing legislation, allowing me to put through a legislative programme to protect the children who are our responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister a timescale for the introduction of new legislation? What is her view of the role of the Garda in relation to school attendance? For example, does she consider it appropriate that the Garda, however well meaning they may be, should undertake that role?  Will she accommodate those areas that should have a school attendance officer &mdash; where none has been appointed to date &mdash; and where the Garda must fulfil this role?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect to introduce interesting amending legislation if not this year, certainly next year which will be warranted arising out of the White Paper on Education.  The Deputy may be referring to areas of mutual constituency interest at present excluded from the provision of a schools attendance officer. Nonetheless, it is possible for the local authority concerned to request my Department to extend the remit in that neither the Garda nor my Department consider that the role they are expected to fulfil at present is one that meets the social problems resulting in truancy on the part of the children involved.  In this respect I would welcome Deputy Keogh's response to the &ldquo;School Attendance/Truancy Report&rdquo;.  I should be glad also if those who have been dealing piecemeal with this outdated legislation would avail of my invitation to respond to this report, which will form part of the <Col N="926" /> legislative review and amending legislation I will be introducing.</P>

Is the Minister aware that buildings in the ownership of Galway County Council could be made available for a college of music?  Is she aware that children from Galway City and county who wish to pursue a career in music have to go to Cork, Dublin or Waterford?

In 1982 and in 1983 the Department was again involved.  A music programme began in 1985.  In 1989 the chief executive officer informed the Department that there were severe financial difficulties with the Galway music scheme and that they were not in a position to continue with it.  In 1992, my predecessor, Deputy Séamus Brennan, replied to Deputy Molloy saying there were no plans for the establishment of a school of music in Galway.

On average 800 students per annum apply to the CAO/CAS for entry to the college of music, less than one-sixth of whom gain entry.  It is not clear, therefore, that <Col N="928" /> there is an urgent need for an additional college or school of music, particularly in the west, in view of the fact that the other provinces appear to be catered for?</P>

It is on the edge of that rich reservoir of traditional music in Clare.  It is the gateway to Connemara and it has many successful cultural movements, such as, Music for Galway, Macnas, Druid, the Taibhdhearc and so on.  Given the particular ambience in Galway and in view of the possibility of jobs in music, a whole new Celtic music centre could be created in Galway, making it the Celtic capital of the world and complementing that unique ambience that is part and parcel of the scene in Galway.</P>

      <P>As the primary educators, parents have a critical role to play in their children's education.  This is underpinned by the provisions of Article 42.1 of the Constitution.  The parents' critical role is reflected on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Paragraph 6.45 of the Programme provides that a central concern of the reform of the education system will be the constitutional prerogatives of parents in relation to the education of their children. The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> also provides that support for parents in relation to the education of their children.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> also provides that support for parent's participation at primary and post-primary levels of the education system will be continued through funding of the National Parents Council's parent development programmes and dissemination of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures already taken or encouraged by my Department to enhance the role of parents in their children's education include: &mdash; the setting up of the National Parents' Council to facilitate participation by parents in consultations with Government about the development of educational policies and the payment of an annual grant towards the expenses of the council; representation of parents on the boards of management of schools; the establishment of parents' associations in schools; the development of home / school / community liaison schemes; the provision of programmes aimed at facilitating parents' participation and involvement in their children's educational development; representation of parents on the senior cycle re-structuring external monitoring committee; involvement of parents in the National Education Convention; the grant payable to each of the two tiers of <Col N="931" /> the National Parents Council &mdash; primary and post-primary &mdash; have been increased from £25,000 to £30,000 this year.</P>
    <P>A number of further initiatives in relation to parental involvement are proposed in the context of the reform of the education system, viz., the inclusion of a formal home/school liaison policy in each school's plan; close consultation with parents in the development of each school's behaviour and discipline policies; regular formal meetings between parents and school management and the establishment by boards of management of procedures through which individual parents can receive full information from schools on all aspects of their children's progress.</P>
    <P>The position paper on regional education councils which I issued recently proposed that parents be represented on such councils.  The position of parents must also be recognised in regard to representation on the boards of management of schools.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that recent controversies suggest that she is either trampling on the rights of parents or, at least, is giving the impression that she is prepared to do so?  Does she accept that parents are the natural and primary educators of their children?  In that context does she also accept that under the Constitution the State must respect the lawful preference of parents about the type of schools to which their children are sent and, furthermore, that in the provision of educational institutions the State must have due regard to the rights of parents? Taking into account these constitutional requirements, does she agree that her recent decisions seem to suggest that she is prepared &mdash; to put it bluntly &mdash; arrogantly to abrogate those rights of parents?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that even in the terminology she uses, e.g. her reference to the role that she &ldquo;has allowed parents to play ... in decisions,&rdquo; indicates an approach that does not accept parents as the primary educators of their children?  Is it not the reverse &mdash; that parents allow Ministers and others to take steps on their behalf and that it is not for the Minister under the Constitution, to be &ldquo;allowing&rdquo; parents that role?  Second, would the Minister agree that her recent decision in the case of Dunboyne displays an absolute disregard for the rights of parents in the matter of choice of school for their children? How can she square that with the position under the Constitution?</P>

      <P>The Department of Education and the Minister have an obligation to make education available to parents for their children.  However, we do not have a responsibility to meet the individual wishes of each parent as to the kind of education in which they wish their child to participate.  Our obligation is to ensure that education is available.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, the Department of Education, in recent years has increased the voice of parents in the schools, beginning with the boards of management, the formation of parents' associations and the establishment of proper links between parents, boards of management and the teachers and by making funding available to the National Parents Councils at primary and post-primary levels thereby ensuring that parents have a viable body to act on their behalf.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes decisions on the kind of education that is made available. Different groups of parents have different viewpoints.  There is not always the united voice.  The Minister's decision is taken in the light of all the information available to ensure that the moneys invested will be available, and transparently so, to the community generally and not to sectional interests only.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In reaching decisions should the Minister not recognise the views of the community generally?  The matter to be debated later this evening is a case in point?  I was very concerned about the terminology the Minister has used.  In saying that she has &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; parents to play a role she is sending out the wrong signals.  There has been controversy about certain decisions that have been made and in that context I do not think it is good enough to look in that light on the role of parents.  Perhaps it was a lapse on the Ministers part, but was it appropriate language?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Breathnach Ms Breathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Breathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly withdraw the word &ldquo;allow&rdquo; if it in any way seems to diminish the role parents are playing, a role which I have publicly acknowledged particularly since the National Education Convention.  When I address public meetings and talk about the partners in education I am recognising the voice of parents.  Many of us were at school at a time when parents stayed outside the school gate but I hope that people will remember my time in the Department of Education as the Minister who opened the school gate.  If my use of words suggested any diminution of the role of parents as partners in education, that was not intended.  I used the phrase in question with a generosity of spirit to invite parents to play their role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate later this evening should prove interesting.  I have given parents a role within the schools on the parents' associations and with their representation on the boards of management. One will find that within any group, whether managerial or teachers, there can be differences of opinion. When making a decision I have to satisfy <Col N="934" /> myself that I have taken note of what people have said.  I have to make sure that I am conscious of the needs of the community and that the investment of public moneys will be of long term benefit to the community.  If I can satisfy myself that I have listened to all the voices, I am confident that the decisions I have taken have been taken in the best interest of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister has unreservedly withdrawn the most unfortunate phrase in question.  The major point at issue is whether having given parents a role she listens to what they have to say and accepts the decision of the majority.  Later we will be debating the issue of Dunboyne, where the case is very much the opposite.  The Minister refers to minority opinions that may not surface but how does she assess these opinions and what type of meetings or communications are set up to access what parents want?  Having ascertained the various opinions, is it the minority or the majority view that is taken on board?</P>

Since my appointment all the information I have sought, whether in relation to building or some other projects, has been made available to me thereby enabling me to reach what I consider the best possible decisions.</P>

      <P>As stated in my announcement on the 1994 Education <Col N="935" /> budget, I propose to allocate 15 additional co-ordinator posts to the Home-School-Community liaison service at primary level with effect from September next.  These extra posts will facilitate a significant expansion of the service and the schools to be targeted will be selected from among those already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and as such, has been allocated two concessionary teaching posts. It also receives additional capitation funding at a rate of £17 per pupil.</P>

What impact will the appointment of an extra 15 home-school liaison teachers have given that it has been stated in recent reports that 30,000 children are absent from school every day?  While I do not expect the Minister to give a commitment will she consider visiting this school to speak to the staff and the children when she will be made aware, despite the extra teachers, of the difficulties they are encountering and of the fact that they genuinely need to retain existing staff and the additional services of a home school liaison teacher?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the school is included in the disadvantaged areas scheme it deserves all the help it has been given.  If I was in a position to allocate an extra 50 co-ordinator posts to the home-school community liaison service I have no doubt 250 schools would be seeking the services of a home-school liaison teacher.  The scheme has been operating on a temporary basis but it is recognised as part of the education service.  I will not be in a position to say before the end of May if this or any other school will be allocated a home school liaison teacher. I am confident that the extra 15 posts will be allocated to the schools most in need of their services.  I will take an opportunity to visit the school if I am passing Goldenbridge but I will let the Deputy know.  I intend to continue to expand the home-school community liaison service given that it plays an important role in building the confidence of children who come from families who need our support. As long as I am Minister for Education, the service will continue to have my full support.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper &mdash;&ldquo;Education for A Changing World&rdquo;&mdash; stated that where the establishment of multi-denominational schools represents the wishes of the parents, and where such schools can be justified on the basis of demand, the Department of Education will facilitate and support the establishment of such schools on the same terms as those available for the establishment of denominational schools.  I am committed to that policy.</P>
      <P>The practice has been that capital funds for the provision of a multi-denominational school, or an all-Irish school, have not been provided unless it is shown that there is sufficient demand to support a viable school and that the demand is likely to be permanent.  In the case of such schools there is a period of provisional recognition during which time the school proves itself.</P>
      <P>When my Department is satisfied of the likely permanent nature of a multi-denominational school, that school is eligible for capital funding on the same basis as other national schools.  I am aware that this particular practice has created difficulties for those wishing to establish multi-denominational schools as does the necessity for them to provide the sites for the schools.</P>
      <P>These issues were addressed in the recent report of the National Education Convention.  The report made a number of recommendations in this regard and these will be examined by my Department.</P>
      <P>In the case of grants to meet the running costs of schools multi-denominational schools are treated in the same way as the generality of national schools.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper suggested a review of the current funding for all schools, including multi-denominational primary schools.  This matter is being considered in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Education.</P>

      <P>The school transport scheme was designed to provide a basic service for all eligible children who might, otherwise, find it difficult to attend school regularly.  It was not designed to provide a door-to-door service.  Arrangements exist to accommodate <Col N="939" /> ineligible children on State services on a fee paying basis where it is possible to do this without additional costs.</P>
      <P>It would be a further step to extend existing transport services in order to provide an enhanced service for pupils whether eligible or ineligible.  The fact that parents or school authorities would be prepared to pay for this would not in itself be acceptable because there would be other parents or school authorities who could not afford to do so.  Accordingly, such arrangements would be discriminatory, on the one hand, and administratively unworkable, on the other hand.  Parents are free to make their own private transport arrangements for their children to and from school provided that this service is not paid for out of State funds.</P>

      <P>This question relates to the three post-primary schools in Youghal, County Cork which serve west Waterford and east Cork.  The children who use the post-primary school transport service are not let off at a central point, they are let off outside one of the schools.  The children who attend the other two schools have to walk approximately one mile up a steep hill to reach them.  One of these schools is prepared to pay the cost involved of extending the service.  Will the Minister agree to extend that service? The names of the two laneways that have to be traversed to get to the schools in question are Windmill Lane and Poison Bush Lane.  The Minister could hardly forget those.  Youghal is the town of Sir Walter Raleigh, who was known for his chivalrous deeds for Queen Elizabeth I. I would like the Minister to be chivalrous and show compassion for children who have to carry school books a mile uphill. It is hard labour and it is not fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer these four questions together.  I fully <Col N="941" /> share the Deputies' concerns regarding the brutal attack on Gorazde.  The town continues to be shelled by Bosnian Serb artillery and also is subject to small arms fire.  UNHCR report that conditions in Gorazde are desperate.  The hospital has been hit by artillery fire and people are sheltering in the basements of their homes.  The population of the town has been swollen by an influx of refugees from the villages in the Gorazde pocket which have fallen to the Bosnian Serbs over the last ten days.  The lives of aid workers, including two Irish citizens working with UNHCR, have been jeopardised by the Bosnian Serb assault.  I utterly condemn these vicious actions, which are further flagrant violations of international humanitarian law.</P>
      <P>Gorazde is one of six towns which were declared safe areas by the UN Security Council last year.  Last week, in light of the threats to the lives of UN personnel in Gorazde, close air support was provided by NATO forces at the request of the Secretary General in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.  Deputies will be aware that last night the UN Secretary General requested NATO to make available to the United Nations the capacity to launch air-strikes to achieve the specific objectives of the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.</P>
      <P>The brutal actions of the Bosnian Serbs against Gorazde which have, to date, left over 300 dead and over 1,000 seriously wounded, also represent a substantial setback for the peace process.  This is a great tragedy, given that much progress had been made in recent weeks.  Sarajevo is no longer being shelled and the war between Croats and Muslims in Central Bosnia has been ended.  European Union Foreign Ministers, at their meeting in Luxembourg yesterday, condemned the continuing Bosnian Serb attacks on Gorazde, and demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, the withdrawal of Bosnian Serbs from the vicinity of Gorazde, and the lifting of all obstructions which have been placed in UNPROFOR's path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers stressed, in particular, the <Col N="942" /> need for an intensive and co-ordinated effort by the international community, involving the EU, UN, United States and Russia, to relaunch the negotiations on the basis of the EU plan of action which has been accepted by all of the parties.</P>
    <P>Discussions yesterday confirmed that a settlement cannot be imposed on Bosnia. The Bosnian Serbs, in particular, must return to the negotiating table to arrive at a solution through negotiation.  At this critical stage, we must continue to exert maximum pressure on the Serbian authorities. We must fully support the efforts of the UN Secretary General and his special representative to put in place an effective ceasefire in and around Gorazde.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, there are at present four UNHCR personnel left in Gorazde, two of whom are Irish.  There are also two non-Irish aid workers with Medecins sans Frontieres.  Yesterday we were in contact with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to express the Government's concerns about the whereabouts and safety of the Irish citizens in Gorazde.  We are maintaining ongoing contact with the UNHCR on the situation in the enclave. Earlier this afternoon, the UNHCR confirmed that the aid workers are unharmed in their shelter in the UN building in Gorazde.  I want to assure the House of the Government's deep concern that shelling continues today in Gorazde and we are committed to doing everything we can to secure the evacuation of Irish and other aid workers to safety.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR have taken the decision in principle to evacuate all humanitarian aid personnel from Gorazde.  However, before the evacuation can take place they need the assurance of the Bosnian Serb military commanders that safe passage will be guaranteed.  I have directly requested Dr. Karadzic's intervention with the military commanders to guarantee safe passage for the evacuation of these aid workers from Gorazde.  Mrs. Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, is also working to this end.  I know that everyone in this House joins with me in hoping that my request is <Col N="943" /> acted upon immediately and that the evacuation goes ahead without further delay.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste not agree that the indifference of the international community and the pathetic response by the European Union initially and by the United Nations is nothing short of a disgrace and that there is much blood on the hands of both organisations? Will he not agree that it has been patently obvious from the start that the clear and single-minded objective of the Serbs has been the annihilation of the Muslim community, that because these people are Muslims and have no oil they simply do not count, that the Serbs have used negotiations and the United Nations as an international play thing and have thumbed their noses time and again at it, again today taking back anti-aircraft guns that were seized previously, and that the international will is not and was never there to do anything substantial about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel that the tenor of the Deputy's remarks reflects the efforts of the European Union of the United States and of the international community over a period of many months.  The European Union has made particular efforts to bring peace to Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia and to assist the victims of the conflict there.  We have yet to achieve the goal of a comprehensive settlement for which everybody has been working for a long time. Some progress has been made, but not enough; for example, the war between the Muslims and Croats which has raged for the past nine months in Central Bosnia has been brought to a conclusion. We want to see a resumption of negotiations. Nobody can defend or stand over what is happening to the Muslim <Col N="944" /> population in the town of Gorazde.  We will continue our efforts at international level.  At the meeting in Luxembourg yesterday it was stressed that we need the best endeavours of the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia in particular to work together to bring the warring factions together to see if we can achieve a resolution of this conflict.</P>

      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for the information that the two Irish aid workers, Mr. Eddie O'Dwyer and Dr. Mary McLoughlin, are safe.  I pay tribute to the courageous work they are doing and the fact that they are staying with the people they work with in their time of trouble.</P>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste not agree that the safe havens, which appeared to be a good idea, and the suggestion for which the Tánaiste took credit in this House, have now become corrals of misery and death and that this policy is no longer one that the EU can continue to sustain without ensuring that the lives of the people in the havens are protected?  Is he aware that the numbers in Gorazde have risen to 65,000 from an original population of 30,000 population, that there are 1,100 people in need of immediate medical evacuation, that 300 people died in a period of 19 or 20 days and that if that rate of killing continues before long there will be nobody left in that safe haven? When will the international community implement the UN resolutions which not only call for the protection of UN soldiers working there but for the protection of the people who have been brought together for their safety in safe havens? The resolutions which have been passed allow for such protection.  Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs take a more frontline role in ensuring that such UN resolutions are implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the population of Gorazde has exploded in recent months because of people from neighbouring villages taking refuge.  I am also aware that 300 people have been killed and 1,000 injured in the recent past.  I <Col N="945" /> have contributed to every debate on the difficulties in the former Yugoslavia which have taken place at European Union level.  During the past two years we have set out to ensure effective delivery of humanitarian aid in Bosnia.  We should not underestimate the efforts of the European Union in particular and the international community.  We also have been pursuing a political solution for Bosnia and an interim solution for Croatia and will continue to do so.  It has always been accepted by the European Union, the United Nations and the international community that safe areas would have to be protected and that humanitarian aid would have to get through.  In conjunction with my colleagues at European Union level, I will continue to press for negotiations because the problem is so complex that it will require the best efforts of the international community and the Serbs, Muslims and Croats if it is to be resolved.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for his assurances on the safety of Dr. Mary McLoughlin and Eddie O'Dwyer.  Like all of us, he is aware of the deep concern about the position in Bosnia.</P>
      <P>Is he embarrassed by the lack of success of EU foreign policy in respect of the former Yugoslavia?  Does he agree with the main thrust of European Union foreign policy or is there a particular Irish Government position which he believes should be followed?  If so, will he state the Government's policy on events in the former Yugoslavia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of being embarrassed about the efforts of the European Union in this regard.  The European Union is frustrated and that frustration is shared by the international community, the administration in the United States, the Russian administration and the United Nations because of the costs of the conflict in terms of loss of human life, suffering and deprivation in the former Yugoslavia.  Our position coincides with that of our European <Col N="946" /> Union partners.  We set out to ensure the effective delivery of humanitarian aid to Bosnia which, by and large, has succeeded in getting through to people who are suffering and hungry.  We set out to seek a political solution to the problem in Bosnia, a resumption of negotiations on the basis of the Geneva package which was largely agreed by the parties in autumn last year.  We also sought an interim solution to Croatia.  Central to that plan was the conditional offer by the European Union to support the phased lifting of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro and the first step in the process could take place when agreement was secured on Bosnia and a <i>modus vivendi</i> established for Croatia.  We will continue to work with the international community.  There is an absolute sense of frustration because of the continuing violence despite our best efforts and those of our European Union partners, but we will have to continue with our endeavours.</P>

      <P>Does the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs support the request by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros Ghali, for air strikes against the Bosnian Serbian forces who are currently assaulting Gorazde?  If so, has he indicated that support to the United Nations, given that the entire Security Council supports that request?  He stated that maximum pressure will be exerted on Serbia.  What will be the extent of that pressure?  Are steps other than those already implemented against Serbia intended?  Will he agree that if Gorazde falls it will not be long before assaults are launched on the other five safe areas which the United Nations is pledged to defend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant resolutions of the Security Council authorise UNPROFOR to take all necessary measures, including the use of force, to achieve certain objectives in Bosnia. Resolutions are of a mandatory nature and have been adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.  The United Nations bears a particularly onerous responsibility <Col N="947" /> in deciding on military action.  Difficult and complex questions will have to be addressed by the Secretary General's special representative in the former Yugoslavia, UNPROFOR's commanders and ultimately by the Secretary General before deciding on the use of air strikes.  These will have to include calculations on whether such action will result in an escalation of the conflict or provoke attacks on UNPROFOR which could force its withdrawal.  The relevant resolutions of the Security Council provide for the use of force, including air power, to support UNPROFOR in discharging its mandate in and around the safe areas.  To date the authority has been used in the provision of close air support when the lives of UN personnel have been endangered.  The Secretary General wishes to ensure that NATO is in a position to undertake air strikes to protect designated safe areas if he decides that such actions must be taken.  It is right that the Secretary General should seek to ensure that the UN has the capacity to implement the resolutions of the Security Council which are binding on all states and he will have our support on those matters.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's view on the threat to Gorazde and the consequences if Gorazde is not protected.  It will be a sad day if Gorazde falls and will endanger the remaining safe areas in the former Yugoslavia.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The conflict which has been raging in the former Yugoslavia is causing great difficulties to international bodies, in particular, the European Union and the United Nations.  I emphasise the European Union because it has been a particular contributor in terms of troops and humanitarian aid and that will <Col N="948" /> continue to be the case.  At all times the intention was to protect human life, to try to end the conflict and to provide whatever protection was possible to ensure the killing and the genocide did not continue.  The European Union will continue to support the United Nations which plays a leading role in respect of the presence of UNPROFOR troops.  We will give every support possible to prevent further loss of life and, in particular, to ensure that Gorazde remains a protected safe area.</P>

      <P>Has the Government protested to the Russian Ambassador and thereby to the Russian Government about the remarks last week of President Yeltsin who criticised the attempt by the United Nations and NATO to stop the Serbian onslaught on Gorazde?  As they are traditional allies and friends, the Russians have a greater influence on the Serbs than anyone else.  Will the Tánaiste make that protest bearing in mind what I said about friendship and use that avenue when meeting Ministers in member states of the European Union to see if some constraints can be put on the Serbs?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be necessary to combine the efforts of the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and the Russian authorities in this regard. I will have an opportunity to raise those matters during discussions with the Russian Foreign Minister and I am conscious of our relations with the Russian Government. Given its traditional relationship with the Serbian people, it has a particular role to play.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This year's Finance Bill implements an important range of measures designed to promote and assist the creation of sustainable employment.  They do this through enhancing business competitiveness, promotion productive use of resources, and stimulating and rewarding genuine enterprise.  In bringing forward these measures, I have taken account of the views of many interested parties, notably the Task Force on Small Business and the Task Force on jobs in Services.  Accordingly, this year's package places particular emphasis on improving the climate for smaller and start-up enterprises.  It also reflects the Government's conviction that the services sector can continue to make a major contribution to fulfilling our employment needs.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise that the measures in this year's Bill should not be viewed in isolation, but rather as complementing and enhancing the initiatives for enterprise and employment enshrined in the 1993 Finance Act.  More importantly, they must be seen in the context of the Government's broadly-based strategy for economic progress in the interests of job-creation: the key elements of this are the continued observance of budgetary discipline, the responsible pay arrangements in the new <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> and the commitment to reforming the taxation system to make it more employment-friendly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the significant items in the Bill in this connection are: the introduction of a special capital gains tax rate for individuals in respect of shares in most unquoted trading companies, so as to help in attracting investment funds to this area and to reward those who put their funds at risk in developing job-creating business; extension to the wider services <Col N="1091" /> sector of the roll-over relief under capital gains tax for equity investment by entrepreneurs in unquoted trading companies, introduced last year for reinvestment in business in certain sectors; a new business assets relief in capital acquisitions tax, so as to facilitate the transfer of family business and to improve incentives for those trying to build up businesses; an easing of the income qualification test for access to the seed capital scheme which assists new business start ups by employees and the unemployed; an increase in the company-value limit for the purpose of BES investment by the &ldquo;original entrepreneur&rdquo;; a raising of the VAT threshold for both goods and services, thus relieving the very small business from the obligations associated with VAT registration; the cash-basis of accounting for VAT is being made available to business in all sectors with an annual turnover of up to £250,000; a new and better focused scheme of incentives for urban renewal, with new incentives for industrial buildings, in the interests of more balanced development in inner city areas; improved annual capital allowances for hotel development and farm buildings, an increased allowance for business cars, and the granting of capital allowances to the purchase of computer software or the rights to use such software; the introduction of a new provision into the relief for investment in films aimed at assisting low budget Irish films; simplification of the payment arrangements, subject to EU approval, for VAT on long term leases of property; a range of relieving stamp duty measures, including a new appeals procedure and a special relief for young trained farmers; modernisation of the tax treatment of businesses' foreign exchange gains and losses; unilateral credit relief for foreign withholding taxes incurred by computer software companies; a range of measures to underpin the further development of the International Financial Services Centre; and amendment of the tax provisions relating to bearer bonds, so as to assist the development of Irish financial markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> Section 1, 2 and 3 provide for the major improvements in the mainstream income tax code announced in the budget.  The basic personal allowances are being increased by 8 per cent and the standard rate tax band is being extended by 7 per cent.  To help those on lower incomes, the marginal relief rate, which is the effective tax rate for many lower paid people, is being reduced by 8 percentage points, from 48 per cent to 40 per cent and the child addition to the exemption thresholds is being improved by £100 per child for all children.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the PAYE allowance to be extended to the children of proprietary directors and of self-employed persons where they are working in their parents business.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 provide for the phased restriction to the standard rate of tax of the relief for mortgage interest and health insurance premiums.  The measures will only affect those taxpayers who claim relief at the 48 per cent rate.  Section 6 provides that, in relation to mortgage interest relief, standard-rating is being phased in so that it will not apply fully until 1997-98.  For first-time house buyers, for the first five years of their claim, the percentage of mortgage interest qualifying for relief will be 100 per cent and the <i>de minimis</i> exclusion will not apply.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the standard-rating of medical insurance premium relief.  As the relief is available on a previous years basis, there will be no impact on taxpayers in 1994-95 and full standard-rating will apply to relief claimed in the tax year 1996-97.  Relief in respect of unreimbursed medical expenses is not being standard-rated given the unpredictable nature of this expenditure. However, section 8 provides for the thresholds to be raised to £150 for an individual and £300 for a family in respect of expenditure incurred in the tax year 1994-95.</P>
    <P>Section 9 reduces, on foot of the fall in commercial interest rates, the rates used for determining the benefit-in-kind charge on preferential loans made to <Col N="1093" /> employees by their employers.  Section 10 revises the current list of accountable persons for withholding tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that, in view of the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy, taxpayers paying their preliminary tax for 1994-95 will not have to take the levy into account if they elect to pay their tax on the basis of 100 per cent of their 1993-94 tax liability.  Section 12 also provides that individuals availing of the 100 per cent rule for computing preliminary tax may not take account of the relief on investment in film companies under section 35.</P>
    <P>To redress an unintended effect of the rule for the seed capital scheme in denying access to some people at whom the scheme was aimed, section 14 provides that there will no longer be any reference to income in the year immediately preceding the establishment of the new business. Moreover, the condition regarding income from sources other than employment will be eased.</P>
    <P>Section 14 also provides for an increase from £150,000 to £250,000 in the ceiling which the capital of a company must not exceed if the rules which prevent an individual who, broadly, owns 30 per cent of a company obtaining BES relief, are not to apply.  The section also ensures that mushroom cultivation continues as a qualifying trade for the purposes of the BES and the seed capital scheme.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill, 1991 countered the circumvention of the BES company limit by the use of company splitting devices, subject to an exception for transitional cases.  The transitional arrangements were intended to be purely temporary and section 15 provides for their termination as and from 30 June 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for more meaningful public access requirements in relation to the income tax relief on heritage property, bringing them into line with those for the corresponding CAT relief.  The property must in future be open to the public for a total of 90 days annually, 60 of which must be in the period May to September.  The section further makes it a requirement for claiming the relief in any year that the location/address of the house or garden <Col N="1094" /> and its opening times be notified to Bord Fáilte, so that the details may be published by the board or another tourism promoting body.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that, subject to certain conditions, the benefit-in-kind charge on works of art or antiques loaned by an employer will not apply where such objects are on view to the public in an approved property.</P>
    <P>Unemployment benefit has been made reckonable for tax purposes from 6 April 1994.  It has been decided, however, that, in recognition of their special circumstances, workers who on 5 April 1994 were participating in a systematic short-time working arrangement, recognised by the Department of Social Welfare, will be exempted from the new tax arrangements.  This exemption will apply in respect of unemployment benefit payments received in relation to systematic short-time working for the duration of an individual's current unemployment benefit claim or to the end of the present tax year &mdash; 5 April 1995 &mdash; whichever is the earlier.  I will bring forward a Committee Stage amendment to this effect.</P>
    <P>Section 18 amends the tax relief for investment in Irish film-making companies. It introduces a pilot scheme targeted at promoting investment in low budget films, which will operate for a one year period from 9 July 1994.  This will allow a corporate investor to invest up to £350,000 in one or more films certified by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the basis of objective criteria relating to small budget films not exceeding a cost of £1,050,000.  As I announced in a press release on 14 January 1994, investment in film companies by way of loans is being eliminated from that date in order to rectify an anomaly whereby investment via a short term loan obtained much more favourable tax treatment than investment by way of shares.</P>
    <P>Section 19 increases, with effect from 27 January 1994, the capital value threshold for determining the capital allowances and the deduction for running expenses in respect of cars used in the course of a trade, profession or employment. <Col N="1095" /> The threshold will increase from £10,000 to £13,000 in respect of capital allowances for new cars only, and in respect of allowable running expenses for all cars.  The previous £10,000 limit for capital allowance purposes will continue to apply to existing and second hand cars.</P>
    <P>Section 20 shortens the writing down period from ten to seven years for capital allowances purposes for expenditure on hotels and holiday camps, incurred on or after 27 January 1994.  Section 21 improves the annual capital allowances regime for farm buildings and structures by reducing the write-off period from ten to seven years.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that where computer software is acquired as an asset of a business, either by outright purchase or under licence, the company will be able to claim plant and machinery capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred in the acquisition of this software.</P>
    <P>Section 25 deals with two issues arising from the removal, by section 38 of the Finance Act, 1992 of the formal liability of non-residents to income tax in respect of Irish dividends.  First, it closes a loophole inadvertently created whereby such dividends paid for the ultimate benefit of an Irish resident fall outside the scope of certain anti-avoidance provisions of the Finance Act, 1974.  Second, it deals with a problem that has arisen with a number of our Double Taxation Treaty partners. They have taken the view that dividends, being legally exempt from Irish tax, cannot be said to be subject to double taxation if fully taxed in the treaty partner country.  However, the stance they have taken ignores the fact that Irish corporation tax is paid on the profits of an Irish company paying dividends to non-residents. In other words, the non-resident shareholder has effectively borne Irish tax.</P>
    <P>Both of these problems are being solved by amending the 1992 legislation. While dividends paid to non-resident shareholders will be liable to Irish tax, any tax due will be fully eliminated by way of a tax credit and further relief so <Col N="1096" /> as to purchase a net nil liability to Irish tax.</P>
    <P>Section 26 tackles certain abuses of the tax exemption for patent royalty income by refocusing the relief, in line with the original industrial policy thrust of the scheme, on inventions researched and developed in Ireland.  The exemption is being maintained where the royalty is paid in respect of manufacturing activity, whether carried on in the State or abroad, and for non-manufacturing patent royalty income arising out of Irish Research and Development to the extent that it arises from third party payments. Dividends paid out of such exempt royalties will continue to be exempt from tax subject to existing requirements.  The provisions in the Bill, therefore, fully protect the <i>status quo</i> for our major research and manufacturing companies.</P>
    <P>Section 27 closes off certain loopholes in the legislation dealing with capital allowances and loss relief in the case of general partnership schemes, by confining them to the partnership income in such situations.  A number of schemes have been launched in the past two years which sought to use these reliefs in an unintended and unacceptable way.  These loopholes are being closed in the case of moneys invested in a partnership on or after the publication date of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 28 introduces restrictions in the tax rules for capital allowances for lessors of plant and machinery in order to deal with an unintended use of these provisions through a new type of lease arrangement with serious implications for the corporate tax revenue yield. Under these balloon lease arrangements, the bulk of the lease payments are not received by the lessor until the end of the primary leasing period which can be up to ten or 15 years after the commencement of the lease.  The effect of this is that the lessor can use virtually all the capital allowances on the leased assets for offset against his other taxable income over the early years of the lease.</P>
    <P>With certain exceptions, therefore, the Bill ringfences the capital allowances in the case of such leases to the lessor's receipts from that particular lease in the <Col N="1097" /> case of leasing agreements entered into on or after 22 December 1993.  The new rules will not apply to leasing companies in the IFSC or Shannon or to leases of buildings and the rules are relaxed to allow for seasonal factors in the case of leases of agricultural machinery.  Special arrangements are provided in the case of leased machinery or plant the expenditure on which is incurred on or before 31 December 1995 and which is provided for the purposes of certain new projects which have been approved for grant aid and which qualify for 50 per cent accelerated capital allowances under the Finance Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>There are two Chapters in the Bill dealing with urban renewal.  Chapter III deals with the transitional arrangements associated with the current urban renewal scheme which has a termination date of 31 July 1994.  First, expenditure incurred between 1 August and 31 December 1994 on certain projects will continue to qualify for the incentives under the scheme.  Second, there will be an additional two year period until 31 July 1996 for the completion of leases to qualify for the double rent allowance.</P>
    <P>The legislation also provides for an increase in the maximum floor area size of refurbished accommodation in the Custom House Docks and the Temple Bar areas in the context of the owner-occupier relief and the relief in respect of rented residential accommodation.  In addition, the owner-occupier's allowance in respect of refurbishment expenditure in the Custom House Docks area is being increased from 50 per cent to 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV sets out the provisions announced in the budget for the new urban renewal scheme which will commence on 1 August 1994 and will operate for a period of three years.  The areas qualifying for the scheme, including certain designated streets under a pilot scheme designed to promote living over business premises, will be designated by way of ministerial order.</P>
    <P>The scheme will include accelerated allowances up to 50 per cent for certain industrial buildings in the designated <Col N="1098" /> areas and a maximum capital allowance of 50 per cent for certain commercial buildings therein.  Subject to specific conditions, these allowances will also be available in relation to the refurbishment of such buildings in designated streets.</P>
    <P>In addition, section 23 type reliefs will be obtainable and a ten year double rent allowance will be available for qualifying properties in the designated areas but not in designated streets.  For owner occupiers there will be a 50 per cent personal tax allowance claimable over ten years in respect of new construction costs with 100 per cent available for refurbishment expenditure.</P>
    <P>The new urban renewal scheme, with its focus on residential and industrial development, will stimulate growth and employment in our designated cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, in order to comply with a direction from the European Commission, the Government had to take steps to remove mushroom cultivation from the scope of the 10 per cent manufacturing rate of corporation tax. Section 43 makes the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides that a company entitled to a section 84 loan by virtue of it being included on an IDA list of allowable loans can only get one such loan of the full allowable amount.  The Bill also imposes a seven year limit on the duration of a section 84 loan taken out on or after the publication date of the Bill and provides that all loans taken out before that date should be terminated before 11 April 2001, that is seven years after the publication date of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 46 extends to 31 December 1996, relief from corporation tax for gifts to the Enterprise Trust.</P>
    <P>Section 47 provides for an exemption from corporation tax for certain payments by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to National Co-operative Farm Relief Services Ltd. and to grants made by that body to its member co-operatives for the purpose of engaging contractors to provide farm relief services.</P>
    <P>Section 49 deals with a double taxation problem arising from foreign withholding <Col N="1099" /> taxes affecting certain software companies. It provides for the introduction of unilateral credit relief for foreign withholding taxes on payments in respect of software transactions.</P>
    <P>Section 51 addresses a number of the most pressing problems in the area of foreign exchange gains and losses facing Irish business engaged in international trade.  I have decided to take a minimalist approach targeted on the main current problems and based on accounting practice. This ensures that commercial strategies for reduction or elimination of currency risk are effective after the taxation liability on the transactions have been determined.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the provisions in the Bill relate to four basic problem areas as follows. First, foreign exchange gains and losses on long term borrowings incurred by companies, which are currently ignored for tax purposes, will now be deductible or chargeable, as appropriate, in the computation of taxable income.</P>
    <P>Second, the foreign exchange gain, or loss, on a hedge instrument associated with a capital borrowing, which, as Deputies may know, are arrangements adopted by companies to protect themselves against exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, will be included in the computation of taxable income and excluded from the computation of capital gains.  In conjunction with the proposal on capital borrowings, this will mean that hedging arrangements will be fully effective for commercial purposes after tax as well as before tax.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it is now proposed to allow companies with a non-Irish pound functional currency to compute their capital allowances in that functional currency. Finally, in the case of companies operating in non-Irish pound functional currencies, it is proposed to value any trading loss in such a currency at the exchange rate of the year the loss is offset against income.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that these changes have been welcomed by the business community as evidenced by the positive <Col N="1100" /> reports on the matter since the publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the House that it is my intention to bring forward a Committee Stage amendment to provide for an exemption from tax for income of noncommercial State bodies.  The exemption will not apply to deposit interest or to fee income, excepting statutory fees and incidental income of this kind.  In settling the annual Exchequer allocation for such bodies, account is fully taken of own-resources arising to them so that the interests of the Exchequer will be safeguarded even in the absence of a tax charge.</P>
    <P>The Government acknowledges the contribution that services have made and will continue to make towards our overall economic performance, particularly in the creation of much needed employment. In recognition of this, action has been taken in developing an overall strategy for the services sector.  Moreover, various policy initiatives being legislated for in this Bill have been consciously directed at the services sector.  In addition, the Government has undertaken, in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> to examine options developed by the Task Force on Jobs in Services and other bodies in the area of the incentives, including tax treatment, afforded to the services sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to incentives, Members will be aware that the Taoiseach recently set up a small interdepartmental working group to examine the range of international service activity which can qualify for State assistance including the reduced rate of corporation tax.  In the time available to the group, it has not proved possible for them to carry out a detailed study of the matter to enable them put specific recommendations in this regard to Government for consideration in the context of the current Bill.</P>
    <P>It would be the Government's intention, however, to consider at an early date any recommendations proposed by this group in relation to the application of State assistance, including the 10 per cent corporation tax rate, to a wider range of internationally traded services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> To the extent that areas warranting extension of the 10 per cent rate are identified by the group and approved by the Government, the aim will be to make provision for these in the 1995 Finance Bill with retrospective effect to the date of any announcement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I would also like to inform the House that I am considering extending the definition of qualifying shipping activities in section 39 of the 1980 Finance Act to include deep-sea tugs.  Subject to the resolution of some technical definitional problems, it would be my intention to bring forward a Committee Stage amendment to give effect to this change.  If this does not prove possible in the time available, I will make the necessary changes in next year's Bill.</P>
    <P>The IFSC has been a great success and I am anxious to ensure that it develops to its full potential.  I am proposing certain changes, which are mostly of a technical nature, to assist this.  In particular, I propose to put in place the tax legislation which is necessary to complement the legislation on investment limited partnerships which the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has announced he will be introducing to help develop the collective funds sector here.  The relevant Finance Bill provision adds certain limited partnerships to the categories of undertaking within the definition of collective investment undertaking in section 18 of the 1989 Finance Act.  This provision will only come into effect when the proposed Investment Limited Partnerships Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>I also propose to allow credit for foreign withholding tax paid in countries with which we do not have a double taxation treaty at present.  This practice is the norm among OECD countries and its implementation here will help the development of business from the IFSC and the Shannon zone.</P>
    <P>Income attributable to non-resident policyholders of IFSC foreign life assurance companies is not liable to tax in the State.  Policies written now will, in most cases, mature in years beyond 2005, the year in which the 10 per cent tax concession for shareholders' profits in such <Col N="1102" /> companies will cease.  The provision in this year's Bill extends indefinitely the exemption from tax here of non-resident policyholders' income.  This is critical to the development of this important and relatively labour-intensive part of financial services activity in the centre.</P>
    <P>Capital allowances on leased plant and machinery in the IFSC and Shannon zone are ring-fenced twice, once to prevent the allowances being set against non-IFSC and Shannon income and secondly to prevent them being used against income of IFSC and Shannon companies other than from the trade of leasing.  It is considered that this latter ring-fence is too restrictive in an IFSC and Shannon context and it is proposed to relax it in the context of claims for capital allowances at the standard rate only.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions of a more technical nature which will also help the development of both the IFSC and the Shannon zone.  I do not propose to go into further detail on these at this stage: Committee Stage would be more appropriate for this.</P>
    <P>Part II confirms the changes announced in the budget with regard to the increases in excise duty on cigarettes and other tobacco products, alcoholic drinks, road fuels and heavy fuel oil and the reduction in the rates of vehicle registration tax on cars and motor-cycles.  Also confirmed is the relief from excise duty on oil emerging from a waste oil recycling process and on the use of marked gas oil in vehicle-mounted cranes and well-drilling equipment.  In response to trade representations, this latter concession is being extended to include mobile concrete pumps and conveyor belts.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the legislative framework to introduce a tax stamp regime for cigarettes which I first announced in the 1993 budget.  The provisions, which are mainly technical, deal with the control and collection of the excise duty on cigarettes, deferred payment arrangements and related offences and penalties.  I consider the proposed regime to offer greater security against the erosion of this significant revenue source from illegal importations within <Col N="1103" /> an internal market devoid of border controls.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments are proposed in the vehicle licensing area with the primary aim of safeguarding road tax revenue.  The amendments are designed to remove any doubts as to the legal status of the national vehicle file regarding vehicle ownership and related matters and to confirm the validity of information contained in certificates taken from the file for evidential purposes.</P>
    <P>At the trade's request, it is proposed to change the high season period of the limited annual licence from 1 March-31 August to 1 April-30 September so as to better reflect seasonal trading patterns. Accordingly, amusement machines so licensed may be made available for play at any time during the six month high season and at week-ends and public holidays during the remaining six months of the year.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes an enabling provision which will relieve bets placed at a horse race-meeting, in respect of events taking place elsewhere, of the existing betting duty when the proposed horse racing authority, as envisaged in the Horse-racing Industry Bill, 1994, is established. It is proposed under the latter Bill to apply a levy to such bets at the same rate as the existing betting duty, and this provision avoids the double taxation of such bets.  Such revenue, which would normally accrue to the Exchequer, will in future be diverted at source into the racing industry for its direct benefit, in the same way as the on-course betting levy helps fund the industry currently.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with VAT and confirms two important measures for business announced in the budget, namely the increase in the VAT registration thresholds and the change in the availability of the cash receipts basis of accounting, as well as the extension of VAT to the services of loss adjusters.</P>
    <P>The Bill streamlines the VAT regime applicable to travelling shows and funfairs through providing that all funfairs will be liable at the reduced rate of 12½ per cent with the exception of gaming <Col N="1104" /> and amusement machines which will be standard rated.</P>
    <P>The arrangements regarding the payment of VAT on long term property leases are being simplified to eliminate the onerous cash-flow burden on businesses entitled to full VAT deductibility and help developers of shopping and business centres.  A facility is being introduced enabling relevant businesses, if they wish, to avoid the current need to pay over a sizeable lump-sum.  As this measure requires EU approval, which is now being sought, the Bill provides for an implementation date to be effected by commencement order.  In parallel with this concession, the opportunity is being taken to confirm that bad debt relief does not apply in cases where a landlord does not receive payment from a tenant for the VAT due on long term leases.  The Bill also provides for a number of technical changes in order to clarify existing law and confirm present practice and also to bring Irish law into line with EU VAT law.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my Financial Statement on 27 January last, I have reviewed the operation of the VAT monthly control statement introduced in 1992 as an anti-fraud measure, including consideration of the alleged distortion of competition arising between those traders currently subject to the control statement and those who are not.  I do not propose to make any changes in the current arrangements which have been fully operational only for a relatively short period.  I am conscious of the undoubted success of the initiative in eliminating certain fraudulent practices.  However, I also remain mindful of the concerns expressed by traders in the matter. Accordingly, I am asking the Revenue Commissioners to examine ways of further improving the general operational approach, in consultation with trade interests, which will balance the respective legitimate official and business concerns.</P>
    <P>Part V reduces the RPT house value threshold to £75,000 and the income threshold to £25,000.  The single 1993 RPT rate of 1 1/2 per cent is replaced by <Col N="1105" /> three tiered rates, 1 per cent for houses valued between £75,000 and £100,000, 1.5 per cent on the value between £100,000 and £150,000 and 2 per cent on the value in excess of £150,000.  A value banding system is included for houses valued at up to £100,000.  The Bill introduces concessions for those over 65 and widowed and incapacitated persons along with a provision to deal with hardship cases and an easy payment scheme.  The limit for marginal relief is extended from £30,000 to £35,000 generally and to £40,000 for those over 65.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy of creating conditions which are conducive to enterprise, investment and employment creation was reflected in several provisions of last year's Finance Act.  Further substantial progress is made on this front in this Bill, which contains a number of major relieving measures in the area of capital taxation.  These aim to improve the risk-reward ratio for entrepreneurs, encouraging them to expand and diversify their businesses.  The Bill provides for a reduction in the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 27 per cent for longer term equity investments by individuals in small to medium sized companies; a widening of the scope of rollover relief under capital gains tax for equity investment by entrepreneurs to include investment in most trading enterprises, and a new relief under capital acquisitions tax for business assets acquired by gift or inheritance.</P>
    <P>The new 27 per cent rate of capital gains tax will apply to unquoted equity investments in small-medium sized companies by individuals which are held for at least five years.  I would like to emphasise that the 27 per cent rate has a very wide ambit.  Trading activities, with the exception of dealing or investing in land, buildings and certain financial assets will be eligible, as will all individual investors, whether they are full-time working directors or non-active minority shareholders. I should add that the reduced rate will apply to quoted shares which were unquoted at the time they were acquired by the individual investor.  When account is taken of the indexation relief, whereby <Col N="1106" /> only gains in excess of inflation are taxed, this new rate will generally translate into an effective rate of tax well below 27 per cent.  This represents very favourable treatment for such investments, which can only be justified in terms of the risks associated with such business ventures.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a considerable widening of the scope of capital gains tax rollover relief introduced last year.  The relief provides for a deferment of capital gains tax where the proceeds of a disposal of shares in an unquoted company are reinvested in new share capital in another unquoted trading company.  In future it will comprehend most trading activities, not just those falling within the scope of the business expansion scheme.  The extended rollover relief will continue to be targeted at entrepreneurs who work in a full-time capacity for a business in which they have a material interest, and wish to move out of their present business in order to start up a new venture.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a new capital acquisitions tax relief for business assets. This involves a reduction for CAT purposes in the market value of the trade-related assets of a business which are acquired by gift or inheritance.  The first £250,000 acquired by a beneficiary will be reduced in value by 50 per cent, while amounts in excess of £250,000 will receive 25 per cent relief.  This relief has a wide scope, covering all business activities other than those dealing or investing in land, buildings and certain financial assets.  It will serve as an important complement to the reliefs already available which assist the transfer of businesses from one generation to another &mdash; for example, the generous CAT exemption threshold for transfers from parent to child and the retirement relief under capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the new relief is effective in alleviating the impact of CAT on the transfer of family businesses and in promoting enterprise and business development, I have decided to relax a number of the terms and conditions proposed in the budget.  I have decided to dispense with the requirement that the beneficiary must work on a full-time basis <Col N="1107" /> for the business for a specified period after the gift or inheritance.  I have also decided to modify the requirement that the beneficiary must hold a minimum 25 per cent interest in the business so as to enable a beneficiary with a minimum 10 per cent interest to qualify where his/her family has a controlling interest or where he/she has worked on a full-time basis for the business for at least five years prior to the transfer.  The minimum period of ownership of the business assets prior to their transfer by the disponer is being reduced from five years to two years in the case of inheritances.  Relief is to be provided for quoted shares which were unquoted at the time they were acquired by the disponer.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of measures which will benefit agriculture and encourage the transfer of farms to younger, more enterprising farmers.  The measures include a substantial improvement in agricultural relief under capital acquisitions tax, relief in respect of probate tax and a new stamp duty relief for young trained farmers.  These measures, when taken together with the EC early retirement scheme and the scheme of installation aid for young farmers, should help to improve the structure of this important sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the significant improvements in agricultural relief under capital acquisitions tax announced in the budget, benefiting both gifts and inheritances.  The Bill also provides for a reduction, by two-thirds, in the stamp duty chargeable on the transfer of agricultural land and buildings to farmers under 35 years of age who have completed an approved training course &mdash; for example, a Teagasc certificate.  In the majority of cases the relief will entail a stamp duty rate of 1 per cent, down from 3 per cent, for transfers between relatives and 2 per cent, down from 6 per cent, for transfers between non-relatives.  The new relief will apply to both gifts and sales and will be operative from 12 May 1994 until 31 December 1996.  This fulfils the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> The Bill provides for the budget proposal to grant probate tax relief at the rate of 30 per cent in respect of agricultural land and buildings.  Farmers will also benefit from the provisions in the Bill giving effect to the budget proposal to fully exempt spouses from the probate tax.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for several measures aimed generally at rendering the administration of stamp duties more user-friendly for taxpayers and their agents.  I would like to briefly outline these measures.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that where both stamp duty and VAT are payable on a property sale or lease, the stamp duty is to be based on the VAT-exclusive amount payable rather than on the VAT-inclusive amount.  The Bill also provides for a retrospective validation of title deeds that have been incorrectly stamped on a VAT-exclusive basis.  The changes in this area will be beneficial for commercial leases.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty appeals procedures are to be brought into line with those applying for other taxes.  All appeals may in future be heard by the appeal commissioners, whereas currently appeals on issues other than valuation must be initiated in the High Court.  Revised procedures are considered appropriate since stamp duty is now on a similar footing to other taxes as regards enforcement and collection.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a substantial reduction in the surcharges which apply when property transferring by voluntary disposition is undervalued for stamp duty purposes.  No surcharges will apply for undervaluations up to 15 per cent, instead of 10 per cent as heretofore, and the rates of surcharge are being reduced by a half.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions which will enable the Revenue Commissioners to revise and update the information requirements &mdash; that is, the &ldquo;particulars delivered&rdquo; form &mdash; in relation to property transfer deeds presented for stamping. The intention is to make the &ldquo;particulars delivered&rdquo; form more user-friendly and have a more precise description of the <Col N="1109" /> property.  It is also proposed to require the tax reference numbers of the transferor and transferee to be provided, where appropriate, but full consultation will take place between Revenue and the Incorporated Law Society on the operational arrangements before this proceeds.</P>
    <P>Finally, the rules for the valuation of unquoted shares in private family-controlled companies for stamp duty purposes are simplified.</P>
    <P>The Bill amends the tax treatment of bearer &mdash; that is unregistered &mdash; bonds with the aim of encouraging greater participation by Irish financial institutions in the issuing of these bonds while at the same time countering as far as possible the use of these instruments for tax evasion by residents.  It is normal practice for Eurobonds to be issued in bearer form.  With the growth in the Irish pound capital market significant opportunities are emerging in relation to the issuing of Irish pound Eurobonds and the underwriting and managing of Irish pound issues on behalf of international institutions. The provisions in the Bill will enable Irish financial institutions to fully exploit these opportunities.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my Budget Statement and mentioned again in my Press statement on the publication of this Bill, a review of the detailed arrangements governing the question of residence for tax purposes is under way.  The objective of this review is twofold.  On the one side there is the matter of trying to bring greater clarity, transparency, order and certainty to an area where the current legal position reflects the interaction over a long period of legislative provisions, administrative practice and case law, much of it dating back to the nineteenth century.  I am satisfied there is a compelling case for reassessing the provisions governing residency for the purposes of taxation against the background of modern realities.  On the other side there is the issue of seeking to ensure that in this aspect of our taxation regime, as in others, we strike the best possible balance between what will help in fully realising our economy's potential and <Col N="1110" /> ensuring that equity in taxation applies not just in theory but also in practice.  In this context we need a tax regime that is helpful and hospitable to inward investment in the overall, but we must at the same time ensure that loopholes are closed which may enable Irish residents to escape the tax obligations arising from generating income and wealth in Ireland. Getting this balance absolutely right is my main concern.</P>
    <P>This review is an even more complex task than envisaged, thus has taken longer to complete than foreseen at the outset.  However, I can assure the House, that I am pressing ahead with it and that I will bring forward my proposals at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I want to make some points on the subject of tax reform. I hope that in this House there will be a greater willingness than among some participants in the debate to face up to what reform is really about and what it means for the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We all need to recognise the very considerable progress in improving the overall taxation system, particularly from an employment perspective, over the past few years, notwithstanding the constraints imposed by budgetary circumstances. Statements made often give the impression that no improvement has been made in the income tax system over the past few years.  Any objective analysis will show this suggestion to be totally without foundation.  This year's budget sought to address the most important issues in mainstream income tax.  The relief given was by any standard substantial, the overall cost of these measures amounting to some £330 million in a full year.  The budget also included a major restructuring of the PRSI system which should improve significantly the competitive position of firms with large numbers of low paid employees.</P>
    <P>There have been major achievements in the area of corporate taxation.  The tax base has been greatly widened, enabling the standard rate to be cut by ten percentage points.  This reform has greatly shifted the balance of incentives in favour <Col N="1111" /> of job creation.  In indirect taxation the standard rate of VAT has been reduced from 25 per cent to 21 per cent.  There has been considerable simplification and consolidation of the rating structure, with a 12.5 per cent rate now applied to a wide range of employment-incentive sectors.</P>
    <P>Our overrriding guiding principle in taxation policy will be to do what we judge best for employment.  In my Budget Statement this year I set out what I and the Government regard as the guiding principles for a &ldquo;pro-jobs&rdquo; taxation strategy.  It is from this perspective that the Government will address the board question of tax reform and evaluate any proposed changes to the taxation system. One of my major concerns is to tilt the balance in favour of productive investment. The new initiatives directly assist in this.  But logic dictates that we look critically at aspects of taxation that tend to divert effort and resources into other areas which, whatever their particular merits, do not contribute to the creation of long term substainable jobs.  The advantages conferred on housing investment have long been criticised from this standpoint and I am satisfied that the steps taken to redress this imbalance are fully justified in terms of our overriding objective to step up the pace of employment growth.</P>
    <P>There is a clear responsibility on those who call for major tax reliefs not just to acknowledge their cost but also to state precisely from where they would have the funding come.  Regrettably, very few of those who seek tax reductions are prepared to specify with a meaningful degree of precision from where the Government should raise alternative revenues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>But revenue foregone in the process of tax reform must for the most part be recouped within the overall area of taxation.  If people are willing to accept significant desirable reductions in the income tax area but strongly object to minor necessary off-setting base-broadening <Col N="1112" /> in another area, it does not augur well for the prospects for significant further tax reform.</P>
      <P>Tax reform has a role to play in improving employment prospects in the economy but we need to keep the potential gains in perspective.  Tax reform has tended to be presented as a panacea for all our employment problems, but even its most ardent proponents would not suggest that on its own it will transform our economic prospects.  Moreover, the nature of reform is that it involves choices, trade-offs and setting priorities.  The Government recognised in framing this budget that not all of our decisions would be universally welcome but we did not shirk from doing what we judged best for employment.  Without confronting such trade-offs, the real benefits of restructuring our tax and PRSI systems, and the consequent improvement in the environment for business and employment, will not be realised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Before getting into the substance of the Bill or the Minister's introductory remarks, by way of preamble might I make a few comments in relation to the current and likely macro-economic position arising out of recent reports, most notably that of the ESRI and its forecast of last week.  The public at large could be lulled into a false sense of feel good factor in relation to the economy. On a daily basis people are being bombarded with messages of boom and bloom when in reality what they see in their own lives are higher tax bills and renewed emigration.  This economic boom will happen for as long as the Government continues to let the economy run on autopilot. The assumptions made by the ESRI need to be questioned.  They say that public expenditure as a percentage of GNP is likely to be reduced from the current 50 per cent to 35 per cent.  I do not know how they can make that assumption when the Government, and particularly the Fianna Fáil Party, since 1990 has facilitated a real increase in public spending, allowing for inflation of one-quarter.  With that appetite for growth in public expenditure I do not see <Col N="1113" /> how there could be such a sharp decline in the level of GNP absorbed by public expenditure.</P>
      <P>In 1989 the ESRI forecast that we would have a current budget surplus of £1.2 billion in 1994.  What is the outcome? The current budget deficit has increased this year to almost £800 million.  The forecast for unemployment for 1994 was underestimated as unemployment will be 70 per cent higher, or 100,000 people extra.  The key assumption we have to reject is that the ESRI, as policy makers, say that emigration will be 100,000 between now and the year 2005.  If that is acceptable as a Government strategy in the labour market, I reject it out of hand because it is a target in relation to unemployment that is totally unacceptable to our school leavers.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, we have the best opportunity in over 20 years for the Irish economy to grow.  That unique set of circumstances arise from low international interest rates, which are stable; low inflation for a continuing period; a US and UK economic recovery and the prospect of European economic recovery. As an exporting nation the prospects for this country are very good.  However, I warn the public that the Government has an enormous capacity to fritter away this opportunity.  My advice to the public is that these forecasts of economic fine weather are such that they would be well advised to bring along their umbrella, given the performance of the Government.</P>
      <P>Each year the Finance Bill is the primary instrument of Government economic policy for the implementation of tax strategy.  The Finance Bill, 1994, is a major disappointment because it represents a substantial increase in the tax payable by home owners and in some cases will substantially increase the tax take from those in the middle income sector.  We will be opposing this Bill because it does not set out any serious strategy to enhance employment prospects through tax reform.  At the end of his contribution the Minister gave a lecture on what he wanted in relation to tax reform and the obligations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I saw thinly veiled criticisms of some of my attacks on Government policy and that of the Opposition parties. The Government has hijacked the tax reform debate because the most important aspect of tax reform, as we understand it and as the ordinary punter in the street understands it, is the need to reduce the overall level of taxation. Before dealing with any individual taxes we need to reduce the overall level of taxation.</P>

      <P>In 1993 public expenditure increased by 9 per cent; this year, before taking into account the revised Book of Estimates &mdash; Supplementary Estimates &mdash; public expenditure will rise by 10 per cent.  In 1993 Supplementary Estimates were of the order of £200 million and in 1992 were of the order of £244 million, so that we are not out of the woods yet. Total tax receipts last year rose by 8.9 per cent and this year independent economists inform me that total tax receipts in 1994 will be up 9 per cent on last year.</P>
      <P>It can hardly come as a surprise to the Minister for Finance when he seeks to widen the tax net, that there are howls of outrage because people see additional tax impositions on their meagre after-tax income.  There has been a 9 per cent increase in the money coming in through the doors of the Revenue Commissioners on an annual basis, which is well ahead of inflation.  Inflation, at 1.7 per cent last year and around 2 per cent this year, is well in excess of economic growth.  The total tax as a percentage of GNP is rising. Allowing for inflation, the Government has done a neat job at increasing public expenditure by 25 per cent since 1990 in real terms.</P>

    <P>The central and unavoidable issue that the Irish economy faces is that we must convert economic growth into employment growth.  Fine Gael believes that will best be achieved by reducing the taxes on unemployment, by stimulating investment <Col N="1115" /> through tax incentives and enhancing the potential of the services sector. Those are three simple strategies.  First, competitiveness can be improved in labour costs by reducing the tax wedge and the incentive to go to work can be improved by reducing the tax wedge. Second, we need to stimulate investment &mdash; fixed investment has been poor in the last two years &mdash; to improve the productive capacity of the economy.  This can only be done through the tax code. Third, in Britain and America, where employment rates are higher than the rest of Europe, that employment is in the services sector.</P>
    <P>If public expenditure growth is controlled &mdash; I am not talking about cuts in public expenditure but about controlling the rate of increase &mdash; the extra revenue from increased economic output, and from exports, can be used to reduce taxes.  That is the simple formula which we have lost sight of.  By simply putting a lid on the growth of public expenditure we have the money to pay for tax reform. In other words, the fruits of economic growth should be used to cut taxes.  This is the important priority area if we are to convert economic growth into employment growth.</P>
    <P>At present all the extra tax revenue and more is being absorbed in increased public spending.  All the current economic reports state that if we control public expenditure growth and wages we can achieve substantial prosperity.  If we look at the economies during the past two decades that have achieved success and prosperity we find that those countries that awarded themselves minimal pay increases, Japan and Germany, had the best prosperity because they took the long term view.  This Government, on its present record, is capable of destroying this opportunity.  Labour's socialism and Fianna Fáil's clientelism are a potent cocktail for ensuring that all the fruits of growth are absorbed in increased spending. The tax burden, as a percentage of GNP, should be progressively reduced.</P>
    <P>This Government has lost all credibility in relation to tax reform.  Its stop-go <Col N="1116" /> approach to individual taxes shows that its approach has been almost schizophrenic. In 1993 the 1 per cent levy was introduced but this year it was dropped. The probate tax was introduced last year but it has been diluted this year.  Opposition amendments were rejected but now they are being dealt with retrospectively &mdash; an admission of failure. Even between the budget and the Finance Bill, Government policy on residential property tax has oscillated.  This Minister's first budget in 1992 systematically abolished a series of reliefs and tax shelters for investments but this year attempts have been made to reintroduce incentives in a limited fashion for small businesses.</P>

      <P>These U-turns and contradictions show there is no underlying philosophy, policy or strategy in the Government's tax reforms.  The Government's economic policy is based on the politics of the latest soundbyte.  There are no stated targets for the reduction of the debt-GNP ratio.  We have no official transparent Exchange rate policy and we have no target set for the debt-GNP ratio. This Finance Bill neither attempts to improve the competitiveness, efficiency or productivity of our economy nor does it give a dynamic impetus to the labour market.  This Government is content simply to coast along on the coat-tails of the recovery of the international economy while interest rates remain low. With net transfers of around £1 billion per annum from Europe and an improvement in our demographic structure, all seems well, but the critical problem remains.  We have the highest emigration and the second highest unemployment rate in Europe.  Our performance will have to improve dramatically if it is to be considered in any way adequate.  This Bill deals only with these issues in the context of closing the odd loophole accompanied by the marginal shifts and technical adjustments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Government has a tax strategy one theme seems to be emerging <Col N="1117" /> and that is that this Government begrudges home ownership.  The Minister stated that he wants less investment in bricks and mortar.  Last night on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; I heard the Minister of State &ldquo;for the shrinking £8 billion&rdquo; say that she favoured less investment in bricks and mortar.  This antipathy to householders is evident in sections 6 and 105 to 115, inclusive.  The Taoiseach dropped a bombshell as he came out of the conference in Killarney when he said he will merge the residential property tax with local service charges into a new super domestic tax.</P>
    <P>We have a new &ldquo;foot in mouth&rdquo; disease. Every time the Taoiseach escapes from his handlers, minders and scriptwriters he puts his foot firmly in his mouth on tax strategy.  I can see what he is at. He is telling Mr. Niall Andrews, MEP, and those knocking at the doors in Dublin who are feeling the heat of the residential property tax row that residential property tax and local service charges are being reviewed.  It is an attempt to create a smokescreen.  The Minister for the Environment openly renounced what the Taoiseach had to say.  We were told also that it was not discussed at Cabinet.  I am told that Cabinet meetings are so busy trying to patch up the row about proposals in the National Plan not covered by the Community Support Framework that they have not got around to discussing tax.</P>
    <P>We are told also that the Department of Finance is busily working on the hidden agenda of introducing rates by the back door.  What are we to make of this? Monday's newspapers confirmed that officials of the Department of Finance have been working on this review of merging the residential property tax with local service charges.  Some economists have told the Minister that where he went wrong with residential property tax is that he did not go for the big bang scenario and instead of going for a little bit of money he should have gone for a huge pot of money and huge reforms.</P>

      <P>Householders utterly resent any further impositions.  They know if there is to be a change in residential property tax people on lower incomes will have to pay the difference. We know also that for any increased imposition on householders there will be a corresponding cut in the rate support grants to local councils, in other words, it will not be developing more revenue raising powers on local authorities but simply using local councillors to implement the high tax, high spending policies of this Government.  Let us leave the utter confusion caused by the Taoiseach's unwarranted attacks on home owners at the weekend and deal with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Under section 6 there will be a systematic reduction over four years in mortgage tax relief.  Those with a hefty mortgage will not get tax relief at their marginal rate but at the standard rate of tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, on a point of information, before Deputy Yates puts his foot in it may I remind him that his leader went for the big bang in his 1982 budget when he did it all in one year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to this before.  He had the advantage on me because in reply to my speech during Private Members' time he raised that issue and I then checked it out.  When I <Col N="1119" /> looked at the small print of that budget I found it applied only to new mortgages taken out after that date, in other words, there was some understanding for the people who had made long term financial commitments.  What we have here is a universal bang for everybody, particularly for those who have had a mortgage for five years or longer who will be faced with interest relief at the standard tax rate and that is only the start, as section 6 states that their mortgage interest relief will be restricted to 80 per cent instead of 90 per cent of the ceiling of what they can claim.  For every £100 only £80 can be claimed against it.</P>
      <P>It is a lifetime ambition of young couples to get a house of their own, it is the fruit of all of their work.  In spite of their long term financial obligations the ground rules have been changed without notice.  Interest rates are low now but that does not mean that will be the case during the lifetime of the mortgage. Economists in the banks are advising people to take out fixed rate mortgages at the current rate.  It is utterly unfair to make changes for anything other than new mortgages, although I oppose it in principle.</P>
      <P>The poor unfortunates paying PAYE were told by the Tánaiste during one of his brief visits to the country at the height of the residential property tax to wait until they got their revised tax free allowances and they would be better off. People have been shocked beyond belief that the allowances for mortgage interest relief of £3,000 have been gutted by £1,800 because of the cumulative effect of the changes in mortgage interest relief.</P>

      <P>What people are interested in is their take home pay.  If they have a heavy mortgage they believe they have been hit in this Finance Bill.  Prior to the last election both Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party gave a solemn promise that they would not tamper with mortgage interest relief and accused each other of being unreliable on this issue.  These promises are now being discarded with ease.  This shows breathtaking contempt for the electorate.</P>
      <P>The construction industry &mdash; there has been a decline of one-quarter in general contracting in each of the past two years &mdash; is being told that it must suffer because of reduced investment in housing.  This is a labour intensive industry and it has been estimated that tax accounts for 33 per cent of the cost of a new house.  At 80 per cent we have one of the highest rates of home ownership in the OECD and this has been a unique stabilising force in society.  These 350,000 taxpayers who are reeling as a result of the changes in mortgage interest relief feel cheated.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the residential property tax.  Given the outturn for last year it was a major political gaffe to introduce the 1 per cent income levy.</P>

How can the Minister justify the hassle which has been caused for himself, home owners, Niall Andrews and everyone else for the paltry £3 million when he will get 50 times more or £150 million in extra tax receipts?  This unfair and inefficient tax should be repealed. We will table a series of amendments on Committee Stage.  If I call a vote on any of these amendments, in a free vote, there would be no competition because the Deputy Callelys, Deputy Shortalls&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Minister's back benchers generally realise that this tax is unjust.  The first amendment I would like to see is mortgage interest relief calculated on the value of the house.  If the Minister fails to do this the householder will continue to pay tax on behalf of the financial institution.  We will oppose the changes in the thersholds in relation to house income and home values which sparked off the revolt.  The decision to widen the net has caused outrage, particularly in Dublin where, because of higher residential values, and not luxury homes, people will find themselves in the net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners should be obliged to accept or reject the value of a house as submitted by the taxpayer; in other words, if a person living in Deans Grange submits a value of £120,000 it is not fair that ten years later the Revenue Commissioners will be able to say that the house should have been valued at £140,000.  The Revenue Commissioners should be obliged to accept or reject the value in the year of self-assessment.  It is unfair that taxpayers face the prospect that they will be held liable for back tax <Col N="1122" /> if a neighbour's house is sold at a higher value in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Reckonable income for residential property tax should not include the income of the entire household, only the house owner.  This anti-family provision is punitive.  The definition of gross income is also unfair.  Interest from Post Office savings certificates, pre-DIRT interest income, covenant payments and social welfare income of a son or daughter or any other member of the household are included and, at a minimum, these should be disregarded.</P>
    <P>Joint home ownership should not be penalised.  The same thresholds should be allowed in cases involving separate ownership of houses.  I have encountered cases of hardship where people on moderately high incomes and living in very valuable houses were liable to residential property tax.  I have said repeatedly &mdash; this applies to rates, poll tax or residential property tax &mdash; no liquidity or income is available to someone from their house.  They cannot go to the attic and get money.  In such cases a ceiling should apply to residential property tax liability as a percentage of their income, say, 4 per cent.  In other words, someone with an income of £40,000 and living in a very valuable house which they inherited should not be faced with a bill of £5,000, £10,000 or £20,000 in residential property tax.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Finance Bill in 1992 the Minister gave a solemn promise that he would not reduce the thresholds, further having made adjustments at that time.  The fear is that the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil will widen the net and increase the rates again in the future.  If the Minister is rejecting what the Taoiseach said and is taking the side of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, I ask him to give legislative effect to his verbal commitments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The other major group who are reeling is the middle income sector.  This group includes those whose combined income is above the average industrial wage.  The budget was designed to put them in their place; the politics of envy and begrudgery <Col N="1123" /> are alive and well at the Cabinet table. Despite the daily news of an economic boom these people are paying more tax.</P>
    <P>The first assault was on the entitlement of insured workers through the PRSI system.  They are being asked to pay more in PRSI for fewer entitlements. There was an aborted attempt to means test contributory widows' pensions.  Pay-related benefit has been abolished for those who become ill or unemployed. Couples, one of whom is working, and those who work short time, have been devastated by the taxation of unemployment benefit.  I encounter cases of hardship on a daily basis where people who have retired due to illness, who work on a week-on, week-off basis or who are engaged in seasonal work have been gutted by a cut of £7 or £27 a week in take home pay.  I welcome the modest changes the Minister proposes to make on Committee Stage for those who work short time but they need to be built into the system.  Where one spouse is on social welfare and the other is on low pay the tax free allowance will be eaten up in terms of disability benefit.  They will be worse off and will say at Deputies' clinics that it will not pay them to work.  This is very wrong.</P>
    <P>This group will also be hit by having to provide for their own health care costs. As they do not have medical cards they are among the 1.3 million people in the VHI.  They have to pay their own doctors' and pharmacy bills.  In section 8 of this Bill the threshold for bona fide medical expenses is being raised for a single person from £50 to £150 and for a family from £150 to £300.  Under this nasty measure refunds in respect of medical care will be restricted.  This can only be construed as a tax on illness.  The provisions in section 7 to standardise VHI tax relief over the next three years is another attack on self-reliant people.  It will make membership more expensive at a time when the VHI faces the prospect of competition and increasing charges by the Government for private health facilities in public hospitals.</P>
    <P>The effect of the combined mortgage <Col N="1124" /> and VHI standardisation provisions is to send a clear message to people on middle incomes, that they could and should pay more tax.  No future changes in the tax bands for the standard rate of tax have been promised for the next four years to match the drop in VHI and mortgage interest relief.  During the last election Fianna Fáil promised that only single people with an income in excess of £20,000 and in excess of £40,000 for a married person would have to pay income tax at the top rate.  Fine Gael will be tabling amendments to ensure that the first £10,000 of taxable income for a single person and the first £20,000 for a married couple will be taxed at the 27 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister made no move to change the tax treatment of benefit-in-kind, particularly for cars.  The provisions of the 1992 budget were savage and I have met many sales representatives who, through the implementation of the changes at the time have seen all their pay increases lost, there is no sympathy for them in public service circles where payment is made on the basis of mileage.  The elderly are amazed that there has been no increase in the age allowances or exemption limits and an increasing proportion of their pensions will be absorbed in tax.</P>
    <P>Any review of the tax system over the last decade will show that the impact of the income tax code on parents has been particularly harsh.  Combined with the social welfare system, the income tax code discriminates against those in employment.  Poverty traps have been created through the entitlement to fringe benefits based on gross pay.  However, the gross and net income of people on social welfare is the same.  Social welfare payments are incrementally increased with each child dependant.  There is no recognition in the income tax code of the cost of rearing children.  The role of the spouse who has given up employment to work full-time in the home is ignored in the tax treatment of the spouse at work. These factors need to be changed.  Families should be supported through tax reforms with the cost to families of rearing <Col N="1125" /> children formally acknowledged in our tax system.  Fine Gael will, therefore, be proposing the restoration of tax free allowances for dependent children at the rate of £400 per child per annum.  This is separate from the cosmetic changes in the exemption limits which leave the vast majority of people unaided.  Where both spouses are working, tax relief on child care expenses up to £1,000 per annum should be allowed.  Similarly, no change has been made in the case of a dependent relative allowance of £110.  Fine Gael believes this should be raised to £1,000 per annum as the cost would be minimal.</P>
    <P>A special yearly tax allowance of £1,000 should be given to a couple where one spouse is working full-time in the home, conditional on providing care for an adult or child dependant.  I again ask the Minister to consider the position of cohabiting couples who should have the same tax treatment of dependent persons as married couples.  I know someone living with a common law spouse who can claim for that dependent spouse under the social welfare system.  That person took up a job under the social employment scheme but was unable to claim for the dependent partner under the tax system.  This is very unfair and a disincentive to work.</P>
    <P>The Government is only partially implementing the recommendations of the task force for small businesses.  It is estimated that three out of every four new jobs created will be in small enterprises. It is a great pity that the Government could not have lowered the rate of corporation profits tax for companies with a profit of less than £80,000 to the standard rate of 27 per cent.  Similarly no concession was made in the case of dividend income of up to £7,000 per year for full-time directors.  The modification of capital gains tax on business assets held over six years is wholly inadequate. Fine Gael will be proposing four simple measures to help entrepreneurs in small businesses: (a) a new 27 per cent rate of corporation profits tax for profits less than £80,000; (b) an income tax exemption on dividend income to full-time directors up to £7,000 per annum; (c) a <Col N="1126" /> reduction to 20 per cent in the rate of capital gains tax on the appreciation in the value of company shares or business assets held over six years; (d) raising the ceiling of tax relief on pension contributions from 15 to 30 per cent to encourage further private pension provisions among the self-employed.</P>
    <P>I regret that the amendments proposed by the Opposition to last year's Finance Bill relating to the seed capital scheme were rejected.  Last year I contended it would have been easier to get six numbers in the Lotto than to avail of this scheme because it is bound up in red tape.  Will the Minister say how many people have applied?  I am told the number is very low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that six is not too far off the numbers applying under the seed capital scheme.  I do not know if the Minister thinks that six people availing of a scheme makes it a success, but I remember asking him on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill last year how many applicants there would have to be for him to consider it a success.  He did not answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>A fair indicator of the success of any scheme is the number of people who apply.  I am told that in this case it is fewer than 50.</P>
      <P>Universal experience of economies with high level of employment is that job growth comes in the service sector. However, this Government treats the service sector as glorified tax collectors. There is a 40 per cent corporation profits tax, a 40 per cent capital gains tax, PRSI at 21 per cent and VAT at 21 per cent. There is no strategy in this Bill to progressively enhance employment prospects in services over the next four years through phased tax reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individual sub-sectors have enormous <Col N="1127" /> potential.  The hotel industry has sought a 10 per cent corporation profits tax rate to enhance tourism investment.  We are opposed to the 40 per cent corporation profits tax rate on the mushroom industry which I will deal with in detail on Committee Stage.  It is clear that the most imaginative change the Minister could make is to have a three-tiered rate of corporation profits tax comprising rates of 40 per cent, 27 per cent and 10 per cent.  That would allow the Minister to select service sectors with job potential for the 27 per cent rate of corporation profits tax, if he could not afford the 10 per cent rate.  It would be a half-way house and it matches existing taxes.</P>
    <P>The tax treatment of investment still militates heavily against enterprise.  Our rate of new businesses established annually is half that in Europe and America. The favourable tax treatment of Government investment products such as gilts and post office saving certificates is in stark contrast to the regime of restricted capital allowances, corporation profits tax and capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to value added tax which remains our second most significant tax with receipts of over £2.5 billion this year.  I regret the Minister has still not seen fit to give any concession to the clothing and footwear industry despite its employment at retail level of 30,000 people.  The top rate of VAT at 21 per cent is simply too high.  It depresses demand and creates an incentive for black economy operators.  The Minister will have enormous problems with VAT harmonisation in 1996 if the current proposals are implemented and progress is not made in reducing the top rate.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister investigate a number of anomalies in the health care area? Generally speaking, medicine are zero rated for VAT.  However, I have received representations about the anomalous effect by virtue of the 21 per cent rate of VAT applying to the following health care items: vaccines, ointments, incontinence pads, bandages, syringes and suppositories. Will the Minister clarify why the general principle of health care products <Col N="1128" /> being VAT free does not apply to these products?  We will be seeking to have them zero rated on Committee Stage.  Similarly, the 21 per cent VAT rate on crèche facilities and childcare services is causing problems for an area with obvious employment potential.  Of continuing concern is the deaf ear the Minister has turned to the representations of the newspaper and the flour and confectionery industries to reduce the 12.5 per cent VAT rate, despite the threat of further import penetration and subsequent job loss.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate on last year's Finance Bill a strong case was made to widen the eligibility threshold for VAT refunds for non-profit making organisations, with particular reference to fund raising to provide health and education facilities which otherwise would have to be provided by the State. It is absurd that voluntary work should be penalised in that way.  Will the Minister widen the eligibility threshold for such refunds as promised last year?</P>
    <P>We will be opposing section 92 of the Bill which applies 21 per cent VAT to loss adjusters' fees.  Many of us have received representations from people claiming this will increase insurance costs, affect employment and undermine fully registered professionals in the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>Section 94 deals with the issue of travelling fairgrounds.  It is my understanding that people involved in those fairgrounds want the 19 day rule extended to 30 days to provide for facilities such as Funderland, but instead the Minister imposed the 12.5 per cent VAT on all travelling fairgrounds.  Will he extend the 19 days to 30 so that such facilities are eligible for the VAT exemptions?</P>

      <P>Section 90 deals with cash receipts and will assist small service companies with an annual turnover of less than £250,000.  Will the Minister extend that turnover threshold to £1 million? Will he also consider increasing to <Col N="1129" /> £250,000 the weekly prize limit for charitable lotteries which is frozen at £10,000 under section 33 of the National Lottery Act, 1986?  Charitable lotteries are in serious difficulties.  I understand the Taoiseach referred the matter to the Ministers for Justice and Finance.  The buck passing should stop and the maximum individual prize should be £100,000.</P>
      <P>Luncheon vouchers have been frozen at 15 pence per day under the benefit-in-kind scheme.  Canteen facilities are 100 per cent tax allowable for corporation tax purposes and companies who issue vouchers are going out of business.  I welcome the changes in respect of the probate tax, but it should be scrapped altogether.  Its yield is too low to justify it.  The threshold of £10,000 and the lack of relief are unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider providing tax free allowance for university teachers?  I understand in other countries teachers have bona fide expenses in respect of their work on which some allowance should be given.</P>
      <P>A review of the position of disabled drivers was undertaken and there has been correspondence between spokespersons in that regard.  I would like the finalisation of that process published before Committee Stage.  Also, I would like the Minister to ensure that those with one arm or one leg are included for the relief and the 20 per cent condition on the minimum vehicle adaptation cost for disabled passengers should be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not agree with the 45 minute limit on contributions to this debate.  It is ridiculous for a Bill with 147 sections. Our main reason for opposing the Bill on Second Stage is that the tax strategy of this Government on home ownership is unfair and we are learning from statements made in Killarney and elsewhere how penal it will be.  The standardisation provisions will hit the middle income sector, self-reliant people providing for home ownership and medical expenses. We lack a tax reforming strategy, particularly to assist families in low paid employment and there is no overall strategy to reduce the tax burden in times of <Col N="1130" /> economic growth to facilitate an improvement in our competitiveness and allow us convert economic growth and good fundamentals into additional employment opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I read with interest the reported remarks of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith in today's <i>Irish Press</i>.  I removed the front page, placed it in my file and much to my consternation I noted on page three the headline &ldquo;Cork man jailed for taking cash out of man's trousers&rdquo;.  The Minister and the Government are digging so deep into men's trousers and ladies' pockets that he may have to do porridge for a prolonged period if the fate of the Cork man befalls him.</P>
      <P>The political context is clear.  We have a Government with the largest majority in the history of the State and, therefore, a Government with an enormous political capacity to see through whatever strategy it plans to address the fundamental problems of our economy.  Added to that dominant political reality &mdash; a crushing reality in the workings of this House from time to time &mdash; is the economic growth rate which is relatively good compared with many other EU States.  The predictions, regardless of nit-picking, suggest that there is as good, if not better, around the corner.  Given the large majority and the relatively good performance and predictions, the real test of this Government's resolve will not be found in the number of schemes it leaves as a legacy in terms of the tax code or the number of agencies it establishes through the Department of Enterprise and Employment, but rather in how it addresses the fundamental structural problems of our economy.  That is a core test we are entitled to apply to measure the success of the Government.  This Finance Bill, similar to last year's, does not even set out to remedy the key structural defects in the economy.  It is my contention, and that of the Progressive Democrats, that tax reform of substance is still absent from the Government's agenda.  That is the Bill's core defect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the two budgets public expenditure <Col N="1131" /> was targeted to increase by up to 17 per cent.  Inflation has been measured at less than one-fifth of that figure.  Therein lies one major structural flaw.  Since the Government took up office an additional £1.5 billion in public spending has been planned.  That will require an additional £1.5 billion in taxes either now or by way of deferred taxation through borrowing. That growth in public expenditure, substantially greater than the rate of inflation, is a core structural flaw which automatically transfers into higher taxation or deferred taxation through an increased debt rate.  By far the easiest way to fund fundamental tax reform is by sustained control of public expenditure. Serious control of public expenditure would enable us to enjoy the fruits of economic growth.  This would be far better than fiddly arrangements that cause enormous political fallout and angst to families, such as the proposed changes in the residential property tax this year, originally designed to bring in an additional £5 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister set out in his budget speech six principles for tax policy or strategy which he hoped to follow.  The third principle was to focus available resources to widen the tax band.  In the Programme for Government and the Minister's speech that target measure, has been given an extremely soft focus. No expressed target has been set and we have nothing against which to measure progress.  I set a target last year, one recommended in Culliton.  I will run through it again this year to see how well we have jumped the fence.  The Government stated it accepted the recommendations of Culliton, and different Ministers at different times said they were implementing them.  The target set out in Culliton is clear: it states that no more than 20 per cent of taxpayers should be paying tax above the standard rate. Last year the Government moved one-twentieth of the way in the direction of Culliton.  Unless it is anticipating a 20 year life cycle of the partnership formed, it seems a most unambitious target for <Col N="1132" /> those who claim to espouse the Culliton tax philosophy.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated his critics were unfair and that relief on the income tax front this year comes to the creditable amount of £330 million.</P>

      <P>If the Minister studies the features of Table G, accompanying the budget on 26 January, he will see that the greatest contributory factor to that sum results from the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy, which he should not have introduced.  If he is trying to explain away that measure as if it were a stabiliser so that he would not fall off his bicycle, that would say more about his technical cycling merits than about the need for stabilisers that were not required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be palmed off as tax reform.  It was nothing more or less than I described in my response to the Minister's budget speech.  It was an act of tax repentance for something that should never have been introduced and it proved to be wholly unnecessary during the year, as was seen in the outurn.  The principles of tax policy are interesting and the best way to judge them is to look to the Government's two Finance Bills, the major instruments of economic policy, introduced last year and this year and judge them on the basis that actions speak louder than words.  The 1 per cent levy was to be a temporary measure but it applied for a longer period than one year.  There was some knotty bargaining about it during negotiations on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the Minister insisted it would remain but that it would be wound down progressively over several years.  Then it was abolished.  In terms of tax strategy that was designed, as initially presented by <Col N="1133" /> the Minister, as a stabiliser so that he would not fall off his bicycle last year.  It was a stabiliser he wanted to keep on his bike for several years.  The position ended up being one of stop-go.  I am pleased it was abolished, but it is an interesting example of a one step forward, one step back tax strategy.</P>
      <P>The probate tax strategy was introduced last year but in a sense it was not new; it was the death duty revisited, reheated and recycled.  It set out blatantly to disregard the right of inheriting spouses and its implications for inheritance after death in relation to agricultural land were extremely vicious.  The Minister steadfastly refused to drop the tax or amend it in those areas and this year he amended it.  I welcome the amendment but we will oppose the tax this year and propose its abandonment as a bad tax. Death duties should not have been reintroduced when three capital taxes, introduced to replace death duties in the mid-1970s, remain on the Statute Book.  They should be relied on in respect of death duties.  Again, in terms of strategy, that tax represented one step forward, stop-go and two steps back, in so far as the Minister last year espoused a more vigorous form and argued for it on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill and other debates.  That tax and others do not represent tax strategy but something nearer to tax tactics.  It is as if the Government wishes to try taxes out to see how they work and if they do not work well it will pull back.  Government action has not demonstrated tax strategy in respect of the fundamental problem but a series of hit and run tax tactics, to hit the people with a tax this year and run from it next year if it is reeling from political pressure. That is a bad basis on which to make policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know who will be left holding the baby in respect of the residential property tax but the baby is well wrapped up at this stage.  It is something like passing the parcel at a child's party.  The Government is passing it around.  Fianna Fáil Deputies say it was a Labour proposal and those at the upper end of the management reaches of Fianna Fáil are <Col N="1134" /> of the view it is inequitable, bad news for Dublin people, should not have been introduced, and others do not wish to contemplate the alternatives.  Will the Tánaiste and the Labour Party or the Minister for Finance and his departmental advisers be left holding the baby? I wonder where the parcel will end up? It is fascinating to observe the characters and characterisation that make up the story.  At an ECOFIN meeting in Brussels the Minister for Finance mounted what the Irish papers described as a spirited defence of the measure.  He talked about hysterical reaction to it.  He dismissed suggestions that tax discriminated against Dublin people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave a performance full of bluster and bravado.  The Minister said he was sticking to his guns and he rejected the substance of the criticism.  Then he paused for thought.  I will stay with the Minister for the moment because any character introduced in a decent novel develops some characterisation to show more than one dimension.  The day after St. Patrick's Day the Minister introduced a Government Information Service press release from the Department of Finance. He announced the various changes, his stop-go policy on the residential property tax, the one step forward two steps back for this year.  He said the Government remains satisfied that the RPT, as extended, is fully justified.  The travelling funfair moves to the IMI conference in Killarney where the Taoiseach made personal comments.  The Taoiseach has had a great weekend unburdening himself. A great sense of liberation must have overcome him during his visit to Cyprus because he has been unburdening himself of personal thoughts since then.  The Taoiseach is reported in the papers as favouring the replacement of the residential property tax with a new service charge.  One of its key characteristics is that it will be more equitable and he said &mdash; at least in the papers I read &mdash; that <Col N="1135" /> the people in Dublin will be hardest hit and that people feared being clobbered twice.  Before I spoke about the Cork man jailed for taking cash out of a man's pocket I read the front page story in <i>The Irish Press,</i> which reported the Minister for the Environment as saying, that anything that looked like rates could not be proposed and that a super domestic tax, such as that proposed, would be unacceptable to the public.  At one time a certain gentleman was berated in this House for being <i>uno duce, uno voce,</i> but we have now gone a full circle and have <i>multo duce, multo voce</i>.  It is interesting in this new <i>multo duce, multo voce</i> Government to figure out who will carry the can and what will emerge.</P>
      <P>The residential property tax has been disowned by the Taoiseach.  Fair play to him, he told it as he saw it, he spelled it out.  It is an inequitable tax, clobbering people twice, with those in Dublin hardest hit.  The Taoiseach wants to get rid of this tax but the Minister insists that it be imposed.  Deputy Yates is trying to render it more toothless by proposing a series of amendments.  The Progressive Democrats will oppose the sections on an extension of the odious residential property tax and propose its removal. This kind of Lanigan's Ball economics of stepping in and out and complicating matters has left everybody confused.</P>
      <P>I was amused at the Minister's call, without a trace of irony, for a meaningful degree of precision about raising alternative revenue.  I presume that was addressed to people on the Government benches.  The Minister could hardly have the temerity, in the context of the multiplicity of voices from the new Tower of Babel to ask the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance should seriously consider, when this Bill becomes law, approaching his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, to raise finance under section 18 to make a movie of the Bill.  It would be one of the smash comedies of the year and might even qualify for Oscar winning performances.</P>

      <P>That would be a good start or &ldquo;Honey I Shrank their Income&rdquo;.  My impression of the Government, having introduced two Finance Bills, is that it is committed to a radical <i>ad hoc</i> approach but not to any clear strategic thinking. That is the fundamental flaw in the last Finance Act and this Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a general point and I urge the Minister, in the event of the Department or the Revenue Commissioners lacking the manpower resources to deal with this matter, to consider it.  Taxation is a minefield, even for experts.  Deputy Yates talked about giving allowances to academics, presumably to buy books.  I invested in a few hefty tomes last year, one of which, Butterworths Tax Acts, is not comprehensive. The last time we consolidated income tax legislation was 1967, 27 years ago.  This book, which contains about 2,000 pages, is a brief summary of taxation in those 27 years.</P>
      <P>Butterworths published an equally impressive tome on VAT, which was introduced in 1972 &mdash; a summary of the non-consolidated VAT changes in the meantime. We have made no progress on capital taxes, particularly those introduced in the mid-1970s.  The consolidation of taxation legislation is a substantial but necessary exercise.  It is so difficult to go from A to B in our tax code, and even to read this Bill as it is presented, that some Act of consolidation is long overdue and must be contemplated.</P>

One of the main proposals for simplification of the legislation is the last of the six principles referred to by the Minister in his budget speech.</P>
      <P>On mortgage interest relief will the Minister consider introducing a Committee Stage amendment outlining future proposals?  It is very difficult to figure out what the Minister means.</P>

      <P>Section 10 covers the withholding tax scheme and additional accountable persons are referred to.  The Progressive Democrats will be proposing the phased abolition of withholding tax because the basis on which it was introduced has been by passed.  There has been self-assessment since 1987.  Taxation of the self-employed is now assessed on an actual year basis rather than on the basis of the previous year's figures, many public sector agencies demand tax clearance certificates.  This is a double attack on income, which is no longer justified, particularly in the context of the degree of revenue buoyancy.  If the cash flow effect is too great in one year it should be spread over several.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 exempts works of art as <Col N="1138" /> benefit in kind.  I am not clear what the Minister has in mind on the 90 days' viewing access for the public and the four hours a day provision.  I understand this proposal in the context of a big corporation placing a work of art in the lobby and people wishing to view it there, but does the proposal extend to persons placing items in their office?  If so, what is meant by four hours a day, 90 days access and so on?</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister proposed an increase in the capital allowance in respect of cars.  When this allowance was introduced in 1973 it applied to cars such as the Ford Granada.  As a result of last year's changes the allowance applied to cars such as the Ford Fiesta.  The proposed changes will mean that the allowance will apply to cars to the value of the Ford Escort.  I intend putting down an amendment to cover the middle executive car which is valued a little higher and used by many people who claim this allowance.  I welcome the Minister's proposal in this area but further progress is required.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify his reference to royalties and patent income?</P>
    <P>Under section 28 the Minister deals with &ldquo;balloon leases&rdquo;.  If ever I saw a section with plenty of air, this is one.  I pose a challenge to the Minister and his advisers.  Is it possible for a Government committed to pursuing simplification and streamlining of tax legislation to bring in an amendment which is not eight pages long, containing five separate formulae for calculation?</P>
    <P>There should be a George Bernard Shaw prize for drafting this Bill.  The Minister will recall that that gentleman once wrote to someone, &ldquo;My apologies that this letter is so long but unfortunately I did not have the time to write a short one&rdquo;.  Could those who drafted this Bill not have taken a little more time and written a shorter balloon lease than the one before us?</P>
    <P>Section 30 to 42 deal with urban renewal and all that goes with that.  This <Col N="1139" /> is another case where some consolidation is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly rolling up of many of the dates but the Minister backtracks over a whole series of Bills. Consolidation is where one can read all the basic data in one chunk and not have to jump back and forth over a series of Bills.  It is a move in the right direction but substantially short of consolidation.</P>
      <P>Section 34 deals with ministerial designation by street of the new urban renewal incentive.  We will be proposing some process of consultation with chambers of commerce.  There is need for transparency.  I am not saying that the Minister or the Minister for the Environment, or whoever will be involved in these orders, would necessarily ever want to favour any street in their own constituency. Far be it for me to suggest such, but it is proper that this scheme be operated in a transparent way.  Some of the existing urban renewal schemes have displaced business in the traditional business districts of towns and have forced traders to lease a second premises so as not to lose market share.  There are problems in this area which need to be addressed and we will be tabling amendments in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to corporation tax and mushroom growers, I realise the Minister is bound by a European Commission direction following a complaint by the United Kingdom.  He is wrong, however, to introduce a calamitous and sudden change.  He should tell the Europeans he will introduce this on a phased basis.  If that is his intention he should insist, if needs be, on bringing a case to the European Court of Justice.  The Minister can fight against implementation on 1 June 1994 even if he believes he is bound by some European direction.  It is unfair for any tax authority to suppose that one can simply turn off something on which business plans have been made the way one would switch off a light.  It is unfair for any authority, including a European <Col N="1140" /> authority, to insist that that should be done regardless of whatever treaty basis they cite for the decision.  I will be tabling an amendment on this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 51 deals with foreign currency transactions.  There are a number of points in that section which time does not permit me to develop in detail but section 12A.&mdash;(1) (a) (ii) refers to auditors certifying various figures.  That will have to be changed because my understanding of current practice is that auditors no longer certify but they do venture to give what is called an &ldquo;opinion&rdquo;.  Several references in that subsection will need to be changed consequently on that.</P>
    <P>In subsection 14A.&mdash;(1) (a) (ii) there is a phrase &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;.  I do not have time to develop my argument but that phrase in some respects in meaningless because it refers to transactions in a foreign currency in the State in which one engages in them in this State.  This requires redrafting.  There is also a reference to certification which will need to be changed.</P>
    <P>In regard to services, I am glad to see that there is some progress reported but unfortunately there is little established in the Finance Bill regarding taxation for services.  I tabled an amendment last year suggesting a 10 per cent tax rate for third country consultancy services outside the EU and I will be retabling that amendment.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with a number of points concerning capital gains tax, but in particular I will be tabling an amendment in regard to section 60.  There is reference to something which I think is useful, namely, £25 million company allowances.  I do not want to go into detail at this stage but if one were to take the contemporary figure of £25 million, some question must be raised as to whether there should be some backward indexation. I will explore that with the Minister when I table detailed amendments.</P>
    <P>On vehicle registration tax, I propose an amendment to the differential rates, but not in terms of scrapping the rates as requested by the Society for the Irish Motor Industry, which I think is asking for too much.  Anyone who can afford a <Col N="1141" /> top of the range car can afford to pay the additional taxation in the price.  I am in favour of environmentally friendly changes to cars, particularly the fitting of catalytic converters which require larger engine sizes.  There should be some upward adjustment of the cubic capacity on the lower rate and I will be tabling an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>I want to signal to the Minister my intention to raise a topic which I was dealing with yesterday in the Economic Committee of the European Parliament in Strasbourg and which is a cause of considerable concern here, namely, an EU proposal on a minimum threshold for VAT refunds for tourists from third countries outside the EU.  As the Minister is aware, we have no minimum threshold and many small retailers, tourism interests and people in the service sector here, who have the management systems for cash-back here and in the UK, would suffer serious employment consequences if there was a downturn in this sector.  I hope that under Article 99 procedures in Europe, the Minister will refuse unanimity if the EU insists on the 175 ECU threshold.  I tabled a number of amendments to the proposal yesterday and we have refused to give it the urgent treatment requested by the Commission.</P>
    <P>On VAT, I refer to problems raised last year concerning golf clubs.  Some golf clubs pay VAT on green fees and some do not.  Large amounts of Structural Funds have been allocated to the development of private clubs in order to sell them as a tourism product and it is stupid to have them on an unlevel playing field with members clubs.  I realise this is to do with the corporate form of the club but some equitable arrangement will have to be worked out.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Yates intends to table an amendment which would follow the amendment tabled by me last year, and which I intend to table again, concerning voluntary activity in the education and other sectors.</P>
    <P>I understand a study has been carried out in regard to disabled drivers.  I would like to see that detailed in some way on Committee Stage.  I do not believe that <Col N="1142" /> giving a tax break to disabled drivers will create an incentive for people to become disabled.  It does not, therefore, have the classic incentive mechanisms where, as in some kind of Islamic republic, someone would cut off an arm or a leg in order to get a VRT refund on their car.  We should be quite generous on that definition.</P>
    <P>In regard to stamp duties, I am glad that the Minister agrees with my suggestion of last year to involve the Appeals Commissioner in stamp duty matters.  I tabled an amendment to that effect last year and I am happy to claim some credit for the change this year.</P>
    <P>Section 100 refers to stamp duty not being required to be paid on the VAT content of a lease or a transfer.  That is welcome but the Revenue Commissioners screwed some people for that in the past few months and I believe that, in equity, they should get back the stamp duty on the VAT part of the lease or transfer.  Some people have been caught in this regard and they are entitled to some return.</P>
    <P>I dealt at length with the question of residential property tax.  We want to repeal the 1983 basic legislation and get rid of the odium that followed.  We intend to do the same in regard to probate tax because we believe it should never have been reintroduced.</P>
    <P>When a Minister for Finance introduces a 100 per cent increase in any tax the alarm bells ring.  Section 135 provides that trusts should have a tax increase from 3 to 6 per cent.  I have tabled a parliamentary question requesting details of the extent of this.  I do not have one and, therefore, will not bleed over this myself but when I see the rate of taxation on anything being doubled, I want to know why.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the Act of last year and the Bill of this year, this is a Minister for Finance <Col N="1143" /> who is well and truly qualified to dance at Lanigan's Ball.  On every significant tax that he has brought in, it has been a case of one step in, one step out again. On that basis, and on the basis that this Government cannot speak with one voice by party or one voice by Minister, or even one voice by leader, the Minister should take my advice.  He should not dig so deep into our pockets that he suffers the fate of the Cork man jailed for removing cash from a man's trousers this week. He should clearly consider asking his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, for some funding to bring us the movie of this tax debacle which the Minister has the effrontery to describe as a tax strategy.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, noting the commitments given in</P>
      <P>(1)  the Fianna Fáil manifesto of November 1992, which on page 7 promises &ldquo;more democracy and openness, with a genuine role for all the partners in Education, including parents&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>(2)  the Labour Party manifesto of November 1992, which on page 9 says that &ldquo;control of our education system must include a meaningful role for parents&rdquo;; and</P>
      <P>(3)  the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> of February 1994, which on page 68 says that &ldquo;a central concern of the reform of the Education system will be the constitutional prerogatives of parents in relation to the education of their children&rdquo;,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>condemns the lack of consultation by the Minister for Education in recent decisions about new school building projects, in particular in Dunboyne, <Col N="1144" /> County Meath, and calls on the Minister for Education to hold a plebiscite among parents in the Dunboyne area to establish their choice of new second level school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is now stating clearly it supports the rights of parents to decide on the education they wish for their children. This right is enshrined in the Constitution and Fine Gael will always defend it whatever the parental choice, be it a community college, a community school or a voluntary secondary school.  Fine Gael recognises the value and commitment of each type of school and is not expressing a preference for any school type in this motion but rather emphasising the supremacy of the rights of parents.</P>
    <P>A campaign for a new school was conducted in an efficient and enthusiastic manner by the Dunboyne Post-Primary School Action Committee.  The village of Dunboyne experienced a major population explosion in the 1970s.  By the early 1980s there was a general desire among the parents in the locality that a second level school be provided.  At that time children attending second level schools were brought by bus from Dunboyne to schools in the surrounding areas.  The Dunboyne Post-Primary School Action Committee was established in 1983.  It met the Minister for Education of the day, former Deputy Gemma Hussey, and outlined the case for a second level school in Dunboyne.  It continued to lobby politicians and to make its case strongly.  In 1985 it received a commitment from the Minister that a second level school would be built in Dunboyne.</P>
    <P>This sanction was progressed a step further in 1986 by the then Minister for Education, former Deputy Cooney, who gave the go-ahead for either a voluntary secondary school or a community school.  A site was offered by the Diocese of Meath for either school in a letter dated 27 October 1986 to the Secretary of the Department of Education from Bishop Michael Smith.  In 1987 there was a change of Government and the <Col N="1145" /> incoming Fianna Fáil Government put this project on the back burner.  It was around this time that the Dunboyne area was put into the greater Dublin area for post-primary education purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education of the day, Deputy O'Rourke, commissioned two studies of school services in that area, each called the Bannon study, the second of which was published in January 1992 and recommended that there be a second level school for Dunboyne.  It should be noted that to date the first Bannon study remains unpublished although its contents are widely known and speculated on in the area.</P>
    <P>Correspondence continued between the school action committee and the Department of Education.  There continued also a steady stream of correspondence between public representatives in the area and successive Ministers for Education.</P>
    <P>On 10 February 1992, Mr. Liam Murphy, diocesan adviser on post-primary education in the Diocese of Meath wrote, on the authorisation of the bishop, Dr. Michael Smith, to the Department of Education, offering: &ldquo;I am to confirm that a site adjacent to the community centre is available, subject to the terms hereunder&rdquo;&mdash; those terms being that, if it was to be a voluntary secondary school, the diocese would provide the site free of charge and if it was to be a community school the Department could purchase this site from the Church authorities and that this would be the local contribution to the total cost of the project.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, in the second paragraph of a letter to Deputy Mary Wallace on 30 April 1993 concerning the second level school in Dunboyne stated:</P>
    <P>Currently my Department is looking at the suitability of a site adjacent to the Dunboyne Community Centre. Details in relation to the site have been requested from the local authority and from those involved in the building of the adjacent centre.  However, before the matter can be progressed further it is necessary to ascertain whether the <Col N="1146" /> school is to be a community school or a secondary school as this will determine whether the site has to be purchased by the Department.  The matter of the type of management structure for the new school is currently under consideration but may ultimately only be determined when the White Paper on Education is published.</P>
    <P>I will be pursuing the matter and will keep you informed of any developments in the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister had only two types of school in mind for Dunboyne at that time.  The Department wrote to the secretary of the Dunboyne community centre seeking details about the suitability of the site on 23 April 1993 and a response was sent to the Department on 29 April 1993 indicating that no difficulties had been encountered in the building project there.  In the Dáil debate of 7 December 1993, Deputy John Bruton raised the question of the provision of a second level school at Dunboyne.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Liam Aylward &mdash; column 1830 of the Official Report &mdash; said:</P>
    <P>A site adjacent to Dunboyne community centre and in the ownership of the diocese is considered a suitable location for the proposed new school. ...It was expected that the new school would be a community-type school and accordingly an offer was made to the Catholic Bishop of Meath, Dr. Smith, for the purchase of the site.  In response to the offer for the site, Dr. Smith seemed to indicate his preference for a diocesan secondary school.  Departmental officials met the bishop subsequently and he confirmed this interest.</P>
    <P>The Bishop of Meath followed up this discussion with a letter to the Department outlining his preferences for the type of school for that area and stated: &ldquo;My wish is that a mixed diocesan post-primary school be built in Dunboyne... I will make the site available for such a school.&rdquo;  This letter was acknowledged on 5 October 1993 and the final sentence <Col N="1147" /> read: &ldquo;We will be in touch with you again on the matter shortly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 22 June 1993 the Dunboyne Post-Primary School Action Committee, accompanied by local Dáil representatives, met the Minister for Education to press the urgency of sanctioning a school.  The question of the type of school was not discussed at that meeting nor referred to by any of the participants. At this meeting the Minister undertook to buy the site in Dunboyne and this was a clear indication to all present that the Minister would provide either a voluntary secondary school or a community school for this locality.</P>
    <P>If it was intended to build a community college the Minister would have indicated at the meeting that she would ask Meath Vocational Education Committee to procure a site for that purpose.  Her statement that she was interested in this site indicated clearly that her option was either for a voluntary secondary school or a community school.  Any subsequent statements by the Minister or by Deputies acting on her behalf on radio programmes or elsewhere that no indication was given of the type of school to be built in Dunboyne are totally misleading and downright deceptive.</P>
    <P>On 7 July last year the Dunboyne Post-Primary School Action Committee met officials of the Department of Education to outline clearly that a community school was the choice of the vast majority of parents in the area.  This leads me to the major question about who should make the decision on the type of school to be provided in any locality.  Before answering this question the Minister should look at Articles 42.1 and 42.2 of the Constitution which states:</P>
    <P>1.  The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable rights and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>2.  Parents shall be free to provide <Col N="1148" /> this education in their homes or in private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State.</P>
    <P>The Constitution gives parents freedom of choice in terms of the education of their children and imposes on them the duty to provide the education they deem most suitable for their children.</P>
    <P>This freedom of choice has been recognised for some considerable time.  We could cite many examples where parents had their choice of school established in their area.  In 1986 the parents in Ashbourne had to make a decision on the type of school which should be provided in their locality.  It was agreed that a public meeting should be called at which the parents were addressed by representatives of the different types of schools &mdash; Sean Ó Beachain represented the Coolmine community school, Liam O'Donnell, the chief executive officer of Meath vocational education committee, represented the vocational school sector and Liam Murphy represented the voluntary secondary school sector.  At the end of the meeting the participants voted overwhelmingly in favour of a community school.  This decision was conveyed to the Department of Education which honoured the wishes of the people &mdash; a community school is at present being built in Ashbourne.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be confused about who she met to discuss the school in Dunboyne and the discussion she had with them.  On 1 March last in reply to question on this matter put down by me the Minister said: &ldquo;I spoke to public representatives, members of the vocational education committee and to some parents&rdquo;.  However, one week later, on 8 March, in reply to written Parliamentary Questions Nos. 177, 178 and 179 tabled by me, the Minister said: &ldquo;I did not personally meet members of County Meath vocational education committee to discuss proposals for a new school in Dunboyne&rdquo;.  There is a contradiction between those statements; on one hand the Minister says she met members of County Meath vocational education committee but on the other <Col N="1149" /> she says she did not.  Will she clarify with whom she met and how she reached her decision?  What is the real story?  Which statement is true?  The Minister must clarify the matter tonight.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of January last a rumour circulated among Labour Party activists in Dunboyne that the Minister had ideological problems with either a voluntary secondary school or a community school.  To clarify the situation the Diocesan adviser, Mr. Murphy, sought a meeting between the Minister and the Bishop of Meath.  Within two days of the Minister agreeing to the meeting an announcement was made on local radio that a community college had been sanctioned for Dunboyne.  This announcement was made without prior notification to the Dunboyne Post-Primary School Action Committee, which had had protracted discussions and correspondence with the Department of Education, or to the Bishop of Meath, who also had volumes of correspondence from and numerous meetings with the Department on this issue.  The Minister was blatantly discourteous to these people who were going about their business and exercising their democratic right.</P>
    <P>Letters were issued to the action group and the bishop the day after the announcement was made on radio.  It is interesting to note that there were three factual errors in the text of the very short letter sent to the Bishop of Meath.  This indicates clearly that the letter was prepared hastily and rushed out to compensate for the void which had been left in the handling of this matter.</P>
    <P>In 1987 a poll was carried out of 1,100 households in the Dunboyne area to assess people's preference in the choice of secondary school.  They were given a choice of two schools &mdash; a community school or a vocational education committee college.  Seventy per cent of those questioned expressed a preference for a community school while 20 per cent expressed a preference for a vocational education committee college and 10 per cent were undecided.  That preference was reinforced by the decision taken by <Col N="1150" /> the 600 people approximately who attended the meeting in Dunboyne on 21 February last, after the announcement was made by the Minister.  It was unanimously agreed at the meeting to write to the Minister requesting her to change her decision in favour of a community school for Dunboyne.  The Minister choose to ignore this request.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that £500,000 of taxpayers money can be frittered away to satisfy the ideological drive of the Minister for Education&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when this money could have been saved by the acceptance of the wishes of the parents in this area and the Department could have secured a site at a nominal price from the Diocese of Meath.  It is interesting to note that the unit cost of the school choice of the Minister will be much higher than the unit cost of the school choice of the parents. This will place further long term burdens on the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I have outlined the clear preference of the parents in that area in terms of the choice of school for their children.  The Constitution clearly enshrines the right of parents to decide the type of education their children receive.  The Labour Party manifesto of November 1992 stated clearly that it envisaged parents having an important role in the education of their children.  The Minister was chairperson of the Labour Party at the time this manifesto was issued.  It states that &ldquo;Control of our education system must include a meaningful role for parents&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>What of the Fianna Fáil Party in this débâcle?  The Fianna Fáil manifesto of November 1992, page 7, promised &ldquo;more democracy and openness with a genuine role for all the partners in education, including parents&rdquo;. Indeed, Deputy Mary Wallace of the Meath constituency indicated very clearly to the parents in Dunboyne that she goes along with those sentiments and disagrees with the imposition of a community college on the people of Dunboyne. I am delighted to note that Deputy Wallace is present.  I wonder whether she will contribute to this debate and indicate clearly where she stands. More importantly, when it comes to voting time tommorrow evening, I wonder whether she will go with the parents in the Dunboyne area or with the Fianna Fáil Party and their partners in Government, and with the ministerial decision. The division in the House tomorrow evening at 8.30 p.m. will decide where Deputy Wallace stands in that respect.</P>
      <P>In an article in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> of Saturday, 19 March 1994, Deputy Mary Wallace is quoted as saying at a vocational education committee meeting:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mary Wallace pointed out <Col N="1152" /> that while the public representatives would carry out the wishes of the parents in the area in campaigning for a voluntary-run community school for the village, the vocational education committee had to obey the Minister's directions.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Sir, I was quoting from the newspaper article, my apologies.  The article said:</P>
      <P>Mr. Ray Burke sought the approval of his parliamentary party colleagues for a motion which committed Fianna Fáil to ensure that Government policy &ldquo;would recognise the role of the religious in Irish education&rdquo;.  Mr. Burke worried that the White Paper would adopt &ldquo;a totally secular route&rdquo; which, he said, would not recognise where we are at in Ireland at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Burke is happy with the imposition of this school on the people of Dunboyne or will he, in the course of this debate, set out clearly what is his thinking and perhaps even that of the Fianna Fáil Party on this issue.  We might even have Deputy Seán Haughey who, in a much heralded recent speech &mdash; not delivered after all &mdash; expressed dissatisfaction with the recent education decisions taken by this Government.  I wonder whether Deputy Haughey will come into the House and indicate where the Fianna Fáil Party stands on this issue, or is the Fianna Fáil Party in free fall, allowing the tune to be called entirely by the Labour Party?  Is it prepared to stand aside on these educational issues allowing its minor partners in Government <Col N="1154" /> to call the tune irrespective of the consequences for future generations?  I look forward to a representative of the Fianna Fáil Party indicating clearly where it stands on this issue.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the Labour Party manifesto, which has been reneged on and having reviewed the Fianna Fáil manifesto and found that that too has been ignored, I want to turn the attention of the House briefly to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> published in February 1994 about the time the decision was taken in relation to the Dunboyne school, but before the ink had had time to dry on this document the Minister had reneged on commitments given therein.  I refer Member to page 68, paragraph 6.45 which says:</P>
    <P>A central concern of the reform of the education system will be the constitutional prerogatives of parents in relation to the education of their children.</P>
    <P>We are in the ironic position in which the promises of the Labour Party have been reneged on as have those of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Indeed, the promises made jointly by the coalition partnership of Fianna Fáil and Labour have been reneged on.  Is this the great injection of trust into politics, the catch cry of the Labour Party before the last general election? Is this the gift being bestowed on the electorate by the first ever Labour Minister for Education?</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to the report of the National Education Convention which states on page 9:</P>
    <P>Here the keynote is consultation in partnership as distinct from rule by diktat or prescriptive imposition.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister decided so blatantly to ignore the wishes of these parents, but, then, rule by diktat is something at which this Minister appears to be good.  Then there was the Minister's recent proposal to establish a group to advise on sex education without any representation from the teacher unions, from the mangement boards of the schools or of the parent's representative <Col N="1155" /> bodies.  Are they not decision, such as the one the Ministers has made in relation to Dunboyne, which promoted an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 10 April 1994, written by Eilish O'Hanlon which said:</P>
    <P>There you have it in a nutshell, Niamh Breathnach is too keen on pursuing her own all-encompassing mini revolutions in Irish education to care whether teachers and parents, let alone bishops, are being carried along with her.  It could yet prove to be her undoing.</P>
    <P>In another article published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 27 March 1994, Eilish O'Hanlon wrote about the Minister's refusal to appoint the boards of the regional technical colleges and said:</P>
    <P>The Minister has chosen confrontation before compromise, rule by diktat before rule by democracy.</P>
    <P>The National Parents Council &mdash; post-primary &mdash; the umbrella orgnisation for eight parent groups has deplored the Minister's decision about the Dunboyne school, stating:</P>
    <P>The Dunboyne Post-Primary School Action Committee wishes to express concern at the violation of parents' rights to choice of school by the decision taken by the Minister for Education, Ms Niamh Breathnach, T.D. This decision imposed a community college on parents who had requested a community school and were given to understand that such would be granted.  Choice in education is a basic parental right &mdash; recognition of this right is crucial if minority or cultural views are to be respected.  This right is sacrosanct to parents.  The concept of parents as partners as expressed in the Green Paper is merely a hollow aspiration if the voice of parents is not listened to and their specific request not acceded to by the Minister for Education. It is feared also that the exercise of democracy has been abandoned in <Col N="1156" /> favour of an ill-thought out, speedy autocratic solution.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister cannot talk about involving parents in education and yet blatantly disregard their preferences in relation to schools.  It will probably be said in this debate that adult education in the Dunboyne area would be neglected or non-existent if a community school was to be built in the area.  That is a misconception.  A study of the volume of adult education which is conducted in second level schools will show that 40 per cent of all adult education takes place in community schools, despite the fact that there is such a small number of community schools.  Let there not be any misconception of misinformation on that front.</P>
    <P>In bringing this motion before the House I hope the Minister will be magnanimous and brave enough to recognise the rights of parents and, establish once and for all, through a further plebiscite, what the wishes of the parents in the Dunboyne area are and, having listened to an assessed those wishes, that she will be courageous enough to allow them have the choice of school they have requested.</P>

In the early sixties I put into practice those sentiments in a school a few miles outside Carlow town.  I do not know whether to conclude from that that I should be Minister now but maybe the future holds something for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not side-track me on that issue.  What the Minister said is important because parents are important in education and they have to be seen to be important. There is no point talking about the importance of parents if their decision is ignored.  That is why it is more important <Col N="1157" /> to allow parents inside the Marlborough Street thinking than inside the gates of any particular school because the Minister will decide the type of education their children will get.  I believe the Minister should seriously reconsider the position of the Dunboyne school in view of the fact that the parents have spoken so clearly and so eloquently in favour of their choice.</P>
      <P>Some teachers in vocational and other schools feel they have been slighted when it was suggested that their teaching of religion was not up to standard.  I compliment the many lay teachers in all schools who, down the years, have kept religion alive but unfortunately, that is waning at this stage.  This choice is not a reflection on lay teachers in other schools who have done so much.  It is a choice the parents have made, and it is one I welcome.  It would be no harm if religion was considered important for parents and children.  The media would be delighted to see this as a Church-State confrontation but it no such thing.  This is a question of parents rights.</P>
      <P>My colleague has quoted from Labour policy documents, Fianna Fáil policy documents and agreed Government documents.  Talking about the rights of parents is only of benefit in a debating society if you do not put what is written into practice; in this case it means listening to the parents in Dunboyne.  We should not allow this issue to be treated as a Church-State confrontation, a ploy used by some people to sell newspapers. When we recall the dreadful murder of Jamie Bulger we begin to wonder what part religion played in the education of the young boys who killed him.  Even though some people may regard religion in schools as going back to the Ice Age, I have no hesitation in saying that if there was more religion in schools and our lives there would be more respect for life.  There is a religious conflict in the North but if religion was alive there, there would not be so many brutal murders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will counteract the effect of films?  Even in what is regarded as a normal film, we can see a person being <Col N="1158" /> bashed to death.  We must have moral standards.  I am not in favour of nondenominational or multinational schools which probably do not teach pupils anything about religious and moral standards.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that 70 per cent of the parents in Dunboyne have made a decision and that only 10 per cent are undecided, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position.  There is no point talking about the role of parents, there is no point wanting to be remembered as the Minister who opened gates if she has closed her mind against the majority decision.  The Minister is intelligent enough to listen to a simple plea.  The fact that a site is available leads me to believe that she will agree to build a community school in Dunboyne.  I welcome the parents' decision and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann congratulates the Minister for Education for involving all the partners of education in the preparations for change in our education system and, in particular, the role of the National Education Convention which was an outstanding example of such involvement and was furthermore an innovation in Irish education in terms of openness and consultation and notes</P>
      <P>&mdash;the recent Position Paper on Local Structures which includes proposals for a meaningful role for parents in education through representation in such structures and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the greatly increased budget for <Col N="1159" /> capital buildings for second level education</P>
    <P>&mdash;the decision of the Minister to sanction a second level school in Dunboyne after an 11 year campaign and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Minister's concern that this school will cater for the full range of abilities and provide for adult and continuing education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amended motion before the House refers to the National Education Convention. This is my firm belief in the consultative process and the convention is a prime example of my willingness to consult with the partners in education on the major educational issues of the day. The report of the convention describes it as:&mdash; ... a very significant dimension of the wide ranging consultative process on the Green Paper&rdquo; ... and contains the following observation:</P>
    <P>The National Education Convention provided a forum for mature reflection and focused debate by representatives of many of the agencies involved.  It set out to encourage participants to clarify viewpoints; to question, probe and analyze varying perspectives; to foster multi-lateral dialogue and to improve mutual understanding between sectional interests.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the convention, I undertook to publish a position paper on local education structures.  I have since done so.  I should mention in this connection that the position paper clearly recognises and affirms parents' role as partners in the education process and copperfastens this by providing for parents' representation on the proposed educational structure.</P>
    <P>The record shows that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have been ever conscious of the need for consultation and have consulted widely on various issues, but decisions have to be made and in the final analysis it is I, as Minister, who has to make them.  It may not be possible always to please all <Col N="1160" /> the interest groups but I cannot allow that to deflect me from doing what I think is best in any particular set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>The current issue in Dunboyne centres around whether the area should be served by a community college or a community school.  In this context it might be helpful to outline some of the history of the community college concept.  The term community college originated in the late seventies when vocational education committees sought to put forward an alternative model to the community school which was increasingly being seen as the only option for green field schools. During his term of office &mdash; 1979-81 &mdash; the former Minister for Education, Mr. John Wilson, gave a commitment that vocational education committees would get a fair share of green field schools and the term community college came into popular use.  A definition of what it was emerged from its being put forward as an alternative to a community school.  An &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; community college would therefore be the sole post-primary school for its area; a green field school or an amalgamation of existing schools; and a school with a large enrolment capable of providing a broad comprehensive curriculum.</P>
    <P>One of the priorities in the Programme for a Partnership Government is to provide all communities with proper school buildings.  Since taking office, I have doubled the capital expenditure for second level school buildings from £19 million to £38 million this year.  I mention this to illustrate the seriousness which I and this Government place in the commitments made to the people by this Government in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  This increase has allowed me to give the go ahead to 38 major building projects in 1994, including five community schools and six community colleges.  In addition seven community schools and four community colleges are in course of priority architectural planning. It is interesting to note that of the total moneys provided for 1993 and 1994, 33 per cent goes to the vocational sector <Col N="1161" /> while 41 per cent goes to the community-comprehensive sector.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with the background to the Dunboyne case.  The request for a post-primary school in Dunboyne goes back many years.  In September 1982, 12 years ago, the parent-teacher association of the Dunboyne primary schools organised a meeting of parents to ascertain the level of interest in the area for a post-primary school.  A committee was elected to examine the situation.  The committee reported in July 1983 that there were sufficient children in the area to warrant a post-primary school.  In June 1985 the then Minister approved, in principle, the provision of a post-primary school to cater for up to 40 pupils, initially, with provision to be made for further extension if required. The timing of the school would be dependent not only on the availability of capital resources but also on the availability of pupil places in existing schools in the south Meath, North Kildare and northwest Dublin areas.  A site owned by the parish was stated to be available for a new school.  This site had originally been acquired by the Servite Order who intended building a school.  When these plans fell through the site was acquired from the order by the parish.  A community centre was built in 1988-89 on part of the site which it was hoped would be available for use by the new school when such was provided.</P>
    <P>The question of the timing of the provision of a new school was discussed on a number of occasions and deferred on the basis that places were available for pupils from Dunboyne in a number of schools in the surrounding areas, mainly, Maynooth vocational school, Dunshaughlin community college, Coolmine community school, Blakestown community school, Riversdale community college, Dominican convent, Cabra&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and St. Declan's secondary school, Cabra.  It became evident in 1991 that some pupils from Dunboyne were having difficulty obtaining <Col N="1162" /> places in schools within a reasonable distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided in August 1991 to engage the service industries research centre in UCD to undertake an independent study of the Castleknock &mdash; Blanchardstown &mdash; Dunboyne areas to determine if new post-primary schools were required and, if so, the required size and appropriate location.  The consultants concluded finally that new schools should be provided in Hartstown, Dunboyne and Castleknock.  The recommendations of the consultants were accepted and a new school was opened in Hartstown in September 1992.  That new school building is now nearing completion.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with a deputation regarding Dunboyne in June 1993, I was pressed to open the Dunboyne school in termporary accommodation in September 1994 because of the difficulties some pupils from the areas were having in obtaining places in existing schools.</P>
      <P>I subsequently asked my Department to examine the enrolment situation and report back to me.  I had previously asked that the site owned by the parish would be examined regarding suitability for a new school and that assuming it was suitable, it would be valued by the Valuation Office and an offer made for its purchase. When an opening offer for the site was made to the Catholic Bishop of Meath, Dr. Smith, he seemed to indicate that he would be interested in being involved in the provision of a secondary school under diocesan management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>He confirmed his interest in such a development at the end of September 1993.  The matter was subsequently referred to me to take a decision on an opening date for the new school and the type of management the <Col N="1163" /> school should have.  I should mention that the significance of the type of management of the school with regard to the site is that in the case of a community type school the site would be acquired by the Department whereas with a secondary school the diocesan authorities would be responsible for the provision of the site.  Having considered all the factors involved in detail&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I decided in February 1994 that the school should be a community college under the aegis of County Meath Vocational Education Committee and that it should commence operations in September 1994.  I was particularly anxious that the new school should open in September 1994 in view of the fact that the local community had been waiting for a school of their own for several years and because a significant number of children from the area were having difficulty obtaining places in existing schools for September 1994.</P>
      <P>Where a decision has to be taken on the type of management structure to be applied to a new post-primary school erected in an area which previously did not have such a school the features of each particular case are taken into account.  The wishes of parents of the area in question form one such feature for consideration.  Their views will normally be communicated to me, as Minister, through a local committee of parents and education bodies such as the vocational education committee.</P>

      <P>I met with a deputation from Dunboyne in June 1993, which included representatives of the local action committee, to discuss the provision of a second-level school in Dunboyne.  I also received correspondence from this group concerning the matter, including the issue of the preferred type of school for the area.  The primary concern expressed by the action group was that a school would be in place by September 1994 &mdash; they did not indicate undue concern about the type of management structure the school would have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most anxious that the school will commence operations <Col N="1166" /> in September in view of the fact that a significant number of parents in the Dunboyne area were unable to obtain places for their children in existing schools.  To this end a principal teacher has been appointed to the new school and a successful enrolment day took place on Saturday, 9 April last.  It appears the site owned by the parish will not be available for the new school.  I regret this.  County Meath vocational education committee is pursing the question of obtaining an alternative site for the permanent school building.</P>
      <P>The new school will open for September 1994 and plans will be put in place to provide a permanent school building as soon as possible.  The new building will be designed, built, furnished and equipped to the highest possible standards and will provide an excellent educational environment.  It will be a facility of which the local community can be proud in coming years.</P>
      <P>The first enrolments in the new school took place on 9 April.  On that day 60 students were enrolled.  Not alone were they enrolled but they were accompanied by the 120 parents involved and there have been further enrolments since.  This speaks for itself even if it has gone unreported in the media which so diligently pursued this issue.</P>
      <P>I hold the community college concept in high esteem.  The thousands of students and their parents, who are receiving their education in the community colleges are receiving top quality education, fully approved by my Department. Furthermore, the religious education of all students in such colleges is fully catered for by having fully qualified teachers of religion, a requirement that does not exist in some of the other models of second level schools.  Any suggestion that a community college would provide an education inferior in quality or insensitive to parents wishes is simply wrong and a slur on the thousands of parents, teachers and students who are presently involved in community colleges.</P>

      <P>Community colleges throughout the country have been very successful.  I have outlined the background to the establishment of community colleges and from what I have said, Deputies will be aware that there is nothing new in the community college concept.  They have been functioning satisfactorily for years.  This is particularly true in the case of counties Cork and Dublin where several of the community colleges operate.  In these cases, the vocational education committees have entered into discussion with the Church authorities and have agreed a model agreement under which the schools operate.  There is no problem with these arrangements which operate to the satisfaction of both the vocational education committees in question and the Church authorities.  It is clear the Church authorities have no problem with community colleges, either in principle or in practice, and they play an active part in the running of these schools.</P>
      <P>I want to reassure the parents of Dunboyne about the educational provision being made for their children.  They should give their wholehearted support to the new school and I ask them to do so.  It would be a great pity if any initial negative attitudes to the school were to damage it in any way.  I say to the parents: &ldquo;This is the school for your children; as one of the essential partners in its operation you have a most vital interest in securing its successful future; you should row in behind the management, the principal and other staff to ensure that your school is a resounding success&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have had this opportunity to clarify the position in relation to Dunboyne and I am sure the House will agree that I and my Department are making every effort to provide a badly needed resource in the Dunboyne area.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that Fine Gael has decided to use the people of Dunboyne as a political football in an attempt to improve its falling ratings.  It is even more regrettable that the people of Dunboyne are being presented as ungrateful by appearing to refuse a <Col N="1168" /> vocational education committee second level school.  This is unfortunate because the vast majority of people from Dunboyne are delighted that the Minister has taken swift and positive action by giving the go-ahead for the school for which they campaigned for many years.  Deputy Bruton, who is from the parish of Dunboyne, failed to deliver even though he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Minister for Finance during that period.</P>
      <P>Some of the statements issued by people who should know better were, at worst, inaccurate, and, at best, economical with the facts.  The veiled attacks on vocational education committee run colleges were scandalous creating an impression that such colleges were inferior and, by implication, less religious than other second level schools.  The attack on the Labour Party was disgraceful. It was claimed that we were attempting to take religion out of schools by supporting a vocational education committee run school in Dunboyne.  That was even more disgraceful because not alone was it an attack on the Labour Party, it was an attack on the very fine teachers, parents and boards of management throughout Ireland who have dedicated their lives to ensuring that all children are given an equal opportunity in our community colleges, and none more so than the hundreds of children and parents who were educated in community colleges in Maynooth and Dunshaughlin. At present there are approximately 150 children from Dunboyne attending those colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What must these children think &mdash; that they are receiving an inferior education, that they are less Christian or religious?  Of course they are not.  People who oppose the community college in Dunboyne, small in number though they are, should in future think and act in a more compassionate, tolerant and Christian way before handing out statements.  It is time the facts relating to the Dunboyne school were put on record.  If some people have a wider agenda, I suggest they find a different playing pitch.  This debate is <Col N="1169" /> not about ideology.  It is about a parish looking for a school and getting it, thanks to a Labour Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>On 25 May 1993 I, like other public representatives, was invited to attend a public meeting in Dunboyne about the building of a second level school.  This meeting of several hundred people gave the clear message, that the people of Dunboyne wanted a second level school and that the type of management structure was not an issue.  I defy those Deputies from Meath who attended that meeting to contradict that.  On 22 June 1993 a delegation from the post-primary committee, with the public representatives, met with the Minister for Education and conveyed in a constructive and forthright way the views which were expressed at the public meeting the previous month.  At no stage did they express to the Minister that they wanted a particular type of school or that they would refuse or object to a community college.</P>

The Minister was advised that there was a site available for a second level school owned by the people in the trusteeship of St. Fintan's Trust which is administered by the Bishop of Meath.  When the Minister got a report from the Valuation Office, her Department made an initial offer for the site to the Bishop of Meath&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At that time Bishop Smith indicated that he had a preference for a diocesan secondary school.  On 8 October 1993 the Bishop confirmed this in correspondence with me.  He indicated that it was the preferred option of the people of Dunboyne.  This was the first indication I had of such a view as certainly it was not indicated at the public meeting of 25 May.  Nothing happened until a letter was sent to the Minister on 15 December 1993 by the chairperson of the Post Primary Action Committee, a copy of which was sent to me.  That letter stated: &ldquo;It is our feeling, and we are very much in touch with the opinions of this community, that a voluntary secondary school would command the broadest support in the area.&rdquo;  That is, of course, a diocesan secondary school.  This again was a new departure from the views expressed at the public meeting and at the meeting with the Minister.  I met the committee on 10 January 1994 and challenged them about their letter and the Bishop's response to the Minister's offer. They expressed the view that they wanted a school and did not have a preference as to the type of school and that the Minister should decide.  I requested that this be put in writing to the Minister.  They refused to do this.</P>
      <P>I received a letter from the committee on 19 January 1994 outlining some of the issues raised at the meeting of 10 January. Again, no reference was made to a particular type of school.  They just wanted a school.  On 9 February 1994, the day the Minister announced the school for Dunboyne&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the Minister's decision was discussed at a public meeting on 21 February 1994 it was obvious there was much confusion caused by people opposed to a vocational education committee-managed school.  However, the vast majority of people were more concerned and angry about the proposal to have the temporary accommodation based at Hartstown while the school was being built.  I relayed that message to the Minister and was extremely pleased that the Minister took it on board and agreed to base the temporary accommodation in Dunboyne.  This news was received with great joy which subsequent events have confirmed, that is the enrolment of 60 children on the first day of enrolment.</P>
      <P>It must be acknowledged that the vocational education committee has played a major role in the implementation of the Minister's decision.  The appointment of a principal &mdash; whom we all wish well &mdash; the acquisition of a site from Meath County Council for the temporary accommodation, the arrangements for enrolment and the efforts to clear up the confusion caused by misinformation confirms that the Minister was correct in her decision which eliminated miles of potential red tape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Bishop of Meath has refused the site which was always recognised by the people of Dunboyne as the site for the second level school.  This site is adjacent to land which <Col N="1172" /> the Land Commission gave to the parish in 1934.  However, I am happy to say that the vocational education committee is presently in negotiations with another landowner.</P>
    <P>I appeal to those objecting to this college &mdash; and this includes the mover of the motion &mdash; to consider the only people who should be considered, the children, and put their full weight behind the college. To do otherwise could seriously affect the confidence of the children who will attend from next September onwards and who are at present attending the community college.  What is needed now is compassion, tolerance and understanding. We should be more Christian in our attitude towards the people of Dunboyne and allow them to get on with their lives and celebrate their victory in achieving their cherished goal, a second level school in their village to which to send their children.  If others have a different agenda, I suggest they take their views elsewhere.  Our children's education is not something that people should play politics with.</P>

      <P>I regret that we have to debate this issue but undoubtedly it has aroused a great deal of feeling and contention. Those of us who have been involved in education particularly regret what has happend in the past few months. I looked forward to seeing the Minister for Education in action and from my background in Education I appreciated the difficult job she faced.  The early indications were that she did not come into the job with answers for everything.  She was prepared to listen and not just apply formulae and expect to get pat answers. She was prepared to consult, listen and create opportunities for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a time for listening, for policy making, for discussion and for action, and in this case the Minister got it all mixed up.  She has the benefit of the Green Paper deliberations, the National Education Convention and a number of advisory groups; but while those consultative <Col N="1173" /> processes take place she has turned consultation on its head, resulting in a row about something which should have been joyous.  The Minister has put down an amendment to the motion, part of which lauds herself for sanctioning a second level school in Dunboyne after an 11 year campaign.  That should be lauded but, unfortunately, she has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in this case and we now have a stand-off instead of a joyful occasion for the people of Dunboyne.</P>
    <P>This is not a debate about the Church <i>versus</i> the State as may have been the case in the media.  The fundamental question we are debating here is the right of parents to choose the type of education they want for their children.  The debate is not about the narrow view of who controls what, although it must also throw open that question because many would say the Minister's decision preempted a debate on the future direction of education.</P>
    <P>The Minister was in a quandary when making the decision about the school in Dunboyne.  She had to decide whether to opt for a traditional voluntary Catholic school for which the local bishop offered a site, a community school, or a community college under the aegis of Meath vocational education committee?  From the reports I received her decision was the more unexpected one.  She decided that the community college &ldquo;would be the most sensitive decision&rdquo;.  The Minister is a sensitive person, but if that is a sensitive decision, I would hate to see an insensitive one.</P>
    <P>Much of the publicity which ensued focused on the row between Church and State because of its public nature.  The bishop took umbrage at the decision, the way it was made and what he saw as the implications beyond this one issue.  He accused the Minister of pre-empting the impending debate on the new kind of management structure that emerges by favouring one type of school and said that she appears to be making important decisions on the control of schools before the issues are thrashed out in advance of <Col N="1174" /> the White Paper and the drawing up of the Education Act.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the secretariat of secondary schools maintained that the Minster overturned a decision of her officials in favour of a community college.  He asked was it now the policy of the entire Government not to sanction any more secondary schools.  His view was that the decision in respect of the Dunboyne school was taken on the basis of Labour Party ideology or policy and as the decision was announced by the local Labour Party TD it is easy to see how a person could arrive at the conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil manifesto promised more democracy and openness with a genuine role for all partners in education, including parents.  The November 1992 Labour Party manifesto states that the control of our educational system must include a meaningful role for parents. Big deal.  The rights of parents in respect of education does not depend on the whim or agreement of either of those terrible twins in Government, the Labour Party or Fianna Fáil.  Irish people have a constitutional right in relation to education. That is why parents' views must be taken into consideration and not because it is included as a vague well meaning part of a party manifesto.</P>
    <P>Article 42 of the Constitution lays down the following constitutional framework for State policy in education.  It states:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>The threehold right of parental choice to provide education in their homes, in private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State is clearly stated.  Moreover, the State is prohibited from obliging parents to send their children to schools established by the State or to any particular type of schools designated by the State where this would <Col N="1175" /> violate the lawful preference and conscience of the parents.  The State is obliged to provide free primary education for children and to endeavour to supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate education initiative. It is only when the public good requires it that the State provides other educational facilities or institutions, and where it provides such other educational facilities it must have due regard for the rights of parents.  The State, as guardian of the common good, is obliged to ensure that children receive a certain minimum moral, intellectual and social education.</P>
    <P>Article 44 of the Constitution envisages legislation providing State aid for schools and directs that such legislation should not discriminate between schools under management of different religious denominations.  Furthermore, a child attending a school receiving public money cannot be obliged to receive religious instruction at that school against parental wishes.  It appears that the State is not merely authorised but required to give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational initiative.</P>
    <P>While undoubtedly the courts would uphold the right of the State to maintain minimal standards in educational institutions aided by the State, it does not follow that the State is entitled to dictate, for example, the precise method of entry into private secondary schools, the precise course content of State-aided education or that schools receiving State aid must prepare students for particular examinations.  Those are matters for agreement between parent and educator.</P>
    <P>In 20th century Ireland no statute has been passed dealing with the subject of secondary education.  Therefore, the phrase &ldquo;legislation providing State aid for schools&rdquo; in Article 44 of our Constitution rings hollow.  There is no such legislation.  Some time ago the Minister for Education threatened to withhold funding from private fee paying secondary schools which conduct entrance examinations to determine the allocation of places.  She made the point, with which many will agree, that allocation of places <Col N="1176" /> by an examination based on academic performance discriminates against those coming from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.  Up to that point her analysis is rational, even if some people disagree with parts of it.</P>
    <P>However, the conclusion which she drew from her analysis was misconceived. The State is not entitled to use its economic muscle on secondary schools in receipt of constitutionally required State aid to force them to implement State policy or to become types of schools designated by the State. The issue of parental choice and the limitation of State dictated policy goes much further.  The protection afforded by the Constitution to the rights of parents and those engaged in the provision of private and corporate education extends to the question of teacher selection.  If parents have an inalienable right to determine their children's education and who educates their child, a person to whom parents delegate such a decision must retain a similar right.  Thus, a proposal that local education authorities would have the right to appoint or dismiss teachers in schools funded by the State would be repugnant to the Constitution.  Although it is open to the State to prescribe certain minimal qualifications for teachers, it is not open to it to impose on private education a system which restricts private education over and above such minimal qualifications.</P>
    <P>Teacher unions are anxious to impose their view of teachers' rights on the employment decision, but teachers and the schools that employ them operate within a constitutional framework which gives parents and educators, including religious denominations, very definite constitutional rights of freedom of choice.</P>
    <P>Another issue of great significance is that of boards of management.  If the State is obliged to endeavour to supplement and aid private education it would seem to follow it is not entitled to make State aid conditional on delegation of managerial functions to bodies outside the control of those providing private education.  If parents wish to send their <Col N="1177" /> children to be educated at a school run by a private individual or by a religious order and are willing to vest the managerial role of that school in an individual, a religious order or a group of trustees it is not competent for the State to withdraw public funding from such a school on the grounds it does not conform with a management model reflecting other interests stipulated by the State, such as representation by local education authorities, teachers or specified arrangements for direct representation by parents.</P>
    <P>The rights of parents are vindicated by the Constitution and the Minister has ignored that constitutional imperative.  In this instance, she has ignored the wishes of the parents.  The announcement of the decision to sanction the building of a vocational education committee community college in Dunboyne was greeted with shock.  It was extraordinary that parents and children should have to protest outside Leinster House in the rain to highlight their case.  It seems incredible that the overwhelming wishes of a community should be ignored by the Minister. The preference was expressed to the Minister, and to officials of her Department, before the decision was taken and at a subsequent public meeting on 21 February when the unanimous decision was to ask the Minister to change her decision in favour of a community school but she has set her face against that.</P>
    <P>This afternoon the Minister said she must ensure her Department is spending with regard to the long term good of the community and I agree with that objective. She said she listens to all arguments and makes the best decisions for the community, but in this instance if she was of a different gender perhaps I would call her paternalistic.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated her commitment to parental involvement in education and illustrated it with examples of participation at the highest level and I agree with that.  She said it is important to recognise that no single partner in education can have a monopoly in relation to issues of education, be they parents, teachers or other groups.  The Minister <Col N="1178" /> went on to say that in any decision the involvement of the partners is important, but ultimately a decision must be taken that reflects the common good of society.</P>
    <P>I described the Minister's approach as paternalistic because in this instance it would appear that the view of the community conflicts with her view, that the decision must reflect the common good of society.  The parents' wishes are at odds with those of the Minister, although they might applaud the fact they have eventually got a school.  It is regrettable there is a need for this debate.  Unfortunately, this is a one issue debate, but there are many other issues to be debated in education.  Arguing over the type of school is like confining discussion of our best strategy in the World Cup to who Jack Charlton should hire to drive the bus or what colour the seats should be. That does not mean that this issue is not important for the people of Dunboyne.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in respect of management control of Church owned schools or the nature of a local tier of education administration are not the big questions in education, but they tend to absorb most attention, especially that of the media in this case.  The most important issue is not about who holds the power within the system, but in deciding what the output of the system should be, what type of education we want and what is needed for young people.  I do not think it is the intention of the Minister, or that of the Fine Gael Party, to deflect attention from that debate.  I support this motion because we must uphold the constitutional imperative which dictates that parents count, but in this instance the Minister has ignored them.  I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Jim Higgins.</P>

She knows it is a good journey from the Montessori to the vocational system.  Having taught in a vocational school for seven years and being aware of its weaknesses and strengths I am a strong supporter of that system.  I am a member of the Teachers Union of Ireland.  Having taught in a secondary school, a Protestant grammar school, and latterly in a community school, I am aware they all have strengths and weaknesses. I am not opposed to the principle of a community college but from the point of view of democracy the ideal is the community school.</P>

      <P>I know of successful mergers of two secondary schools and one vocational school in a community. They buried their prejudices, worked for the common good, and had a new beginning on a new campus.  Three teachers unions and two religious organisations who had been vying for a shrinking pupil population merged in a community school in which I taught and that merger was successful.  I do not believe that a fairer structure is possible in respect of school management than one of a board of management comprising two parents, two members of the vocational educational committee, two religious and two teachers.  That represents equality of participation.  I am sick and tired listening to the Minister and her predecessors mouthing about parent participation and parent power.  In this instance the Minister has turned on its head the participation, power and wishes of parents. The acid test, which the Minister fudged, is if she is prepared to have a plebiscite in Dunboyne to give parents a democratic say about whether they want a community college foisted upon them with the assistance and help of the Minister's colleagues or does she want to comply with what we suspect to be the parents' wishes, a community school.

      <P>I wish to express my thanks to you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to raise an extremely important issue.  It has been brought to my attention in recent weeks and months that to be eligible for the area aid scheme and the farm retirement scheme farmers must present a map of their property. However, it can take weeks or months to receive these maps from the appropriate office.  I accept that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has extended by one month the period in which maps must be submitted for the farm retirement scheme and the area aid scheme. However, I suggest that this period is inadequate because the maps will not be available.  More staff must be made available to provide maps to farmers.</P>
      <P>Every local authority has unmarked maps of its own area.  I suggest to the Minister of State, who I am very pleased is here tonight, that local authorities should be in a position to provide these maps and, if necessary, to charge a certain amount, some of which would be paid to those who provide the maps in the first instance.  This would alleviate a major problem in that it would enable people &mdash; I speak particularly about people in north Cork, the Kanturk electoral area &mdash; to get from their local office, in this case Mallow, a copy of the map for £20 or £25.  Of this amount, £5, £10 or £15 could be paid to the mapping section of the Land Registry.  That is not an unreasonable or unfair request.  Farmers never had to provide maps heretofore, but to be eligible for grants maps must now be submitted.</P>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I would like to give Deputy Paddy Sheehan a minute of my time.</P>

With co-operation between the Department and the farming community the maps concerned could be obtained from local authorities.  The farming community has been bled dry in terms of the cost of maps.</P>
      <P>We seem to be very good Europeans in that we are the only member of the EU who obeys the rules to the letter of the law while other nations ride roughshod over the regulations.  However, they seem to fare better at the end of the day. What have we achieved by being good Europeans?  This matter has been badly handled.  There are farmers in my constituency and throughout the country who are debarred from drawing grants because maps have not been submitted with their applications.  I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to approve every application irrespective of whether a map is submitted.  The Minister of State should have a word with the Minister to ensure that is done.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to respond to my two good friends, Deputies Crowley and Sheehan from Cork, who have made a very strong case on behalf of the farmers in their area.  Obviously this is a matter in which all of us are interested.  I would like to make a number of points in reply to the issues raised by the Deputies.  First, I wish to put on record that the staff in the Land Registry are first class and have displayed an admirable devotion to duty. They have been trying very hard to reduce delays in the registry, with some success, as I shall explain later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, the arrears arose due to the need for the registry, like other services, to comply with Government policy in relation to staffing which operated throughout the public service in the <Col N="1183" /> 1980s.  As in other areas of the public service, staffing levels had to be reduced while the volume of business increased &mdash; a quite significant increase in the case of the registry.  Governments were aware that the policy of containing numbers would pinch &mdash; in some cases quite severely &mdash; but were also faced with the imperative of containing public expenditure in the longer term interests of the economy as a whole.  It would, I think, be acknowledged fairly widely that the public service staff limitation, or &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; policy, though painful, was one of the elements which contributed in a significant way towards the improvement in the general state of our public finances in recent years.</P>
    <P>Since 1990 our capacity to ease the staffing problem in the registry has been improving.  Additional staff have been appointed and a considerable investment is being made in computerisation and information technology.  Over each of the past four years annual output in the Land Registry has exceeded the annual intake of business, thus reducing the arrears level.  To illustrate this I will refer to figures for &ldquo;dealings&rdquo;, which is the most important category of business transacted in Land Registry.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1989 the total arrears in dealing was 51,145.  At the end of last year the corresponding figure was 41,828, representing an improvement of some 18.2 per cent.  At present the average time taken to have a dealing processed in the registry is between 16 weeks and 24 weeks, depending on complexity and geographic location, and this is continuing to improve.</P>
    <P>While accepting that there have been problems with the registry and that it has not been in a position to provide the speed of service which is required, I must also point out that it sometimes unfairly gets the blame for delays when the fault actually lies elsewhere.  For whatever reason, some solicitors, when lodging applications with the registry on behalf of clients, seem in many cases to get them wrong.</P>
    <P>Handling of the large volume of incorrect <Col N="1184" /> and-or incomplete applications which are received in the registry gives rise to non-productive work and represents poor utilisation of the registry's scarce resources.  Management, in co-operation with the Law Society, have made efforts to bring about improvement in the quality of work lodged.  However, the results to date have been disappointing. This is a matter which will have to be tackled and is something which requires further action by solicitors and the Law Society.  The registry is most anxious to assist solicitors in any way they can to improve matters.</P>
    <P>That is the background to the problems at the Land Registry.  As to solutions and as to the future, these lie in the Government's decision to reconstitute the Land Registry and its sister, the Registry of Deeds, as a commercial State-sponsored body.  For the registries to be run effectively and to deliver the kind of service the public needs and expects they need the freedom which semi-State status will confer on them.  There are at present well in excess of 500 staff working in the registries.  It is a highly labour intensive operation with great scope for computerisation.</P>
    <P>What is needed is therefore not necessarily more staff but perhaps more investment in technology and business orientation.  In this regard, progress towards conversion of the registries is well under way.  Following on the Government decision that the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds should be reconstituted as a commercial semi-State enterprise, an interim board &mdash; whose chairman and members have a wide range of business expertise &mdash; was appointed in July 1992 to assist and advise on the procedures and the legislative changes that will be necessary to bring about the conversion.</P>
    <P>Additionally, a comprehensive programme for the introduction of the most up-to-date information technology and computerisation of a wide range of procedures at the registries is being implemented.  This, combined with the tight management of scarce resources, is contributing to an improvement in the <Col N="1185" /> standard of services provided to the public.</P>
    <P>Steady progress is also being made in preparing a portion of the Land Registry's operations for decentralisation to Waterford in accordance with Government policy.  A site is available in Waterford and inquiries have been received from interested developers with a view to building office premises.  The Government's programme provides for the transfer of 150 to 200 civil servants to the beautiful city of Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment tonight.  On Tuesday, 27 October 1992 the then Minister for <Col N="1186" /> Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, announced the setting up of a special traffic development task force for Shannon airport.  A high powered group of exceptionally qualified members, including the very talented Gillian Bowler, was given £1 million of taxpayers' money to undertake this review.  They hired top level consultants and reported in time for some plans to be effected during the 1994 tourism season.</P>
      <P>Why has there been a delay in publishing the report?  Could it be that the Government is aware of recent setbacks such as the curtailment of Transair and Ryanair services to Shannon, the negative response to the Aeroflot application for pick-up rights on Shannon-New York, the sale of SRS without any consultation of Aer Lingus employees, the huge drop in sales at the duty free shop following the Aer Lingus decision to fly Shannon-Dublin-New York or the new transatlantic services of US airlines into Dublin, which is of concern to airport employees?</P>
      <P>Workers at the airport are suspicious of the Government's sweet talk on this issue.  There are those who claim that the publication is being cynically delayed for the Taoiseach's proposed visit to the mid-west on his election tour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Taoiseach, is coming to the mid-west to give us the benefit once more of his wisdom in this area.  I am aware that a special group is busy examining the prospects for the Shannon Estuary.  The money that has been spent studying the potential of the Shannon Estuary would, if invested properly, create several thousand jobs, but for some reason the people in Merrion Street do not seem to take any notice of such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> I would like the Minister to warn the Government that the electorate is aware that their decision in the ballot boxes will be important in the coming June election. When the boxes are opened I expect there will be a roar of disapproval for Fianna Fáil and Labour in County Clare because of the delay in implementing proposals such as those that have been outlined in the report of this task force. I appeal to the Minister, if he is not prepared to publish the entire document, to at least give his approval to the proposed customs clearance area that has been negotiated between Aer Rianta and the CIS countries where the Russian customs clearance people have offered to set up a haulage area designated in Shannon which will create substantial employment and which would become an east-west crossroads for freight traffic.  I do not understand why the Government would delay on such matters.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Transport, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, was regarded as an honourable person.  I do not wish to be entirely critical of the Minister but if I read out the entire press statement that was issued on 27 October 1992, the Minister would not make any reply here this evening but I will not do that.  I will give the Minister an opportunity to impress on his pals in Aer Lingus the need to uphold committments they have given.  They said that a transatlantic fleet would be based in Shannon; that has now been changed.  They said that 200 transatlantic staff would be transferred to Shannon; nothing has happened about that.  With regard to the fixing of fares, they said there would be no common fares and that there would be a bias in favour of Shannon; unfortunately, that has gone the other way.  The regional subvention has been redirected from Cork to Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to Deputy Carey.  In June 1993, the Government set up the Shannon Airport Traffic Development Task Force with the brief: to develop additional passenger and freight traffic through Shannon Airport.  The task force was asked to examine specifically increasing tourism charter traffic into Shannon; making the airport more user-friendly for transatlantic traffic; developing more scheduled services to and from Europe; developing more cargo traffic and developing hubbing services at Shannon.</P>
      <P>The task force invited submissions from the general public and from local and national organisations concerned with air transport, air freight and tourism. It met all State agencies, airlines, tour operators and tourism interests connected with Shannon.  It also engaged consultants to report on key aviation and tourism related issues.  Having examined and discussed the large amount of material generated through this process the task force presented its report to Minister Cowen at the end of December last.</P>
      <P>Its report contained a number of far-reaching proposals, the implications of which warranted detailed consideration by our Department.  That task is nearing completion and we hope to be in a position to announce the Government's decision on the task force's recommendations soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We absolutely reject any suggestion that there has been any delay in acting on this report which was prepared on the basis that it was confidential to the Minister as the responsible authority. Accordingly, it was not our intention to <Col N="1189" /> publish the report.  Minister Cowen informed the Dáil of this position on 30 March 1994.  However, in response to the points raised by various public representatives, we will examine again the feasibility of publishing the report.</P>
    <P>This Government is absolutely committed to the development of Shannon. We have a track record of supporting Shannon and bestowing benefits on it which other regions did not receive. Shannon must accept that the international aviation is a fluctuating business and we must take decisions that protect the best interests both of Shannon and Irish aviation.  The commitments we have given will be honoured.  It will take some time to put the package into operation but we are committed to the development of the area and to the continued success of Shannon.  The Deputy can reassure his constituents about this.  I am sure that on 9 June the people of Clare will overwhelmingly endorse the efforts of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the issue of the sale of cigarettes to underage children and the failure to enforce legislation.  Eighty per cent of adult smokers were initiated into the habit of smoking by the age of 13 years.  This startling statistic is the reason I raise this topic.</P>
      <P>The Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988 prohibits the sale of tobacco products to any person under the age of 16 years whether for his own use or otherwise, and any person selling to a young person under 16 shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this question as a study was conducted in Dublin to document the percentage of retail outlets which sell cigarettes to children and which display notices indicating that cigarettes will not be sold to children.  All retail outlets were identified and visited by one of five 12 <Col N="1190" /> year old boys who attempted to purchase cigarettes.  One hundred and nine out of 134 attempts, 81.3 per cent, were successful. In 28 or 20.9 per cent of attempts, the boys were challenged by the shopkeepers. However, in four of these attempts the purchase succeeded.  Warning notices were displayed in only eight premises.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that 20.9 per cent of the attempts by the boys were challenged by the shopkeepers.  However, the conclusion of the study is that underage children can easily purchase cigarettes in Dublin.  No prosecutions have ever been taken in the Dublin area for illegal sales of cigarettes to children.  The law should be more vigorously implemented as part of an overall strategy to combat smoking among children because of the seriousness of the health risk.</P>
    <P>A greater effort should be made by the Minister to ensure that more shops have a sign stating that cigarettes will not be sold to anyone under 16 years of age.  By this means the seriousness of the situation gets more attention and it draws public opinion and shoppers' attention to the issues involved.  I noticed on a visit to England recently that every shop where cigarettes are sold appeared to have a prominent sign on display stating this.  I have to acknowledge the wide range of anti-smoking measures which the Department and the health promotion unit have been taking over the years.  I welcome them and urge the Minister to pursue them.</P>
    <P>We need to re-emphasise to young people, and particularly to young women, the dangers of smoking.  The implementation of this legislation and attempts to take it more seriously should be an important part of that.  Perhaps the Minister would answer the broader question of whether recent surveys have enabled him target young smokers effectively.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently accepted a children's charter on the right to freedom from tobacco which was launched by ASH &mdash; Action on Smoking and Health &mdash; Ireland.  This charter identifies children's rights not to be sold cigarettes, <Col N="1191" /> their right to be taught how to recognise and resist pressure to smoke, their right to clean air in the home, in school, in youth clubs and public places.</P>
    <P>Smoking is a huge issue where responsibility to children is concerned.  It is clear that by the age of 16 most of the decisions are made as to whether you are a smoker or not.  Of the 55,000 young people who sit their leaving certificate, 18,000 are already confirmed smokers.  If they continue to smoke, 5,000 are likely to die of smoking related diseases and many of the deaths will occur in middle age.  That is just from one year's group of leaving certificate students.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a great deal of work to be done between the Departments of Health and Education.  We must recognise that the consumption of tobacco is one of the greatest hazards to human health and that for the majority of smokers, smoking commences in childhood without full, informed consent.  We must teach our children the impact of smoking on their health and wellbeing and how to recognise and resist pressure to smoke.  Children should also be protected from any form of tobacco advertising.</P>
    <P>The charter has been supported by the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Heart Foundation and the Royal College of Surgeons, among others.</P>
    <P>Smoking is at the top of the list of habits which have lethal consequences for health and has now been identified as one of the world's most serious health problems.  We must develop preventative programmes aimed at supporting and developing children's self-confidence in dealing with peer pressure.</P>
    <P>International advertising is targeting young smokers, particularly women. Global studies have shown that the inequality women experience in all societies is one of the determinants of tobacco use.  Smoking is frequently connected to lack of self-esteem and anxiety about weight control.  Women who die in middle age are those who have smoked since they were adolescent.  As the current <Col N="1192" /> generation of young women who smoke grow older and continue to smoke, their burden of smoking-related diseases will grow larger.  There is now emerging a creeping but silent epidemic of smoking-related illnesses in women.  I hope that in the national plan for women's health, the Minister will address this.  Young girls are smoking more and more.  Women face specific gender related conditions, for example, cervical cancer, increased risks of ectopic pregnancy and early menopause.  The effects of smoking during pregnancy are very severe.  For these reasons I urge the Minister to take whatever action is necessary to ensure the legislation is enforced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and giving me an opportunity to respond.  I share her view that this matter is of prime importance.  I have responsibility to discourage smoking among teenagers and young adults.  My Department's prevention and education campaigns are geared towards that objective. It is also imperative to take whatever steps are necessary to restrict access to cigarettes by young people.</P>
      <P>In the two years I have been Minister for Health we have launched comprehensive television and multi-media campaigns to alert people to the dangers of smoking and I share her view that it is one of the most serious health hazards that needs to be addressed by society.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy said, it is an offence under the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988 to sell cigarettes to children under the age of 16 years.  I know that the voluntary organisations working in this area are concerned about possible breaches of the legislation and I share their concern.  I have, therefore, been considering the action which might need to be taken to ensure that the legislation is not only on the Statute Book but enforced.  My Department has recently written to the organisation representing retail outlets seeking their advice and co-operation on how the incidence of sales of cigarettes to under-age children might be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> The Deputy will appreciate that given the large number of outlets at which cigarettes may be purchased, policing the legislation is not easy.  However, the health boards, which have responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of the legislation, have also been asked to ensure that those responsible for retail outlets are aware of their responsibilities under the law.  In addition, the health promotion unit of my Department is arranging to have suitable notices prepared for distribution to retail outlets.</P>
    <P>I will be keeping the situation under review and, if the steps I have outlined are not successful, I will then consider what other avenues of action are open to me to ensure that the practices which the Deputy has described are eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter of some importance on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister for being present in the House to reply.  I appeal to him to provide as a matter of urgency a State-funded screening service for all women in the high risk category group for breast cancer.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer is one of the major unsolved problems in medicine today and is by far the most common form of cancer among women.  The average Irish woman has a one in 11 chance of developing breast cancer during her lifetime. Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death among women aged between 25-34 years and is the most common cause of death among middle aged women.  More than half of deaths among women aged between 50-64 years are caused by breast cancer.  Last year 660 women died from breast cancer.  This is the highest figure in any country in the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a well researched speech last week, the European Social Affairs Commissioner, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, predicted that deaths from cancer would continue to rise by the dramatic figure of 15 per <Col N="1194" /> cent over the next number of years. These statistics give a clear idea of the scale of the problem.  The effects of this problem and the suffering and anguish it inflicts on women cannot be quantified. Neither is it easy to quantify the effect the death of a young mother can have on her young children.  The fact that this problem cannot be quantified does not mean it can be ignored.  Modern research demonstrates categorically that early detection of breast cancer can save many lives and lead to a substantial reduction in the number of deaths from breast cancer. Scientific evidence proves that the survival prospects of women in the 50-64 age group can be improved by as much as 33 per cent if a national screening programme is in place.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, calling on the Minister not to ignore the reality of those figures and to put in place as a matter of urgency a national screening service.  This would be a substantial investment in ensuring good health among women in particular and society in general.  I would also regard it as another essential step forward in tackling the scourge of breast cancer. Taken in conjunction with the research into finding a cure for breast cancer, a State-funded screening service would enable us to say we were nearing the stage when a cure for breast cancer would be within our reach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for raising this very important matter.  I share the concern expressed by her and many organisations, particularly women's organisations, and most notably the Irish Countrywomen's Association, about the high incidence of breast cancer among Irish women and the need to put in place mechanisms which will reduce the high incidence of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The causes of breast cancer remain to be clearly identified and emphasis is, therefore, placed on early detection at the preinvasive stage, through mammography and consequent early treatment. At present mammography is used largely as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or worried women on referral by their general practitioner, consultant or <Col N="1195" /> through the local breast clinic.  There are now diagnostic mammography units at 17 hospitals and expertise has been growing in all aspects of the early detection of breast cancer and its treatment.</P>
    <P>Mammography screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis to detect breast cancer in non-symptomatic women.  Mammography screening programmes tend to be directed at women aged between 50-64 years.  There is general agreement that mammography screening programmes are not effective in reducing mortality in younger women.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom and the Netherlands are the only two countries in the European Union which have organised national mammography screening programmes for women aged between 50-64 years.  However, there is considerable debate and discussion internationally regarding the effectiveness of mammography screening programmes in reducing mortality from breast cancer. Before proceeding with a national screening programme for women aged between 50-64 years, it is imperative that the benefits of mammography screening, in terms of achieving a reduction in mortality, are carefully and fully assessed.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, my Department is supporting a major mammography breast screening programme, the Eccles Breast <Col N="1196" /> Screening Programme, currently underway at the Mater Foundation.  This programme is one of a network of pilot schemes which are at present underway in seven countries within the European Union.  The other countries are Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy.  The Irish pilot programme covers a defined catchment area, North Dublin and Cavan-Monaghan, representing both urban and rural populations.  All women in the catchment area aged between 50-64 years are eligible to attend.  Screening is provided free of charge to women taking part in the programme.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the Eccles Breast Screening Programme are: to evaluate the impact of mammographic screening on mortality from breast cancer among Irish women; to document compliance with a breast screening programme in Irish women and to compare the specificity, sensitivity and predictive value of the mammography programme with that reported internationally.</P>
    <P>The second round of screening is expected to be concluded by the end of 1994.  The Eccles Breast Screening Programme is the first study of its kind undertaken in Ireland.  National policy to be followed in this area will be influenced by an evaluation of the results of the pilot scheme when these become available.</P>

      <P>Primary and secondary schools receive grant assistance towards the cost of secretarial services under two schemes operated by my Department.</P>
      <P>One scheme, introduced in 1977 provides grants in respect of the remuneration of school secretaries employed by schools on a full-time or shared basis. The school is recouped the full salary costs including employers PRSI contributions. Schools that originally qualified continue to receive grants under the scheme but no other schools have been added to it since September 1992.</P>
      <P>The second scheme was introduced on foot of a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to provide more schools with clerical services. This is being done by way of a supplementary capitation grant.  Individual schools have discretion about how precisely to utilise this grant to procure secretarial assistance.  It is based on the school enrolment and is not salary based. At present all new provision is under the terms of this capitation based scheme.</P>
      <P>The current phase of the programme has extended assistance to primary schools with single enrolments of 400 pupils or over, schools with disadvantaged status of 200 pupils or over and schools of 12 teachers or over catering for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>Secondary schools with enrolments of 200 recognised pupils or more are eligible for a grants towards the employment of clerical assistance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy refers to the position of schools sharing a clerk typist under the original scheme.  Such schools were excluded from consideration under the capitation based scheme irrespective of their enrolments because the view was taken that it was preferable to use available resources to target schools that had no provision at all.</P>

      <P>I launched the finalised guidelines on 30 September last, and I am confident that they will prove to be of very real benefit and assistance to schools in both preventing, and dealing with, bullying behaviour in our schools.</P>
      <P>I believe that every child has the right to attend school in an atmosphere of caring and calm.  Victims of bullying behaviour are clearly denied this right. Bullying behaviour is unacceptable and must be seen as such by teachers, parents and pupils.</P>
      <P>The guidelines state that the creation of a positive school climate, which focuses on respect for the individual, is at the centre of a whole school response of bullying.  When staff, pupils and parents are involved in the development of a school behaviour policy, they are more likely to actively support it.  I am confident, therefore, that the guidelines, which were issued to primary and post-primary schools, will assist schools in identifying the incidence of bullying in our in reducing the level of bullying in our schools.  I expect the guidelines to be adopted by each school board of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested in my guidelines that schools monitor the effectiveness of school policy on this issue and their views <Col N="951" /> will, of course, be taken into account in any review of the guidelines.  I am closely monitoring the number and type of bullying behaviour cases reported to my Department during the present school-year and I will review the situation at the end of this school-year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any announcements having been made in relation to the allocation of grants under the recreational facilities scheme.  I cannot understand how that could be the case as no decisions on the allocation of funds in respect of any projects have yet been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is presently assessing almost 1,300 applications which have <Col N="953" /> been received and a sub committee of Cospoir, the National Sports Council, will be established to monitor the selection process and to recommend projects for funding.  Following this process, which will be completed as soon as possible, the list of grant allocations will be formally announced by the Minister of State at my Department and all applicants will also be notified by my Department.</P>
    <P>The recreational facilities scheme is specifically designed to assist voluntary community organisations in the provision of, improvements to and equipping of recreational, leisure and community facilities.  Applications from voluntary community organisations will be given priority as it is a condition for grant aid under the scheme that the grantee organisation undertakes to provide for community access to the facility.  Private commercial organisations are ineligible for consideration under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The advertisement in the National Papers on 11 February 1994, inviting applications for assistance under the scheme, specifically outlined the criteria for the selection of projects which included the priority of the proposed improvement/facility in relation to the organisation's existing facilities, the ability of the organisation to undertake the project and claim the grant in 1994, the amount of local funds available, the availability of the other facilities in the area and the requirement to achieve an equitable geographical distribution of funds.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 32 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the case made for additional accommodation for the Cork School of Music.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, an extension to the School was at an advanced stage of planning in 1985 when, having regard to the financial circumstances at that time and the need to utilise funds for capital projects in areas of greatest priority, the planning of the project had to be deferred.</P>
      <P>Since January 1993 the School has been incorporated into the Regional Technical College, Cork under the terms of the regional technical college Act 1992 &mdash; it previously operated under the City of Cork Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>A submission by the regional technical college to my Department for capital funding under the 1994-1999 European Regional Development Fund programme in respect of a broad range of projects for the college, included a proposal in respect of the extension to the School of Music.  As already indicated in my press statement of 13 January 1994, a sum of £3.75 million has been included in my Department's 1994-1999 European Regional Development Fund submission to the EU for capital developments at the College.  Regrettably, it was not possible in the specific allocation to the Cork regional technical college, to include the School of Music project.  As an interim measure, however, my Department gave approval last autumn for the renting of additional space for the School.</P>
      <P>The present position with regard to the proposed extension for the School of Music is that following consultation with the Director of the regional technical college my Department has very recently received a revised submission, prepared by the Director of the School of Music. It is at present under examination.  The revised submission was necessary due to the many new developments which have arisen since the plans for the extension were originally prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On completion of the examination and when the proposed project has been fully <Col N="956" /> evaluated it will be considered for funding.</P>
    <P>The Deputies, will, I know, appreciate that I continue to be faced with the difficult task of allocating available funding against a very wide range of pressing demands for capital resources.</P>

      <P>Since I took office in January 1993, I have set up the following working groups or advisory committees involving persons from outside my Department:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Expert Working Group on Bullying in Primary and Post-primary schools;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Expert Advisory Group on Third-level Student Support;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Senior Cycle Re-structuring External Monitoring Committee;</P>
      <P>&mdash;In-career Development Advisory Committee &mdash; Primary;</P>
      <P>&mdash;In-career Development Advisory Committee &mdash; Second-level.</P>
      <P>Working groups or committees of this nature are a particularly useful mechanism for addressing complex inter-linking issues which are such a feature of the education system and for facilitating a practical input by the various partners in education.</P>
      <P>These groups or committees tend to fall into a number of categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> Some are traditional committees charged with addressing a particular task within a finite period in the course of which they clarify the issues, identify viable options and produce a report or findings which include recommendations for consideration by me as Minister.  The Expert Working Groups on Bullying in Schools and the Expert Advisory Group on Third-Level Student Support were examples of this type.</P>
    <P>This Expert Working Group on Bullying, which included educationalists and parents as well as officers of my Department, was established in April 1993.  It presented me with its findings in June 1993 and I took action on the basis of its findings in September 1993.</P>
    <P>I established the Expert Advisory Group on Third-level Student Support in March 1993.  I received the report of the group recently and I subsequently announced a number of improvements approved by Government to improve the conditions and administration of the third-level student support schemes.  I am continuing to study other significant findings in the report.</P>
    <P>Other working groups or committees act as a mechanism for information exchange and for continuing consultation and feedback on a particular issue and provide a regular periodic input into the operation of my Department instead of working towards a specific report at the end of a finite period.  The Senior Cycle Restructuring Monitoring Group and the In-career Development Advisory Committees are examples of such committees.</P>
    <P>The setting up of informal working groups of officials only is a routine and continuing feature of the internal working arrangements of my Department.</P>

      <P>In 1989 my Department proposed, and the Mercy Order agreed, that the long term needs of Tralee Post-Primary Centre would be best served by an amalgamation of its two post-primary schools in Tralee, at Moyderwell and Balloonagh, into a single post-primary school, to be based on the Balloonagh School site, extended and adapted as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Mercy Order has now proposed to my Department that the amalgamation would be best effected through the building of a completely new school on a site in the Balloonagh area which the Order has purchased.</P>
      <P>The combined enrolment of the two Mercy secondary schools in the current school-year is 1,206.  My Department is examining the Mercy Order's proposal in the light of the longer-term needs of Tralee post-primary centre as a whole and further discussions will be held shortly with the Mercy Order.</P>

    <P>The organisation of classes within a primary school is a matter for the Principal teacher.  My Department operates guidelines for maximum class sizes.  The current guidelines are:</P>
    <P>39 (in the case of a single-grade class-group);</P>
    <P>38.  (in the case of a class-group with two consecutive grades);</P>
    <P>35.  (in the case of a multi-grade class-group) and</P>
    <P>28.  (in the case of one-teacher schools with more than four standards).</P>
    <P>These guidelines for single-grade, dual-grade and multi-grade class groups are to be improved with effect from 1 September, 1994.  The improvements will mean a 2 unit reducation in each of these guidelines.  I am also introducing for the first time a new guideline of 29 in infant standards in designated schools serving areas of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The current <i>de facto</i> pupil teacher ratio in second-level schools, having regard to total enrolment and the total number of teachers, is approximately 17.4:1.  This position will improve in 1994-95 as a result of:</P>
    <P>(a)  the allocation of additional teaching resources arising from the implementation of the provision in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in relation to ex-quota guidance and vice-principal posts, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the allocation of additional disadvantaged and remedial posts outlined in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>Class size within the post-primary sector varies depending on the subject choice of <Col N="962" /> pupils within individual schools.  There are more than 25 pupils in some classes while in others the number of pupils is significantly less than that.</P>

      <P>Physical education currently forms an integral part of the primary school curriculum.  At school level the Principal teacher, in consultation with the school staff, has responsibility for setting a plan of work for the school as a whole and for ensuring that each area of the curriculum is adequately dealt with in all classes.</P>
      <P>I note with concern recent reports on fitness levels within the population and I fully accept the critical role that physical education within schools can play in encouraging children to develop an interest in physical activity as an essential component of an active and healthy lifestyle. I note with particular interest that the report of the National Education Convention again focussed on the importance of this area of the curriculum within primary schools.  There is considerable consensus on a need to achieve a new momentum in relation to physical education.  Fundamental to this is ensuring appropriate curricular content and to that end The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, as part of their review of the primary curriculum will advise me on necessary revisions to the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the provision of facilities for Physical Education within schools, my current priority as set out in the National School Capital Programme is to improve sub standard accommodation. Specific provision for physical education will continue to be considered within the limits of the available capital and having <Col N="963" /> regard to other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>Given the number and diversity of professional development activities for teachers, figures on the precise extent of participation are not available.</P>
      <P>With regard to higher education institutions, a block grant for operating expenses is allowed to each institution. This grant does not allocate specific sums of money to particular activities.  Staff development would be a matter for individual faculties or departments within each institution.  The nature of the initiatives undertaken would be quite diverse and the number of staff participating is not available.  Grants have been made available with assistance from the European Social Fund for staff development in the higher education sector under the training of trainers initiative.  The amount allocated in 1993 was £630,000.  The number of participants in 1992 was 1,114 and the 1993 figure is not yet available.</P>

      <P>The official side &mdash; the Department of Education and Finance &mdash; has agreed, in principle, to negotiate changes in the teachers' superannuation schemes which would allow for early retirement provisions: (a) in the case of those teachers who no longer find themselves able to function at an acceptable level of professional performance, and (b) in situations where there are teachers who are surplus to requirements but who cannot readily be transferred elsewhere; any such provision to be implemented flexibly including, for example, the possibility of according priority to teachers over a certain age.</P>
      <P>It has been agreed that a working group of the Conciliation Council would be the appropriate forum for these negotiations. All parties agree that discussions in the working group will be substantive and will be concluded by 30 September, 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the overall operation of the School transport scheme is constantly under review, to ensure that the best and safest possible service is delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bus Éireann, who operate the service on behalf of my Department, are justifiably proud of their safety record in operating the school transport scheme. They place special emphasis on safety and, to this end, have a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure a safe and reliable service which are <Col N="969" /> reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that standards are maintained.</P>
    <P>All vehicles operating under the scheme meet rigid safety standards and, where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass the Department of the Environment tests, in regard to road-worthiness.</P>
    <P>The school transport scheme involves travel throughout the entire country in both remote rural areas and populous urban centres.  All routes are examined with regard to the suitability of the roads for the various types of vehicle used.  Safe set-down-, turning- and pick-up points are carefully selected, always with safety in mind.</P>
    <P>In the planning of routes, road conditions, traffic hazards, and all other aspects of safety are considered.  Services are monitored and, if conditions deteriorate or dangers arise, they are revised to ensure safety.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann undertake safety promotions at regular intervals so as to alert teachers, parents and children to safety aspects of the service.  Their Inspectors also speak to groups of pupils on the subject of safety, as part of their normal duties.  They continue to place the highest emphasis on safety and the Deputy will be aware of their recent safety video which I had the pleasure of launching in February this year.</P>
    <P>All private contractors employed by Bus Éireann under the school transport scheme must hold either: (a) a public service vehicle licence, as defined in Article 80 (2) of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, SI 190 of 1963, which enables them to undertake work for hire and reward, other than school transport, or (b) a school vehicle licence, as defined in Article 60 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, SI 181 of 1963, which restricts them to school transport only.</P>
    <P>These licences are issued and renewed by the local Gárda PSV Officers, following an inspection of the vehicle.  The trend in recent times is that more contractors are opting for the Public Service <Col N="970" /> Vehicle licence (A above) which enables them to undertake other work.</P>

      <P>The fundamental task in the education of children is the promotion of their moral, spiritual, intellectual, aesthetic and social and physical development and their preparation for adult life including work life.  The present senior <Col N="972" /> cycle of secondary education prepares students for the important transition from school to the world of work through a range of programmes, specifically, the Transition Year Programme, the Vocational Preparation and Training Programme 1, the Senior Certificate Programme and the Leaving Certificate including the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme.</P>
      <P>As has been stated in the White Paper &mdash; Growth Competitiveness and Employment &mdash; a society based far more on the production, transfer and sharing of knowledge than on trade in goods must recognise that access to theoretical and practical knowledge has a major role to play in an economic system.</P>
      <P>The Government in its response to the Moriarty Task Force on the Implementation of the Culliton report accepted the recommendation that it is necessary to strengthen the vocational orientation and relevance of particular subject options in secondary schools so as to provide an adequate platform for young people to proceed, at around the age of 18 years, to develop advanced, highly-rated skills for work as part of their post-secondary formation.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that I have already announced a fundamental restructuring of the senior cycle.</P>
      <P>There will now be the option of a three-year senior cycle for pupils after Junior Certificate.  This three-year option contains: the Transition Year Programme, the Leaving Certificate Programme, the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme and the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These programmes offer a significant increase in options for students at the senior cycle.  The Transition Year Programme is to be made widely available to schools and this one year programme will allow students to develop educationally and personally without academic examination pressure.  The content of all subjects in the Leaving Certificate Programme is being reviewed and updated by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The Leaving Certificate Applied Programme, the <Col N="973" /> fundamental goal of which is to prepare pupils for transition from the world of school to adult and working life will assimilate the VPT 1 and Senior Certificate Programmes.  The subject base of the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme is being expanded.  It is designed to foster in pupils a spirit of enterprise and initiative and develop their interpersonal, vocational and technological skills, in addition to providing pupils with opportunities for third-level and further education.  The LCVP will enhance pupils' preparation for the world of work, either as employees or in self-employment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that my Department operates a VPT 2 Programme &mdash; Post-Leaving Certificate courses &mdash; for some 17,000 students.  This offers a wide range of courses which are vocationally specific and also provide for the areas of personal development and work experience.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1992 eligibility for higher education grants for all applicants, irrespective of their age, was assessed on the basis of the candidate's own income and that of their parents or guardians.  The special provisions for mature students, introduced in 1992, represented a major improvement in allowing applicant-students who were at least 23 when entering approved third level courses and who were deemed to be independent of their parents to be assessed on their own means and that of their spouse, if applicable. The age of 23 is in line with the practice in third level institutions for <Col N="974" /> designating mature students.  I have no plans at present to alter the income assessment arrangements for candidates who are not mature students.</P>
      <P>I have already announced the establishment of a hardship fund which will be administered with third level institutions for the benefit of individual students already attending college where assistance on a flexible basis is required because of exceptional unforeseen circumstances and where assistance under the general student support schemes is not available or is inadequate.  Information on the criteria relating to the operation of this fund and the organisational arrangements for its disbursement will be disseminated to students and their representatives with the assistance of the third level institutions at the beginning of the next academic year.</P>

      <P>The content of all subjects at post-primary level is constantly being updated by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  In the case of music, a new programme is already in place for junior cycle.  An important objective of this is that it will encourage involvement by pupils and enhance their ability to partake in an enjoyable form of music making.</P>
      <P>The new transition year arrangements which will be operative from September 1994 will allow pupils to engage in a range of cultural pursuits, including music, without the stress of an external examination. I hope that some additional pupils will be encouraged through these experiences to choose music as a subject in senior cycle.</P>
      <P>With regard to senior cycle, the new leaving certificate course in music is now at an advanced stage of preparation by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  It will follow on naturally from the new junior certificate programme, which has been enthusiastically received.  However, it will be some time yet before this new course will be examined. I recognise a need for some interim arrangements which, while allowing for the changes at junior cycle, will involve no reduction in standards.  I am giving this urgent attention at the moment.  On several occasions since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have indicated my full support for the further development of music at all stages of our educational system.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that as Minister for Education I am certainly concerned that school text books should not encourage cruelty to animals. From the details furnished by the Deputy it would seem that the text book concerned is an Irish reader for 4th class pupils which has been in use since 1988. Officials from my Department have been in contact with the publishers of the text. The publishers have given an assurance that they will give full and serious consideration to the points which have been raised with them in recent days regarding the text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While not wanting in any way to imply that I condone the type of action depicted in the text, I would like to say to the Deputy that the context in which the story is set actually makes the point that <Col N="977" /> the individual inflicting the act of cruelty is subsequently punished for the insensitivity. I am confident that children reading the story as a whole, would appreciate that there is an issue regarding the poor treatment of the dog and that the story as set out actually provides teachers with a useful teaching point whereby they can heighten pupils awareness of such issues.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any research of the kind referred to by the Deputy having been carried out in this country.  My understanding is that the outcome of research that has been carried out in other countries as to the relative merits of integrated and segregated education has failed to establish a clear-cut advantage in favour of either integration or segregation.</P>
      <P>The report of the special education Review Committee indicated that the committee held no entrenched doctrinaire position regarding the integration into the ordinary school system of pupils with disabilities and-or special needs.  Its philosophy could best be summed up by saying that it favoured as much integration as is appropriate and feasible with as little segregation as is necessary.  It therefore envisages a system in which there will be a place for both ordinary and special schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rationale behind the concept of designated ordinary schools, proposed by the Special Education Review Committee, is that a greater range and intensity of support services can be provided for children with special educational needs attending ordinary schools where those services are concentrated in selected schools at local level.  The concept is particularly relevant where the numbers of such children would be relatively small and-or scattered over a wide geographical area.</P>
      <P>I consider that designated schools would allow support services to be allocated in a focused manner while facilitating, to a considerable extent, the wishes of many parents that their special needs children should remain in local ordinary schools.  The alternative, of attempting to address individual special needs as and where they occur, would be inefficient and ineffective by comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the designated setting, a full-time teacher would be allocated to the selected school to provide regular and sustained <Col N="979" /> support.  The teacher would give substantial periods of special instruction, in group settings or individually, in accordance with the needs and ability of each pupil.  In addition, the pupils with special needs would participate with other pupils in ordinary classes for such time as was thought appropriate.  My Department is currently examining the practical implications of this proposal as part of its overall consideration of the report of the Special Education Review Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works have been engaged in a programme of restoration for the Royal Canal for several years.  To date fifty miles of the canal, from Dublin City to Mullingar, has been restored to a navigable condition, with locks restored, spoil dredged and pedestrian access restored along the towpath.</P>
      <P>The programme is proceeding as rapidly as the financial resources available to the Office allow.  At present, restoration of boat access to Dublin Bay is nearing completion.  Additionally, dredging works have been underway west of Mullingar for some time and are proceeding towards the Shannon.</P>
      <P>In relation to outstanding works on the canal in County Westmeath, the position is that the nine mile section between Coolnahay and the County Longford boundary has been dredged and rewatered. Pedestrian access has been restored along this towpath.  In addition, the installation of lock gates is now underway at the lock in Ballynacargy.</P>
      <P>Dredging of the canal between Mullingar and Coolnahay is being carried out on a phased basis partly to minimise disruption to the rich flora which make this section such a unique and attractive stretch.  The section of the canal in Mullingar itself can only be dredged when the culvert at the Dublin Road Bridge is removed and access is possible for a barge mounted dredger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped that the recent opening of the Mullingar By-Pass road will reduce the volume of traffic using Moran's bridge on the Dublin Road and thus open <Col N="987" /> up the possibility of doing the works necessary to facilitate the extension of navigation beyond the bridge into the town.  Preparation of a design for these works is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to advance the matter in further discussions with Westmeath County Council.</P>
    <P>The availability of an adequate water supply is of vital importance if the canal is to be restored for navigation as recommended in the Management and Development strategy for the Grand and Royal Canals and the River Barrow.  As the volume of water available from existing sources is inadequate, the Office of Public Works is undertaking a comprehensive study to try to identify the possible new sources of supply.</P>
    <P>Another major task which must be carried out before full restoration can be achieved is the reconstruction of the canal banks and bed through Ballymaglavy Bog.</P>
    <P>Various other environmental works will also be necessary before the canal can achieve its full potential as a public amenity.  The rate of progress will depend on the resources which are available but full restoration will require a very considerable financial commitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out, in the first instance, that persons 65 years of age and over receive special treatment under the tax system.  The income tax exemption limits for pensioners are significantly higher than those which apply to the generality of taxpayers.  These currently stand at £4,100 single-£8,200 married for those pensioners aged 65 years and over and £4,700 single-£9,400 married at 75 years and over.  There is also an addition to the basic personal allowances of a special age allowance of £200 single-£400 married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of the tax changes in the budget excluded pensioners.  Pensioners, depending on the level of their income, will have benefited from the improved personal allowances, the reduction in the <Col N="989" /> marginal relief rate of tax, the extension of the standard rate band, the abolition of the 1 per cent levy and the new income threshold for the Health and Employment and Training levies.  It is possible, however, that some pensioners will have entered the tax net due to increases in their pensions or other income.  Estimates of the numbers involved are not available.</P>

      <P>Under the EU Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming a farmer can transfer his land by gift, lease or sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he leases the land Class S contributions <Col N="992" /> are payable on the income from the lease provided the total reckonable income is £2,500 or more per annum. This will maintain entitlement to pension at age 66 (provided a total of 10 years contributions have been paid).  If the farmer is in receipt of income from investment of the proceeds of the sale of the land the same arrangements apply as for income from a lease.</P>
    <P>If the only income after transfer of the land is the EU Retirement Pension the position is as follows: Pensions are not normally subject to PRSI contributions. To maintain entitlement to a social insurance pension a person in this situation who has had at least three years Class S contributions paid can become a voluntary contributor subject to satisfying the normal criteria.  A combination of the voluntary and compulsory insurance, provided a total of 10 years contributions have been paid, can be used to qualify the farmer for a social insurance pension at age 66.</P>
    <P>Under the farm retirement scheme if a social insurance contributory pension is payable at age 66, the farm retirement pension will be reduced accordingly for the remainder of the period of entitlement of the EU pension.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to provide an enhanced radio system at the Garda Divisional Headquarters in Anglesea Street, Cork, following consideration of the matter by the Garda Communications Advisory Committee.  This project was advertised to potential contractors in the supplement to the Official Journal of the European Community on 6 January 1994 and tender responses are due on 29 April.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that a contract will be placed in July-August of this year and that commissioning will take place early in 1995.  This matter is the subject of continuous consultation with the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>There are 37 EU <Col N="997" /> Council or Commission Directives in my Department's areas of responsibility which at this point require transposition into Irish law.  Of these, 20 are Directives where the date for transposition has passed.  The Commission has issued Article 169 letters in the case of ten of these while a Reasoned Opinion has been received on one case.  There are no Directives <Col N="998" /> in respect of which proceedings are pending before the Court nor indeed where there are either unimplemented Court judgments or ones where proceedings have been initiated for failure to implement such judgments.</P>

      <P>On their establishment the County Enterprise Boards were invited to consider their staffing arrangements and to decide, in consultation with the relevant City and County Managers, on the designation of acting chief executive officers for all Boards pending arrangements for the legal incorporation of the new Boards.  I made it clear at the time that it was my intention to proceed with arrangements which would enable the chief executive officer positions in all 35 Boards to be filled in due course on the basis of open recruitment.</P>
      <P>The acting chief executive appointments have been filled on an interim basis by the County Development Secretaries in the former Western Development Counties and from local authority staff who went on secondment to the Boards in their own areas; in the case of the South Cork Board, an acting chief executive was externally recruited on a temporary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the completion of arrangements for their incorporation as separate companies, each Board will be in a position to recruit a chief executive officer on <Col N="1001" /> a substantive basis through open competition.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the efficient and energetic performance of the Boards in their first six months of operation could not have been achieved without the commitment of the seconded staff and the co-operation of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Insurance intermediaries are regulated in accordance with the provisions of Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989.

The provisions of Part IV of the Act are kept under regular review.</P>
      <P>Sales employees of insurance companies are not subject to statutory regulation. However, I am advised by the insurance industry that all life companies in Ireland operate training programmes for their sales employees.</P>

      <P>The adoption and implementation of the tenant purchase scheme announced last year is the responsibility of each local authority. From the information available in my Department, I understand that Clare County Council is the only authority that have not yet adopted the scheme for its area.  My Department is in communication with the council regarding its adoption of the scheme as soon as possible, and I want to ensure that eligible tenants who wish to purchase their houses are given the opportunity to do so without further delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 to 134, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Fallowing or rotation of sites in marine fish culture is now an internationally accepted fish farm management strategy with demonstrable benefits for fish husbandry, fish health and the control of sea lice levels.  The practical implementation of fallowing strategies is now being given high priority under established technical and licensing parameters.</P>
      <P>Technical guidelines for the fallowing of sites have been formulated by the Advisory Group on Fallowing which I convened last year.  Marine fish farmers are being actively encouraged to develop fallowing strategies for approval and licensing, in accordance with these guidelines. The full and effective implementation of fallowing regimes has been recommended by the Sea Trout Task Force in its final report as an effective long term means of controlling sea lice and other pathogens.  The task force has urged the expeditious consideration of fallowing licence applications, guided by scientific principles.</P>
      <P>The fallowing proposals to which the Deputy refers were duly assessed by regional fallowing advisory groups representing fisheries boards, the Salmon Research Agency, the Department, salmon farmers and fisheries interests. The proposals were also assessed, from technical and all other perspectives, by the Department's Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee and were the subject of consultation with local authorities, the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte and the Commissioners of Irish Lights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My statutory powers in relation to the licensing of fish farming derive from section 15 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, and section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980.  The holding of public inquiries into individual aquaculture proposals is not required.  The siting of fish farm structures is regulated under the Foreshore Act, 1933, which does provide for the discretionary holding of public inquiries into all manner of permanent foreshore development, should this be necessary in the public <Col N="1018" /> interest.  The public notification of applications for foreshore licences while also discretionary, is the standard for aquaculture applications which are permanent and long term and involve significant production levels.</P>
    <P>Following a comprehensive assessment procedure and an appropriate level of consultation commensurate with the nature and scale of the proposals, I have decided to permit, under the Fisheries and Foreshore Acts, for a trial period this year only and under strict conditions, the salmon farms in question to operate additional sites at which the 1994 intake of smolts will be stocked for a number of months.  This will enable existing sites to be fallowed, or rested and is in line with the widely accepted objective of progressing fallowing strategies on a practical plane as early as possible.</P>
    <P>The maximum intake of smolts which will be licensed for each of the operations is as follows:</P>

    <P>The permissions are subject to stringent conditions including environmental fish health and sea lice monitoring and control arrangements.  The decisions are therefore stringently circumscribed and conditional in nature.  Implementation will be closely monitored.  None of the proposals involve an overall increase in licensed fish production for the operations concerned.  All smolts will be transferred back to existing licensed sites in due course.</P>
    <P>The implementation of these fallowing trials which are of strictly limited duration, will provide a basis for future evaluation and environmental impact assessment of the sites as components of overall fallowing strategies for the fish <Col N="1019" /> farms in question.  The companies have also been instructed that, if it is their intention subsequently to seek longer term permissions for the sites, environmental impact statements in line with the parameters laid down in the relevant environmental impact assessment regulations, should be finalised and published &mdash; in some cases this work is already well advanced.</P>
    <P>Longer term decisions will be informed by the performance of the sites, the results of ongoing environmental fish health and sea lice monitoring, environmental impact assessment, further consultation with all relevant interests and all other appropriate considerations.  The practical experience gained through these fallowing trials in 1994 will contribute significantly to the agreed objective of better management strategies for fish farms commensurate with the needs of other users of the marine resource.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium on 11 cows under the 1993 suckler cow premium scheme.  He was paid a 60 per cent advance on 27 November 1993 in respect of 11 animals.  However, at an inspection of his herd it transpired that he had included two in-calf heifers on his application which he had shown as having calved prior to application.  Under the terms and conditions of this scheme as laid down by the EU, applicants could only apply for premium in respect of genuine suckler cows and they should not include in-calf heifers.</P>
      <P>As a result of this false declaration the person named is not entitled in accordance with the EU regulations to any payment under the 1993 and 1994 suckler cow scheme.  As he has already been paid an advance of £521.99, this amount will have to be recouped from future grants due to him.  His application for grants under the 1993 beef cow scheme is being processed at present and any payment due will be made shortly.</P>

    <P>&mdash; are under 35 years of age,</P>
    <P>&mdash; their total household income is less than £14,822 p.a.,</P>

    <P>Payments made in respect of ewe premium, and sheep headage represent full entitlement.  Payments under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes represent in the main 60 per cent advances in line with EU requirements. Slaughter premium payments represent full amounts due in most cases.  Cattle headage and beef cow schemes are normally paid by way of advances.  Payment of the balances due under these two schemes commenced before Easter and are continuing at present.  Payment of 40 per cent balances under the suckler cow premium scheme has now commenced and those under the special beef premium scheme will start within a week.</P>
    <P>Payment of the balances under these schemes is subject to EU requirements relating to the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density.  This obliges member states to process all applications received from a particular applicant during the course of 1993 before paying out the balances.  Payment of the November 1993 special beef premium scheme commenced recently.  Payment of extensification premium is also linked to stocking density and here too I expect payments to commence by the end of the month.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for special beef premium on 30 animals in December 1992.  As he notified the local livestock office that one animal died after he had applied his <Col N="1045" /> application was processed for payment on 29 animals.  At computer validation the application was rejected because of one invalid tag.  This was corrected and when revalidated the altered tag number related to an animal already paid for in a herd in County Cork.  Arrangements are now being made to pay premium on 28 animals.  Further investigation of the tag number problem will be carried out and payment will be made in respect of the animal concerned if and when this problem is resolved.</P>
      <P>He also applied for one animal under the ten month and seven animals under the 22 month special beef premium in June 1993.

      <P>The present position in regard to EC Directives <Col N="1050" /> within my area of responsibility which have been adopted but which have not yet been transposed into Irish law is detailed in the Schedule which I will circulate in the Official Report.  There are no other EU measures requiring transposition.</P>
      <P>Under Article 169 of the EC Treaty letters have been received from the EC Commission in respect of item numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 12.  Reasoned opinions have been received in respect of Item numbers 2, 6, 9 and 12.</P>
      <P>Formal proceedings have been initiated against Ireland on 9 August, 1991 under Article 169 for alleged infringements of Community Law (under Articles 30, 34 and 37 of the EC Treaty) by retaining exclusive rights in relation to the import and export of electricity. As part of this procedure the Commission forwarded a reasoned opinion to the Irish authorities on 26 November 1992.  A response to the reasoned opinion was issued to the Commission on 25 March 1993.  A formal reply from the Commission has not yet been received.</P>
      <P>No proceedings against Ireland are pending before the Court of Justice of the European Union in respect of the Directives yet to be transposed.  No judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union has been given against Ireland and consequently no proceedings have been initiated under Article 171.</P>

      <P>The £26 million investment programme being undertaken at Whitegate Refinery is being funded from the internal sources and trading operations of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.  There is no Exchequer subvention for the development.  The investment programme, together with marketing initiatives and a broader range of products is <Col N="1053" /> intended to enable the refinery to operate on a commercial basis at open market prices from the end of 1996 when the system of mandatory sales of petroleum products at cost-recovery prices will be terminated.  The total effect of the programme will be to eliminate the operational diseconomy at the refinery which currently necessitates the charging prices above open market levels.  The amount of saving to be achieved depends on market conditions from time to time and could be substantial based on past experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the experience here and in most developed countries that demand for orthodontic treatment exceeds real need where the service is provided free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, my Department has asked health boards to apply certain objective criteria in assessing degrees of priority of need for specialist orthodontic treatment on the basis of degree of handicap and severity of malocclusion.  I am satisfied that these criteria continue to be <Col N="1058" /> fair and relevant, and not in need of review at this stage.</P>
    <P>For many years most health boards were unable to recruit consultant orthodontists to head up their secondary care orthodontic services.  In those circumstances, patients were assessed for orthodontic treatment by the health board's own dental staff and provisional waiting lists for secondary care orthodontic treatment were drawn up on the basis of these assessments.  During the past two years consultant orthodontists have been successfully recruited by the Southern, North-Western, South-Eastern, Western and Eastern Health Boards.  A consultant orthodontist has been with the Mid-Western Health Board since 1985.</P>
    <P>One of the first tasks of the newly appointed consultant orthodontists has been to reassess the cases already provisionally placed on orthodontic waiting lists and to validate these waiting lists. Inevitably, some persons on the provisional lists are not being included in the validated and up-dated waiting lists as in the opinion of the consultant orthodontist their treatment need does not come within the guidelines.</P>
    <P>In 1993 I allocated an additional £2 million for developments in the dental services including the development of orthodontic services.  This year I will provide further resources to the health boards to continue the development of orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>My Department is in discussions with the Western Health Board regarding their requirements for the further development of their orthodontic services in 1994 and over the period of the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board that figures prepared by Aoibhneas appear to show that, during 1993, 200 women and 490 children could not be assisted by their service.  However, <Col N="1065" /> the board have advised me that women and children who needed to be placed in alternative accommodation were provided with assistance by the board through Womens Aid and other refuges and hostels.  I accept however, that there is a shortfall in the number of refuge places available in Dublin and I am aware that Aoibhneas have plans to build a larger refuge.</P>
      <P>During 1993 the level of financial support provided by the health boards to womens' refuges nationally reached £806,162 which represents almost 90 per cent of the total amount spent on women's refuges during that year.  I also approved the provision of additional emergency accommodation for victims of domestic violence in Navan, Castlebar and Letterkenny and the appointment of additional social workers and child care workers to provide support to families in difficulty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 211 together.  I am fully aware of the need to encourage research in our higher education institutions not only because of its crucial role in the advancement of learning in all academic disciplines but also because of the contribution applied research can make to economic development.</P>
      <P>About 12 per cent of university students are engaged in postgraduate work while in the sciences the figure is in the region of 21 per cent.</P>
      <P>The advanced technical skills programme which is assisted under the European Social Fund has a useful contribution to make and is being restructured so that the resources available will be directed more specifically to meet the needs of the sectors identified as priorities under the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>The 1992 legislation for the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Regional Technical Colleges includes a specific remit to these institutions to engage in research, consultancy and development work and to provide services in relation to these matters.</P>
      <P>I have approved senior positions as head of development in the regional technical colleges so that the colleges can, <i>inter alia</i>, fully develop their role in this area taking account of the specific statutory regional remit of these colleges.</P>

      <P>I have appointed governing bodies to the regional technical colleges in Athlone, Carlow, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Sligo, Tallaght and Tralee to 31 March, 1995.  The academic staff representatives on these governing bodies have to be appointed as yet.</P>
      <P>While none of the governing bodies appointed represents an appropriate gender balance, four of the eight governing bodies did achieve almost or in excess of 25 per cent female representation. This is, however, an unsatisfactory outcome and the Government has authorised the drafting of a Bill as a matter of priority to amend the existing legislation for the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology which will deal with issue of gender balance in the governing bodies.</P>
      <P>In relation to the universities, the position is that I have no function in relation to appointments to the governing authorities of Trinity College or St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  In the case of the constituent university colleges of the National University of Ireland, the Government appoints to the governing bodies only three members in the case of UCC and UCG and four members in UCD.  The balance of the members are either <i>ex officio</i>, elected or co-opted by the governing bodies themselves.</P>
      <P>The governing bodies of the University of Limerick and Dublin City University were appointed in 1992 for a five year period.</P>

      <P>A grant of £1.75 million was allocated in 1988 to Cork Corporation under my Department's multi-annual capital programme for the provision of major sports facilities.  The project involves the provision of a 25 metre swimming pool complex with ancillary indoor facilities.</P>
      <P>Following the planning process the Department, in consultation with Cork Corporation, invited proposals for the project in 1991 on the basis of a design, finance, construct and management package.  No satisfactory proposals emerged from this process and it was agreed that the project should proceed on a traditional design and tender basis.</P>
      <P>In view of the lapse of time since the grant was originally allocated Cork Corporation undertook a reassessment of the facilities to be provided taking account of the needs of the area and the competing facilities which have been established in the intervening years.  As a result the proposals previously prepared by Cork Corporation are being revised in consultation with my Department, following which the detail design can be completed and tenders invited.</P>

At present over 200 schools from both parts of Ireland and the Continent participate in the project.  The overall aim of the programme is to encourage co-operation among participating students and staff and to contribute to educational development in the wider dimension of the European Union through informing students about current social, economic and political issues at national and European level.  It also equips students with a variety of skills, particularly those of communication through modern technology and co-operation in multi-school projects.  My Department is at present discussing the future development of the project with the Department of Education <Col N="1076" /> in Northern Ireland with a possible view to extending it to a greater number of schools.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration for Peace and Reconciliation of the Irish and UK Governments represented a significant event in the search for peace.  I have arranged for a copy of the Declaration to be made available to schools with a request that teachers and pupils be made fully aware of its terms and objectives.</P>

      <P>The staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment of Teevogue national school on 30 September 1993 was 57 which warrants a staffing of a principal and one assistant teacher for the 1994-95 school year.  The school also has the services of a shared remedial teacher.  Accordingly, the second assistant's post will be suppressed with effect from the end of the current <Col N="1078" /> school year.  The teacher in question has been given the option of having her name placed on the diocesan panel for re-deployment to another school from I September 1994.</P>

      <P>Second level schools are encouraged in a variety of ways to promote the teaching of European languages.  Modern language programmes are in place at junior certificate and leaving certificate levels.  The study of a European language is a compulsory part of the leaving certificate vocational programme.  Arrangements have been made for the <i>ab initio</i> study of a European language at senior <Col N="1079" /> cycle, that is where senior cycle pupils can begin the study of a language and sit the junior certificate examination paper in that subject at the time of sitting their leaving certificate examination.</P>
      <P>In addition to standard staffing and financial resources made available to schools, my Department is prepared, in certain cases, to sanction extra part-time teaching hours for the introduction of modern continental languages. Resources are also provided for the professional development of language teachers, including grants to enable teachers to attend courses in teaching and methodology in a target language country.  These teachers are replaced during this time by a native speaker who is a qualified full-time teacher in his/her own country.  In addition, each year foreign language assistants who are usually trainee teachers from mainland European countries are available to work in our schools alongside Irish language teachers and under their guidance.  Provision is also made under the LINGUA and other EU programmes for teacher exchange and for teacher and pupil exchange.</P>

      <P>My Department issued guidelines on the development of sex-relationships education to the authorities of post-primary schools in February 1987.

    <P>With regard to the specific topic of HIV-AIDS, my Department, in co-operation with the Department of Health, has prepared a detailed package of educational <Col N="1080" /> resource materials on HIV-AIDS.

The issue of the package was followed by a series of 27 in-service days organised by the two Departments and held during the two years following. In addition, there is an annual summer school for teachers on the topic of HIV-AIDS and drug abuse, organised by the Departments of Education and Health in co-operation with the Mater Dei Counselling Centre.</P>
    <P>I have announced the establishment of an expert advisory group to advise me on relationships and sex education with the following terms of reference: (a) to identify the existing provision for relationships and sex education in order to provide a background for the group's work; (b) to provide guidelines for schools on the process by which management, staff and parents are consulted and involved as the school clarifies, specifies and discloses its policy on relationships and sex education; (c) to provide information and teaching materials to support teachers and schools in the development of a relationships and sex education programme &mdash; this programme will be in the context of existing school ethos and will be appropriate to the physical, social and emotional development stages of pupils of different age groups in primary and post-primary schools; (d) to advise on appropriate in-career development provision; (e) to report within two months.</P>

      <P>Representatives of school managerial authorities have made submissions to my Department seeking increased grants towards the recurrent costs of schools.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have secured substantial increases in the capitation grant for primary schools over the last two years.  The standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from a level of £28 in 1992, to £33 in 1993 and £38 for 1994.  I am satisfied that these increase represent a very positive step towards improving the financial position of primary schools.  The Department grant is, of course, augmented by a local contribution of at least 25 per cent of the Department grant.  The sum required to meet the local contribution is provided by the parish or other appropriate analogous community or body, from general funds at the disposal of such community or body without any levy on parents of children attending the school.  The manner in which these funds are raised locally is a matter for the board of management of each primary school.</P>
      <P>The State does not meet the full cost of voluntary secondary schools but makes available an annual <i>per capita</i> grant in respect of recognised pupils.  I am pleased to have been able to increase the <i>per capita</i> grant towards the recurrent costs of secondary schools in the free education scheme from £150 to £158 per annum with effect from January 1994.  I have also introduced a special enhanced <i>per capita</i> grant for schools designated as disadvantaged by my Department.  In addition, increased funding is being made available towards the provision of caretaking services in eligible secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comprehensive and community schools are funded on the basis of an annual budget rather than a specific <i>per capita</i> grant.  Funding in respect of the running costs of vocational schools is included in the grant paid towards the cost of the overall educational scheme of each vocational education committee. There will be increases within the approved budgets of the vocational education <Col N="1082" /> committee and community-comprehensive school sectors also in 1994.</P>
    <P>Contributions from parents and other sources are not compulsory but where they are available on a genuinely voluntary basis they are a welcome addition to school resources.  The manner in which such contributions are collected is a matter for school principles and managements provided that all concerned &mdash; parents, pupils and school authorities &mdash; clearly understand their voluntary character and that the manner of their collection does not in practice create a situation where parents and pupils can reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.</P>
