    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I am sure that can be arranged by the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the day following the celebration of the 75th anniversary of this democratic assembly, I am sure all of us would wish to mark the transition to full democracy and the historic events which are occurring today in South Africa and wish that country, with whom Ireland <Col N="3" /> has had great contact over many years, every success and prosperity as a result of the introduction of full democracy. I am sure the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, in particular, would like to be associated with those remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's comments are timely. As he is aware we established full diplomatic relations with South Africa during recent months. This is an historic day for South Africa, but there are still considerable difficulties and obstacles to overcome. I am sure the Government, Members of this House and the Irish people send their good wishes to the people of South Africa today and the hope that their democracy and new society can be established on a sound footing. On behalf of the Irish Government I convey our wishes to all leaders in South Africa in the hope that their democracy can be established and will thrive in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Bruton and the Tánaiste. This is an historic day for South Africa. We can learn a lesson from this, their first free elections, in that they have provided for their emigrants to vote abroad. I hope we can put into practice what they have been able to do in their first free elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, want to be associated with those sentiments. This is a major new dawn for the people of South Africa. We can only hope that the inordinate problems that will confront that society after its transformation will be effectively and peacefully tackled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa chomh maith mo chuid beannachtaí a chur in iúl do mhuintir an Aifric Theas. I am sure there is a great deal of promised legislation to come in South Africa, but I would like to tie into the Bill before the House what is happening in that country in respect of votes for emigrants whether in local or general elections. We have an opportunity to do something about this <Col N="4" /> and emulate some of the more progressive legislation in South Africa in respect of votes for emigrants. Will the Tánaiste pass on those comments to the Minister for the Environment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have before me a copy of the Programme for a Partnership Government which contains a commitment to develop a third banking force here involving the Trustee Savings Bank. As the Tánaiste was obviously involved in drawing up that document, where stands that commitment now as it appears the Minister for Finance proposes to sell off secretly the State's interest in the Trustee Savings Bank without an option, an open bid to one possible purchaser?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste anticipate the need for legislation to provide for this attempt to sell the taxpayers' interest in Trustee Savings Bank to a foreign bank?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a commitment in the Programme for Government in respect of a third banking force and it is under active consideration by the Government. There are no proposals <Col N="5" /> before the Government from the National Australia Bank or the Trustee Savings Bank at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste has developed a good sense of humour: he refers to a third banking force being under active consideration when it is obviously going down the drain and the person who is pushing it down is sitting beside him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always had a sense of humour. One of the problems was the Deputy did not recognise it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to a matter I raised yesterday morning on the intention of National Australia Bank to gobble up the Trustee Savings Bank, and I wonder if the Labour Party is still opposed to that? If so, it is a uniquely Labour Party contibution to the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste say why the Government is not prepared to give more time to debate the Local Government Bill? Following yesterday's debate we reached amendment No. 3 of the 129 amendments and one day remains to debate the rest of the amendments, the sections and the remaining Stages.</P>

      <P>Deputy, please resume your seat. We are about to resume Committee Stage of the Bill. I appreciate there is a time limit on it. A request for consultations with the Whips was made by Deputy Enda Kenny, maybe the matter to which the Deputy refers can be resolved, but I do not know. It is primarily for the Whips. The House has already decided the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister for the Environment offered to take this Bill last week, to provide more time. Discussions took place between the Whips &mdash; I assume Deputy Molloy has been in consultation with his Whip &mdash; and, as suggested by Deputy Kenny also, we have said that if more time is required in respect of Report Stage that aspect can be discussed today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that when privatisation takes place under a Fianna Fáil-Labour Government it is done on a sweetheart basis? Why is there not an open bid and a number of bidders allowed take part?  Why is there only one possible purchaser?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1991, Woodchester, Ulster Bank, Irish Life and others were in a competitive auction. That does not apply in respect of this case and a full statement should be given by the Tánaiste as to whether amending legislation will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe history is not only being made in South Africa. Fine Gael is admonishing the Labour Party about its attitude to privatisation, an interesting turn-up for the books.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to get the proper price. We are wary of sweetheart deals and exclusive bids involving friends. We want no secret deals. Such deals involving a sale to one bidder are the Labour Party's method of privatisation. The Tánaiste would not sell his house to one bidder.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste should, not rush at this stage. I seek the Chair's assistance. The point I wish to make is not a reflection on the Chair's judgment in respect of a parliamentary question &mdash; I accept his response. I tabled a parliamentary question requesting information as to whether programme managers, advisers and special assistants were likely to be candidates in the local elections. I received a communication from the Chair's office indicating this was a matter for the private individuals, but I respectively submit it is not.</P>

      <P>I was virtually finished my remarks when the debate adjourned yesterday evening. The remaining comments I wish to make relate to my amendment which is being taken with the batch of amendments under discussion. Deputy Durkan on the Order of Business drew attention to a question he tabled on the possibility of any of the army of advisers and handlers employed by Government Ministers participating in the local elections. My amendment would prevent people employed in the office of a Minister or Minister of State from participating in the elections.</P>
      <P>There are two matters to be considered here, the first of which relates to Ministers' offices. It is a regular feature of the offices of most Ministers and Ministers of State that there are three or four people, be they programme managers, public relations people or advisers, engaged there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what has this to do with the amendments before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It has a lot to do with them. We are dealing with section 6 which proposes to disqualify from membership of a local authority people such as Commissioners of the European Union and the Comptroller and Auditor General. A number of Members, including myself, have proposed that there should be deletions from or additions to that list. I am proposing to include the people employed as advisers, programme managers and so on to Government Ministers, <Col N="13" /> and I have a specific reason for doing so.</P>
      <P>During the debate yesterday there was considerable discussion as to the extent local government should be overlapped with central Government. There is probably no more centralised version of central Government than the concentration of power in the private offices of Government Ministers, which by and large rests in the political appointees made by Ministers to their offices to provide them with advice. Programme managers and advisers who are not directly accountable to this House, who, from what we hear, make the real decisions about legislation and the form in which it is introduced, are the shadow Cabinet.</P>
      <P>I am drawing attention to the number of such persons employed in Ministers' offices, in addition to the large number of civil servants who are used in these offices to do constituency work on behalf of Minister. If one adds the number of advisers, programme managers, public relations people and civil servants who are transferred from normal Civil Service work to answering letters from constituents and attending to normal constituency servicing that most Members of the House carry out on their own behalf, there are probably between eight and ten such people engaged in work essentially designed to make Ministers look good to their constituents and to the press. If that number is multiplied by 30 there is an industry of advisers, programme managers and civil servants assigned to Ministers' offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A different style of Government is emerging. Very rarely does a Minister make an important announcement in this House; Ministers' announcements are made outside the House. I would be amazed if the people employed in Ministers' offices, providing advice, writing scripts, organising press conferences and processing legislation, found time to attend a humble meeting of a town commission or an urban district council and I would like to ensure that they are spared that onerous responsibility. Because of the intimate involvement of those people in the workings of Government at central <Col N="14" /> level, people who in many cases are the power behind the throne, just as Ministers and Ministers of State are prevented from being members of local authorities, these people should also be so prevented. That would be a much more appropriate way of devolving the concentration of power from central level to local level than the superficial proposal to disqualify members of the Oireachtas from membership of local authorities.</P>

      <P>I heard it. Some people have a hang-up about Deputies being members of local authorities. Why home in on TDs?  Why not exclude doctors, dentists, carpenters, busmen or any other business or trade?  Why should we specifically exclude people who are Members of either House of the Oireachtas?  Most people who are members of a local authority have another occupation. To a large extent, politicians have a degree of flexibility and they are certainly in a better position to combine their membership of a local authority with their job as a TD or a Senator than people in nine to five jobs. I do not understand, therefore, why these amendments were put down.</P>
      <P>Various exclusions are listed in the Bill including people of unsound mind, certain politicians and criminals. Deputy Sargent wants the exclusion of people of unsound mind removed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sargent wants the politicians excluded but he wants people of unsound mind to be in a position to run for an election. I find that rather surprising.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he seems to have a strange view on the matter. I do not support amendments Nos. 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 7 and paragraphs (m) and (n), is that a new provision or did it always exist? Some people on Dublin City Council, members of Deputy Sargent's party, foolishly or otherwise, took a court action against the local authority. I believe it was taken against the Dublin City Council/Dublin County Council combined. The action was taken because these people felt strongly about a matter which they could not block through the normal committee structure. Whether one agrees with their action is another matter but these people, who are students of small means, now have a huge legal debt against them. I would prefer to defeat those people politically before the people rather than have them excluded or prevented from running for election because of the action they took.</P>
      <P>If this provision was always in place I will accept it but if it is a new provision I would like the Minister to comment on it. I have some sympathy for these people. Their actions were well meaning and if the system allows someone to take a High Court action without having a guarantor or the means to back up the case, it is unfair to debar them from election afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the view that handlers should be debarred from participating in local elections because handlers are now becoming full time local <Col N="16" /> politicians in issuing statements, etc. It is not the great disadvantage of other elected members of local authorities and members of any level that this should be the case. Because these handlers are a new invention and hold a unique position, particularly in the Labour Party, they should be debarred from standing in local authority elections and that provision should be included in the Bill. I am not sure that any of them would have sufficient time to represent people at a local level but should it happen in the future, this exclusion should be contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There have been examples of handlers being more devious than local politicians in any regard. In one case I had been making representations for approximately a year, along with other representatives from the area, concerning a 7th year class in St. Patrick's national school. I received a Dáil reply on 23 June 1993 informing me that the Minister for Education had decided that this class could not be extended. On 26 March I received a letter from the Minister, dated 21 March, informing me again that this request could not be granted. I then notified all the parents who had contacted me and I gave them a copy of the Minister's reply saying that this could not be done. Lo and behold, on 21 March, the date of the Minister's reply to me, a statement by a Labour Minister in my constituency was read on Galway FM to the effect that the extension of this class had been granted. When I inquired from Galway FM I was told that they received that information from the Minister's handler. Handlers should not be involved in such matters. They should not give certain information to a TD while, in the same week, giving completely opposite information to another representative for the area.</P>
      <P>Such people should be debarred from standing for local authority elections because of the manner in which they are now misusing their positions. It should be clearly written into the Bill that handlers are included in the list of people debarred from seeking election to local authorities or at any other level.</P>

      <P>We should deal with this matter without reflecting on civil servants or officials. It has been a longstanding tradition of this House that they are not reflected upon and that the Minister concerned is responsible, not the officials.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke earlier I dealt with the matter of the dual mandate. Deputy Ahern has raised the other matters that are contained in my amendments and I will deal with them now.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the dual mandate, the people who are both members of local authorities and Members of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann are decision-makers. It is not by way of pointing out that doctors or anybody else should come into the same bracket. A very different criterion is used for people who are decision-makers and that must be recognised. It also relates to a democracy, to equality and to distributing the decision-making in this country as broadly as possible so that it can reflect the greatest common good and public will. That is the purpose of my amendment; it is not discriminatory as the Deputy might suggest. The same applies to Deputy Gilmore's amendment, although it is slightly limiting in that it deals only with handlers and officials and does not go so far as to include TDs. The argument, however, is basically the same, these people are decision-makers in one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment, which proposes to delete paragraph (k), is sought simply on the basis that a law should not be enacted that cannot be enforced within specific parameters. If we say a person of unsound mind should not stand for election will public representatives be assessed for soundness of mind or will there be a psychological service available to treat those of unsound mind? Who <Col N="18" /> defines &ldquo;unsound mind&rdquo;? Is the same level required for a responsible job such as chairman and for ordinary councillors? The proposal is fraught with danger and open to abuse. How can it be justified? Is it fair and objective? Down through the ages people whom we now acknowledge as geniuses were thought to have been quite mad in their own time, for example Van Gogh, whose paintings now command high prices. I am anxious to ensure we do not make laws that cannot be enforced.</P>
    <P>The deletion sought by Deputy Gilmore is likely to be abused. I thank Deputy Ahern for his understanding and appreciate that he raised the case of a city councillor and county councillor, both of my party, faced with enormous debt. They did not incur this debt through gambling or dealing on the stock market but because they were legally advised there was a problem with a planning decision and it had to be challenged. They were prepared, in the interest of the public good, to go to whatever lengths it took within the legal process and have now incurred a substantial charge against them. According to the Bill they are put in the same category as those who defraud and are dishonest. That is the exact opposite of what they tried to do. Not only did they try to deal with the matter legally &mdash; they did not indulge in uncivil action of any kind &mdash; but out of their own meagre resources. The Minister should show understanding for people who are prepared to go to such lengths in the public interest and not put them in the same bracket as those guilty of dishonest dealing and corrupt practice. People should be entitled to challenge the law without being penalised and made give up their position on the council. That is an important part of the Bill and I hope the Minister will amend it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts my first amendment, disqualification from the date of conviction if one is a member of the Joint Services Committee, etc., would not be relevant as a Deputy would not be a councillor, and for very good reason, as many would argue. That is mentioned in the submission from the general council <Col N="19" /> of county councils. The Minister should take on board the points I have made and accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My party and I do not agree that people should be excluded from standing for office at local or national level. In the interests of democracy people are entitled to stand for election. However, there comes a point where we must decide whether groups of people are entitled to stand and on that basis I tabled amendment No. 8.</P>
      <P>We should devolve as much power as possible to local government if we are to have a real second tier of government which is worthwhile, workable and representative of the people we serve. It would be in the interests of democracy for people to devote their attention to either that tier of government or national Government. No one should be debarred from standing for election provided they adhere to the laws of the land.</P>
      <P>However, I take on board the point about people working in ministerial offices and so on. I do not believe they should be debarred but their employers have a responsibility to stop what is happening at present. I am a great defender of this Chamber and the day is fast arriving when it will become irrelevant. The spin doctors and handlers arrange set pieces outside the House to ensure maximum publicity for a Minister or Minister of State and ignore the fact that they are answerable under the Constitution to this Assembly. This is part of the problem we face every morning on the Order of Business. Pure frustration drives Opposition Members when they see blatant abuse of State facilities and money to promote individuals. Major statements should be made in the House and proper answers given to parliamentary questions. A Deputy should not read in the newspaper the following morning that there was a press conference announcing the very matter he or she inquired about in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People elect some of those who stand and that is their choice. It is not the fact that people stand for local government <Col N="20" /> that causes the problem. That is just a sham. I hope before it is too late that the Government will wake up to what is happening and stop it. We hear about it during our campaigning for the Euro-elections. The Government parties will have a rude awakening when they knock on people's doors as a result of the behaviour of programme managers and spin doctors who spend their time promoting individuals rather than in interests of the country. At the end of the day they are paid out of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>I will not use this occasion to seek to debar people who may wish to stand for election from doing so; it is up to the public to decide whether they should be elected. My amendment No. 8 endeavours to tackle the problem in a real way by forcing the Government to devolve real power to local authorities so that we have a proper and effective system of local government. When this has been achieved the Minister can then bring before both Houses of the Oireachtas a regulation which would debar Members from participating in local government.</P>
    <P>The real argument is whether we should have two levels of government or one centralised system. Fine Gael believes that we should have a two tier system of government, local and national. When I refer to local government I mean real local government and not the present excuse for a system under which public representatives cannot blow their noses without first checking with the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Finance. Under the relevant Acts the county manager enjoys almost twice the power of elected representatives. We pretend we have a local government system but in reality we do not.</P>
    <P>The House should not divide on this issue &mdash; I believe some members of the Government parties share my views on it. Under my amendment Parliament will decide whether real and effective powers have been devolved to local government, and it will do so before it supports the motion which the Minister will be obliged to bring before both Houses of the <Col N="21" /> Oireachtas. This is the way foward, and I hope the Minister will respond positively to my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very concerned if paragraphs (m) and (n) were not deleted from section 6 (1). Under this section a public representative could find himself in difficulties for a number of reasons either deliberately or accidentally or through inability to pay. None of these reasons justifies the exclusion of someone from holding public office in the way proposed in the Bill. Until recently a person who did not pay his service charges because he felt they were wrong could not get a higher education grant from a local authority. That rule has rightly been changed. Rules can change because of political pressure and a person who may be in conflict with the local authority one day may have no dispute with it the following day.</P>
      <P>In some cases people may simply be unable to pay a debt. I would cite as an example the long-standing difficulty in my local authority about section 4s. Recently the county manager proposed that councillors should hold themselves personally liable for any compensation claims which might arise from section 4s. I accept that councillors who pass section 4s should be accountable for those decisions. I do not have a problem in principle with this proposal, but I have a difficulty in imposing a surcharge on a councillor or other public representative who makes a decision in good faith in the interests of the public. Such councillors are doing their best. Even though they may be eccentric, which is a good thing in every walk of life, the majority of councillors are of sound mind and any incorrect decision they make should not reflect on the ability to act as public representatives. It would be wrong, therefore, to hold public representatives liable for any compensation claims or to exclude them from standing for election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 5, the position in regard to a public representative who is fortunate enough to be elected to the Dáil and who is also serving on a local authority is very different; the two functions <Col N="22" /> dovetail very well. The meetings of this House are arranged so that public representatives can carry out those dual functions. I hope my performance as a Deputy is enhanced rather than diminished through my involvement in a local authority.</P>
    <P>As a TD I am accountable for my actions every day, yet programme managers and special advisers who wield power are not accountable and never have to answer for their actions. There is no transparency in this secret, enclosed system. I would not like to see such a system introduced at local authority level. Although the local authority system is very limited it is open and members know where they stand and that they are accountable. I would not like a secretive system of holding power to be extended to local authorities as it would diminish the extent to which they are accountable to the public.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Bill, it is a pity it does not go further. Calls have been made over a period of time for including photographs of the candidates in local and national elections on the ballot paper. I cannot understand the resistance to these calls as it would help those who suffer from dyslexia or are illiterate. One has only to look at the elections in South Africa to see why we should implement this proposal. I do not understand why it is not possible to include photographs on the ballot papers for local authority elections even on an experimental basis. It is a pity that no proposal along these lines has been included in this Bill which deals with local government reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the points made by previous speakers about public representatives who are both local authority members and TDs. Most Deputies served their apprenticeship in their local authorities &mdash; we were not parachuted into the Dáil. Local authorities deal with bread and butter issues and our membership of them strengthens our profile in the Dáil. Another very important aspect is that TDs remain in contact with the public through their membership of local authorities <Col N="23" /> and are conscious of what is happening on the ground. If anything, it results in a better performance in this House because people can be truly representative of constituents' interests. I do not support the amendments tabled by the Green Party because it would be a retrograde step for democracy if Members of these Houses were debarred from membership of local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have elaborated my reason for being in favour of membership of local authorities. There is much talk about devolution, subsidiarity and other buzz words, yet local authorities' finances are being depleted because they have to assume many functions delegated to them by the European Union. There should be a consciousness of the cost of local authorities implementing European Union regulations in parallel with a consciousness by the Government to give them assistance in that regard. There is the farcical position at present of local authorities being responsible for the maintenance of courthouses, which should be the responsibility of the Department of Justice and which merely leads to a diminution of local authorities' assets base.</P>
      <P>Many aspects of local government beyond the proposals of this Bill must be analysed if we are serious about reform.</P>

I understand that the Whips are meeting with a view to agreeing an extension of the time allowed for this debate. Obviously it will finish much later this evening than had been anticipated and I am happy to facilitate the House in this regard. I was anxious to take Committee Stage last week but I understand the difficulties that posed for Members opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finucane raised the question of candidates' photographs appearing on <Col N="24" /> ballot papers. That is a matter for electoral law in which a number of changes have been effected, clearly a proposal for future consideration.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to effect changes in regard to European Union regulations presenting local authorities with financial problems in their implementation. I accept there are times when impositions require additional resources and I have some ideas on how I might help in that area in the future.</P>
    <P>Several Members, particularly last evening, availed of the opportunity of the debate on amendments not merely to widen the debate generally but to belittle and lambaste the very nature of the proposals in this Bill yet the first person I met in the Mansion House last evening was someone who will be affected by the Bill and who congratulated me on its introduction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy has been much longer in Government than I have been.

      <P>I sat here yesterday evening and earlier this morning and did not interrupt anybody. The same courtesy should be shown to me to reply to some of the questions raised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy also criticised me for having postponed local elections. I might remind him that he was a member of a Government that postponed local elections in 1990; they were postponed indefinitely in 1991. There is not much point in the Deputy castigating me for taking such action as though others in the past never contemplated doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Members referred to the powers and resources of local authorities. At no stage in our history have new powers been granted to local authorities under successive Bills. The reason it is difficult <Col N="25" /> to get candidates to stand in local elections is not because local authorities do not have powers but because the overall experience of serving in public life has changed. It would be no harm to reflect on the number of ways in which it has changed. It is now much more demanding, requiring considerably greater attention, hours, dedication and commitment. That is not to decry the work of others in the past. All Members will be aware that, despite the assistance of new communications systems, electronics and so on, pressures have increased leading to a number of people deciding it is not something in which they want to engage. We are extremely anxious to encourage young people of both sexes to become engaged in politics but it is becoming more difficult, not merely because potential candidates might require more powers. There has been a deliberate attempt to use this Bill as a vehicle to present a scenario most Members know not to be in accordance with the facts. The extension of the role of local authorities, their flexibility, not only in construction, acquisition, maintenance, housing extensions, the provisions of bathrooms, remedial schemes linked with voluntary schemes and their contribution to urban renewal schemes, have no parallel in the past and there was no direct ministerial involvement.</P>
    <P>We can look also to the activities of local authorities <i>vis-à-vis</i> national primary routes, their design and operations in that area. This year the level of resources being made available to them for county roads &mdash; where there are also problems &mdash; will be without parallel, £160 million between their own, State and European Union resources. There is also the drawing up and delivery of programmes in the sanitary services area where these have been delivered in parts of Dún Laoghaire, Wicklow, Arklow and other places nationwide. We should at least acknowledge that local authorities in many areas have given the public a very good service, they will be spending up to £1.6 billion this year. They are able to implement projects although we should all like to see them do more and <Col N="26" /> find extra resources to help them. Members should not decry the exceptionally good work undertaken in many local authority areas.</P>
    <P>Many contributors seemed to belittle and lambaste provisions not previously enacted by any of my predecessors. This is the first time a Government decided in favour of the establishment of town councils and extensions to town boundaries and new borough councils. Local authorities will be based in towns where there had been none to date. Over the past 20 years Fine Gael was in office for a ten-year period when all that was introduced was a Control of Dogs Bill. Therefore, it will clearly be seen that we are making progress.</P>
    <P>There have been many unsubstantiated attacks on programme managers and people working in ministerial offices. I would have expected Deputy Molloy, and perhaps Deputy Barrett, to have known at first hand the difficulties encountered in ministerial office, simultaneously endeavouring to serve one's constituency, deal with other developments associated with the office and the support services required to do so effectively. As Members know, many of the people who work in these offices are extremely committed and dedicated. They are involved in a process of trying to deliver a good service to the community, shaping new legislation, getting agreement where there are differences. Nothing can be found wrong with that. The Government's record on legislation in the past year has been recognised to be without parallel. The amount of legislation processed exceeds that in any of the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The dual mandate is not the major issue in this legislation. I was accused of taking this issue as the major item. Deputy Gilmore was obsessed with this issue. His party has always been open to members wishing to hold office at various levels, but there are differing views on the matter in this House. I have no hesitation in telling the House that I would have no real objection to a total ban. We should move gradually towards the separation of these two important functions. <Col N="27" /> Like all Deputies I am a democrat and I listen to the views of every Member and try to reflect on what has been said. On the one hand, an argument is made for giving all powers to local authorities and, on the other, I am being asked to take a stand which is totally against the views of other Members. I try to find a balance in all that. Perhaps some think I have an obligation to go further; I do not think so. In the past I have introduced legislation in which I would have liked to go further; this is one such Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies Molloy and Sargent propose prohibiting all Oireachtas Members from election to or membership of a local authority. As I explained on Second Stage, I have given careful consideration to this matter and I have listened to contributions in the House and elsewhere, some of which were diametrically opposed, ranging from a blanket prohibition to absolute freedom. Such a prohibition is not the norm in most European countries. Deputies Liz McManus and Noel Ahern see continuity of local authority membership as enhancing their work in the House. There are varying views on that issue, but each Deputy is entitled to his or her view.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a further extension of the process begun in 1991 of excluding a range of public office holders. This, and the related provision to preclude Oireachtas Members from being local authority cathaoirleach or leaschathaoirleach, will also serve as a signal in favour of separate local and national representation as a generally desirable objective. It is against the background of the Barrington report, a Council of Europe report, last year's report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the views of local authority members who are not Oireachtas Members that we are obliged to examine the matter of the dual mandate with the view to making progress. I have already indicated to the House that there may be an opportunity in the future to take further steps.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Gilmore's amendment relating to staff in ministerial <Col N="28" /> offices, the position is that persons, other than regular civil servants, employed in the offices of Ministers and Ministers of State are engaged as temporary unestablished civil servants on a contract basis. Their appointments are coterminous with those of the Ministers in whose offices they are employed. Because of the temporary nature of their employment, it would be inappropriate to debar them from membership of local authorities. I appreciate Deputy Barrett's contribution in relation to that matter.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Sargent's &ldquo;unsound mind&rdquo; proposal, disqualification of persons of &ldquo;unsound mind&rdquo; already applies in respect of the Dáil. The wording here is identical to that used in the Dáil code in section 41 (1) of the Electoral Act, 1992. This is not a new provision nor is it exclusive to Ireland. In most member states of the European Union it appears that severe mental illness disqualifies both for voting and for membership of the national parliament. The disqualifying condition is expressed in different ways in the various member states. For example, in Denmark, it is defined as &ldquo;persons declared incapable of managing own affairs&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>That covers a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That could apply to Ministers, Ministers of State and probably half the Members of this House. I am sure at some stage in their career they would have said they could have managed their affairs better. In Germany the disqualification condition is expressed as &ldquo;mental disability&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this amendment is carried, it would create a somewhat anomalous position whereby persons of unsound mind would be disqualified for membership of the national Parliament, but would not be disqualified for membership of a local authority. That ineligibility would apply to persons suffering from severe mental illness or deficiency and not to persons who might, from time to time, suffer from nervous or similar disorders. Any decision in this regard, in the case of a <Col N="29" /> dispute, would be a matter for the courts, having considered the medical evidence.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 7 tabled by Deputies Gilmore and Sargent, the current law as regards the audit disqualification is contained in section 62 of the Local Government Act, 1925. It is included here in paragraph (m) as part of the consolidation of the law relating to local authority disqualifications. The disqualification only comes into effect on the expiration of the time limit for an appeal to the Minister and the courts or when the surcharge is upheld in the case of an appeal. Deputies will appreciate that a surcharge is not lightly made and will usually arise in case of illegality or misuse of funds. It is only when all the options for appeal are exhausted that the disqualification will come into effect. This provision has existed for many years and has not caused problems. I propose to move an amendment on Report Stage which will limit the duration of such a disqualification to five years; at present it continues to apply indefinitely unless the sum surcharged is paid by the member concerned.</P>
    <P>The second disqualification the Deputies wish to have removed is the disqualification in paragraph (n) relating to moneys owed to a local authority.</P>
    <P>For many years existing law &mdash; section 57 of the Local Government Act, 1941 &mdash; has disqualified a person for non-payment of rates. If rates were not paid disqualification automatically ensued; no court conviction was necessary. This provision will be repealed and the new situation will provide for equal treatment on a uniform basis in respect of all debts owed to a local authority. However the disqualification will only arise where the matter has been pursued to finality through the courts to the award of a final judgement, order or decree, not automatically at the end of a financial year as is currently the case for rates. The disqualification will therefore only come about after a lengthy process. The local authority will have issued reminders, followed by final notice etc. before initiating court proceedings. The section also allows time for appeal through the courts <Col N="30" /> to take account of cases in which there is an appeal from a court judgement. It is only when the final decision has been made that the disqualification will come into effect. The disqualification will apply for a period of five years by virtue of subsection 2<i>(a).</i> This is a very reasonable approach, particularly when viewed against the current situation as regards rates. I would therefore ask the Deputies to withdraw the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said a great deal but suggests that he might, rather than would, accept the amendment on the dual mandate if he got the support of other Deputies. Not only is the Minister in favour in principle of my amendment, but the General Council of County Councils would support it. The Commission for the Status of Women in its recommendations also supports my amendment. If the Minister is serious about being democratic he might consider asking the people who have to live with these decisions whether they support them. One may say they can make their decision at election time but there is considerable confusion about the work of councillors and that of TDs at election time, whatever about any other time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that the only people arguing against this amendment are the TDs themselves. It is a classic case of asking turkeys to vote for Christmas: why would they support this amendment if they see membership of local authorities as enhancing their work and enhancing their vote? That is their perception, but it is not accurate. It would not be the case if the public were informed on the role and functions of councillors and Oireachtas Members. TDs and councillors are able to communicate with each other and it is not essential to be at the opening of every envelope to know what is happening at local level. It calls for teamwork, the essence of democracy. It may be in the self-interest of some TDs not to support this amendment, but most favour it, including the Minister. If the Minister is concerned about the views of people in general, particularly, the councillors who <Col N="31" /> are most affected by the legislation, I ask him to take stock.</P>
    <P>The disqualification for local authority membership of a person of unsound mind raises a question that has not been answered regarding people who cannot look after their own affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>Given that we are part of the European Union we must note how &ldquo;unsound mind&rdquo; is interpreted elsewhere and I wonder if there would be even fewer in this chamber if that were to be applied in practice. It raises the question of who decides on the matter and whether prospective TDs would have to undergo psychological testing, similar to what the Department of Education offers. Will the Department of the Environment operate a psychological service for adults who wish to enter public life?</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore and I think it is important that we delete paragraphs (m) and (n) and we have tabled an amendment to this effect. The Minister mentioned that these paragraphs deal with the abuse of funds and illegalities. I do not think this is the writing on the wall for the two city and county councillors who, on behalf of the people of Howth and its hinterland, took their grievance to the courts. Will the Minister differentiate between such action and corruption and criminal practices? Will he re-examine his decision on this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Members hold different views on the dual mandate. The Progressive Democrats position relates to the necessity to establish the credibility of local government. I am pleased that the Minister agrees with the thinking behind our suggestion that prohibiting Oireachtas Members from membership of local authorities would help to establish <Col N="32" /> local government in its own right and would in time lead to the strengthening of the system. One of the weaknesses of the system is that reform has been put on the long finger. If local authorities were cut off from the national tier of government and had to depend on their own powers they would exercise their muscle in accelerating the reform programmes that are so necessary to strengthen the system. The fact that they hold a dual mandate dilutes the effectiveness of local authority members in campaigning for the development of their role and the allocation of badly needed finance. All the reports from the municipal authorities, the General Council of County Councils, LAMA and other bodies where councillors meet to discuss their role appeal to central Government to establish the system on a more credible basis. Their appeal has not been responded to.</P>
      <P>It was unfair of the Minister to make the accusation that because I was in Government I should have done what I am suggesting now and that I was personally at fault for not so doing. I thought I explained my position adequately last night. The local elections were postponed in 1991 in the expectation of major reform in line with the Barrington report, which, of course, did not happen. I have been campaigning for many years, both in and out of Government, for reform of local government and one of the obstacles I met was the marked reluctance of other ministries and other parties to support the kind of changes that have been sought by the General Council of County Councils, the Municipal Authorities Association and others who commented publicly on the need for change in the system.</P>
      <P>It was on the initiative of my own party that the Barrington Commission was established to carry out a review and make recommendations which would lead to legislation. This and the earlier Bill resulted from its recommendations, although some of the more important recommendations in its report have not been acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider the question of dual <Col N="33" /> membership to be a crucial issue but the need to make local government more meaningful is. If it would help to have a bar on the dual mandate in achieving that objective, I would support it. While that also appears to be the Minister's opinion I regret that he has not been successful in convincing his colleagues to accept this bar on the dual mandate, given that this would act as a catalyst for change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent made the point that Members of this House are reluctant to give up the opportunity of standing for election to local authorities. It is in their own interests to further their political careers to have greater access to local authorities by being members of them. They are reluctant to put themselves on the chopping block. Will there ever be major developments in this area, given that the people who hold the sway and control legislation are Members of this House and feel that it would affect their standing in the community? That is the dilemma facing the Minister. We require a Minister and Government with great courage to radically reform local government. It is sad that this is not being done today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the characteristics of the local government system is that the Minister has a stranglehold in that local authorities have to refer even the most minor matters to the Department for decision. While the Minister has implied that he is in favour of ending the dual mandate, he has failed to do so. I have stated my position. I suggest that the Minister is on the side of the angels. He has the power to make this decision and we would have to live with it. If he believes that this would improve the local government system and he is a crusading Minister who will devolve powers to local government, he has to make the hard decisions. It comes down to a question of leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have yet to be convinced that this change needs to be made. Because local government is so repressed, perhaps there is a need for the dual mandate to allow us serve our constituents. The Minister has to decide, but in this <Col N="34" /> instance he is saying one thing and doing something else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the comments made by Deputy Molloy. I was not making a personal attack on him when I mentioned that he continued to serve as a member of a local authority while he was Minister; I was replying to a hefty accusation made against me last night.</P>
      <P>To respond to Deputy McManus, although I have devolved powers to local authorities on numerous occasions, I have been asked to meet a local deputation to discuss a decision taken at local level and reverse it. We are not serving local authorities well by pretending that everything is perfect provided one obtains ministerial agreement. The Deputy knows as well as I do that while the public demands services, it is not inclined to pay. It would be far better to say this at local and national level rather than pretend that money is available when there is a limit to what the taxpayer can provide. Although I am no longer involved and have given the local authorities this power, I have been besieged to change decisions made at local level.</P>
      <P>On the question of leadership, I would like to move a stage further. In this Bill we are continuing the process which began in 1991. Whether we like it or not, people hold very strong views on this matter. I have listened to them at my own parliamentary party meetings and in this House. If the Deputy believes that I should ignore these strongly held views, that is not my understanding of leadership.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The North Lee Development Company was established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social <Col N="55" /> Progress</i> as one of the pilot projects for the area based response to long term unemployment. These areas have now been designated under the new local development programme which is a major component of the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999.</i> The North Lee Development Company is one of the areas which will receive funding under the disadvantaged areas element of the programme. So far the discussions with the European Commission have been very positive and I do not anticipate any delays in reaching agreement on the Operational Programme very soon after the Community Support Framework is adopted. The mechanism for channelling European Union funding to the partnership companies is the global grant for local development, with matching funds in the Vote of my Department.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there will be no undue delays in relation to the disbursement of EU funding to partnerships. In addition my Department has assured the partnerships that matching Exchequer funding is being made available to partnerships on the basis of their commitments and cash flow requirements to ensure that there is no loss of momentum pending finalisation of the EU Global Grant.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his assurance but when will funds be made available to the North Lee Development Company? The Taoiseach will appreciate that many job creation projects are up and running and waiting for the funding. It is important that there should be no delay in the provision of funding because this area has been hard hit by unemployment through the years. Now that the projects are being developed and the systems ready will the Taoiseach accept it is essential that the funding be made available without delay?</P>

      <P>I recognise fully what the Deputy said in relation to unemployment in this area and that is the reason it was chosen as a pilot project. My information is that there were problems <Col N="56" /> and delays earlier. The matter concerning money paid to the company for the people it employed rather than for what it wanted to do, has been rectified and there are no problems in this regard. I assure the Deputy there will be no delay in projects because of the lack of funding and the cashflow requirements of that company, pending agreement on the Community Support Framework and the operational programme. My Department is ensuring there will be no delays.</P>

      <P>In his discussions with the Dutch Prime Minister, who is a candidate, has the Taoiseach expressed his concern at the policy of some Dutch local authorities in Amsterdam in relation to the legalisation of certain drugs? Does the Government agree with the policy in Amsterdam or would it prefer another policy to be pursued? What are the implications of that policy if the Prime Minister of the Netherlands becomes President of the European Commission?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dutch Prime Minister visited Ireland he was not in a position to have any discussions in relation to filling the post of President of the European Commission. He was Prime Minister and, as he explained to the media and me, his constitutional position precluded him from commenting. In due course he may become a candidate. The attitude of the Irish Government towards drugs and the whole drugs industry is clear. I will certainly make that position known at the summit in Corfu if the position has been filled by then. At present we do not know the full list of candidates.</P>

      <P>No doubt the Taoiseach will be concerned about the drugs <Col N="58" /> problem and the knock-on effects as far as crime and vandalism are concerned in this and other cities in Ireland.

      <P>Of course we discussed these and other problems and agreed on the need for co-ordination and co-operation between all member states in the Union in the fight against drugs. We are concerned at the level of drugs seized off our coasts. Clearly Ireland was used as a conduit in some shape or form to bring drugs not only into Ireland but to other member states. We both agreed on the need for stepping up action in that area and that all member states should coordinate their action and policies in this regard.</P>

I put it to him that it would be in the interests of Ireland to have an Irish nominee for the presidency of the European Commission and even better if we could succeed in having one appointed. It should be the Taoiseach's function to seek an acceptable nominee and to present that name to his colleagues, the other Heads of State. One obvious name has been mentioned in many international magazines, <i>The Economist,</i>  the <i>Financial Times</i> and so on, that of the former Commissioner, Mr. Peter Sutherland.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of Communicating Europe is to raise the levels of awareness and debate in Ireland on European issues and to address the public's &ldquo;comprehension deficit&rdquo; which it is generally agreed exists in this area. I launched the initiative on 18 February 1994 and I am developing it with the assistance of a task force which is to report by July 1994 with recommendations on ways of addressing the &ldquo;comprehension deficit&rdquo;. In addition to the preparation of its report, the task force is pursuing a range of specific initiatives designed to enhance awareness and understanding of European issues, including measures to increase European awareness in our schools; a series of <Col N="64" /> national and regional conferences on topical European issues; and the preparation of accessible and readable information on European funding.

      <P>The Taoiseach answered the question he was asked by the Deputy. This question relates to a particular subhead. The Deputy will appreciate, as one of the candidates in the forthcoming European elections, that there is a problem in increasing awareness of what is happening in Europe. In a recent survey 65 per cent of the public felt they were not being adequately informed about what was happening there. It is obvious that there is a comprehension deficit. A sum of £100,000 has been allocated for this initiative and the task force will report by the end of July. This work is useful. We are consulting the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Irish Council of the European Movement <Col N="65" /> and the Institute of European Affairs and compiling an inventory. Yesterday the Deputy attended the launch of the NSSB initiative in this area. This problem is being encountered throughout Europe also. Commissioner de Pinheiro visited Ireland recently and met the task force. He said that this initiative could serve as a prototype for other members of the European Union.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State making a distinction between an information deficit and a comprehension deficit and not implying that there is a shortage of paper, rather that there has been a failure to communicate how decisions are made in the European Union? Does he agree, as I suggested earlier to the Taoiseach, that a debate on the appointment of the President of the Commission would be one way of clarifying for the public how the European Union operates? It would also identify the issues people should concern themselves with when making decisions about Europe and the operation of a democratic system would bridge the comprehension deficit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need to address the information deficit and the comprehension deficit. A series of conferences will be held throughout the country and in 1996 an intergovernmental conference will be held to debate major issues. The purpose of this initiative is to ensure that we have a balanced debate, not to impart information. The public will be allowed to participate at every level as provided for in the remit of the task force. The Deputy mentioned that we should have a debate. Since the Government was formed the Committee on Foreign Affairs has been very active. The Government is addressing this matter in the best way possible and, as the Taoiseach said, if there is a need for a debate on the appointment of the President of the Commission he will not be found wanting.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the question of compliance. Does the Minister of State agree that we are in breach of many EU Directives? I tabled a series of questions to each Government Department relating to the issue of compliance with EU Directives, including those for which the date of transposition into Irish law has passed, and the replies make sorry reading. Does the Minister of State agree that the Government should be just as interested in the issue of compliance with EU Directives as in the Communicating Europe initiative?</P>

      <P>The sum of £100,000 will be used in organising conferences etc. The European Parliament organised a seminar recently and we contributed a sum of money to meet the cost involved. In co-operation with the Commission I organised a conference on the White Paper on Unemployment. We have been allocating small sums of money for various initiatives and I will be glad to tell the Deputy where every single penny of this £100,000 was spent. It was well spent. I hope it is recognised that there is a need to do this and the commissioner supports what we are doing.</P>

      <P>I disagree with my colleague Deputy Mitchell in that I do not think any of this money should be used to give a crash course to Government candidates in the forthcoming elections. Could some of this money be made available to non-governmental organisations to hold public hearings on, for example, issues relating to the 1996 review? Has the Minister discovered any difference in the comprehension deficit as between urban areas and provincial Ireland? Will the campaign involve advertising on the public broadcasting media? I did not hear the Minister's reply to the question of the involvement of outside consultants and non-Civil Service personnel. If they are involved, on what terms are they involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Non-governmental organisations will be involved but I will not be in a position to give a full report until I receive a submission from the task force on which there are representatives of the Commission, the Parliament, the Irish Council of the European Movement, the Institute of European Affairs and other experts in this area. The purpose is to involve non-governmental organisations, including bodies such as the Irish Council of the European Movement, a pro-Europe organisation. We will welcome the views of any interested organisation and I have been contacted by many organisations who have been working in this area and are delighted to be involved. The main thrust of this initiative is pro-Europe which reflects the views of the majority of Members including, I presume, those of Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On advertisements, we will be seeking the views of members of the public. If they wish, they can have an input into the work of the task force. There is little that can be done with £100,000. The <Col N="69" /> initiative, which is all-inclusive, simply involves organisations active in this area and mainly pro-European. However, the process will certainly include those who hold a different view.</P>

There is information about the farming community and it will be appreciated that farmers are probably the best informed about Europe. I will make all this information available. However, the detailed report is not available and I am imparting some of the information that has been made available to me. I look forward to publishing the report on time and members of the European Parliament will get the first copies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 8, 12, 33 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The prisoner to whom Deputies Mitchell and Gilmore refer was committed to prison on 27 October, 1993 to serve five years for robbery. With normal remission he would have been due for release on 3 July 1997.</P>
      <P>Shortly after 2.00 p.m. on 13 April, the prisoner was found unconscious in his cell. Medical assistance was immediately summoned and a doctor arrived within minutes. The prisoner was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This case will be fully investigated by the gardaí and an inquest will take place into the death. As the Deputy is aware, under the Coroner's Act, 1962 the coroner is an independent officer specifically appointed to investigate such deaths. He may sit with or without a jury of independent citizens and may summon <Col N="78" /> such witnesses, be they eye witnesses or expert witnesses, as he wishes to enable him or the jury to come to a verdict in the case. It is the function of the inquest to inquire not merely into the causes of death in the medical sense but to investigate all circumstances relating to the death. It is a matter for the coroner's inquest to decide on the cause of death, but the indications are that it was related to a drug overdose.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, very concerned about the tragedy of deaths in the prisons, whether caused by drug overdoses or otherwise, and in implementing the recommendation of the advisory group on prison deaths, I am satisfied that my Department is doing everything practicable to prevent them. The report of the advisory group had to do mainly with the problem of prison suicides and I should, of course, emphasise, for the avoidance of any doubt on the matter, that there is no suggestion that the death referred to by Deputies Mitchell and Gilmore was a suicide. As I have said the inquiry into the causes and the circumstances of the death in this instance will be a matter for the coroner.</P>
    <P>I am aware that despite stringent precautions, drug abuse is taking place in Mountjoy and other prisons. The best way to avoid such drug abuse is to prevent all illegal drugs coming into the prisons. Steps which are being taken to keep drugs out of the prisons include a high level of staff vigilance, closed circuit video surveillance, screening of prisoners after visits and regular searches of the prisons.</P>
    <P>In this Administration we operate a fairly liberal regime for prisoners including free association between prisoners and free and open contact on visits with families and friends. In that situation there is a real risk that some prisoners and visitors will abuse the freedom by passing illegal drugs on visits and that, later, prisoners will abuse free association by passing drugs to one another.</P>
    <P>Where there is a real suspicion that an identifiable prisoner-visitor is passing drugs on visits, personal contact is not permitted and they can only communicate through a special glass barrier. <Col N="79" /> Even then there remains the possibility of the prisoner receiving drugs acquired by another prisoner whose visit is not restricted.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be possible to modify the regime for prisoners in such a way as virtually to eliminate the problem. The revised regime, however, would have to include severe restrictions on free association between prisoners, more frequent searches of cells and prisoners, including strip-searches, the searching of all visitors to prisons, the erection of barriers between prisoners and all visitors to prevent personal contact, even with children, and the introduction of more intrusive technology. While I accept that the drugs problem is a serious one and demands that all reasonable steps should be taken to solve it, I am not satisfied that I would be justified in introducing so restrictive and inhumane a regime which would punish the innocent as well as the guilty and could cause irreparable harm to relationships with families including children. I have, however, asked that the whole matter be kept under continuous review with a view to taking whatever steps are needed, short of the restrictions I mentioned, to contain the problem.</P>
    <P>In view of developments which have occurred in community-based treatment programmes I am reviewing the programmes available for drug dependent prisoners. My Department is, for example, in consultation with various agencies involved in methadone maintenance programmes in the community to see how prison-based treatment might be brought into line with public health practice.</P>
    <P>The optimal setting to deliver a prison-based methadone maintenance programme would be a drug-free wing. Such wings have been developed in the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden. The prison medical director and other senior officials visited drug-free wings in England and a number of prisons in the Netherlands recently to review their method of operation and to see how they might be adopted here. I will explore this issue in more detail when I have received their report <Col N="80" /> and will make a further announcement when my review is completed.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no doubt that substantial numbers of prisoners are already drug-dependent on committal to prison. That drug dependency has its origin in the community and clearly, therefore, an important priority must be to tackle the problem at community level.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the drugs problem remains one of my highest priorities. As far as law enforcement is concerned the Garda authorities renew and update their operational strategies on an ongoing basis. The need for a national drugs strategy has been recognised by the Government. In May 1991 the Minister for Health launched the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse. The intention is to tackle the drug problem on every front. Realistic and achievable objectives have been set for the reduction both in the supply and demand for drugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This bombastic nonsense has gone on for too long. What the Minister said is almost a repeat of what she said in reply to questions I tabled on 25 November when she stated that the matter was under constant review. How many prisoners will have to die from drug overdoses before she takes action to prevent illegal drugs being available in prisons? Yesterday a young man approached me with a problem typical of many others. He sought help for a heroin addiction problem which he acquired in prison. Is the Minister aware that for as long as the illegal drugs problem is not tackled in the prison system we will merely create potential criminals who will resort to crime when they are released to feed the habit they acquire while in prison? What is the outcome of the review the Minister has been undertaking since 25 November last? Why are illegal drugs still freely available in prison? Why has she not taken on board the concerns I frequently expressed here on behalf of parents that their children may develop drug addiction while in prison?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Members agree that there is a certain regime we can put in place in our prisons if we want a drug-free prison system. Perhaps Deputy Mitchell accepts that the various proposals I read out to the House would be acceptable in this jurisdiction, but I do not believe they would. As Minister for Justice, I could not stand over a position where mothers, wives and children, including babies, are strip-searched every time they visit a prison or that prisoners, before and after such visits, are strip-searched by prison staff. It would be grossly unfair to enforce such a regime.</P>
      <P>In Mountjoy Prison they operate video equipment for the purposes of detecting illegal drugs. When a prisoner is passed drugs during a visit it may be detected on the video screen. The quantity of drugs is seized by the prison officer concerned and a different regime is applied to such prisoner for future visits. A barrier is erected and he or she is not allowed physical contact with visitors. That does not mean that other prisoners who have not come under suspicion cannot get illegal drugs, or avail of and abuse free association between prisoners before and after visits to pass drugs. We can introduce the regime Deputy Mitchell appears to suggest &mdash; although he should clarify his suggestion &mdash; but that would not be a humane way to treat prisoners and their visitors, particularly women and children.</P>
      <P>In the meantime every other aspect of drug abuse and the passing of illegal drugs in prison is kept under review. Steps are taken immediately when a problem comes to light. If a prisoner is suspected of receiving illegal drugs the matter is dealt with effectively in the prison system.</P>

      <P>That is the problem with Question Time. A man died in prison and I will not allow that be swept away by anybody. The Minister spoke about the inhumane regime she claims I want, but has she read the report to the advisory committee on communicable diseases in prison? It recommends we should not have an inhumane regime and it lists seven steps to prevent the ease of access to illegal drugs in our prison system. Why was it necessary to tell the House last November and again today that she has the situation under review when she had received the report of a review group in May 1993? What steps has she taken to implement the findings of that committee and when will drugs be removed from our prison system?</P>

      <P>Before I reply to the Deputy's question I wish to make two points. My reply was to four questions tabled by four Deputies dealing with separate aspects of the initial question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has assured the House she is concerned about the problems resulting from the availability of drugs. Is she aware that Interpol has set up a European Liaison Bureau, one of the objectives of which is to coordinate the operations of Interpol in so far as they concern the distribution of illegal drugs throughout Europe? Given <Col N="84" /> the evidence which suggests drugs coming into this country are warehoused through member states of the European Community, would she agree the presence of a liaison officer from our Garda force in Europe, near the centre of distribution, would greatly benefit the Garda and customs officials in tackling the importation of drugs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter involves two issues. On the one hand we are dealing with Interpol where there is no requirement to assign a liaison officer and on the other with the Europol Drugs Unit, recently set up in The Hague, to which a liaison officer has already been appointed. That officer, who holds the rank of sergeant, is based in the Dublin headquarters and operates in the Europol Drugs Unit. It has been suggested the position should be at inspector level. A circular was issued to all inspectors asking them to apply for the position if they were interested. Application have been received and a recommendation will be passed to the Commissioner and an inspector appointed. I have considered a possibility which might be in our best interests despite the assigning of a liaison officer to the Europol Drugs Unit. Legislative change would be necessary. I have asked my officials to consider that matter so that it may be included in the Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to be introduced in the autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would she agree that, rather than waiting for any requirement to assign an officer there, some initiative should be taken by the Government to prevent the drugs trafficking gaining momentum, and to tackle the problem in parts of the inner city where drugs are being sold openly? Yesterday I met tenants from an inner city flats complex who are concerned about the sale of drugs on the street. Would the Minister agree that <Col N="85" /> the presence of a Garda liaison officer in Lyon would help root out the source of those drugs and that action should be taken at that level before they are imported?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be helpful, but priority must be given to the Europol Drugs Unit. That is why I attached importance to the immediate appointment of a liaison officer when the setting up of a Europol Drugs Unit was agreed by the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs. Interpol is a worldwide police organisation. Our biggest problems concern the European Union. I considered it a priority to ensure that whatever needs to be done within the European Union and by my ministerial colleagues in the Council of Europe, should be done and the emphasis should be at that level.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 10 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before giving the number of prosecutions and convictions under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, <Col N="86" /> 1993 and commenting on the operation of the Act, it would be helpful to outline the background to its provisions on prostitution, particularly soliciting.</P>
    <P>Prostitution is not and never has been an offence in itself. The law has sought to protect members of the public from the more intrusive aspects of prostitution, such as soliciting in the street, and to protect prostitutes from exploitation by, for example, pimps living on the earnings of a prostitute.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993 had as its main objective the removal of criminal sanctions from consensual sexual acts between adult men. Clearly, with respect to prostitution, these had to be subject to whatever controls applied to heterosexual prostitution and indeed the 1993 Act provided that every reference in any statute to a prostitute should be taken to include a reference to a male prostitute. That in itself, however, was not enough. One of the main statutory controls on prostitution is the prohibition of soliciting in public and, while there were no fewer than three statutory offences of soliciting, all of them had been inoperable since a Supreme Court decison in 1981 and a subsequent District Court decision in 1983. The choice which faced the Oireachtas, therefore, was to introduce new controls on soliciting in public, covering both the heterosexual and homosexual behaviour, or to abandon any attempt at such control.</P>
    <P>This question was considered by the Law Reform Commission in its report on vagrancy and related offences. The report examined the inadequacy of the law on soliciting in the light of the court cases I have mentioned and recommended a new offence of soliciting in public which would apply to clients as well as prostitutes. The old statutes applied the offence only to prostitutes or, as their terminology put it, &ldquo;common prostitutes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>More recently, the Second Commission on the Status of Women has considered this matter. I paid particular attention to their views as it is clear from reading their report that they examined <Col N="87" /> the plight of prostitutes with great sympathy and understanding. The Commission did not, however, recommend the abolition of the offence of soliciting. Instead, and in line with the Law Reform Commission, they recommended its extension to clients of prostitutes. In the light of this, the Oireachtas chose to include in the 1993 Act an offence of soliciting in public for the purposes of prostitution which applies to everyone, clients and third parties such as pimps, as well as prostitutes.</P>
    <P>On the question of the implementation of the Act, the Garda Commissioner tells me that its provisions are working satisfactorily. While it is a little too early to identify any distinct trends in detections and prosecutions under the Act, perhaps I could give the House a summary of the cases which have so far occurred.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 of the Act, which concerns soliciting in public for the purposes of prostitution, there have been 12 prosecutions and nine convictions, with one case pending. Under section 8 of the Act, which concerns loitering in public for the purposes of prostitution, there have been 18 prosecutions for failing to comply with a Garda direction to leave the area. Of these, there have been two convictions, and the remaining 16 cases are pending.</P>
    <P>On the question of the consequences of conviction, I took careful note during the Oireachtas debates on the 1993 Act of the concern expressed by Members of this House that the penalties for soliciting should not be too onerous. The amendments which I introduced to lower the proposed penalties set the maximum penalty for a first conviction at £250, rising to £500 for a second conviction. Imprisonment is possible only after a third or subsequent conviction, and even then it may not exceed four weeks.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the Act is the increased protection from exploitation it gives to prostitutes. It contains new offences, with tough penalties, for controlling or organising prostitution or forcing a person into prostitution. The penalty for living on the earnings of a prostitute has also been increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> As regards other forms of exploitation of prostitutes, such as acts of violence committed against them, I have read the views of the person referred to in Deputy Deasy's question and I have arranged for her and a colleague to meet senior officials of my Department. I want to know exactly what the problem is and how it may be remedied and I do not want, no more than would anybody in this House who supported the legislation, to produce a situation which would leave women at greater risk of injury. I want to emphasise that the full protection of the criminal law is available to prostitutes. No-one should hold back from reporting an assault to the Garda because he or she is a prostitute. The law is there for the protection of everyone and will be enforced to that end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply. Has she figures to show how many prosecutions have been taken against men who use prostitutes? How many male prostitutes have been prosecuted under legislation? Is there a tendency by the Garda to enforce the legislation more against female than against male prostitutes? I would ask the Minister to address this matter with specific reference to rent boy activities in the Phoenix Park. This is particularly relevants in terms of possible acts of gross indecency between adult men and boys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the 12 prosecutions for soliciting, two have been against male clients of prostitutes. Of the 18 prosecutions for refusing to comply with the direction of a garda to leave an area immediately, two have been against males &mdash; one of these was a male client. On the Phoenix Park, the terms of the Criminal Justice Act are being applied equally in Dublin and in other areas where breaches of the Act come to the notice of the Garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister specifically to address gross acts of indecency involving minors. Has the Minister information that teenage boys are involved in these activities, and, if so, would she agree that more stringent enforcement of the law is necessary leading to prosecutions in this matter? It is important that a message goes out loud and clear that such acts with minors have not been decriminalised. Will the Minister comment on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All breaches of the Act brought to the attention of the Garda or witnessed by gardaí are prosecuted. I am very concerned that word should not go out from this House that we are in some way soft on acts of gross indecency which involve minors. That is the last thing any of us would like to see. I am prepared to raise that specific issue with the Garda Commissioner and if he believes that the law as it stands is not strong enough to deal with the problem I will have no hesitation in bringing in an amendment to the Act.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that investigation of alleged corruption in relation to land rezoning in County Dublin has not yielded evidence which would support the taking of a criminal prosecution. However, I understand that the Garda investigation files remain open and, should additional information become available, it will be fully and properly investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the file in this case remains open, even though there <Col N="90" /> has not been a great deal to report until now. Members of the Garda Síochána share my view that the investigation is unlikely to uncover anything of substance until such time as there is some amnesty or confidentiality for witnesses. Will the Minister put in place a provision to ensure that evidence is forthcoming? Has she spoken to journalists who report cases of developers offering money? I understand that in one case a councillor refused a sum of money as being insufficient for the purpose of voting a certain way on a rezoning proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are talking about is allegation and rumour. I exhort all members of the public, journalists, politicians and others, if they have such evidence, to bring it to the attention of the Garda. The decision whether to institute proceedings against an individual is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent in the carrying out of his duties. I have no function, nor would I support giving the Minister a function, in impeding or influencing the Director of Public Prosecutions in his job. The essential element in instituting proceedings or prosecutions in any case is evidence, and evidence is not available in this case. Only one person has been successfully prosecuted. Once again I exhort anybody who has information to bring it immediately to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister is distinguishing between allegation and evidence. Is she anxious to further this investigation through the means I mentioned or through the Director of Public Prosecutions? Would she agree there should be a redoubling of effort in this area? It is extremely frustrating for members of the public who see huge prices being paid for large areas of land, simply on the basis of a vote. The temptation in this regard is enormous. Perhaps the Minister for the Environment should be involved in this matter. Will the Minister consider options to clear the logjam on bringing forward evidence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Every possible <Col N="91" /> lead that has come to the Garda has been pursued actively and the file remains open. When the first complaints were made in 1989 one of my colleagues who was then Minister for the Environment initiated the Garda investigation. There is no slowness on my part to ensure that every facility is made available so that all evidence that comes to the Garda is vigorously pursued.</P>

Would the Minister agree in the public interest, and in the interest of defending public officials, whether elected or unelected, that the forthcoming ethics Bill should incorporate provisions requiring declarations in given circumstances where there is a potential conflict of interest or potential for corruption and will she recommend to her relevant Cabinet colleague that consideration be given to incorporating those provisions in the Bill?</P>

Stringent regulations will be laid down in that legislation for members of the Oireachtas, members of Government, senior public servants, chief executives of State companies and so on, and that is to be welcomed. I am interested in ensuring that the high level of integrity of public officials and elected politicians is maintained and that the public have confidence in them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they received complaints concerning the activities of the Women's Information Network, Galway. Because the complaints were of a kind which left open the possibility that a criminal offence or offences were involved, the Garda judged it their duty to investigate the complaints. The complaints were then fully investigated and a file has been fowarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for directions. These directions are awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister for Equality and Law Reform stated that people have a right to information and to the provision of information on abortion, would the Minister clarify under what law this service is being investigated and why a report has gone to the DPP? If the service is illegal, what law has been breached or what question mark lies over it with regard to the information it is providing which, according to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform is guaranteed under the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, complaints were received by the Garda alleging that directive counselling was being given by the Women's Information Network in Galway. The Garda has a duty to investigate those complaints. It has investigated them, a file has been prepared and has been sent to the DPP and it will be a matter for the DPP to give directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McManus is correct when she says &mdash; and this is something I explained to the group when I met its members in Galway &mdash; that the amendment passed by the Irish people enshrined in the Constitution <Col N="93" /> the right to receive and to impart information subject to various conditions that were to be laid down by law. This law is in the course of preparation within the Department of Health. The Government's view at that time, and it remains the Government's view, is that non directive counselling is clearly covered by the right to obtain or make available information which was provided for in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The service provided is not directive counselling, it includes the provision of telephone numbers. The nub of the question is whether that constitutes or is likely to constitute directive counselling and that is what must be clarified here. I presume the Minister is aware that the service being provided by these people has been impeded and interfered with since last Novmber. Is the Minister saying that if telephone numbers are provided, that constitutes directive counselling and if that is the case what are the grounds for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I am saying because as Minister for Justice, as Deputy McManus is well aware, I have no function in interpreting the law. That has to be interpreted based on the file sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and it will be a matter for him to decide whether a breach of the law has occurred in this case.</P>
      <P>The Bill dealing with this matter is in the course of preparation by the Department of Health. It will clear up any doubts about the position following the acceptance of the amendments by the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has touched on a valid point. In a climate of uncertainty allegations of directive counselling will prosper. There is a great deal of confusion among the public and general practitoners and will the Minister agree that the legislation is needed urgently to regulate the provision of information on abortion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did the Minister clarify with the group in Galway that it was providing a non-judgmental, <Col N="94" /> noncoercive and non-directive service, which is what I understood it to be providing from my contacts with the group? Would the Minister agree that essentially counselling can only be non-directive, that it is anathema to the concept of counselling that it be coercive in any way? Would the Minister agree also that this matter is urgent because we are in clear breach of Article 10 of the Convention on Human Rights as judged by the court in 1992? Would she also agree that the matter needs to be regulated immediately and for everybody to know where the link is between information and referral?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the Irish Family Planning Association is currently giving such information and providing such counselling services with referral to the United Kingdom? If that is illegal, will the Minister explain why the association is not being prevented from providing those services?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of what the Irish Family Planning Association is doing. The only information I have is on the group in my city. When members of the group came to see me I also understood that they were involved in non-directive counselling. All the information they gave me suggested strongly that they were engaged in activity in accordance with what the Minister for Justice indicated would be the position following the acceptance of the amendment. The legislation to put the result of the amendment on a statutory footing is close to completion within the Department of Health and will clear up a number of doubts. In the meantime, however, once complaints are made to the Garda, it has no choice but to investigate them and prepare a file for the DPP which is what has been done in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that while we are awaiting this legislation, any GP or anyone who provides information is open to Garda investigation? That is a serious matter. Surely the Minister accepts that this right does not come <Col N="95" /> with the legislation and it would be an infringement of people's rights if every time general practitioners, for example, provided a telephone number or non-directive counselling, they would be leaving themselves open to Garda investigation?</P>

On the specific complaints made to the Garda &mdash; and I do not know what those complaints were or who they came from &mdash; the Garda pursued a line of inquiry, it has completed its inquiries and prepared a file which has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is now a matter for him to decide whether the law has been broken.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 13:</P>
    <P>In page 13, subsection (4), line 42, after &ldquo;vacancy.&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The person to fill the casual vacancy shall be a member of the party of the previous office holder. In the case of the previous office holder being an independent candidate the vacancy shall be filled by the person with the highest number of votes in the electoral area of the previous office holder.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Deputies have contributed extensively to the debate and I hope that will continue. As regards the matter under discussion, a number of solutions have been put forward. We have Deputy Barrett's amendment and Deputy Molloy's suggestion that there be a by-election. The customary position is that, where there is agreement between all parties, the vacated seat is filled by the party who originally won the seat in the election. I indicated I would consider the matter but I have not arrived at a satisfactory solution. One problem arises where a candidate changes from one party to another. I am dealing with electoral law in the electoral Bill which will be brought forward soon. It is ready to go before the Government and will be enacted later this year. I intend to have a serious look at the electoral code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of sense in the proposal but it is not possible to accommodate it here in the available timescale. It has <Col N="132" /> wide implications for other aspects of the Bill. The matter needs to be teased out further. I will undertake a general review of the electoral code not only in relation to local elections but parliamentary elections as far as by-elections are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I hoped the Minister would say he would do something on Report Stage. We have a ready made alternative in that the Euro elections are a model for the filling of a vacancy. In the European context there is a separate list but it would cause confusion if it were used in a local election. I understand there may be difficulties. If we agree with the general principle of filling a vacancy occasioned by the death or resignation of a local authority member, it should not be beyond our capabilities to find the correct wording. If the Minister is giving a commitment, I will accept his word. Perhaps he might deal with it in the Seanad and bring the Bill back to this House. It would be better to do something in this legislation rather than in the proposed electoral Bill because this legislation will bring forward somewhat the reform of local government.</P>
      <P>I do not want to push an amendment that will be defeated and forgotten about. I would prefer if it were on the record that the Minister accepts the principle and that the matter will be dealt with in a positive way in the electoral Bill. I would prefer if the Minister gave an undertaking to deal with the matter between now and Report Stage or during the debate in the Seanad. Any amendment agreed by the Seanad could be agreed by this House in a matter of minutes.</P>

      <P>This has proved to be a more stubborn problem than originally thought. I have no difficulty in accepting the general principle of the Deputy's amendment but one would want to be sure of the solutions before one went all the way down that road. I cannot go any further at this stage. The matter is too complicated to solve in the time available here. I will examine the matter in the context of the electoral Bill and consider <Col N="133" /> the implications for Parliamentary elections.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to hear that. The Minister has given a fairly satisfactory response to the points we have made about filling vacancies. I hope the electoral Bill will extend voting rights to Irish citizens residing abroad. The Minister must be very embarrassed that South Africa in its first democratic elections has been able to extend voting rights to its citizens in other countries. Approximately 500 South African citizens in Ireland have this right. To their shame, successive Irish Governments have neglected our citizens in other countries. I hope the South African election will jolt the Government out of its complacency and it will finally extend the right to vote to the many Irish citizens living in other countries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand. I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 14, lines 40 and 41, and in page 15, lines 1 and 2, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The term of office of the members of every local authority elected at the elections referred to in subsection (1) shall, in respect of each <Col N="135" /> town mentioned in columns (1) to (3) of the Sixth Schedule, terminate in the year specified in the heading of the relevant column of that Schedule. Elections of members of local authorities shall then be held every five years after the year in which each term of office terminates.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to extend the life of the county councils elected in 1991 by two years to 1998 so that all local authority elections will be held on the same date 1998 onwards. I have put forward an alternative proposal in the belief that there is no necessity to hold all local authority elections on the same date and it might be preferable to hold them on alternative dates. My amendment proposes that the various sub-county authorities, the town authorities, as the Minister prefers to call them, need not necessarily hold their elections on the same date.</P>
    <P>This practice operates in other countries and should prove attractive to parties in Government. If all local authority elections are held on the same date they could become a test of the Government's performance in office, thus introducing a new element into the elections, distracting the electorate from local issues to national issues, introducing a national importance into the local elections instead of focussing on the role of the local authority and its performance in the community. Somebody suggested &mdash; perhaps it was the Minister &mdash; that it would be right and proper to hold all local authority elections on the same date. It sounds like a Civil Service tidying-up arrangement.</P>
    <P>I oppose the postponement of the 1996 county council elections until 1998 merely to facilitate this suggestion. It is undemocratic to suggest that a council elected in good faith by the electorate for a period of five years should have its life extended for another two years by the Government at the stroke of a pen. This displays a certain disdain for the local government system. One cannot help coming to the conclusion that it is considered <Col N="136" /> to be unimportant, things are done by central Government, it is not intended to devolve any meaningful role to local authorities, it is a bit of a nuisance holding elections to these bodies and it would be much handier to hold all the elections on the same date.</P>
    <P>I do not see the logic behind the Minister's proposal, which cannot possibly have anything to do with expense. I do not perceive any great difficulty in holding elections to some local authorities in one year and to others in another year. It would overcome the concept that they must all be held on the one day. That is the real thinking behind my amendment. I will be opposing the extension to 1998 and giving the reason. I am introducing a new element in this amendment, that local authority elections in different areas should not have to be held on the same day. That is the practice in many other places where it works very satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Tacáim ar go leor bealaí leis an méid atá ráite ag an Teachta Molloy. Tá suim faoi leith ag an bpobal sna toghcháin a bheidh ar siúl ar 9 Meitheamh mar gur cuireadh na toghcháin sin siar cheanna féin. Ba i 1985 a bhí na toghchúin deireanacha do na coimisinéirí bhaile agus do na húdaráis eile ar an leibhéal céanna. Tá praiseach á dhéanamh againn arís den scéal ag cur siar na dtoghchán áitiúla arís go dtí 1998. Nuair a thiocfaidh 1998 tá go leor daoine ag rá go gcuirfear siar arís iad go dtí 1999. Níl ach bliain eatarthu agus beidh na comhairleoiri sásta fanacht in oifig agus beidh an Rialtas sásta ligean dóibh.</P>

Tá an dlí ann agus caithfidh gach duine idir Airí agus phobal é a leanúint. Dá mbeadh deis ag an Aire na toghcháin Eorpacha a chur siar bheadh siad curtha siar, ach ní féidir. Measaim go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach ó thaobh an chreidiúnais atá i measc an phobail maidir le cúrsaí polaitíochta de ligean do na toghcháin dul ar aghaidh i 1996 mar atá leaghtha síos sna tréimhsí cúig bliana atá ann agus gan a bheith ag <Col N="137" /> cur isteach air sin, mar ní chabhraíonn sé leis an íomhá i measc an phobail ó thaobh cúrsaí polaitíochta de.</P>

      <P>By opposing section 21, which provides for the holding of elections to all local authorities in 1998, Deputy Molloy would negative his amendment to provide for a new rota system for town elections because the latter relate to section 21. He may wish to withdraw that amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There appear to be all sorts of conflicting views as to when the next elections to all local authorities should be held. None of the amendments is acceptable. Deputy Molloy wants local elections to be held in four out of every five years and at county level in 1996, by virtue of the proposed deletion of section 21, and town elections divided between 1998, 1999 and 2000.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that there are different systems in other countries. I am not sure they have any advantage over ours. I could foresee some disadvantages. Although Deputy Molloy would appear to think there would be no diseconomies or overheads involved in holding elections more frequently, even if their overall number is not increased, I would have my doubts. For instance, there would be more frequent chopping and changing within and between other bodies to which local authorities make appointments such as health boards, harbour boards, vocational education committees, regional authorities and local authority associations, to name but a few. I could not contemplate such change without widespread prior consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Holding different local authority elections in different years probably would reduce the overall national focus on them <Col N="138" /> and would not be conducive to enhancing their status or general public awareness of local authorities. Deputy Molloy's amendment would also put back the next elections to some town commissions for six years. I am not sure there is any demand for that type of change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent wants elections to all local authorities to be held in 1996. This conflicts with his amendment No. 24 which proposes to repeal the relevant section. This proposal is unacceptable because it would mean that, in order to bring town authorities back into line with the general cycle, members elected next June would have a term of two years only. I explained last evening why I considered that undesirable.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to satisfy everybody in this case. I am proposing an amendent to drop the power to postpone local elections by order, the best way of resolving problems of this kind, so that we can hold elections every five years from 1998 onwards. I am satisfied that the provision of the Bill that elections to all local authorities will be held in 1998 constitutes the best balance of all the relevant factors. I will be adhering to this provision. The various amendments to sections 15 and 21 and the consequential amendments to sections 15, 16 and 17 proposed by Deputy Sargent accordingly are rejected.</P>

      <P>The Minister appears to think I was referring to the Government when I mentioned the number of amendments calling for the election year to be 1996, not 1998. I presume the Minister can enlist collective Government support in rejecting this amendment.

      <P>Deputy Molloy expressed the desirability of holding local elections at different times in certain areas over five or six years. I merely said I felt there was no public pressure or support for that type of change from the current practice of holding all local elections in tandem. I am anxious to preserve that practice and to be fair to those candidates who go forward on this occasion for election in all urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the Minister correctly. There was no public pressure to extend the term of those local authorities elected in 1985 from 1990 to 1991, from 1991 to 1992, from 1992 to 1993 or from 1993 to 1994, which is what has been done. I do not understand how the Minister feels there must be public pressure to justify something being done. All sorts of actions are being taken in regard to local government about which the public are not consulted at all. What I am objecting to is the notion that local authorities elected in 1991, whose term would expire in 1996, will have that term extended to 1998 without any public pressure. If that is the type of base line the Minister uses when determining whether to introduce legislation, there is no justification whatever for his proposal to extend them to 1998. It is a retrograde step and all the comments I heard outside were critical of the Government's decision. There is no regard for the democratic decision of the people when they were asked to make a choice for five <Col N="140" /> years. Their views were ignored, central Government treated local government as a play thing and felt it could postpone local elections indefinitely.</P>
      <P>The Government, with its majority can introduce legislation to make these things happen but it is not doing the local government system any favours. Instead it is undermining the people's faith and trust in that system. That has to be the constant theme of my party's contributions to this debate. We want the Government to accept that local government is important and that the people want it to play a meaningful role in society, which it has been continuously denied by the actions of Government parties. We have a classical example here in that the Minister is proposing that elections be postponed not for one year but for two years on the spurious argument that all the elections should be held on the same date. Who laid down the edict that it was necessary to have all the elections on the same date? There is no statutory requirement that they must be held on the same date, it has just been the practice.</P>
      <P>If we are trying to improve, reorganise and reform the local government system with the intention of strengthening it, we are going about it in the wrong way. I am critical of the Minister's move in this regard as it is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument the Minister is using for the holding of elections on the same date is a spurious one. There is no constitutional obligation on him to do so and there is no bar on his accepting an amendment of this kind. My amendment, which proposes dividing up councils and having elections on different dates is an indication of how it can be done. It can be changed; elections do not have to be held every three years. Alternatively, the matter can be left alone if the Minister tells the House that he is prepared to drop the extension of the term of office of county councils from 1996 to 1998. I will withdraw this amendment if the new town authorities which commence in 1994 will serve a five year term followed by elections. Those elections do not have <Col N="141" /> to coincide with elections to county councils.</P>
    <P>It is undemocratic of the Minister to think that because of the Government's majority it can deny other parties the right to contest and increase their strength in local elections. The Minister is seeking to cement his numbers in local authorities by denying people their right, under current legislation, to pass a judgment on these councillors after their five year period in office in 1996. In effect it is an interference with democracy, the jackboot is being used by parties who have a large majority in this House. It is an abuse of Government power and it has to be exposed. The Minister can put forward the spurious argument that all elections should be held on the same date. There is no public pressure for not holding them on the same date. Those who are aware of what the Minister is doing are not happy.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party lost seats in the last local elections and, perhaps, they fear that should an election be held in 1996 they would lose even more of their strength. In order to avoid that the Minister is proposing the postponement of those elections. The Minister is aware that our party contested the local elections for the first time in 1991 with a certain degree of success. Obviously, the Progressive Democrats look forward to contesting the next county council elections with the objective of increasing its membership. It will not have a chance to do that because Fianna Fáil, in cahoots with Labour, will deny the people the opportunity to vote in 1996 and in 1997. This is a disgrace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the suggestion that local elections should be brought in line with the European elections. It is time the public was asked to concentrate on local government issues separate from European issues. In an attempt to build up that second tier of Government, in terms of a proper local government system with proper powers devolved to it, it is right that people should be asked on a particular day to give their opinion as to who is best to <Col N="142" /> serve them at local level. For that reason I do not accept the argument that local elections should be held in conjunction with the European elections as the issues would not be debated properly. It is demoting local government to a position it does not deserve and it takes away from the seriousness of the European elections. Nobody appreciates democracy until they are without it.</P>
      <P>People in other parts of the world fought long and hard for democracy. Irish people should be permitted to express their views through the ballot box on local government, national government and European affairs. For convenience sake we should not have too many elections on the same day; that is not the purpose of the exercise. If that happens the real issues are not debated. One election would be placed against the other with the result that one would have to take second place. For that reason I do not accept the argument that local elections should be held on the same day as the European elections.</P>

      <P>I agree 100 per cent with Deputy Barrett on that issue. It is unfortunate that on this occasion the local elections which were deferred in 1991 are coinciding with the European elections. I would hope that that would not be repeated in the future. Deputy Molloy's references ring hollow considering that he was in Government in 1991 when the local elections were deferred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in the Government of 1991 when the local elections were deferred indefinitely. What is happening now is immensely different from those decisions which Deputy Molloy was a party to. I am happy to terminate that power and have introduced an amendment to delete section 25 in order to remove the power to defer local elections. I have indicated that I am anxious to hold all local elections on the same day as this will give them national significance and encourage greater public participation. <Col N="143" /> I am trying to consolidate matters and in the circumstances I propose that candidates standing for election to urban authorities should serve a two year term of office.</P>
      <P>We can change over time but Deputy Molloy knows that his attitude to the liquidation of urban authorities is different from mine. We have tried to find the best possible balance. It is not ideal to defer elections but it is a good thing to hold local elections on the same day, if possible. We will achieve that in 1998 and the candidates who present themselves will have a reasonable mandate in the forthcoming June elections. Earlier we considered how difficult it is to persuade people to stand for public office. It is a difficult arena that is becoming even more difficult and it would be almost impossible if those who are putting themselves forward were asked to seek re-election in two years' time.</P>
      <P>There is no ulterior motive to deprive people of the franchise. In fact, I have extended the franchise, in a way no previous Minister ever did by extending the boundaries in towns. Other provisions in the Bill demonstrates I am anxious that people participate. I am taking the ultimate step in ensuring that the matter will be rectified by deleting a provision that gives the Minister of the day power to defer local elections. In its letter, the General Council of County Councils intimated that the elections be held in 1999. I want to remove the possibility of that happening and to be certain that local elections will not again be held in tandem with Euro elections. Each local election will have its own special significance and there is no question of deferring them further.</P>

Last night I went out of my way to describe clearly what happened in 1991. The Progressive Democrats Party <Col N="144" /> were a minor partner in that Government but the Barrington Committee was established at our urging as part of the Programme for Government. Even though our partners were reluctant to reform local government the commitment had to be fulfilled as part of the Programme for Government. The Barrington report states on page 54:</P>
      <P>(d) At the sub-county level, the Committee have put two possible options forward for consideration &mdash; either a directly elected district tier of authorities or the formal establishment of district committees of the county council; under both options the existing sub-county authorities would cease to exist and be replaced by new arrangements. The logic of this situation, is that if either option is to be pursued, local elections should not be held in June to the existing sub-county authorities. These should be continued in existence until such time as the necessary reorganisation legislation has been prepared and enacted.</P>
      <P>On the basis that the Government intended to bring forward major legislation on the sub-county authorities it was agreed to postpone elections but not for the county and county boroughs, which did in fact, take place. Unfortunately, the reason given for postponing urban elections was never fulfilled because the reorganisation legislation was not brought forward in a form that resembled the overall proposal from the Barrington Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is of minor significance as it merely extends the boundaries of some towns while completely ignoring the main thrust of the Barrington report that local government at sub-county level be extended to the whole population, not just to the 15 per cent who live in towns. The Minister should recognise the legitimacy of the argument and the expectation that major reform would take place, although it was never fulfilled, possibly because the Progressive Democrats Party did not remain in Government and the reluctant partners did not introduce a Bill. This partnership Government <Col N="145" /> laboured and produced what they call a major reforming Bill but, by any stretch of the imagination, it could not be deemed that. The Minister has held office since 1992 and I do not see his point in arguing about previous extensions. We are trying to introduce legislation that will lay down statutory requirements for the future. It is wrong and anti-democratic to seek to deny the people the opportunity to vote in county and county borough elections in 1996 as is their entitlement under the law which the Minister proposes to change. It cannot be justified on any grounds and the Minister has not justified it in his explanations to the House. He has not referred to the principle of the point I am making. I have shown that it would be possible to hold elections on different dates and there is no necessity to hold them all on the same date but he has not attempted to answer this point. The Minister appears determined to hold all local elections on the same day but that is an excuse to extend the mandate of existing councillors for two years, which is wrong.</P>

      <P>The Minister argued that only two years will elapse before commissioners and urban district councillors seek re-election to office. The point seems to have been lost that the cause is the postponement of local elections. Two wrongs do not make a right. We have already gone through the mill of procrastination and deferral. The results are to be seen in towns fortunate to have town representatives. In Balbriggan, some members of the urban council have died, others have resigned and it is good to rejuvenate urban district councils and town commissions to bring them into line with the year 1996 as proposed in the amendment. That would give us two years to rejuvenate the town commissioners by giving them sufficient powers. We also need to allow other towns to elect councils. For instance, Skerries, which is of similar size, Malahide and Swords, which have populations of 25,000 or more, are bemused that Balbriggan, which has a population <Col N="146" /> of 8,000, has town commissioners. That does not make sense.</P>

      <P>When the Government of which Deputy Molloy was a member fell it was replaced by a Government of a different complexion. The Deputy realises that dialogue takes place. I am not anxious to defend the decision to postpone the elections. I was merely highlighting the fact that the Deputy was a member of the Government which made the decision. Nine years is too long and the signs are visible. It takes a considerable period to prepare local government reforms and it is well known that their preparation was interrupted.</P>
      <P>We are back on an even keel and all local elections will be held simultaneously in the future. They will not be held in tandem with national or European elections. The power of the Minister to defer the elections is being terminated. Deputies should try to be more generous and understand the problems which led to the deferment of the elections. I would not like to see this repeated.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy's amendment relates to boundary alterations generally on an ongoing basis for all local authorities. Section 18, which this amendment seeks to amend, is a once-off power to allow alterations for the purpose of the June elections arising from the boundary review carried out by county managers following consultations with the authorities concerned. Alterations made under section 18 must relate to the maps submitted by the managers which have been agreed locally. Section 18 is not an ongoing mechanism for boundary alteration but a once-off power. An amendment of this nature to deal with an ongoing position as regards boundaries is inappropriate for inclusion in this section.</P>
      <P>The Local Government Act, 1991 contains provisions on the lines sought by this amendment, boundary proposals developed locally and referral to an independent review committee whose report must be published. The relevant provisions of Part V of that Act have not been implemented pending decision as to future sub-county structures. Once future arrangements affecting town local government are settled following the report by the reorganisation commission, under Part X of this Bill it is proposed to implement the boundary provisions of the 1991 Act. As this will meet the requirement sought by Deputy Molloy's amendment, I ask him to withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes the setting up of a boundary authority, following the publication of each census, to decide on the total number of members of every local authority. I am not prepared to accept such an amendment as there is not a real case for setting up such a elaborate mechanism.</P>
      <P>While at first glance there might seem to be arguments in favour of the establishment of greater uniformity of numbers between authorities, this does not stand up to scrutiny. Each authority operates within its own administrative area and, so long as the council has sufficient members to carry out its functions effetively, there is no real reason there should be concern about whether it is treated more or less generously, from the point of view of representation, than its neighbours.</P>
      <P>An attempt to base the number of members of a council on a national average population or some variation of such national average would result in unrealistic extremes of representation. Either some authorities would show a significant loss of representation or others would show inordinate increases to unmanageable sizes. To be able to function each council must have a certain minimum number and if membership goes above a particular level the council will become unwieldy and inefficient; all were agreed on the problems associated with the large size of the former Dublin County Council. Insistence on equality of representation across local authorities is not necessary, desirable or realistic. It might also be noted that there is not a constitutional or statutory requirement regarding equality in the councillor-population ratio as between local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, statutory provision for the revision of electoral areas within local authorities. This can be used to ensure reasonable equality of representation between the electoral areas of the one authority. The law in this regard will be consolidated and is contained in section 26 of the Bill. Any such revision will involve a report by a statutory <Col N="153" /> boundary committee under Part V of the Local Government Act, 1991.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment. The provision here is a technical one which requires the application of Part IV of the Local Government Act, 1941 side by side with the other provisions of this section. The 1941 Act allows the Minister, where a local authority has been removed from office, to hold new elections to the authority. If this amendment was accepted it would create confusion. It would be unclear whether members of a local authority removed from office would have to remain out of office until the next ordinary elections which could be four years later, or whether the Minister could order the holding of new elections in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference to the 1941 Act is included simply for clarification purposes. The provisions in Part IV of that Act are not used lightly. Over the past 50 <Col N="154" /> years members of local authorities have been removed from office on only four occasions. I ask Deputy Barrett to accept my assurance as to the technical nature of his proposal and, accordingly, to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot grant the Minister's request simply because this amendment is tied in with later amendments relating to the Minister retaining power to remove members from a local authority for, say, not striking a rate satisfactory to the manager or the Minister. Nobody can abolish this Assembly. This is similar to an argument we debated earlier. Why should central Government have the power to abolish an elected body of people in 1994? This provision dates back to 1941, 53 years ago. We are living in different times. If people are elected to a body by the public they are expected to behave in a responsible fashion and if they do not the public will inform them either directly during their term of office or at the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In time people will realise that local government stands on its own. I fail to understand why the Minister for the Environment approaching the 21st century, should have power to abolish an elected body of people. Similar rules should apply to local government as apply to this Assembly. For that reason there is no need to retain the powers sought by the Minister in section 21 (1) <i>(b).</i> Section 21 (1) <i>(a)</i> clearly states that an election of members of every local authority shall be held in the year 1998 and every fifth year thereafter. The public should be given an opportunity to vote, the elected representatives should be given responsibility to run the local authorities for a five year period and nobody should have the right to abolish them if they do not adhere to certain regulations. For example, three new local authorities, namely Fingal, Dún Loughaire-Rathdown and South County Dublin, were established on 1 January 1994 and the Minister said publicly he would abolish them if they did not impose service charges. That is an undemocratic approach. The elected members of those <Col N="155" /> authorities and others should justify their actions to those who elect them. If they run out of money, cut services and impose taxation they should be answerable to the people, not to the county manager who can complain to the Department of the Environment that they will not agree the rate. The Minister can tell the elected members that if they do not change the estimate he will abolish the authority. In 1994 that is supposed to be democracy. A Minister should not be empowered to remove elected representatives.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s when it was established that the Government had introduced a false set of Estimates in that the moneys voted were insufficient to run the country for the period involved the Clerk of the Dáil did not run to the President complaining that Deputies in Leinster House were not providing enough money in the Estimates for the following year and that it should be abolished. The Minister for Finance can get his colleagues in Government to vote through a budget or Estimates that may be insufficient. The Government can do as it likes. However, big brother may tell a local authority it will abolish it if it does not impose service charges. We are being asked to agree subsection 1 (b) so that the Minister can retain his power to put manners on people or call elections if he decides to abolish an authority because he does not approve of the manner in which it operates. Under that subsection governed by an Act dating back 53 years, he can decide to call an election if he does not agree with the manner in which it operated.</P>
    <P>We should go the whole hog and ensure reform by holding local authority elections every five years and the elected representatives should be answerable to those who elected them. If the Minister is interested in reform &mdash; as he claimed during the past two days &mdash; he should say, with his hand on his heart that it is time to get rid of this poisoned chalice. The local authority should decide on the introduction of service charges, its level of expenditure and justify its existence to <Col N="156" /> the public. He should not retain power to call elections because of a provision in the 1941 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of page 19 of the 1941 Act appears innocent but it uncovers not only a feature of democratic abuse, but an agenda which, unfortunately, will gather momentum. It is evident in problems faced by Fingal and other local authorities in County Dublin, if it is appropriate to refer to those authorities as being in County Dublin. If the Minister is empowered to abolish local authorities because they do not strike a rate of which he approves, how will the problem of local authority funding be resolved? The decision by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1977 to abolish domestic rates is now seen as a big mistake. Many see it as a device the Minister may use to force local authorities to carry out the dirty work while the Government, like Pontius Pilate, will wash its hands and say that the public should not complain as it is the local authorities who are fleecing them. I wonder if there is an understanding between local authorities and the Minister on this matter. I have heard members of local authorities say that if they did not impose service charges the Minister for the Environment would abolish the authorities. That is a wonderful example of passing the buck. I wonder how long it will take the public to see through that formula. Would it not be honest to involve more people in politics by abolishing the dual mandate and securing a greater turnover of members by not postponing elections. People would realise what is involved in running the country compared to a local authority. Perhaps Ministers could make a start by having a smaller car and cutting back on expenses, particularly on the number of trips abroad. Such measures would set an example of frugality in how we spend public money. I hope such measures will be the preferred course rather than the formula agreed between the Minister and the local authorities, where one blames the other for certain measures.</P>

      <P>During the past 50 years 6,000 meetings of local authorities have been held at which they adhered to their responsibilities to pass the estimates and run the services. Of those 6,000 meetings this power was exercised on only four occasions. We should not exaggerate the massive dragon who is making decisions for all local authorities, encroaching on their fields and delivering the ultimate package, the message of abolition. We should put the matter in perspective. That decision is rare. It is difficult to calculate a precise percentage as the number is so minute. That matter is not relevant to this section but I mention it in case I do not have an opportunity later to reply to queries raised.</P>
      <P>Since the abolition of rates local authorities have had to raise more money from own resources &mdash; this year they will raise more than £400 million. There are people in Dublin who blame the Minister for the Environment for the introduction of service charges, but the people of Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Wexford and Kilkenny have had to pay a proportion of the cost of those services for a very long time. It is a pity public representatives sometimes hide behind the Minister, but I do not mind. If that is the way they want to serve in public life, escaping from reality, I cannot help them. The only circumstances in which the general provisions in this area will be applied will be where there is failure on the part of a council to pass an Estimate as submitted by the manager. Any suggestion that this provision will affect councils throughout the country is not true. In 50 years 6,000 Estimates have been passed and there was intervention on only four occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has done is a typical example of using statistics to present a false picture. He did not quote the number of cases that were referred to previous Ministers for the Environment where subsequently local authorities succumbed to the pressure imposed on them. The Minister referred <Col N="158" /> to four occasions where local authorities were put out of business. He is not denying the heavy hand of Government in this matter. He should accept the blame for service charges in Dublin. When I did not support service charges in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown it was suggested that I was all right because I had a seat in the Dáil, but the other members felt under pressure because they were going out of business. It was clear that if charges were not imposed the Minister would exercise the power which I maintain he should not have. As long as he retains that power councils will hide behind him because he is an easy scapegoat. If that power did not exist we would have to justify our existence to the public. We would have to justify whether we could run the local authority without charges or we would have to justify cuts in expenditure.</P>
      <P>I will give an example of what is happening as a result of the Minister having this power. In the course of the estimates debate in Dún Laoghaire, which was very short, I queried expenditure on the running of swimming pools. There are three swimming pools under the control of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council which were built with public money. Two of them are run through voluntary community groups. The local authority provides £15,000 per annum to supplement the running of the pools. The third pool, which is closed on many occasions, in run directly by the local authority and costs the taxpayer £164,000 this year. The manager did not say he had proposals to reduce that amount to £15,000. Instead the estimate was referred to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing that if a manager is unhappy about a matter and reports it to the Minister, the Minister's function should be solely to appoint an efficiency audit group to look at the estimates and report publicly within 14 days so that the public will see what is happening. The elected members could then make their decision. The Minister should not tell them to revoke their decision on a particular rate or that he will put them out of business. The members of the local <Col N="159" /> authority must justify their course of action to the people who elected them.</P>
    <P>A practice used by managers throughout the country relates to what are called &ldquo;sweeteners&rdquo;. For example, the manager of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council provides £75,000 to the five electoral areas, with each area receiving £15,000 of public money to produce ideas and decide on items of expenditure. However, members are reminded that those who do not vote for the estimates will have no say in how the money is spent. We are talking about public money and running local government, but this is an absolute disgrace. I want a stop put to this practice. Elected representatives who are dealing with public money should behave responsibly and if they can save money, they should do so. They make difficult decisions on the imposition of taxation and they should stand over those decisions. They should not go running to the Custom House to blame the Minister, regardless of what party he belongs to. Local authority members should stand on their own feet and question the county manager on every pound of public expenditure. Vast sums of money that could be used for good productive purposes are being wasted simply because of inefficiency.</P>
    <P>I tabled an amendment which proposes that each local authority should produce an annual statement with an audited statement of accounts, and that they appoint commercial auditors to carry out an audit each year. It is the minimum that should be done in the control of public expenditure. That is reforming local government. Once that happens there will be no need to run to the Minister about Estimates and so on and there will be no need for the Minister to have power to scrap locally elected bodies and replace them or perhaps hold new elections.</P>
    <P>There should be a second tier of government that stands on its own feet and is answerable to the people. After five years the public will decide whether members are re-elected. People ask me and other members what we are doing <Col N="160" /> with their money and why we are not doing something about waste and negligence. All of us, including the Ceann Comhairle in his long distinguished career as a public representative, have been asked what is going on. Where is the control? When elected members ask questions and have power to direct paid officials to do their job there will be real democracy and people will be answerable to the electorate.</P>
    <P>The day the Minister gets rid of the power to scrap local authorities, appoint commissioners and hold new elections, there will be a sigh of relief in his Department. That would be in the interests of democracy. The Minister would be doing everybody a great favour if he had the courage to say enough is enough. This power may have been relevant 50 years ago but it is no longer relevant. There should be proper local government, with elected representatives behaving in a responsible fashion and answerable to the people.</P>

      <P>For a couple of minutes I thought I was sitting over there listening to a new Minister to the Environment saying some of the things I have been saying about efficiency and having the best profile and practices so that we can guarantee the taxpayer a good service without excessive costs. With a view to achieving such a service I visited practically all local authorities and will conclude those visits before the end of summer. Included in those visits is the question of discussion on audits and the comparisons between what is happening in one area and another. I have already outlined publicly my annoyance at the variation between, for instance, expenditure on county roads from as little as £200 a mile to almost £2,000 a mile from own resources at local authority level. I have already expressed my opinion on the repeated filling of potholes and urged that structural work must be done, even though it will take longer.</P>

When the dry weather eventually comes the full day will have to <Col N="161" /> be availed of, while there is light and dryness, to continue the work on many of the roads that are in a poor and unacceptable position. Changes at administrative and operational level are essential because the expenditure overall in this area will be approximately £160 million this year. In the past five years £600 million has been spent on the county and regional roads and enormous problems remain despite that large expenditure. Funding will increase over the next six years but it is important that we achieve better results as there are wide disparities between what is happening in one area and another.</P>
    <P>I am delighted this issue has been addressed in an open and frank way without involving the politics of it or trying to pick out individuals. We have tried to contribute to ensuring that we achieve better results from the resources that have been provided. I regret there has been a long tradition among all parties in the House of simply requesting additional resources to solve a particular problem. We must see what can be done within existing resources in terms of finance, personnel and structures, to deal with these problems. That is not to say that our councils have massive resources, they are tight on many fronts and I accept that, but a number of points have been raised by Deputy Barrett in a forthright and honest way and if Members serving on local authorities tried to achieve that balance, we would find better solutions more quickly.</P>
    <P>I mention county roads because there are major problems in many regions and in the cities in relation to these matters. When I visited County Monaghan, I was told that they have only had seven fine days this year to work on our roads. If the weather clears up, which I hope it will, finishing work at 3.30 or 4 p.m. will not be adequate to deal with these problems. I was delighted to hear that in one part of Dublin the operations began at 7 a.m., were deferred during school going hours and resumed again following that, which showed a level of flexibility and understanding of the needs of the public and the pressures of traffic. In <Col N="162" /> Merrion Street last year work was carried out during off peak hours to achieve better results and efficiency. These are matters which must be dealt with at local level.</P>
    <P>I welcome contributions from Deputies which go above the normal political style and which do not involve simply requesting additional funding. That will get us nowehere. I am determined to achieve efficiencies and I will support every measure in terms of better practices, audits and some other measures, which I have already outlined, involving bonus payments from my Department for operations which are skilfully, efficiently and comprehensively carried out and perhaps some consideration for the minus results also where such practices are not being adopted.</P>

      <P>I understand there is quite a divergence between the number of polling stations in different local authority areas. There may have been an oversight in omitting it from this regulation or it may be covered adequately in some other Act. The Minister may be able to clarify that when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 23 gives power to make regulations concerning the conduct of elections. This includes regulations <Col N="163" /> governing the nomination of candidates, deposits by candidates, deaths of candidates, the duties of returning officers, staff of returning officers, the taking of polls and counting of votes, the use, free of charge, of schools and public rooms, arrangements for postal voting, arrangements for special voting, voting by persons in the employment of returning officers, voting by physically ill or physically disabled electors, etc. The list is long and provisions in regard to the number of polling stations should be included if not covered adequately elsewhere.</P>

      <P>In some ways I am surprised that Deputy Molloy is tabling this amendment because he advocates local autonomy and subsidiarity, with which I agree. Primarily this is a matter to be dealt with at local level because of the consultative process and the need to be familiar with the local situation. Differences will arise because of geography, demography and so on and I do not want to become involved in primary legislation on this matter. The Deputy will be aware that under the 1991 Act, there are regulations on which I am working which should help to achieve greater uniformity. I believe that is what Deputy Molloy has in mind. I should not decide matters which are best decided at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the provisons of subsection (1) or of the Electoral Act, 1992, any person who reaches the age of eighteen years before the election date shall, not less than 12 days before an election, be entitled to have their name added to the supplement to the register of electors.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would prove an administrative nightmare, if not an impossibility, for those charged with the preparation of the register of electors for local elections, quite apart from any question of principle involved and there are serious questions to be addressed in this regard.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the person who reaches the age of 18 years before the election date shall be entitled to have his or her name added to the register of electors through the supplement to the register which is provided for by section 15 of the Electoral Act, 1992. The supplement is a mechanism by which electors who were inadvertently omitted from the register may have their names restored during the currency of the register.</P>
      <P>The essential requirement for inclusion the supplement is that the applicant must satisfy the requirement for inclusion in the original register, in other words, for the purpose of the supplement no account can be taken of subsequent occurrences, such as change in address or acquisition of citizenship. The supplement is designed solely to correct mistakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the view were accepted that the person should be able to vote immediately on reaching 18 years the proper <Col N="165" /> course would be to include the person on the register for that year with an indication that voting entitlement would commence from a particular date. This is the practice adopted in a number of countries, including the UK. If they are to have the right to vote they should be put on the register from the start and the right should not be dependent on making a special application.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment would be that a person aged 16½ years would have to be included in a draft register and such voters would be specifically identified as young people. Their precise age and birthday would be published for all to see and could leave them open to all kinds of unsolicited and undesirable requests.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of fairness and the protection of the integrity of the register, procedures identical to those applying to the ordinary register would have to be put in place &mdash; house to house inquiries, proper checking of eligibility, provision for public inspection of a draft list, right of audience at revision courts and, where appropriate, appeal to the Circuit Court. I do not see that this procedure could possibly be followed in the time available. I am not convinced that this approach should be adopted. We should weigh the matter up very carefully before going down that road.</P>
    <P>The supplement is an innovation in the registration process and will face its first practical test at the elections in June. I ask Deputies to encourge constituents to examine the register and if they are omitted they should apply immediately to be eligible to vote at the forthcoming elections. This provision which I made in the Electoral Act, 1992, received all party support. We are all aware of cases where people were left off the register and it was decided to have a supplementary register. We should ensure it works well and consider whether further changes should be made in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone omitted from the register &mdash; except an 18 year old &mdash; can exercise the right to be included on the supplementary register up to 12 days before the election. However, the determining <Col N="166" /> date for an 18 year old is the date the register comes into operation. If an election were held in November or December an 18 year old person's name would not be included and they would be denied access to the new facility of the supplementary register.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned it could be done in a more administratively efficient way as is the case in the UK. I wanted to debate the principle and ascertain the Minister's reaction to it. It is fair that people who reach the age of 18 by the date of the election should have the right to be included on the supplementary list.</P>

      <P>In areas such as the Sligo Borough Council which have been expanded to a certain extent, will there be new registers or will the people operate on an amalgam of the old registers which were designed for the borough council and county council areas? The Sligo Borough Council may be unique as far as wards are concerned. I do not know if other areas have wards. If so, will they be retained? The fact that more people have been put into one ward rather than another has accentuated the discrepancies that existed as regards the number of people each councillor represents. I am sure it is desired to have uniformity in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Areas such as Drogheda, Dundalk and Bray have wards. The change in population over the years would necessitate change but the number of seats would remain the same. Sligo is one of the unique places where I understand the extensions agreed were in proportion to the existing wards and did not add sufficient population to knock the existing ward system out of kilter beyond taking the broader population into the ward to which it was closest. The register for that area will be a single register of voters. For Sligo, the boundary divisions are just a minor extension outwards to take in the new population with no change in the line from the old boundary inwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not respond to my point. Does he see any validity in the argument that a person who is 18 years of age at the time of election is precluded from voting because he is excluded from the register and does not have access to the new facility of the supplementary register?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for the first time I lose, even though I am doing the right things. In 1992 I provided that those omitted from registers could be included on a supplementary register provided they registered within 12 days of polling day.</P>
      <P>I have some sympathy with Deputy Molloy's proposal to extend the range of facilities, but further detailed consideration would have to be given to the way in which this proposal is implemented. He referred to the position of a person who reaches the age of 18 in April, where a subsequent election does not take place until November. Work on the register normally begins in September and is completed by the end of the year, with some court revisions in February. I am not sure about the numbers but if Deputy Molloy's proposal could be tidied away in that context it would be a better way to achieve the result he seeks.</P>
      <P>This is a very complicated matter and it could be taken into consideration in future electoral law, the proper place to deal with such matters. I agree that we should continue the process of allowing a franchise to those groups in so far as that is humanly and administratively possible. However, it is not possible to do so in this context. I should like to see how the new system works before considering any future extensions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 23, subsection (1) (a), line 6, to delete &ldquo;or urban district&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that urban district council areas should be maintained as one electoral area and the Minister should not have the power to divide them up. Urban district councils have nine members and under this section as worded the Minister will have power to divide the nine seat electoral area into smaller parts. I am opposed to that and would like to hear the Minister's views on my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>All urban district councils have nine members. It is envisaged that a number of town commissioners or urban district councils will be enhanced over the next few years &mdash; at least six authorities come to mind where the membership <Col N="169" /> will be increased from nine to 12. There are differing views about wards. I have no intention of enshrining in legislation any provision under which the ward system could be introduced in nine member urban district council areas. There are differing views about the introduction of the ward system in larger areas &mdash; Deputy Nealon might want to refer to Sligo. Although I had an inclination to abolish the ward system, the strongly held views and traditions in some areas obviously changed my mind.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that other factors have to be taken into account in larger urban areas, for example, the number of candidates in a 12 seat area and the problems associated with that, even down to the count. I should like to hear the views of my colleagues on this point. Power is provided in the Bill to accommodate local authorities which now have nine members but which will clearly have an enhanced new status following the commission's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what section 26 says; it gives the Minister very wide powers to divide these electoral areas in whatever way he wishes. For example, the nine seat urban district councils could be divided into areas with three representatives each. Such a move would not be appropriate in the case of smaller towns which do not have a very large population and it could have implications in terms of the overall results of the elections in these areas.

The boundary commission will take all factors into account and consult with the members of the councils and the community so as to ensure that the new ward system conforms with changes in population and any other developments in the town. If wards are to enhance local authorities they must reflect the changes which have taken place. This process will begin towards the end of this year or early next year. There is no urgency about it but the commission will undertake the work on an independent basis.</P>

      <P>I cannot see anything in the section which provides that the Minister shall only exercise this power to implement the recommendations of a boundary commission. The position of Sligo Borough Council does not arise in the context of my amendment which proposes to exclude the urban district councils from the terms of this section. I accept that in the case of county boroughs or borough councils it would be necessary and suitable to have wards or different electoral divisions where the number <Col N="171" /> being elected would be more than nine, it might well be as many as 12 or 15. My amendment seeks to exclude urban district councils which are electing nine members. Under this section the Minister is taking power to divide that electoral area into lesser parts and to determine the number of people to be elected. Can the Minister show me where he is constrained only to implement the recommendations of the Boundaries Commission, not referred to in this section, which gives him wide powers in this matter?</P>

      <P>I was extremely anxious to ascertain whether I could do so, particularly in the case of those towns that have attained eligibility for borough status. I was unable to do so and the matter will fall to the remit of the Boundaries Commission. Taking everything into account and the new town councils to be established, especially in larger urban areas, that is the best way to proceed. there will be new councils with 12 members. Unfortunately it is not possible to deal with that before the forthcoming election.</P>

      <P>If accepted this amendment would delete <i>inter alia</i> the words &ldquo;by order&rdquo;. The effect would be that any alteration to local electoral areas would no longer have to be effected by order but could be done by simple letter of the Minister. These are orders required to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by virtue of section 3 of the Bill and, by omitting the term &ldquo;by order&rdquo; this would no longer be necessary.

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not include the substitution for what I had deleted, which was to consult with the local authorities affected by a proposed amendment or modification, which picks up a theme expressed on Committee Stage. Whereas the Minister appears to be freed from any accusation of power-broking by the use of the phrase &ldquo;by order&rdquo;, he does not appear to be equally concerned to consult local authorities in regard to the changes he is implementing. Am I to understand that the phrase &ldquo;by order&rdquo; is a catch phrase for all sorts of consultation? Certainly it does not give that impression if my understanding of the phrase is correct. For example, could it be interpreted that some more consultative, democratic process could be put in place rather than simply coming in here, as is often the case, with a proposal already decided, a <i>fait accompli</i> approved by the Government, programme managers and others outside the House? Can the Minister suggest what I should write there to ensure the fullest consultation?</P>

      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Sargent doubting not my judgment but my good faith in all this. As he is aware, I have not been involved in boundary changes. It has been a matter left absolutely to local discussion and consultation between the respective urban and county authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> Apart from the technical problems associated with this amendment, these orders are subject and without prejudice to Part V of the Local Government Act, 1991 which empowers the Minister to provide for the independent commission which is obliged to consult with local authorities. Any orders I then put in place will be on foot of the commission's independent report to me, having consulted local authorities. For Deputy Sargent to suggest that that involves me in some way in bringing an order into this House, with Government support and with the backing of programme managers and others, is stretching the issue to a point which in his own interest he should not attempt to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister recognise what is actually happening? Proposals are brought into this House under the guise of taking everybody's views on board whereas, in practice, such proposals will already have been worked out. As the Minister himself said, much work will have gone into their preparation. The impression one gleans from reading such a simple phrase as &ldquo;by order&rdquo; is that it is just that, by order, sounding almost military in connotation. I want the Minister to ensure that people do not misread his intention. He almost sounds personally wounded by my doubt about his approach. If he is, as he ought be, very concerned with all of the detailed provisions of this Bill, he should be equally conscientious about specifying the consultative democratic process under which we would all wish to see such decisions taken.</P>

My amendment is not as tidy as I would wish as I do not intend that it should apply to the chairpersons of county councils. The terms chairman and vice-chairman are satisfactory for county councils. We did not have sufficient time to prepare these amendments and those of us who were busy elsewhere had even less time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The titles of méara and leas-mhéara are more suitable for chairpersons of these authorities than the Minister's proposal that they be known as cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach. I do not know where the tradition of the title &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; originated but it is widely accepted as the title for the chairperson of local authorities in towns. In that scenario, the most appropriate titles which would be widely recognised would be méara and leas-mhéara, which can easily be translated to mayor and deputy mayor. In many cases the title of &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; has been established and respected. I have met mayors from different towns from different countries in Europe and also from many other Continents. It appears to be the most widely accepted title for the <Col N="175" /> chairperson of a town council worldwide. While I am anxious that the title would be in Irish a more suitable title would be méara, rather than cathaoirleach which, to my recollection, has been applied officially only in the case of one local authority, the former Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.</P>

      <P>We have a former member of that council in the House who may have something to say on that matter. I do not wish to delay the House unduly on this amendment. It may appear to be a small matter but it could do much for the status of local authorities to associate them with leaders in towns throughout the world. The title &ldquo;méara&rdquo; has more of an international reputation than our own strictly Irish translation of chairman into cathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to assign titles such as méara agus leas-mhéara' and ard mhéara or leas-ard mhéara to our local authorities. The present position is that boroughs and county boroughs have mayors or, in two cases, lords mayor, while for all other local authorities the title is chairman, or cathaoirleach in three cases. Generally there is no provision for deputy mayor except in Dublin. There is no legal provision for the post of vice-chairman in the case of UDCs and town commissioners and it is optional in the case of county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides that there will be a post of cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach for every local authority but without prejudice to the continued usage of the existing titles of mayor and lord mayor. Indeed, the primary purpose of the section was to provide consistency for these posts for all local authorities. The term cathaoirleach is used for the Seanad, for many years it applied in Dún Laoghaire Borough and by virtue of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993, it now applies to the three new county <Col N="176" /> councils &mdash; Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the title mayor, or méara as proposed, applies to urban and not to rural areas. It is interesting in this regard that the Barrington report proposed that the title &ldquo;county chairman&rdquo; and not mayor should apply for county councils. The term cathaoirleach is non-sexist, is already in use for local government purposes and can apply to urban and rural authorities. All in all, it seems to be quite appropriate.</P>
    <P>However, I appreciate that there can be a range of differing views on such matters. One of the matters to be looked at by the reorganisation commission under Part X is the future nomenclature to apply to the new system of town classification, titles and corporate status. As the commission is required to consult all the town and county local authorities it can be asked to have another look at the question of the appropriate titles for chairman, chairperson, chair, cathaoirleach, méara, árd mhéara, county chairman.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there are other more exotic titles which applied up to 1840 in various towns: &ldquo;Portreeve&rdquo; in Ardee, Enniscorthy, Navan, Trim and Wicklow; &ldquo;Bailiff&rdquo; in Dundalk; Burgomaster in Portlaoise; Provost in Bandon, Ennis, Monaghan, Tralee; Sovereign in Clonakilty, Dingle, Fethard, Naas, Kinsale, New Ross and Tuam.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I ask Deputy Molloy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the commission can have a more in-depth look at this issue and decide on a variety of titles which may differentiate between the size and status of the towns and cities. I am not saying they will decide to do that but it is one possible decision they could make. Like Deputy Molloy, I have met a number of representatives from European countries and other Continents where the term mayor is widely used. It is a title I would recommend but it is a matter for decision by the reorganisation commission on the basis of the size and status of the towns and ability to perform a different range of functions. If we approach it in that <Col N="177" /> way we can all have an opportunity to contribute towards getting the best result from this proposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy said that he did not consider it a major matter. It may not be a major matter but it is important, psychologically, to get it right. We need more time to do that and the commission should do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything is relative. The issue raised in this amendment is an important one. If we establish the titles cathaoirleach and leas-chathaoirleach in this legislation they will not be changed later. In view of the Minister's comments regarding the international recognition of mayor I ask him to accept these amendments or, at least, to bring forward on Report Stage, or in the Seanad, amendments to comply with the principle proposed and to exclude county councils which may not be catered for in the amendment. I note that Deputy Sargent is proposing a similar amendment in relation to county boroughs. It is worth noting that the Irish title méara can be recognised as mayor by people who are not familiar with the Irish language. For many years there has been a desire on the part of the chairman of these authorities to be known as méara of their town. From my experience in dealing with local government reform down through the years there has always been a warm response to the suggestion that the title of mayor should apply. In France where there are thousands of local authorities, the leader of each town, no matter how small, is appointed as the mayor. The same applies throughout America and many other countries in different Continents. I do not wish to use up too much time on this matter because it means we will not have time to debate other issues but it is an immportant matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain the purpose of this because it has been misunderstood. The existing law on local authority meetings dates back 150 years and is outdated. It differentiates between classes of local authority; it is fragmented, scattered over many enactments, inconsistent, complex and difficult to interpret.</P>
      <P>The 1971 White Paper on local government reorganisation, with which Deputy Molloy is familiar, referred to the unsatisfactory state of the law and stated that regulations should be prepared under the Local Government Act, 1955, to update, and consolidate it. The Barrington committee, which reported in December 1990, also referred to the law on meetings as fragmented and confusing. At the end of 1992 a review group on reserved functions which included representatives of the General Council, AMAI and the county managers reported:</P>
      <P>The law relating to local authority meetings is antiquated, unclear and scattered over many enactments. It should be consolidated, modernised and made available in a more user-friendly format.</P>
      <P>This is the purpose of section 32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government Act, 1955, already provides for regulations covering local authority meetings. However, although the section provides that such regulations would supersede any existing law it does not specify which. This would lead to confusion in regard to new regulations and doubt as to what old law still applied. For that reason regulations were never made under the 1955 Act. The Bill allows for the making of regulations under this section in regard to specified provisions which would cease to apply on the coming into operation of the regulations. <Col N="185" /> The section simply corrects the defects in the regulatory power contained in the 1955 Act.</P>
    <P>What is proposed under section 32 is a single set of regulations containing the law relating to local authority meetings in a modern, convenient and accessible format for the benefit of councillors, officials and the public. I hope, for the first time, to establish in law a right of public access to meetings, to remove anomalies, clarify procedures, increase public awareness and promote greater public interest.</P>
    <P>Deputies can be assured that all the specialist groups and individuals who have looked at this over 30 years have recommended these changes. I am doing no more and no less than getting rid of archaic provisions and providing a simple solution which has been strongly recommended for a long time.</P>
    <P>No law exists which gives the public a right to attend a council meeting and surely it is time we rectified that.</P>

As a member of the public I wished to follow the affairs of my own town, but was thrown out of a council meeting last week because of the provision that the public may not attend in certain instances, a matter that is open to dispute. It seems the Minister will do what he likes. The situation is farcical. This Bill has many provisions that need to be debated and we are told to forget that because not enough time has been provided, despite the willingness of Members of this House to come back later and deal responsibly with the legislation. The Minister talks about councillors being responsible. I am talking about this House being responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the concern about women's health as recently indicated by the high incidence of breast cancer in this country and the many women who have tested positive in the course of the current Anti D screening process, calls on the Minister for Health:</P>
      <P>(1) to immediately set up a nationwide breast cancer screening programme under the GMS for women in the high risk age group in the first instance, and</P>
      <P>(2) to provide the resources necessary for a comprehensive scheme to identify, counsel and treat all women and their families suffering from the hepatitis C virus and antibodies arising from Anti-D immunoglobulin treatment from 1970 to 1994.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Theresa Ahearn and Doyle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is satisfactory and agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion in my name and that of Deputy Ahearn, Chairperson of the Oireachtais Joint Committee on Women's Affairs, was inspired by the section of the Irish Countrywomen's Association that deals with breast cancer screening and by the lack of urgent and appropriate action by the Minister in dealing with the hepatitis C virus. I will outline Fine Gael's reservations on both matters and colleagues will deal in greater detail with them as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time breast cancer has been a source of worry to Irish women and that has been exacerbated by the fact that a seemingly higher proportion of Irish women die of cancer than other Europeans. In 1992, 650 women, of whom 250 were in the 45 to 64 age group, died as <Col N="191" /> a result of breast cancer, a rather chilling thought. It helps focus our attention on the magnitude of the problem. Notwithstanding the Minister's proposals in the recently announced health document, it is appropriate to focus on that problem now.</P>
    <P>The importance of research cannot be over emphasised. It is essential that women in the high risk, 50 to 64 age group, should have ready access to mammography screening in the light of the need for early detection. Services are available at a number of hospitals throughout the country, but those centres are not readily accessible to all women. I hope that will be remedied in the not too distant future as the delay in that area is disappointing. We are awaiting the results of pilot schemes before processing further, but I am not sure if that is the most appropriate course in this instance.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the EU screening programme under way on a pilot basis at the Mater Foundation but that is not a sufficient response to a serious health problem for women which should be dealt with on a nationwide basis. I am aware of the debate on the effectiveness of mammography screening but it is necessary to implement procedures for earlier detection which I hope will reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer. The Minister should immediately set up a screening programme which would be readily available for women.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Irish Country Women's Association who focused attention on this subject in recent times.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the debate within medical circles on the best means of dealing with this problem. Notwithstanding that, immediate action is required. I hope the Minister will act, signal clearly to women that he is serious about this and reassure them of his intentions to do whatever is required.</P>
    <P>The second part of our motion arises from the recent concern of women who received Anti D immunoglobulin treatment, particularly in the 1970s. It should be noted that women's health suffered as a result of their following an approved <Col N="192" /> and prescribed procedure whereby they were given intravenously an apparently contaminated blood product. It has caused untold concern, stress and perhaps, in a minority of cases a life threatening illness. I am disappointed at the way the crisis was handled by the Minister who seemed more intent on keeping the problem at arm's length than quickly implementing procedures to screen, identify and counsel those at risk.</P>
    <P>Last February when the full scale of the problem became apparent the Minister announced that a screening process would be put in place immediately through the GP service. Many GPs first heard of the Minister's proposals through the media. The manner in which they received advance warning from the Minister was haphazard, unco-ordinated and unprofessional. In many cases the facilities to carry out blood tests were not available to GPs for several days or weeks following the Minister's announcement.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the screening process attempted to address the problem. I give full credit to the general practitioners who have done an excellent job, with negligible back-up from the Minister. I will refer later to that. The Minister is smiling, he must not believe what I am saying but it is a fact that can be borne out by numerous women throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I will give examples of people who experienced this problem. The son of a woman in the high risk group presented for screening and was told that no procedures were yet in place to deal with such cases. This was more than a week after the Minister's announcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did this person seek screening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred that case to the Minister at the time and he should know about it. There is no point querying it now. In the case of a woman who presented for blood tests and made inquiries ten days later, she was told that the sample was still not sent to the laboratory for analysis. At a later stage, little or no information was available on the <Col N="193" /> test except that it was positive. For this unfortunate woman who was naturally worried and anxious to ascertain what further information was available on the test, the only information available was vague.</P>
      <P>In another case where a woman's test was positive and she went for counselling and treatment, she found the treatment &mdash; self-injection &mdash; cumbersome to administer and the counselling worthless due to the fact that insufficient information was available, with particular reference to her future health. This latter factor is particularly noticeable when patients inquire as to how they might be affected in the event of accelerated progression.</P>
      <P>Another case is that of a woman who tested positive and who may have her employment position reviewed due to her employer's concern about her insurance cover, an item which the Minister stated was a matter between the insured and her insurance company. That presents a very serious problem for some women, particularly in the public service &mdash; insurance cover is required for public liability where people are dealing directly with members of the public. The Minister will recognise some of those cases; one of them is near his constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been particularly slow in providing information on the accuracy of the PCR test and other tests which might follow, including liver biopsy. There is equal vagueness as to the success rate of treatment by way of interferon. Little information has been made available on the advanced age factor in terms of progression. No provision has been suggested on compensation, which must be an issue where patients are innocent victims of circumstances outside their control, as in the case of haemophiliacs. The Minister will recall that when he was on this side of the House he brought to the attention of the then Minister, as did my colleague, Deputy Ivan Yates, the absolute and urgent necessity of addressing the question of compensation where it was clearly identifiable that the patients were in no <Col N="194" /> way to blame for the problem with which they were faced.</P>
    <P>No reliable information has been made available on methods of transmission, whether sexual transmission or otherwise. As the Minister knows, medical opinion is divided in that area. For example, in Japan it is presumed that sexual transmission is possible whereas in Germany and other countries it is believed it is not possible. This information should be available to counsellors, yet when women seek it in the course of counselling they are unable to get it. I can cite numerous cases where women had to seek out the information from international medical journals, and that is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that women should be treated in such a slipshod, impersonal, demeaning and undignified fashion. It is intolerable that they should be treated more as numbers than as human beings and that they should be left to worry about their health with only the support of their families, while information readily available in other countries is unavailable to them. It is unbelievable that almost 1,000 women who have tested positive are left worried and confused as to their future health, notwithstanding the Minister's statements in the House and long-winded replies to parliamentary questions. Unfortunately, the Minister is not the only culprit in that area. Long-winded replies to parliamentary questions are commonplace and are more like statements than replies.</P>
    <P>Lest it be felt that I am exaggerating I will cite an article by Carol A. Seymour in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, volume 308 of 12 March 1994:</P>
    <P>Irving <i>et. al.</i> found that all but two of 52 &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; blood donors infected with hepatitis C virus had abnormal liver biopsy tissue. The abnormalities ranged from fatty change, chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis to cirrhosis.</P>
    <P>Several issues must now be addressed. Should further screening programmes be planned to pick up more of these &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; people in the <Col N="195" /> community since they may be at risk of future liver disease by a synergistic effect with other agents such as alcohol and drugs (a couple of well-known drugs are named).</P>
    <P>What should be done about a positive test result for hepatitis C virus? Counselling is essential, and Ryan <i>et. al.</i> have shown it to be effective on a limited scale. More studies of asymptomatic people will be needed to determine the precise risk of progression to chronic liver disease and the effects of treatment, when appropriate. At present the only results we have are of treatment of patients with hepatitis C. Up to half go on to have some form of chronic hepatitis and if untreated, up to a fifth of them may progress to cirrhosis. Patients with community acquired hepatitis C may have a lower risk of cirrhosis; meta-analysis suggests that the disease progress in one-fifth of such patients and that two-thirds of those develop chronic hepatitis. Furthermore Irving <i>et. al.</i> suggests that substantial proportion of donors with repeatedly positive result on hepatitis C virus testing should have liver biopsies to assess any liver pathology.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recognised that the testing system is not 100 per cent accurate and I accept the difficulties there. The danger is that in this country we appear to accept the 75 per cent rate of effectiveness of the PCR test, and we do not suggest how patients might progress to further tests. I am not happy that the method by which the Minister is dealing with this matter is in the best interests of the women of Ireland or of his Department.</P>
    <P>The <i>New England Journal of Medicine,</i> volume 330, No. 11 of 17 March 1994 states:</P>
    <P>Epidemiologic studies show that the most efficient transmission of HCV is through the transfusion of blood or blood products or the transplantation of organs from infected donors and through the sharing of contaminated needles among injection-drug users. <Col N="196" /> However, less than half of patients with acute hepatitis C report a history of such exposure. A small number of epidemiologic studies demonstrate that perinatal, sexual, household, and occupational transmission occurs.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to reassess the problem and the manner in which he and his Department have managed it so far. They should be seen to be dealing with it in the best possible way. The Minister should review the matter with a view to making available to the women concerned every possible item of information so that some of their worst fears may be assuaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to dwell mainly on the need for national screening for breast cancer. I am sure the Minister is aware that breast cancer is the most important and most urgent health issue for Irish women. It is the most dreaded enemy of every woman because every woman is a potential victim. It is the secret fear of every woman, including myself. For all of us, any indication of a lump or cyst causes shock waves through the system. Many women have experienced this awful and frightening feeling. I am certain that everyone in this House must know a family member, a friend or a neighbour who has lost a loved one through breast cancer.</P>
      <P>The facts are frightening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. It is the commonest cause of death in women between the ages of 35 to 45 years. It is diagnosed in approximately 1,200 women every year in Ireland and is responsible for more than 600 deaths per year. It is diagnosed generally from the age of 30 years onwards and, sadly, there is no known cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight's motion concerns one known fact &mdash; the earlier the disease is diagnosed the more likely that treatment can cure it. Because of this I joined my colleague, Deputy Durkan, in tabling this motion because we know, and it has been proved, that early detection will prevent deaths. All the medical evidence and research supports the vital importance of early detection and there is living proof <Col N="197" /> that this is the most vital element in curing breast cancer.</P>
    <P>The issue is so important and urgent that it cannot be considered as just one of the many parts of a plan for women's health; any decisions to tackle this nationwide killer cannot be deferred until yet another study or pilot programme is completed and evaluated. It must be treated in isolation and dealt with urgently. Every week new cases are diagnosed; with every week's delay valuable opportunities are lost to provide methods of early detection and screening, thus preventing deaths.</P>
    <P>It is an avoidable defect in our nation's health care that we have the second highest death rate from breast cancer within the European Union. This proves that the problem must be of national concern and a priority in our health policy and must, therefore, demand speedy reaction and resources provided swiftly. There is and will continue to be a debate as to the best way to tackle and attempt to reduce the alarming number of deaths caused by breast cancer but there is an emerging agreement that deaths can and will be avoided by the provision of a nationwide breast cancer screening programme for women in the high risk category.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Irish Countrywomen's Association for its initiative in undertaking a national campaign calling for the provision of such a screening programme. Its members deserve all our support in their efforts to establish a national focus and an increased awareness of the means of reducing death from this disease.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we hear more about those who die from breast cancer than of the huge number who overcome the disease and are cured. I appeal to the Minister to play his part in providing the necessary resources to turn the problem of breast cancer to the stage where we will record the number of cases cured rather than concentrating on the number of deaths.</P>
    <P>The screening programme for which I and my party call for this evening can be established at a cost of approximately £5 <Col N="198" /> million to £6 million. Surely this can be considered a worthwhile investment in view of the possible number of lives saved. I urge the Minister to respond positively by agreeing to the establishment of a screening programme without delay. While we are all aware that the screening programme is not the total answer, other effective measures must also be taken if we are determined to reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights on 9 March 1994 I placed this issue on the agenda. The meeting was addressed by Ms Aine Gillatt, the health promotions officer of the Irish Cancer Society, Professor Higgins, Professor of Surgery at UCC and St. Vincent's Hospital, Dr. Codd of the Mater Hospital and Dr. Jane Buttimer of the Department of Health. It was obvious to all of us who attended that meeting that not enough is being done to ensure early detection and that there is a need for a national strategic plan on breast cancer.</P>
    <P>The clinic in St. Vincent's Hospital is hugely under-resourced and massively under-funded. I call on the Minister to provide the funds to allow this breast clinic to be developed into a major breast diagnostic centre. At present the clinic is operating for only one morning per week and is, therefore, unable to cope with the huge demand. This, unfortunately, leaves many women who have symptoms but who cannot have speedy examination enduring a stressful and distressing waiting time. This is most unfair, totally unjustified and should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister also to promote an awareness of breast cancer and to provide psychological and community service support for those women who have been diagnosed with the disease, whose needs should be determined by survey and, most importantly, by speedy access to treatment. The message is quite clear; deaths can be prevented. The Minister must be committed to taking the first steps in providing a nationwide breast <Col N="199" /> cancer screening programmes, it is the only way early detection can be achieved.</P>
    <P>At present there are only 17 mammography machines around the country and for that reason only women who already have the symptoms can avail of that service. Early detection is important in women who may not have physical symptoms. It is only when we undertake and are committed to providing that type of screening programme that we will succeed in having early detection, the results of which will be the prevention of deaths.</P>
    <P>All of us have met too many families with no mother and too many children without their loved ones all because breast cancer was diagnosed too late. This disease is a major killer and yet it is one where the number of deaths can be reduced. Is it too much to call on the Government to provide the necessary finances and resources to enable early detection? If the Minister responds favourably to this motion he will be providing a valuable service to women. He will relieve women's fears if they can be assured that screening facilities will be made available and may help to ensure that families are not left motherless. Even if the death rate is not reduced vastly, one life saved is one family saved and it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to look on this demand as part of his national health programme, for which I commend him. I ask him to look at it in isolation. This matter cannot be delayed because a delay will result in more deaths and more women who should have been detected but who will not be for months or perhaps years. The facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this issue because I have lost loved ones as a result of breast cancer as I am sure have many Members of this House. We should commit ourselves in 1994 to tackling this enormous killer of women and to provide the necessary resources. I appeal to the Minister to respond positively to our request.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second part of the motion, I am happy to support Deputy Durkan in calling for improved support <Col N="200" /> for the many unfortunate women who received a positive result in the Anti D screening process. My concerns are in three areas. I understand that 12,000 women in the targeted area have not turned up for testing. I appeal to the Minister to initiate a nationwide programme urging these women to come forward for testing. I am concerned that there appears to be a delay of five to six weeks before the results of the second test are known. That is a time of enormous stress for women and anything the Minister can do in that regard would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised that all support services would be available for women who tested positively. I received telephone calls from women concerned about the financial cost involved. One person was minding the children of a neighbour who had to go to Dublin for a test. Who pays the train fare and the childminder? Not only do families suffer stress but they also have an additional financial outlay. Many people cannot afford this and they should not have to worry about finance during this distressing period. There is a very little information on the disease. Financial support should be available to those who must undertake such journeys and leave their homes and jobs for further testing.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to provide nationwide breast cancer screening. It is one of the major issues facing women today and he would be thanked for providing such a service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to support the motion, although I do so with concern. Given the huge morbidity and mortality rate from breast cancer we need answers and action urgently. The fact that early detection saves lives needs no further study or research. Detection at present involves the best use of electronic equipment, namely, mammography. I am aware of the discussions in medical circles but until something better is in place I ask the Minister not to deny the large body of women, particularly those in the higher age risk category, easy access to mammography. Sometimes it is <Col N="201" /> too late when self-examination or examination by a general practitioner indicates there may be a problem. The Minister should ensure easy access to mammography under the GMS for all women who wish to avail of it.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to say this but with the alarm being raised about the increasing rate of testicular cancer, men will not have the same difficulty getting immediate access to detection and treatment. I ask the Minister to ensure, on foot of this excellent, constructive and positive campaign of the ICA, that no woman has to wait to avail of a mammogram deemed necessary in her case. Please give easy access to all women regardless of their financial means to this important detection procedure. Detection is the only means we have of ensuring the rates of morbidity and mortality will be reduced. We do not need to await the findings of the Mater Hospital study to give us the rates.</P>
      <P>I would be negligent if I did not point to the criminal neglect of medical research here. Research is a cinderella area. Medical research has not been given the priority it deserves and that is tragic in a country which has a reputation for the delivery of treatment and services in the medical field. Perhaps the Minister will address this issue. We will not be ahead in the medical field tomorrow if we do not put money into research today.</P>
      <P>I support what Deputy Theresa Ahearn said regarding St. Vincent's breast clinic. It is under-resourced and under-financed. It is the only one in the country and is open for only half a day each week. It is unrealistic to expect that to continue. The Minister gave a grant towards the clinic recently but I ask him to give them the outstanding funding to ensure the clinic is properly funded with the equipment and staff resources it needs to do the job, given the huge rate of morbidity and mortality from breast cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the tragedy of hepatitis C from Anti D immunoglobulin treatment of women, no women who tested positive for hepatitis C has been advised not go give blood. The Minister may say that heat treatments and the different management <Col N="202" /> of blood means this could not happen again but some advice should have been given in this area. Many of the women who tested positive gave blood since 1977. I am not sure that was wise. If infected blood went into the overall blood pool there is a much less chance of passing on hepatitis C than there was in the case of Anti D treatment but there is a slight risk. Many others are concerned that if they had a blood transfusion over the last ten years or so they may have caught hepatitis C. The Minister needs to extend the testing service to anyone who may have concerns in this area, to the husbands and families of those who may have tested positive and to anyone who may have had a blood transfusion or who has cause for concern, whether it is realistic or not. People who are worried do not need the bible of medicine preached to them. They need the blood screening test to allay their fears and I ask the Minister to ensure it is available to them.</P>
    <P>The newspaper column inches attributed to the Minister on this issue since it broke last February run into thousands. Apart from doing a good PR exercise to shore up his image and that of Pelican House and all those who have been caught on this issue, there are huge gaps in the management of this problem. I will give the example of Frances from County Wexford. She made several attempts to contact the Minister and failed to do so. She contacted a named official in the Department who told her to write to them. She did so and up to three days ago had not received a reply. Frances is a school teacher. She is articulate and a great spokesperson for women who may not be able to express their concerns. Frances is married with four grown up children. She had a miscarriage in 1977 at the age of 37. She is rhesus negative, as is her husband. She should never have had Anti D immunoglobulin treatment but it was given to her on the insistence of her gynaecologist at Wexford General Hospital as a &ldquo;precaution&rdquo;. How many other women were given Anti D unnecessarily apart from those who received it because it was thought to be the best medical practice? As an articulate <Col N="203" /> educated woman, she pointed out that both she and her husband were rhesus negative and that she should not be given it but they insisted and she was given the treatment. She has now tested positive. The PCR was received from Edinburgh some time ago and she had high anti-bodies which means she had a recent bout of the virus.</P>
    <P>This woman is awaiting a call for follow on treatment. She can get no information as to when she will be called. She does not know what kind of treatment she will be offered. Those who tested positive are alarmed, as are their families. The ABC of what happens when a positive test and PCR is received has not been spelled out so their fears cannot be allayed.</P>
    <P>The Well Woman Centre tried to set up an advice centre but it cannot gain access to the information it needs. General practitioners are frustrated because blood tests results are not automatically sent to them. When Frances contacted Pelican House on being tested positive she was told by a doctor, whom I can name later, that everyone who has this disease will eventually die from it. This woman panicked and visited her GP. He phoned Pelican House and she was put in contact with another doctor who denied the statement. I will give the Minister the name of the doctor who made the statement.</P>
    <P>These women need to know the truth. They also need counselling and information on the steps being taken in terms of treatment. I urge the Minister to accept this motion which will allay these women's fears. Many of the fears are perceived rather than real, but nevertheless they will not be allayed until such time as the Minister spells out the steps being taken in terms of treatment. Many women, their families and society in general are concerned about the way this unnecessary scare has been handled.</P>

      <P>It will be an unnecessary scare until such time as they know the facts. Why do Britain and France, where <Col N="204" /> women have received the Anti D immunoglobulin treatment, not have the same problem with hepatitis C? This woman would normally be well able to pursue her own interests without having to ask her public representative for help. However, having been totally frustrated by the response of the Department and the Minister who could not tell her where she should go next, this woman had to ask me for help. She is a teacher by profession and she should be applying for the principal's job which will come up next year. The staff are having a meeting this week to consider her future position in the school &mdash; parents have expressed concern about her. The Minister, or perhaps medical science, have not been able to allay the fears of people about the impact of this disease. The Minister must spell out precisely the counselling which will be made available immediately for all women who have tested positive and the treatment they will receive.</P>
      <P>It is with pleasure that I support this motion. I hope the Minister will have some good news for us both in terms of access to screening for breast cancer and the handling of the hepatitis C problem which has tragically affected many more women than we initially envisaged would be affected. Will the Minister say when the immediate families of these women, people who have had blood transfusions and those who are concerned about hepatisis C, can gain access to the testing service? How does the Minister plan to deal with the large number of women who have tested positive? How will the treatment be financed and what criteria will be used in the selection of women for treatment?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;welcomes and supports the Minister for Health's proposals for the development of a comprehensive, integrated health care system as set <Col N="205" /> out in the national health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>,</P>
    <P>&mdash;commends the proposals contained in the strategy regarding the development of a plan for women's health, including the proposal, in relation to screening for breast cancer, that a decision would be taken on the question of setting up a national screening service as soon as the findings of the present study at the Mater Hospital Foundation have been evaluated and</P>
    <P>&mdash;commends the Minister for the action taken and proposed in relation to the identification, counselling and treatment of women and their families who have tested positive for hepatitis C arising from the national screening programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will deal later with the specific issues raised in the motion and by Deputies on the other side of the House. Any discussion on the health services should now be placed firmly in the context of the comprehensive and integrated strategy on health services which I published last week. This strategy will guide the development and improvement of all health services. I welcome the opportunity to outline for the House the main principle and directions embodied in the strategy, so soon after its publication. The House will see that the strategy gives priority for the first time to the development of a comprehensive plan for women's health.</P>
    <P>The publication of the health strategy discharges an important committment of my Department under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> It is the culmination of a root and branch examination of all aspects of the health services to which I have devoted the last 16 months since becoming Minister. This examination has revealed a service with very many strengths, but one which cannot deliver on its full potential because of organisational and other difficulties. Foremost among its strengths is the quality and commitment of its staff. Another important asset, the extent of <Col N="206" /> which is perhaps unique to Ireland, is the involvement of the voluntary sector as a substantial and integral part of the public services. There is a real enthusiasm within the services for development and change, for progress and improvement.</P>
    <P>The principal weakness is a lack of clarity about the overall focus or direction of the health services. In the absence of specific goals or targets, it is very difficult to assess real effectiveness. This position is unsustainable in a service which spends more than £2.25 billion of taxpayers' money each year and which could spend very much more on undoubtedly worthwhile developments if the resources were available. Notwithstanding the rhetoric engaged in by the Deputies opposite in calling for significant expenditure cuts, I am sure that like me they could name many projects which would be worthy of funding.</P>
    <P>A second weakness, and one which has long been recognised, is the inadequate development of community services and of appropriate linkages between community and hospital services. This works against the objective of providing appropriate care in the most appropriate setting. It is clear that the organisational and management structures of the health services need to be significantly updated if real progress is to be made in tackling the other weaknesses I have identified.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Health I was determined that I would build on the existing strengths of the services and implement the reforms needed to overcome the weaknesses. Just over a year ago I announced that with the assistance of my Department I would draw up a comprehensive national health strategy. I said that the strategy would have a clearly stated philosophy and clear and unequivocal objectives and targets and would provide for the necessary legislative measures to back them up.</P>
    <P>The document published last week delivers fully on this commitment and has the potential to transform our health services for many years to come. The title of the document &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; conveys its main theme &mdash; the reshaping of the health services in terms <Col N="207" /> of a clear, strategic direction so that improving people's health and quality of life becomes the primary and unifying focus of all our efforts.</P>
    <P>Three important principles underpin the entire strategy &mdash; equity, quality of service and accountability. The Government's commitment to social justice has been seen in a wide range of policies since we took office and is reflected in the commitments to further progress which we have included in our Programme for a Partnership Government and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>There are few areas of Government policy which can have a greater impact on social justice than health policy. I am particularly pleased that in endorsing the health strategy my colleagues in Government have agreed in the clearest statement yet that our health services should first and foremost help those whose health needs are greatest. It is now an established fact that factors such as unemployment and poverty are linked with poor health status. We have also known for some time that certain groups, such as travellers, particularly women travellers, have health status far below that of the population as a whole.</P>
    <P>The strategy contains a number of measures which will address this inequality, the most innovative of which is the creation of health development sectors. This means that each health board will be required to identify within its region those sectors which need special attention in terms of targeting health services. These sectors may be geographic areas or specific population groups, such as travellers or single mothers. The strategy explains how the health services will focus particularly on improving the health status and quality of life of these sectors.</P>
    <P>The second principle is the measurement of quality. This has several dimensions. The formal measurement of the technical quality of the services will become an essential, integral part of their provision and all health care professionals will be expected to become <Col N="208" /> involved in an ongoing clinical audit of their own areas.</P>
    <P>However, there are other aspects of quality which can have a marked effect on a patient's satisfaction or otherwise with the service provided &mdash; Members opposite touched on these in their earlier contributions &mdash; aspects such as dealing efficiently, courteously and comprehensively with patients, showing sensitivity to their requirements. These aspects will also be evaluated through regular consumer or patient surveys.</P>
    <P>The third principle is accountability. The strategy sets out new arrangements for improved legal and financial accountability. But it goes far beyond that &mdash; it sets out a new approach to the provision of health care under which everyone providing a service knows what is required of them and accepts responsibility for the achievement of agreed objectives.</P>
    <P>This principle is especially important in the context of the necessary reorganisation of health structures. The strategy sets out the decisions the Government has made in relation to structures which will be followed by the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>The strategy document is in two parts. The first part is the strategy proper &mdash; five chapters explain how the system will be reshaped to bring about the necessary transformation in accordance with the principles which I have described. The second part is a four-year action plan which itemises the detail of what will be achieved in each individual service.</P>
    <P>The objective and targets set out in the strategy and the action plan do not deal merely with service developments. They also deal with the importance of focusing our health promotion policies on tackling the main causes of illness and premature death. There are very significant potential reductions in the extent of illness and premature mortality if we can, as a community, adopt the appropriate preventive measures. A cohesive programme to bring this about is included in the strategy.</P>
    <P>I intend this document to be the working agenda for everyone in the health services from today on. Its implementation <Col N="209" /> will take account of the views and ideas which emerge in response to it. It contains an explicit invitation to all interested parties to consider and debate the strategy and its implications for all of us.</P>
    <P>The strategy sets out broad principles and objectives, but these will have to be translated into detailed plans at national and at local level. I want to see the widest possible participation in this process.</P>
    <P>In summary, the strategy is a landmark document which sets out objectives for the health services to achieve, structures to achieve them and mechanisms to measure progress. I am very encouraged by the extremely positive response it has received so far from a wide range of groups and commentators both within and without the health services. This augurs well for the task which now lies ahead &mdash; the reshaping and development of our services in order to overcome the weaknesses by building on its undoubted strengths.</P>
    <P>I want to focus now on one specific section of the strategy, that dealing with women's health. I do not agree with the view expressed opposite that we should compartmentalise our health services, that we should look at women's health in isolation from everything else, or that we should look at one aspect of women's health only. That is why I spent so long working on a national policy. That is why I introduced my remarks this evening by focusing on that national policy.</P>
    <P>The strategy identifies the need for a policy which is based on a comprehensive view of women and the issues that affect their health. At present, health services for women are organised by function. There is no framework to provide unified objectives or common approaches.</P>
    <P>The strategy sets out the major elements which now underlie Government policy on women's health. These objectives include the following: to ensure that women's health needs are identified and planned for in a comprehensive way; to ensure that women receive the health and welfare services that they need at the right time and in a way that respects their dignity and individuality, <Col N="210" /> with ease of access and continuity of care; to promote greater consultation with women about their health and welfare needs, at national, regional and local levels and to promote within the health services greater participation by women both in the more senior positions and at the representative levels.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the issue of cancer and particularly breast cancer. I am determined that I will do everything I can, as Minister for Health, to reduce the incidence of cancer in Ireland. In the health strategy document which I recently launched I have set a medium-term target to reduce the death rate from cancer in the under-65 age group by 15 per cent in the next ten years. The strategy sets out a number of action programmes designed to achieve this target. The increasing number of deaths from lung cancer among women is an area of particular concern to me, the number not so much fewer than the number of deaths from breast cancer, which is frightening and worrying.</P>
    <P>Increasing deaths among women from tobacco-induced disease reflects the great growth in smoking among women since the fifties. Smoking is a major causative factor in up to 90 per cent of deaths from lung cancer. Deaths from lung cancer have been increasing as a proportion of all cancer deaths among women. In Ireland, a total of 500 women died from lung cancer in 1992.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years the health promotion unit of my Department has been particularly concerned with tackling the very worrying upward trend in the number of women smoking in this country. The unit has launched anti-smoking campaigns and other initiatives specifically targeted at women. The unit would be anxious to enlist the support of women's groups in its efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>Despite the advances made in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery which have revolutionised cancer care, cancer is an illness which retains its power to inspire fear and distress. Many cancer patients and those close to them, feel a sense of powerlessness in the face of this <Col N="211" /> terrible illness. This is, perhaps, because of the severity of the symptoms associated with some cancers and its ability to spread and attack healthy tissue. As Minister for Health I am extremely conscious of this. I am very aware of the particular anxieties felt by women regarding breast cancer.</P>
    <P>Increasing emphasis is being placed on early detection and the prevention of illness where possible. The European Union has made the fight against cancer and the value of prevention an integral part of its health policy. This initiative has developed in tandem with increased health awareness and health promotion in this country. Few of us now remain unaware of the links between diet, smoking and lifestyle with heart disease and cancer. Unfortunately, the causes are less clear in the case of breast cancer. Hereditary factors, diet, alcohol and late first pregnancies have all been mentioned as being possible among the influences which can increase the risk of breast cancer.</P>
    <P>While mortality from breast cancer is not separately identified in published Eurostat data, World Health Organisation statistics based on age-standardised data indicate &mdash; and this is important &mdash; that breast cancer mortality rates are lower in Ireland than in the United Kingdom or Holland, the only two European Union countries that have national screening programmes.</P>
    <P>In terms of establishing breast cancer incidence levels in Ireland, the new national cancer registry &mdash; which I opened in Cork in January &mdash; will enable us to provide accurate and comprehensive statistics on national incidence levels of breast cancer. In the meantime, we can avail of data on incidence levels from the southern tumour registry which is the most reliable database available in the country. In fact most countries do not have a national registry but rely instead on local registers such as the southern tumour registry.</P>
    <P>The much publicised claim that Ireland has the highest incidence rate of breast cancer in Europe is misleading and inaccurate. <Col N="212" /> In fact, using age-standardised data from the southern tumour registry. Ireland ranks fifth within the European Union in terms of incidence levels behind Holland, Luxembourg, Belgium and Denmark. I give this fact purely and safely for the sake of accuracy, not to underscore in any way the terrible seriousness of the problem.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, unlike lung cancer, with its well documented links with smoking, the causes of breast cancer remain to be clearly established. Because it is not possible to say how breast cancer can be prevented, emphasis is placed on early detection at the pre-invasive stage, through mammography and consequent early treatment.</P>
    <P>At present in Ireland mammography is used largely for symptomatic or worried women on referral by their general practitioner, consultant or through their local breast clinic. There are now diagnostic units at 17 hospitals throughout the country and expertise has been growing in all aspects of the early detection of breast cancer and its treatment.</P>
    <P>Mammography screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis. All Deputies who contributed said mammography was available to all those who want it. I agree with that statement. A national screening programme is quite different, it reaches out to all women, many of whom will never otherwise present themselves for screening. We have to work out mechanisms to have the most effective means of early detection.</P>
    <P>It may be helpful to outline briefly some of the general principles which are considered necessary to underpin a successful screening programme. One of these is that the natural history of the disease should be well understood. Another is that there should be a suitable screening test and one which is acceptable to the population to be screened. Another essential factor in the success of such a screening programme is a high and consistent participation rate among the population to be screened. The absence of a national population register in <Col N="213" /> Ireland makes the implementation of a national screening programme all the more difficult.</P>
    <P>There is considerable debate and discussion internationally regarding the effectiveness of mammography screening programmes in reducing mortality from breast cancer. Our objective must be to reduce mortality rates.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom and the Netherlands are the only two EU countries which have organised national screening programmes specifically for women aged between 50 and 64 years. There is general agreement that mammography screening programmes are not effective in reducing mortality in younger women. Unfortunately, women aged over 65 have proved reluctant to come forward for screening.</P>
    <P>Critics of mass population mammography screening programmes consider that not enough is known about the natural history of the disease and how it should be treated. Mammography is technically difficult to carry out and requires a high level of professional expertise.</P>
    <P>Screening does not reach an absolute conclusion on the presence or absence of disease. It does not give a definitive yes or no but merely divides the screened women into test negatives or test positives for further investigation, if necessary. It is essential that the number of false negatives &mdash; I know the Deputy will appreciate this point &mdash; and false positives is kept to an absolute minimum, both to avoid unnecessary further investigation which can be traumatic for women and also to prevent women who test negative falsely from being lulled into a false sense of security. Standards of excellence in both the mammography equipment used and the staff carrying out the technique are therefore critical to its effectiveness. In a well organised mammographic screening programme, women must be invited to come for a mammogram at specific intervals. As I mentioned earlier, the test must also be acceptable to the population to be screened since a reluctance to come forward for screening or to accept an invitation <Col N="214" /> to be screened will jeopardise the success of the programme.</P>
    <P>Since the probability of developing breast cancer increases with age, screening needs to be repeated at regular intervals. The optimum interval between repeated screens has not yet been agreed by doctors. We must be aware of, and guard against, any potential hazards such as any danger associated with ionising radiation and unnecessary biopsy operations in women with false positive results.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding with a national screening programme for women aged 50-64 years, it is imperative that the benefits to be derived from a well-organised screening programme are carefully and fully assessed. It is vital that expertise is gathered on how best to organise and manage a screening programme. For these reasons, my Department is supporting a major breast cancer screening programme currently underway at the Mater Foundation. This programme &mdash; the Eccles breast screening programme &mdash; is one of a network of pilot schemes which are at present underway in seven countries within the European Union. The other countries are Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy.</P>
    <P>The Irish pilot programme covers a defined catchment area of north Dublin and Cavan-Monaghan. All women in the catchment area aged between 50 and 64 years are eligible to attend. Screening is provided free of charge. The Eccles programme has established itself as one of the leading European pilot programmes. The key factors in its success are common to all successful programmes, namely a centralised screening programme, having proper regard to quality assurance mechanisms, with strong clinical leadership and trained and dedicated radiological, epidemiological and radiographical support.</P>
    <P>The Eccles breast screening programme is the first of its kind undertaken in Ireland. As indicated in the new health strategy &mdash; Shaping a Healthier Future &mdash; national policy to be followed in this area will be guided and influenced by the information we gain from this programme <Col N="215" /> by the end of the year. My objective in breast screening is to put in place whatever mechanisms are required to reduce mortality from this terrible cancer.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the action taken and proposed in relation to the identification, counselling and treatment of women and their families who have tested positive for hepatitis C arising from the Anti D immunoglobulin product. The Blood Transfusion Service Board informed me on 17 February 1994 that evidence had emerged that there was a possible link between the product Anti D immunoglobulin and heapatisis C. The board made arrangements to change the product and this took place on Friday, 18 February 1994. It has introduced a new virally inactivated product which has been supplied to all hospitals. I have already outlined publicly the importance of Anti D immunoglobulin and I say this in reference to Deputy Durkan's remark. This is a huge breakthrough for women to allow them to have babies. Many hundreds of children have come into this world because of the availability of Anti D. There are many women who if given the choice now would take the risk of Anti D in order to have a healthy child.</P>

      <P>Its importance cannot be overstated and that is something which has been made clear to me from all my contacts with women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hepatitis C virus was first described in 1989. The question of introducing a screening test for hepatitis C for donations nationally had been considered in 1989 and in 1990. During this period the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the Department of Health examined the possibility of introducing such a test. However, a review of international practices and discussions with medical experts abroad revealed that there was insufficient scientific information about the test to approve its routine introduction. The position was <Col N="216" /> carefully monitored and when the test was considered sufficiently reliable it was introduced in Ireland. This occurred in 1991 at the same time as this screening was introduced in the UK. Cost was not the determining factor in the timing of the introduction of such tests and, in fact, £1 million for hepatitis C testing by the Blood Transfusion Service Board has been approved to date.</P>
    <P>When the possible link between the Anti D product and hepatitis C was brought to my attention, my immediate concerns were the protection of all future recipients of Anti D immunoglobulin, the identification of any risk, however small, for any mothers who received the Anti D immunoglobulin product in the past and the provision of counselling and treatment for women who test positive for hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board has announced its intention to follow up all of the mothers, as far as is practicable, who may have been at risk of contracting hepatitis C from the Anti D immunoglobulin product. A special public awareness campaign was launched to inform the public as to the possible risks. This campaign will continue until every woman who wants to be tested has received a test. The board estimate that 60,000 women received the Anti D product from 1970 to 17 February 1994.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that the number who have been screened for hepatitis C antibodies under their hepatitis C / Anti D screening programme is 48,358 and that the number who have tested positive in this preliminary testing is 893 up to and including yesterday, 26 April 1994. A further confirmatory test is being carried out on the blood samples given by these women and I have been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that the indications now emerging are that a greater number are now proving to be negative.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board that there are some encouraging signs emerging with regard to the results of the liver biopsies carried out to date; however, it is too <Col N="217" /> early to say what the final overall outcome will be.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that all women who were administered with Anti D are being requested to avail of the nationwide free blood testing service by the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Expenditure totalling £1 million has been incurred by the Blood Transfusion Service Board on the national blood screening programme since last February. In addition, I have approved expenditure up to a total of £1.8 million by the hospitals involved in the treatment of those who test positive for hepatitis C antibodies. Anti D was introduced in 1970 and the object of the campaign is to advise all women who have had Anti D from 1970 up to the 17 February 1994 to come forward for testing.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board has informed me that in the five year period 1975-79, 90 per cent of those who received Anti D have presented for testing. In the five year periods 1970-74 and 1985-89, 75 per cent of those who have received the Anti D have presented to date for testing. In the five year period 1980-84 70 per cent have presented. However, in the period 1990-93 only 60 per cent of those who received Anti D have come forward. I urge these people to come forward immediately.</P>
    <P>Screening of children and-or partners of women who test positive for hepatitis C has also commenced. This is being carried out in consultation with the three children's hospitals in Dublin and paediatric units at Cork and Galway. Women who test positive for hepatitis C are being offered screening for their children and partners by the Blood Transfusion Service Board who are making arrangements for the test to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Counselling by medical counsellors is provided at the Blood Transfusion Service Board headquarters in Dublin, at the regional centre in Cork and at a number of other centres nationwide.</P>
    <P>Counselling is available to those who have tested positive for hepatitis C anti-bodies. Many women are counselled by their general practitioner, but women may be referred by their general practitioners <Col N="218" /> for counselling by the medical counsellor at the Blood Transfusion Service Board or may themselves elect to attend the medical counsellors at the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Further counselling is also offered if the confirmatory test is also positive.</P>
    <P>Treatment for those who test positive for hepatitis C antibodies is being provided at the following hospitals: St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; Mater Hospital, Dublin; St. James's Hospital, Dublin; Cork Regional Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
    <P>The treatment initially involves an outpatient visit at a special consultant staffed clinic which may be followed by a short admission for clinical investigation and follow-up treatment, if required. The treatment, including the provision of Interferon, if prescribed by clinicians, will be provided by the public hospital service free of charge.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that public confidence in the Blood Transfusion Service Board remains high. Since its foundation the board has provided an essential service to thousands of Irish people. It is a service on which our health service relies daily. In view of the crucial importance of maintaining the highest possible standards for blood and blood products I am determined to take whatever action is necessary to ensure the highest possible safety standards.</P>
    <P>I announced on 4 March last the establishment of an expert group to examine and report to me on all circumstances surrounding this issue and any other matter relevant to the maintenance of high standards. If the expert group finds any cause for concern in respect of any other aspect of the systems in place in the Blood Transfusion Service Board, it is being asked to look at that.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the screening and treatment programmes being undertaken by the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the hospitals respectively. I am getting a very positive feedback from people who have availed of the services. I know it is very difficult to carry out such a mass screening programme, it is <Col N="219" /> probably unprecedented. My immediate reaction was to give everybody information. I know some people did not want that and wanted it rationed out to different categories of people: general practitioners first and the general public afterwards. That is not my style and I decided on complete openness from the beginning.</P>

      <P>I stress the importance for all women who received Anti D at anytime to come forward for testing, which will be carried out free of charge.</P>
      <P>Any objective assessment will show that my commitment, and that of the Government, to the provision of an equitable and effective health service has been borne out by the publication of the national health strategy, and that women, as with all users of the services, will benefit greatly as a result.</P>
      <P>I have indicated the action that is being taken in relation to cancer, and particularly in relation to breast cancer. This problem is being taken very seriously by the Government and, as indicated in the health strategy, the measures to tackle it will be implemented in the light of the results of the programmes I outlined to the House.</P>
      <P>As regards the link between the Anti D product and hepatitis C, I indicated clearly the actions taken and proposed in relation to the identification, counselling and treatment of women who have tested positive and their families. These actions show the Government's willingness to face up, openly and rapidly, to problems that may emerge and this will continue to be my approach so long as I am Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party support this motion. Having listened to the debate there seems to be a disparity in the statistics and it has been disputed whether Irish women top the European Union league of deaths from cancer. I do not think that is the issue. Whatever the statistics, far too many Irish women die from breast cancer every year. That is the issue to which we must address public health policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Far too many women die and that must stir us to examine our public health policy as it relates to women. I pay tribute to the Irish Country Women's Association who have thrown down the gauntlet to the Minister and all of us and forced us to confront the issue in an unprecedented manner.</P>
      <P>They are calling specifically for a national programme for mass screening for all women in the highest risk age group, that is women in the age group 50 to 64 years. In the circumstances that is a reasonable and well thought out request. It was only last Wednesday that the Minister and I debated this issue on the Adjourment and I do not think either of us anticipated that it would re-emerged so quickly. Nonetheless it is worth spending more time and giving more thought to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be repeating what I said a week <Col N="221" /> ago. I urge the Minister to take note of the Irish Country Women's Association request and respond positively with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <P>Breast cancer presents one of the major unsolved problems in medicine today. It is by far the most common form of cancer in women. The average Irish woman has a chance of 1:11 of developing breast cancer during her life time. It is the second most common cause of death in women aged between 25 and 34 years. In middle aged women it is the most common cause of death. More than half of the deaths in women aged between 50 and 64 are from breast cancer. Last year 660 Irish women died because of breast cancer, a horrendous figure. Women confronted with this problem experience anxiety and anguish and it is a terrible heartbreak for families when a young mother dies. It cannot be quantified but must never be ignored.</P>
    <P>The years 25 to 34 are the major child bearing years and the mother is badly needed in the home. The middle years are the major years for rearing children. When one considers the anguish and the havoc in the home on the death of a mother at any time one can appreciate the difficulties it causes in the middle years. We must pursue all steps open to us to ensure that as many lives as possible are saved. It follows that all steps open to us in terms of public health policy must be pursued vigorously. There is ample evidence that the earlier the disease is diagnosed the greater the likelihood of successful treatment leading to a cure. A properly designed national screening programme is a key element in this respect. We have been informed by the experts in this field that such a programme could improve survival rates by as much as 33 per cent in women in the 50 to 64 age group; in other words, the lives of a sizeable number of women could be saved.</P>
    <P>In respect of women under 50 &mdash; another high risk group &mdash; I understand that screening is not very effective. Yet, a huge number of women in this age group die from cancer. We must confront that issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> In his comprehensive and promising health strategy published last week the Minister puts forward the concept of a vastly enhanced role for the general practitioner. Younger women should be advised, if not required, as a matter of policy to have a breast examination by their general practitioner twice yearly. This ought to form part of a public health service. They should also be encouraged consistently by their general practitioner to carry out this examination themselves based on the principle that early detection leads to a cure.</P>
    <P>We must provide more money for research to establish the causes of cancer. There must be some reason more women are dying from cancer today than 20 years ago. Is this due to diet, some other environmental factor or a combination of factors? The Minister should make sufficient moneys available &mdash; this would be a good investment &mdash; to enable research to be carried out. Prevention and early detection must be the passwords.</P>
    <P>I am advocating that we adopt a three pronged approach: a national screening programme as requested by the ICA, a programme to be implemented by general practitioners aimed at early detection in respect of women under 50 and additional funds for research. I do not have time to develop any of these points.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the two issues dealt with in the motion are being taken together as each would merit a full debate. In relation to the second issue a number of practical problems have arisen and I appeal to the Minister to address them as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice that women have to confront a range of obstacles, one of which is the policy of the VHI which refuses to provide cover for women who have tested positive for hepatitis C. This is a scandal. It is unacceptable that these women will not be covered under their VHI plan and it constitutes a gratuitous additional burden. I call on the Minister to intervene and direct the VHI to offer cover when it is sought. As the only shareholder in the VHI, he has the authority to do this and I call on him to <Col N="223" /> exercise it. Previous Ministers in similar situations stepped in and ordered the VHI to act when they saw that such action was essential and desirable.</P>
    <P>During a previous debate in this House the Minister promised priority treatment but this is not happening. It is not good enough that many of these women who are very worried face long delays for treatment. The Minister will have to take all the steps open to him to ensure the promises he made at the time are not broken.</P>
    <P>A number of women who have tested positive believe that the counselling provided is inadequate. I have been informed that there is an unwillingness to provide even the most basic information. I know of women who have not yet received a copy of the blood test result. This is a disgrace and falls short of the full and frank disclosure promised by Dr. Walsh of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and confirmed by the Minister in the House.</P>
    <P>I have been reliably informed that there are unnecessary delays in liver biopsy testing, which is also unacceptable. Delays may have been inevitable in the early days but there is now no justification for them. I am aware that the process is cumbersome and ought to be streamlined. I know of one woman undergoing interferon treatment who feels she is being sent from pillar to post. She has to visit the health board to obtain a script and return to the hospital to receive a month's supply of interferon and needles.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is probably aware, an action group has been set up to help women who are experiencing a sense of fear, isolation and frustration in securing their rights. The Minister should ensure that this action group receives the support and co-operation of the Blood Transfusion Service Board. It is my information that this is not forthcoming. The Minister should provide resources to help this group achieve its aims and ambitions.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the promises made when this issue was raised in the House was not monitored. If it had these sloppy practices would not have been allowed. The Minister should address these three key issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for facilitating this brief debate because it is a matter of the utmost gravity on which the public spotlight should be focused. What is emerging is the fact of secret negotiations and a lack of accountability and transparency in a matter of direct concern to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Bank is the subject of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989 which provided that if the bank were ever sold out of its present ownership structure the proceeds would fall due to the Exchequer. It is reckoned, on last year's accounts, to have assets of £1.2 billion, an annual profit last year of £15 million and about 1,000 employees. There have been reports in the last few days that the dismissal of a chief executive of one of the top five banks was in some way connected with National Irish Bank acquiring the Trustee Savings Bank. A statement from the Trustee Savings Bank board did not deny that discussions have been taking place. I am now told that these discussions have advanced to a stage where Mr. Lacey is to be replaced by Mr. Harry Lorton, the <Col N="225" /> boss of Trustee Savings Bank, and that a provisional agreement has been reached. Last Thursday I questioned the Minister in the Dáil about the future of the three State banks, ACC, ICC and Trustee Savings Bank and got no indication whatever of this move. It is stretching credibility to suggest that the Minister did not know what was going on. He should have known.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that in the context of any proposal by the Trustee Savings Bank board to sell it, the Government's position is that unless a purchaser takes the ICC as well, such sale will not be approved. Is this Government policy? That is a most serious development which should be clarified because there would be clear implications for employment in ICC, which the Government has been trying to flog for many years.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with something that is worth £200 million in the context of Trustee Savings Bank or ICC and it would be unfair if there were anything other than open tendering so that the taxpayer would get the highest price. It is unacceptable that those who bid in 1991 for the Dublin Trustee Savings Bank, namely, Woodchester Bank, Irish Life and Ulster Bank would not get a look in this time around. This smacks of a sweetheart deal done in secret. That is no way to conduct public affairs. Having checked the legislation of 1989 and the ICC Bank Act, 1992, I humbly submit that an order of this House would be required in regard to any sale of Trustee Savings Bank and, if a majority of the stake of ICC were to be sold, it would require new legislation &mdash; only a minority stake of ICC can be sold under the present legislation. This would, therefore, be in order on the Order of Business, although the Government would want to avoid those questions.</P>
    <P>I want a commitment from the Government that the taxpayer will get top dollar if Trustee Savings Bank is sold. I have no ideological objection, but the Labour Party has been shafted on this. Its proposals in the Programme for Government to form a super State bank have been <Col N="226" /> dropped. That is sensible. The proposal was daft from the outset. It is vital, however, that we have transparency and accountability, that the taxpayer gets the maximum amount of money and that everybody gets a fair crack of the whip so that the best strategic interests of the employees and this bank can be developed together.</P>
    <P>As matters are developing, I am concerned that we will be faced with a <i>fait accompli</i>, a package deal which will not allow this House, the taxpayer or the employees of the Trustee Savings Bank or ICC adequate input into these important decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Yates in thanking the Chair for his creative use of the Adjournment debate to discuss this important matter.</P>
      <P>On 1 February I put down a parliamentary question asking if the Trustee Savings Bank was involved in the evolution of a third banking force. The Minister said that it was but he had had no meetings with the Trustee Savings Bank. On 28 February he said, by way of letter, that he had inadvertently misled me. I accept that it was not intentional. He said:</P>
      <P>It is now brought to my attention that I met the Chairman of the Trustees and the Chief Executive of the Bank in November 1993. At that meeting, as in the various meetings held with other relevant institutions, I made it clear that the purpose of whatever initiative is to be taken in relation to a third force is to increase competition in the banking sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Yates that these manoeuvres have been carried out in secret and without accountability. What the Minister means by developing competition in the banking sector and the evolution of a third banking force is distinctly different from the notion enshrined in the Programme for a Partnership Government. It also effectively constitutes privatisation and, therefore, would be a major development in the banking sector which would have serious <Col N="227" /> implications for the Government's platform in the Programme for Government. On 2 November 1989 the then Labour spokesman on Finance, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, said in the Dáil:</P>
    <P>The Minister is gearing himself up and preparing the powers for himself to do a Thatcher operation on the Trustee Savings Banks . . . the intention in the medium term is to privatise this national asset and sell off this magnificent potential for the Irish people to their friends, [In Fianna Fáil] their backers and supporters in the private sector . . . I look forward to an assurance that not 5 per cent, not 10 per cent nor even 1 per cent of these banks will be allowed to fall into the hands of the private sector creditors . . . I say, hands off the Trustee Savings Banks. They are private property and must remain in the public domain.</P>
    <P>He was directing his comments at the man who is now Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance. He himself is now at the Cabinet table in a very good position to ensure that this asset remains in public hands.</P>
    <P>The sale of the Trustee Savings Bank would not only be a breach of the commitments given by Labour about privatisation, it would also inflict a possibly mortal blow to the proposals for a vigorous third banking force promised in the Programme for Government. In the programme it is stated: &ldquo;The Government will develop a vigorous third banking force from within the State sector by merging the ICC Bank and the ACC Bank and by seeking a merger of the new entity with Trustee Savings Bank&rdquo;. If the Trustee Savings Bank is sold off to the Australians, the value of any third banking force will be limited. The Trustee Savings Bank's 69 branches, 1,000 staff and assets of more than £1 billion are essential, and it is doubtful if, without them, any new third banking force would have the strength or resources to offer a genuine competition to the existing banks.</P>
    <P>It is now more than 15 months since <Col N="228" /> that programme was agreed, yet this is the first development that has emerged as a result of the extraordinary happenings in recent days. There is a stronger case now for a third banking force than in December 1992. The commercial banks have little concern for the overall needs of the economy. They regard their customers as primarily a source of profit maximisation. In terms of the developmental role of a third force in banking, not to mention the competition it would provide in the banking sector, it is essential that the Government proceeds with its plan as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government. It now emerges that the Government has a distinctly different view of what is meant by competition in the banking sector than that agreed by the Labour Party when it entered Government. I look forward to the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, explaining how this developed and how she sees the evolution of a third banking force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies opposite are confusing private discussions between two banking groups with public policy. Such private discussions are not public policy.</P>
      <P>An efficient banking system is of fundamental importance to economic development. In view of that, the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> indicated that it would be Government policy to create a third force in banking. The objective is to increase competition in the banking sector, while protecting and enhancing the developmental role which State banks play in fostering industry, especially small and medium sized industry. As Deputies will be aware, the proposal to establish a third force in banking involved at the outset the ACC bank, the ICC bank and the Trustee Savings Bank. Proposals to give effect to this policy have not yet come before the Government, but work is ongoing in the Department of Finance to finalise those proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike the ACC and ICC banks &mdash; which are owned by the State because it <Col N="229" /> owns the vast bulk of the shares &mdash; the Trustee Savings Bank is governed by a board of trustees who have control over the day-to-day management of the bank. In that respect, it was always accepted that the Trustee Savings Bank would have a key role in determining its long term future and that role must fit in with the overall Government policy for developing our banking system.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989, the board of trustees are free to enter into discussions with third parties on proposals for the bank's future development which they will submit to the Minister for Finance for consideration. As stated by Deputy Yates, under section 57 of that Act proposals by the board of the Trustee Savings Bank have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. It is for this House to decide, not for the trustees.</P>

      <P>The House will no doubt be aware that the trustees of the Trustee Savings Bank issued a statement on 25 April indicating that the board of trustees had been for some time evaluating the many strategic options available <Col N="230" /> to the bank for its long-term development. Their statement also indicated that as part of this process, consideration had been given to a number of options to determine if the trustees could develop proposals which could be recommended to the Minister for Finance. Their statement went on to say that this process was continuing and may result in due course, in proposals being made to the Minister whose authority must be sought if there are to be changes in the status of the Trustee Savings Bank. The Trustee Savings Bank statement concluded by indicating that recommendations should not be made unless the trustees of the bank are fully satisfied that the long-term interest of the staff of the bank and its customers is being served.</P>
      <P>The Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989, does not contain provisions which would prevent the trustees from making proposals to the Minister for Finance on its future development.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy listened he might hear something. These proposals cannot be given legal effect unless the Government agrees to them and recommends them in the form of a draft order to both Houses of the Oireachtas, which must receive the assent of both Houses.</P>
      <P>Proposals which trustees of the Trustee Savings Bank recommend to the Minister for Finance would have te be subject to detailed analysis before a recommendation to Government could be formulated. It is essential that any proposal for the development of the Trustee Savings Bank are consistent with the proposal in the Programme for a Partnership Government for the development of a competitive banking system and the needs of the overall economy, including employment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates asked why the sale of the Trustee Savings Bank should not be conducted through a competitive tendering procedure. The Minister for Finance has not received proposals from the Trustee Savings Bank, therefore, it is premature to comment on disposal or methods of disposal. As the House will be aware, it is Government policy to use competive tendering procedures where appropriate. Proposals involving the future of the Trustee Savings Bank would have to be examined against the background of the unusual legal structure of that bank. It would also be necessary to consider how the proposals met the perceived need, as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government, to increase competition in the banking area while protecting the interests of the taxpayer, the banking system in general and staff and customers of the Trustee Savings Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this subject on the Adjournment. I pay tribute to Wessel Industries for the contribution it has made to the economy of Carrick-on-Shannon for almost 40 years. The company was set up in the mid-1950s under a Government incentive programme and it has been reasonably successful since then.</P>
      <P>Its recent closure with the loss of 42 jobs is a blow to an area that has suffered a number of serious industrial losses.</P>
      <P>During the past 12 months there have been job losses with the closure of the GEA plant in Carrick-on-Shannon and, in the neighbouring town of Drumshanbo, with the closure of the Lairds jam manufacturing plant. The Minister and the IDA should specifically address the problems in Carrick-on-Shannon by attracting an industry to replace Wessels or, if possible, provide aid to save some jobs in that company. The loss of 42 jobs in that area is as severe as the loss to Galway of the Digital company 12 to 18 months ago. In the context of our major industries 42 jobs would be considered small but such loss, in addition to 40 manufacturing jobs during the past 12 months, is a major blow to that area.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the international wing of the IDA and the Department to set up job creation projects in Carrick-on-Shannon to replace the jobs lost recently. That is not an easy task but Carrick-on-Shannon has a good basis for attracting industry. Some of the jobs in Wessels should be protected or, if that is not possible, the IDA and the Department of Enterprise and Employment should give special treatment to that area to replace those jobs lost.</P>
      <P>That area has suffered a decrease in population during recent years and is probably the area in the west that has suffered most. Now that a long-term employer has gone out of business the Government and the IDA should give a commitment to provide a replacement industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate Deputy Ellis' concern about the impending closure of Wessels Ltd., in Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim. I an conscious of the effect its closure will have on the employment situation there and on the employees concerned. Deputy Ellis emphasised the good record of the company in Carrick-on-Shannon and its beneficial impact on the surrounding countryside.</P>
      <P>On 21 April 1994 Wessels announced the closure of its operation in Carrick-on-Shannon with the loss of 42 jobs. I understand negotiations were concluded and agreement reached on the terms of closure with the employees and their union. The other Wessels operations in Dublin and Longford are not affected.</P>
      <P>The plant at Carrick-on-Shannon, owned since 1982 by Wessel Industries Ltd. was established in 1953 to manufacture wiring accessories. Since Wessels took over manufacturing was carried out under licence for a UK grouping.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years the electrical accessories business has experienced increasing competition from the Far East. The competitors are mainly Hong Kong companies. Faced with a deteriorating market and in a desire to improve its profitability by using surplus capacity in the UK, the licensing company decided not to renew the manufacturing licence with Wessels and to distribute the product directly to the Irish market. That decision resulted in the recent announcement of the closure of the company.</P>
      <P>While the withdrawal of this manufacturing licence will result in the closure of the facility, Wessel Industries has actively sought alternative business for the Carrick-on-Shannon plant in conjunction with the international wing of the IDA Ireland and Forbairt, its domestic wing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that IDA Ireland has made numerous attempts to find suitable projects &mdash; joint venture partners &mdash; to provide work and save jobs at the Carrick-on-Shannon plant since it became aware <Col N="236" /> of the impending withdrawal of the manufacturing licence. Those efforts included IDA overseas offices entering discussions with a number of potential investors. Despite those strong domestic efforts and those of a concerned community, no suitable partner has been found.</P>
    <P>Against this background, IDA Ireland, in conjunction with Forbairt, continued to actively seek alternative business for the Carrick-on-Shannon plant. I am glad to tell Deputy Ellis that as a result of these efforts, his efforts and those of concerned community leaders, in recent weeks, a party has been identified who has indicated a definite interest in establishing a new alternative electrical manufacturing business, albeit on a smaller scale than the Wessel plant. Negotiations are at an advanced stage on this proposal with Wessel and Forbairt. I assure the House that every effort is being made to facilitate the start-up of this new business as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In the broader context, I am confident that the difficult employment situation in Leitrim will improve. I am aware that Forbairt has been working closely with community groups in the area in order to encourage and promote employment opportunities and that a number of companies, supported under the small industry programme, have grown to become medium sized ones. I can assure the Deputy that both the IDA and Forbairt will continue to actively market the Carrick-on-Shannon area as a first class location for investment. In this regard, the development agencies are making a special effort this year to market the advance factory of 24,000 square feet in the area which it has recently acquired.</P>
    <P>There are strong indications &mdash; I am not prepared to go further &mdash; of a replacement industry, albeit on a smaller scale, for the Wessels factory. The advance factory of 24,000 square feet in Carick-on-Shannon is being aggressively marketed. Forbairt is actively encouraging the development of small community industries and some have commenced. Carrick-on-Shannon needs all the positive help possible. I hope the Deputy's raising <Col N="237" /> this matter will result in positive news for Carrick-on-Shannon in the near future.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Illegal Moneylending.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me to raise the important subject of illegal moneylending which is causing so much distress in my constituency, Dublin city and other cities. This problem has existed for a long time and I raised it on many occasions in the Dáil. Despite pressure from the Opposition the Government has only taken insignificant steps to tackle the problem and they have been ineffective. When the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, introduced the dirty dozen cuts the Government greatly exacerbated the problem of illegal moneylending. Although some of those cuts were withdrawn, those that remain in place have worsened the problem. Only the poor borrow from illegal moneylenders and they pay the highest interest rates.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer in particular to three of the social welfare cuts. First, community welfare officers in health centres may not give assistance to help pay local authority rent arrears. Second, they could help only very rarely in ESB arrears cases and, third, clothing allowances were a much less frequent aspect of the supplementary welfare system and, even when granted, they were much less than they had been. The community welfare officers, frequently called relieving officers, are relieving damn all, but that is no fault of theirs because they are acting under instructions from the Minister for Social Welfare. The result is that many of the poorest people are forced to go to moneylenders to forestall evacuation from their houses or disconnection of electricity supply, or to dress themselves and their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Social Welfare to remove the three remaining elements of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;, which the Labour Party promised would be removed. I ask him to instruct community welfare <Col N="238" /> officers to help in the stressful cases of rent arrears on local authority houses to prevent eviction and to help much more generously and frequently with ESB arrears and clothing allowances for the poor.</P>
    <P>My second request relates to a proposal I made four years ago to expand the supplementary welfare system to include interest free loans in addition to the existing grant. Many of those who go to the moneylenders should be able to get an interest free loan from the community welfare office to pay ESB arrears or to get shoes or clothes for their children. The money could be stopped at source from their social welfare payment, with a reasonable amount being deducted per week without interest. The only direct cost to the State would be the interest on the loan, but that would be offset by the fact that many people would opt for a loan rather than seek a grant.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating what happened under the British social security system where interest free loans were made available but grants were abolished. I am not advocating the abolition of grants; I am asking that interest free loans be an option for the poor. Illegal moneylenders are blackmailing and robbing the poor and we are doing damn all about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for raising this issue about which he obviously feels very strongly. I know he has the interests of the people of Dublin at heart. The question relates to the continuing serious problem of moneylending and I have responsibility for legislation in this area. The Deputy ended by saying that the Government is doing very little to help those beset by illegal moneylenders. I endorse the very strong language the Deputy used to describe these people &mdash; there is no language fit to describe the rapacious behaviour of those who prey upon vulnerable people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Consumer Credit Bill which has been passed on Second Stage will shortly go to Committee Stage. There are no simple solutions in that Bill to the problem of moneylending, a problem that has <Col N="239" /> existed from time immemorial. The Moneylenders Acts, 1900 and 1933, are being repealed in the Consumer Credit Bill. The Director of Consumer Affairs will have very strong powers under that legislation. Moneylenders must be registered and applicants for licences must pay a fee of £1,000 to trade in one District Court district and a further fee of £500 for each additional district. There will be very strong strictures on moneylending. For example, moneylenders will not be allowed top up loans, collection books must be maintained and be open to scrutiny and they must not call to a persons's house between 9 p.m. and 10 a.m. or on Sundays or bank holidays. Many calls from illegal moneylenders are made very late at night, terrorising people, particularly women in their homes. Under the legislation moneylenders must produce a letter of authorisation.</P>
    <P>The reason I am going into the background of this matter is that this is one part of the answer to the problem, but there are also social welfare measures involved. Under the legislation there will be clear differentiation between those who legally lend money and those who illegally lend it and extract it back by extortion, by taking social welfare books and using other methods of obtaining payments at exorbitant interest rates which people cannot afford.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, has introduced a number of initiatives to help people with debt problems. In 1992 the Department of Social Welfare funded the establishment of pilot projects around the country aimed at building new and more comprehensive approaches to combating the problems of moneylending. Responsibility for making and amending rent schemes for local authority dwellings was devolved to local authorities in August 1986 and <Col N="240" /> guidelines were issued by the Minister for the Environment at that time to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation confirmed that where a tenant has genuine difficulties with payment of rent arrears, every effort is made to facilitate the tenant with payment of arrears, including, where justified, the payment of arrears by instalments. The corporation has advised us that approximately 2,500 of its tenants have availed of the Department of Social Welfare household budgeting facility. In view of the discretion of local authorities in dealing with rent arrears cases, the Department of Social Welfare has asked health boards to advise tenants who seek assistance with rent arrears to consult the housing welfare department of their local authority for advice on how to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>A joint effort is being made to combat illegal moneylending. I am introducing a legislative programme to wipe out illegal moneylending. People should be confident to contact the Director of Consumer Affairs who will take the necessary action on their behalf, but that will take time. As Deputy Mitchell said, people need debt management advice and provision will be made in this area. There is need for local authorities to be diligent, courteous and humane in their dealings with people, and Dublin Corporation in particular is adopting that attitude with those who find themselves in arrears.</P>
    <P>There is no need for people to use illegal moneylenders. These people are thriving because those to whom they lend money are afraid to speak up about them in the communities. I know that Deputy Mitchell feels strongly about this matter and I hope that the measures of which I speak will in time eliminate this scourge.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 April 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Oral Questions Nos. 24, 38 and 45 and Written Question No. 77 together.</P>
      <P>On the basis of my own detailed knowledge of the particular area in question, I came to the conclusion that there was a need for a redistribution and changes in the stationing of Garda resources in the Salthill region. Among the factors which I considered were the increase in the population of Salthill in recent years to a figure of 16,000 people. Because of its popularity as a seaside resort, its population increases to about 24,000 for the summer months. In addition, crime figures for the area &mdash; including the incidence of drug abuse &mdash; have been on the increase.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, under the powers conferred on me by section 6 (1) of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, I directed the Garda Commissioner that a redistribution of resources should be brought about. This involved, as one element, the upgrading of the Salthill sub-District to a District Headquarters status.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner has just forwarded his proposals to me to give effect to my direction. I have accepted those proposals and the necessary changes will come into effect as and from 16 May 1994. I have also agreed with the Commissioner's proposal to review the operation of the new Districts of Salthill and Galway (Mill Street) early in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These changes do mean a reduction in the status of the former District of Oughterard which will now become a sub-District of the new Salthill District. This can be justified on the basis of comparative crime statistics alone. The crime level in Salthill has been at about three times the level of Oughterard in recent <Col N="102" /> years. I have been concerned nevertheless to ensure that Oughterard maintains policing strength at the level it requires. This is estimated by the Garda Commissioner to be one sergeant and five gardaí and one patrol car will be assigned to the station on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>The new Salthill District will comprise the following sub-Districts: Salthill, Oughterard, Spiddal, Inverin, Carraroe, Lettermore, Rosmuc, Moycullen and Kilronan. It will have a Garda strength of 61 members (as compared with 28 previously) and will cater for a population of 31,588.</P>

      <P>Full-time school attendance officers are employed by the borough councils in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Dún Laoghaire. Outside of the borough areas, the Garda Síochána is the enforcing authority for the School Attendance Act, 1926.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that there are 827 gardaí acting as school attendance officers throughout the country. However, no member of the Garda Síochána is actually deployed full-time on school attendance duties. All the members who perform such duties are available for, and perform, the full range of Garda duties and the work is generally undertaken in connection with juvenile liaison or community-neighbourhood Garda work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education, published a school attendance-truancy report earlier this month, and the recommendations of this report, in so far as they impinge on the role of the Garda Síochána in this area, are currently being <Col N="103" /> considered in my Department in conjunction with the Garda authorities. One of the recommendations of this report is that detailed discussions should take place between officials of my Department and the Departments of Education and Health on this matter. It is my intention that these discussions will take place and that the future role of the Garda Síochána in this whole area will be subject to this review.</P>

      <P>There are two separate aspects in the procedure for the payment of criminal legal aid claims. Initially, claims are lodged with the relevant court office for certification. They are then passed to my Department to be processed and paid.</P>
      <P>In so far as court offices are concerned the information sought is not readily available. Any exercise to compile the information in court offices could only be undertaken by assigning a disproportionate number of staff to the task at the expense of other more important tasks, which would cause delays in court business.

      <P>Including the Presidents of the various courts there are currently 17 High Court judges, 18 Circuit Court judges and 46 judges of the District Court.</P>
      <P>The appointment of additional judges is one of the matters under consideration following a review of activity levels in the High, Circuit and District Courts to assess the impact of the altered jurisdiction of the courts under the Courts Act, 1991. The result of this review will form the basis of proposals which I will be bringing to Government with a view to eliminating arrears in the courts. However, I could not undertake, in response to a Parliamentary Question, to outline my proposals prior to their consideration by the Government. With regard to training for judges, the scope for the exercise by me of initiatives in this area is limited having regard to the Constitutional independence of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>Our system of appointment to all levels of the Judiciary is based on the concept of bringing in trained and experienced legal practitioners. This contrasts with the system in certain other European States where recruitment is of new legal graduates who are subsequently trained in their judicial functions. The formal qualification required for appointment as judge of the District Court is not less than ten years' practice as a barrister or solicitor; ten years' practice as a barrister is required for appointment as a judge of the Circuit Court; and 12 years' practice as a barrister is the requirement for appointment as a judge of the Supreme and High Courts. To become a barrister or solicitor in the first place requires successful completion of a course of studies laid down by qualifying authorities. Judges would on appointment therefore have a wide knowledge of the law itself and of court procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> But I recognise of course the widely-held view that judges, especially, those who have occasion to deal with cases in the family law area, sexual offences and so on should have the opportunity of participating in seminars, conferences etc, with others such as psychiatrists and psychologists who provide expert services for people involved in these difficult human situations and who possess valuable insights and experience concerning the handling of such cases. The Judiciary are aware that I am most willing to facilitate exchanges of this kind by providing the necessary resources and I know that they themselves are providing to take certain initiatives in this regard. This is a very positive development.</P>
    <P>I know also that Judge Peter Smithwick, President of the District Court, has already initiated induction training for all new judges appointed to the District Court. This initiative has been very well received by the Judiciary and I would like to compliment the President on it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should point out that statutory meetings of the judges of the District Court are held up to twice annually under the provisions of section 36 (3) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 for the purpose of discussing matters relating to the discharge of business of that court including such matters as &ldquo;the avoidance of undue divergences in the exercise by the judges of the jurisdiction of that court and the general level of fines and other penalties&rdquo;. While there is no statutory provision for such meetings in relation to judges of the Circuit and Higher Courts, I understand that such meetings do take place.</P>

In order that the Commissioners be provided with the information necessary for the performance of the foregoing function, returns of every charitable devise or bequest are required to be submitted by the Probate Officer to the Commissioners, pursuant to section 58 of the 1961 Act. The 1992 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General focused on this aspect of the role of the Charities Office, in his report on &ldquo;Charities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A new system for the examination of charitable bequests was set up on 1 July 1993. Under the new system, solicitors applying for a grant of probate of any will containing a charitable legacy lodge a simple summary form with the Probate Office supplying details of all charitable bequests. These forms are transmitted to the Charities Office each month for checking. A member of staff to operate the necessary checking procedures was assigned to that office on 27 September 1993 and it is intended that an additional member of staff will also be assigned shortly.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current strength of Donegal division is 485. The Garda authorities inform me that, while overall crime figures for the division to date in 1994 are roughly the same as last year, the figures do show an increase in vandalism and malicious damage type crimes. The Garda is taking special measures to deal with this situation. <Col N="111" /> These measures include the deployment of gardaí in those areas considered to be at most risk and the issuing of crime prevention advice, using the local radio and print media. The Garda is also encouraging the establishment of neighbourhood watch schemes where appropriate in the division.</P>
      <P>The Garda also reports that new arrangements have been introduced in the division whereby Garda stations have been twinned for manpower purposes. This has resulted in an improvement in policing in the division and makes optimum use of manpower and other resources. The Garda authorities are satisfied that the present strength is adequate to deal with the policing needs of the division and they are confident that the measures they are taking will have a significant effect on the fight against crime in Donegal. The situation is being kept under continuing review and any change in the policing arrangements which is considered necessary will be made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 63 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The United States embargo on all political, economic and commercial relations between the United States and Cuba was instituted in 1962. The embargo does not preclude other countries from developing trade and commercial links with Cuba, nor has it prevented the provision of humanitarian aid to Cuba.</P>
      <P>The normalisation of relations between the United States and Cuba is essentially a bilateral question for those two governments. I regret both the continuing poor relations between the United States and Cuba and the circumstances which underlie that situation. I have already said in relation to this issue that it is my hope that the changes that have taken place in international relations in recent years will create the conditions for an end to Cold War animosities everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland abstained on the recent resolution in the United Nations General <Col N="114" /> Assembly because we believe that this situation is better addressed as a bilateral matter between the United States and Cuba rather than being made the subject of a motion amounting to censure in a multilateral world forum such as the United Nations General Assembly.</P>
    <P>The US Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, however, introduced a new extraterritorial dimension to the embargo. Ireland is opposed to this. We have made this clear to the United States and, together with our partners in the European Union, we took the opportunity of the recent vote at the United Nations General Assembly to restate our opposition to the Act and to reject American actions designed to implicate third countries in US commercial measures.</P>

      <P>The question of emergency aid for Cuba from the European Union is monitored on an ongoing basis by the European Commission, and by myself and my colleagues in the Council of Ministers. As far as humanitarian assistance is concerned, 5.1 million ECU were provided in food aid to the people of Cuba by the European Union in 1993. This was channelled through various nongovernmental organisations. In addition, 7.8 million ECU were provided in the form of nutritional and hygiene products, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. The purpose of this assistance was to combat the spread of infectious diseases and the effects of last November's floods. So far this year, some 3 million ECU have been committed to making good <Col N="115" /> the endemic vitamin B deficiency in the country.</P>
      <P>An EU planning mission has recently returned from Cuba. During the course of its visit, detailed discussions were held with the authorities there on the future format and content of European Union assistance to Cuba. Proposals will shortly be submitted by the Commission to the Council, where they will receive careful consideration.</P>

      <P>(1) Civil servants are not permitted to stand for election to either House of the Oireachtas, or to the European Parliament. This restriction applies to all categories of staff and is provided for in the Electoral Act, 1992, and the European Parliament Elections Acts, 1977 to 1993.</P>
      <P>(2) Civil servants in the industrial categories and in manipulative, sub-clerical and manual grades are free to engage in political activity, subject to the general restriction in relation to parliamentary elections. Civil servants in this category may, therefore, contest local elections.</P>
      <P>(3) Members of the clerical classes in the Civil Service, and civil servants in non-manipulative grades with salary maxima equal to or below the clerical officer maximum, may apply for permission to engage in politics on the same basis as the staff referred to at (2), but officers employed on particular types of work may have their applications refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) All civil servants above the clerical <Col N="116" /> level are totally debarred from engaging in politics. However, personal assistants and special advisers in Minister's offices are exempt from the present arrangements covering State employees and politics.</P>
    <P>The basis for the above restrictions is that civil servants whose work concerns advising Ministers and the Government on the execution of Government policy, for instance, a direct service to the public or access to confidential information, should not be known adherents of a political party or be known to have political ambitions.</P>

      <P>He continued to submit medical evidence of incapacity and was referred for a further medical examination on 14 February 1994. He was found incapable of work and disability benefit was subsequently restored by the deciding officer with effect from that date. Payment of disability benefit was made from 10 March 1994. Because he had been paid unemployment benefit for the period 14 February to 9 March, there were no arrears due.</P>
      <P>A letter normally issues to clients where disability benefit is restored after an interruption in payment. However, since the person in question was due to attend at his local office on the day following the decision to restore disability benefit to him, it was considered preferable for him to be advised personally of the decision at that stage. No discourtesy was intended but having regard to the Deputy's point that the client first learned of the decision when he received this cheque for disability benefit, I am having the notification procedure reviewed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid supplementary welfare allowance from 21 September 1991 to 12 February 1994. He applied for unemployment assistance in respect of the periods 10 September 1991 to 5 May 1992 and also from 30 March 1993 to the current time. His current claim will continue in payment for so long as he fulfils the statutory conditions.</P>
      <P>The unemployment assistance claim in respect of the 10 September 1991 to 5 May 1992 period was disallowed. The decision to disallow was upheld by an independent appeals officer.</P>
      <P>The claim which commenced on 30 March 1993 was disallowed on the grounds that the person concerned had not fully disclosed his means. An independent appeals officer subsequently reviewed the decision to disallow and decided that the person was entitled to unemployment assistance with effect from 21 April 1993. Weekly payments commenced on 9 February 1994. Arrears of unemployment assistance for the period 21 April 1993 to 8 February 1994 amounted to £1,618.40. The person concerned had received £1,649.48 by way of supplementary welfare allowance from 21 April 1993 to February 1994. The arrears of unemployment assistance were offset against the supplementary welfare allowance already paid for the relevant period. The case has again been reviewed and the claim made in 1993 will now be backdated to 30 March 1993. There may be a small amount of arrears due because of this adjustment.</P>

      <P>My Department, in consultation with the Garda Síochána, has prepared a draft new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between the health board and the gardaí. This procedure, which revolves around a standardised form for the reporting of suspected abuse, is aimed at ensuring closer co-ordination between key personnel from both agencies in order to facilitate the twin objectives of protecting the child and the full investigation of any crime. The procedure is currently being operated on a pilot basis in a number of selected areas and, subject to any refinement that might be needed, I expect that it will be introduced nationally before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The implementation of this new procedure on a national basis will give effect to a central recommendation of the report of the Kilkenny investigation. This measure represents the first step in a comprehensive review of current arrangements for the reporting of suspected child abuse.</P>
      <P>The Kilkenny investigation report also recommended the mandatory reporting of all forms of child abuse to the health boards. My Department is at present in the process of preparing a discussion paper on this question as a basis for wide-ranging consultations with the relevant interests.</P>

The new code of <Col N="128" /> ethics allows a doctor to breach confidentiality where necessary to safeguard the welfare of another individual or patient. This is in line with another recommendation contained in the Kilkenny Incest report.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific measures that have been put in place in each health board area to improve arrangements for the notification, investigation and management of child abuse, this information is at present being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Section 5 of the Child Care Act, 1991, places a statutory duty on health boards to make suitable accommodation available to homeless persons up to the age of 18 years. The Health Boards discharge their responsibilities in this regard through the placement of young homeless persons in emergency hostel accommodation, residential centres, foster <Col N="129" /> care, special fostering schemes and semi-independent accommodation. The specific details requested by the Deputy are at present being collated and I shall forward them to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
