      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 5, 6, 12, 13 and 14.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) business shall be interrupted at 12 midnight tonight; (2) the sitting shall be suspended at 6.30 p.m. for 30 minutes; (3) No. 5 shall be decided without debate; (4) the proceedings on No. 6 shall be brought to a conclusion within one hour and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the opening speech of the Minister, the main spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and the Technical Group shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes; and (iii) the Minister shall be called upon not less than five minutes before the debate is due to conclude to make a speech in reply; (5) the proceedings on the Committee and remaining Stages of No. 12, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment; (6) the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 13, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to <Col N="1154" /> a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. tonight; (7) the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 14, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12 midnight by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry; and (8) Private Members' Business shall be No. 18 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>The proposal for dealing with No. 12 is acceptable but there is a difficulty in that a meeting of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy has been convened for the same time.  This will cause a particular difficulty for Opposition spokespersons because they cannot be in two places at the one time.  The Government has a Minister and a Minister of State who can divide the business between them but this does not apply to the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House would wish to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the Irish team on winning a place in the last 16 in the World Cup for the second time in succession.  I congratulate the members of the team and its management on a magnificent success which has brought pride and joy to the hearts of everybody in all parts of Ireland and the extended Irish community around the globe.  The Irish fans have proved to be outstanding ambassadors by enjoying themselves in a way that conveys enjoyment rather than offence to others and, in particular, for the way they mingled in an amicable fashion with fans of rival teams before and after matches. Those responsible for law enforcement in the United States have complimented the Irish fans on their behaviour.</P>

      <P>At 8.30 p.m. last night I said we were all extremely proud of how well the Irish team had performed and of how Irish supporters behaved. They were a credit to Ireland in the last World Cup too.  I know the House will be unanimous in congratulating the team and complimenting the supporters. However, we should not lose sight of the marvellous work done by our Embassies and consuls abroad in dealing with the problems that occurred on a day to day basis since the start of the World Cup.  I have first hand knowledge of their work and I am sure the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will vouch for what I am saying.  They have worked day and night to overcome many difficult problems and will continue to do so.  The House should congratulate our Foreign Affairs' officials abroad on the magnificent job they are doing, which has been recognised by people who have encountered difficulties.  We hope the Irish team will not return in the very near future.</P>

The Irish team are a credit to the country and, whatever about party differences, it was good that we were all united in watching the match yesterday evening.

      <P>As Deputy Bruton said, the Irish fans behaved in a most exemplary fashion and were complimented by the police authorities in New York and Orlando.  I join with the Taoiseach in complimenting our diplomatic staff who work with very limited resources compared with other embassies to do an outstanding job for our country on all occasions.  They have done so again on this occasion.  The manager of the team, despite the fact that he was caged in, also did well.  Whether on the sideline or in the cage he is more than capable of managing our team and making sure they perform as well as the best.  I pay tribute to him.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach if he would follow the precedent set by his predecessor if we qualified into the next round.  I do not know if the Taoiseach has had an opportunity to consider the matter, but I look forward to hearing from him when he has made up his mind.</P>

I do not have the same technical knowledge of the game as the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who performed well last night on television.  It is important that we acknowledge not only the sacrifices made by our team and its manager but by our Ministers who sacrificed a great deal to be there to cheer on our team and who have now come back to the mundane affairs of the House.  I am pleased that we have secured a place in the next round and I hope the team do even better.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Social Welfare (Old Age (Contributory) Pension) Regulations, 1994,</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 22 June 1994.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these regulations is to disregard periods spent working in the home while rearing children up to six years of age or while providing full-time care and attention to an incapacitated person, when determining a person's entitlement to old age contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The conversation in the lobby is such that the Minister can hardly be heard in the Chamber.  Ciúnas le do thoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory pension is that the person has a minimum yearly average number of contributions since entering social insurance to reaching pension age, that is, age 66.  A yearly average of 48 paid or credited contributions is necessary to qualify for the maximum rate of pension.  A reduced rate of pension <Col N="1160" /> is payable if the person has a minimum yearly average of 20 contributions. Under the present arrangements, periods spent working in the home are not disregarded when determining a person's entitlement to pension.  It is predominantly women who are adversely affected by the way the average condition is calculated because where they take time out from the workforce to work full-time in the home the resultant gap in their PRSI record has the effect of diluting their yearly average number of contributions which is needed to qualify for pension.</P>
      <P>Women who spend significant parts of their working lives working full-time in the home do not, in general, qualify for old age contributory pension in their own right.  Instead, they rely on the means tested old age non-contributory pension or are regarded as adult dependants of their husband.  The increase payable in respect of an adult dependant with old age contributory pension is about 70 per cent of the personal rate.</P>
      <P>The problem of gaps in women's insurance records was highlighted by the National Pensions Board in its final report entitled, &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo;.  The board highlighted this issue in the context of the increasing number of women who return to the labour force after periods spent working in the home.  The board also identified that the increase in marital separation and lone parenthood will result in fewer women being covered by social insurance as dependants of their husbands in the future.  Consequently, the board recommended that women's social insurance pension entitlements should be maintained while they are caring in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations I propose to make are based on the recommendations of the National Pensions Board.  They give practical recognition to people, primarily women, working in the home.  Under the provisions of the draft regulations, years spent caring for a child, up to six years of age, or for an incapacitated person will be disregarded when working out a person's yearly average number of contributions. <Col N="1161" /> These arrangements will be effective from the current contribution year.  Up to 20 contribution years may be disregarded. This measure will ensure that those who leave the workforce to care for young children or incapacitated people will no longer be disadvantaged when they claim old age contributory pension.  In effect, the new regulations will make it easier for those concerned to qualify for a contributory pension on retirement.</P>
    <P>The 1991 labour force survey indicates there are some 476,000 women and 4,000 men, under 65 years of age, working in the home.  This new initiative will increasingly benefit such people in the future when they reach pension age.  Women in the home are the largest group of people excluded from compulsory social insurance cover in their own right.  I regard this measure as an important step in providing them with access to pension cover.  This initiative builds on other improvements I introduced such as extending social insurance cover to the self-employed in 1988 and to part-time workers in 1990.</P>
    <P>This practical recognition of the work undertaken by parents and carers is a timely development in this the International Year of the Family.  Under the draft regulations, parents who take time out from the workforce to care for their children up to school-going age will no longer be disadvantaged in terms of their pension entitlements.  These arrangements are not confined to parents.  They will also apply in situations where a person other than a parent is living with and caring for a child on a full-time basis. This would include adoptive and foster parents and any other person caring for a child on a full-time basis.</P>
    <P>A person working part-time can earn up to £30 per week and still benefit under draft regulations.  This is an important feature of the scheme which recognises the reality for a large number of women who undertake some work outside the home.  People earning in excess of this amount would be fully insured in any event.</P>
    <P>In addition to catering for those caring <Col N="1162" /> for children, the new provisions will also apply to people who provide full-time care and attention to an incapacitated or invalided person.  It will apply to all carers, and not just those who are receiving the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>In 1990 I introduced the carer's allowance to provide a weekly income, on a means tested basis, to those carers who were unable to provide for themselves because of their caring responsibilities. Since then I have introduced a number of improvements in the scheme.  In this year's Social Welfare Act, I relaxed the rules for the assessment of means in the case of a carer whose spouse is in employment or self-employment.  From July next, the first £100 of weekly earnings of a working spouse will be disregarded in the assessment of means.  In addition, the initial means disregard is being increased from £2 to £6 a week.  Almost 1,000 carers will benefit from these improvements, some by as much as £29.50 extra a week including about 500 carers who will qualify for the allowance for the first time.  A full-time carer without children with a spouse earning £160 a week, who would not previously have qualified for the carer's allowance will now receive a weekly allowance of £37.</P>
    <P>This initiative is a further example of the Government's commitment to focus social welfare improvements on families and, in particular, on women working in the home.  The family income supplement is providing much needed support to workers on low pay bringing up families. Over 10,000 families are now getting FIS, and will receive an extra £6 a week in the new improvements to come into effect next month.</P>
    <P>Child dependant increases payable with social welfare payments also increase next month.  The new minimum payment for child dependant will be £13.20 a week.  The monthly rate of child benefit will be increased from £20 to £25 for the third child and from £23 to £25 for subsequent children from September next.</P>
    <P>Over 9,000 widowed men and their families will benefit for the first time under the new contributory survivor's <Col N="1163" /> pension from October next.  The National Pensions Board also recommended that widowers should have the same pension entitlements as widows.</P>
    <P>All of these developments are particularly important in the context of the International Year of the Family.  The new arrangements provided for in these regulations add to these developments and will benefit a very large number of women in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the regulations is a general provision relating to the citation.  Article 2 defines a homemaker as a person who resides with and provides full-time care to a child under age six or to an incapacitated person.  In both cases, the homemaker must be under age 66, resident in the State and not engaged in remunerative employment, other than employment of inconsiderable extent. This means that women who do some part-time work and earn less than £30 per week can still be regarded as homemakers. Article 2 also provides that in determining whether a person is so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention, the criteria applying under the carer's allowance scheme will be applied.</P>
    <P>Article 3 provides that with effect from the current contribution year, any contribution year in which a person is a homemaker will be disregarded in determining the person's yearly average number of contributions for the purposes of the old age contributory pension scheme.  Up to 20 contribution years may be disregarded in this way.</P>
    <P>These regulations are being made under the powers contained in section 84 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  Section 4 (5) of that Act provides that regulations made under these powers may not be made until a resolution approving the draft regulations has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I recommend the draft regulations to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is long overdue and will recognise the importance of people, mainly women working in the home.  In recent years there has been a <Col N="1164" /> tendency to undervalue the role of the housewife and to look down on her if she is not involved in a profession or other activity outside the home.  She is often made to feel inferior.</P>
      <P>This measure will reduce the penalty imposed on home makers over the years, but how many women will benefit?  The Minister did not say.  Is it much ado about nothing?  I wonder how the age limit of six years for qualifying children will affect the scheme.  I am unhappy with this limit.  A woman caring for children over six years of age will not get the credits she would get in respect of children up to that age.  This is a fatal flaw in the provision because some of the major social problems in other countries are beginning to surface here.  The problem of the latchkey children who come from school to empty homes and roam the streets until their parents arrive from their respective jobs late in the evening is a growing phenomenon here.  I thought the Minister would address this problem and it is disappointing that he has imposed an age limit of six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spent much of his time speaking about the International Year of the Family.  In that context I would have thought the Minister would have taken the opportunity of dealing with the growing problem of the feminisation of poverty. On the recent Social Welfare Estimate I spoke about lone parents who are now compelled by ministerial directive or the Consolidation Act, 1992, to surrender maintenance payments to them by their husbands.  The Minister and his fellow party members have given good reasons for making this provision. However, the Minister accepted on a number of occasions that it has caused severe problems for some families.  I know a family whose income has been reduced by up to £80 a week because of this new provision.  No single parent family with an income of £150 a week can accommodate such a reduction in income.  The Minister promised to look at my suggestion to give alleviation payments to these families.  I heard nothing from the Minister since he gave those <Col N="1165" /> assurances during Question Time and again in the debate on the Social Welfare Estimate.  The Minister should again look at that because the measure is creating definite hardship.</P>
    <P>A headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 24 May said: &ldquo;Woods says ways of granting women pensions without means tests under study&rdquo;.  Is this the full extent of the Minister's proposals in regard to pensions for women who decide to stay at home and raise a family?  If he is planning other measures we would like to hear about them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the impact this measure will have on carers.  The carer's scheme has been a disappointment in that eligibility limits mean that only 4,600 carers qualify.  That will now increase to between 5,200 and 5,300, far short of the number of genuine carers who cannot fulfil themselves in a professional way because of the necessity to stay at home and care for elderly parents or sick friends and relations.  Does the Minister intend to extend the carer's allowance scheme or to incorporate the principle of empowerment so that the handicapped and the sick will have a say about how moneys can be spent by them to employ carers?  The Minister must agree that the limits imposed under that scheme are such that the maximum number who can hope to qualify, even up to the end of this year, is 6,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this measure is an improvement for women.  However, I put the Minister on notice that the ongoing festering controversy about equality payments to women is not forgotten.</P>

      <P>The Chair is right.  The Minister should be orderly.  I was about to say, before I was interrupted, that I am aware of the High Court hearing last week and that a reserved judgment will be given, possibly before the end of July. The Minister used the High Court case as an excuse to deny Members information about spending taxpayers' money.  A decision will be given in July and the Minister will have no further excuses for not giving information to Members of this House and to women who have already been paid sums of money by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister give a pledge that he will provide all the information required by Deputies when the High Court case <Col N="1167" /> is settled and a decision given?  He is responsible for taxpayers' money.  On the debate on the Social Welfare Estimate he acted unprecedently by denying Opposition spokespersons information they required about spending money on the basis that the matter was <i>sub judice.</i> There should be no further excuses for the Minister to deny that information.  I put him on notice that in the forthcoming session I will be pursuing the matter until all information is made available to the House and to the thousands of women involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the regulations.  Any measure that contributes to the role of women in society is to be welcomed.  It is ironic that in presenting the regulations the Minister talked about elements of policy in the context of the International Year of the Family.  It is particularly ironic in view of the debacle of the EU equality directives which undermined women's confidence in the Minister and the Government. That was unfortunate and unnecessary and resulted in a long, tortuous process. It is sad the Government had to be forced into action by women who can ill afford to do so and I hope it will never happen again.</P>
      <P>When talking about equality for women we should remember that the Government has not provided for joint ownership of the family home, and that is a matter of regret.  The regulations are the Minister's way of getting a good end-of-term report.  He is finishing off the session on a positive note for women. Notwithstanding the fact that there is a Ministry for Equality and Law Reform, unfortunately much of the good work that has been done has been overshadowed by the events I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the age limit set down in the regulations.  We are told that the regulations are specifically designed to disregard periods spent working in the home while rearing children up to six years of age.  That could be seen by some women as putting pressure on them to get back into the workforce <Col N="1168" /> once their child is over six years of age.  I am sure that is not the intent, but it could be the practical impact of the regulation, which is unfortunate.  I would like the Minister to clarify this issue.  That stipulation negatives the main thrust of the regulations which is to encourage women to stay at home to mind their children.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the emphasis should be on encouraging women to go out to work rather than to be home makers and that home makers do not get due credit.  I have always given great credit to women who stay at home to mind their children because it is a most difficult job. Those women generally receive nothing more than lip service.  Evidence of that is the avoidance of the issue of joint ownership of the family home.  Admittedly, much work has been done in this regard but there has been no follow through which is regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Minister should re-examine the six years of age clause or explain how that age was arrived at.  Obviously the period of 20 years is designed to facilitate people with two or three children, but what is the position of a family with one child? It would be unfortunate if the effect of the regulations was to force people to go outside the home to work.</P>
    <P>The regulations are timely but they are not retrospective &mdash; they will not take effect for ten to 15 years.  When considering regulations such as these one must think of the cost to the Exchequer. Fortunately in this case the position will be different from that of the EU directive in that these regulations will take effect over a long period.  There is no mention of how many people will be involved or what the cost will be to the State.  When introducing regulations we should be given as much information as possible.  I do not know if there is a guesstimate of how many women will qualify in this instance.  Will the Minister give a projection of the number of people who will be involved and the potential cost?  In the long term there will be no great cost to the Exchequer.  The principle should be established whereby people are entitled as of right to social welfare and other <Col N="1169" /> payments.  I am sure the Government is grateful that this is a principle it can enshrine at no cost to the State.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of carers as referred to by the Minister.  It is regrettable that eligibility limits for carers are very restrictive.  I appreciate that there has been an easing of the restrictions in recent times but we should consider this matter in the context of the cost to the State in the event of elderly, incapacitated people who are cared for in their homes being institutionalised.  That would give a true picture of the payments carers should receive.  I acknowledge that they have received a slight increase, but it is an insult to expect people to exist on such a small amount of money.</P>
    <P>In seeking increases in the carer's allowance at Cabinet the Minister should put forward the genuine argument of the savings to the State from the work done by these people.  It is on that basis that payments should be calculated rather than by plucking a figure out of the air. We are playing on the good nature and devotion of these people.  It is similar to the treatment of nurses who we believe will accept a low salary because their job is a vocation.  The Minister should put forward a strong argument for increased allowances for carers.  Eligibility limits should be re-examined and payments increased.  They should be doubled or trebled, but that is a matter for the Minister.</P>
    <P>I welcome the regulations although I will not get over excited about them.  If their introduction means that the Minister gets a good end of term report, my comment is that he made a burst at a very late stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other speakers in welcoming the principle of these regulations but it is an extraordinary penny-pinching approach to fix it in such a way that very few of those who give up work to care for children or incapacitated people will qualify for a considerable period.  There is no sense in enshrining in regulations a principle which may mature in 15 or 20 years time when there are retired people or people <Col N="1170" /> who will retire in the near future who will not qualify under these regulations.  It is disingenuous of the Minister to provide for a debate on this good news measure but when he introduces regulations to cut people's income he is very reluctant to provide time for debate in this House.  I propose to deal with that briefly.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree to delete a part of section 2 (a) which refers to the interpretation of homemaker?  I suggest that the words, &ldquo;and is under pensionable age&rdquo; should be deleted because people who are unemployed may be denied a pension as a result of having to leave work to return to the home to care for children or an incapacitated person.  If the Minister and Minister of State were serious about this issue they would not have included that phrase in the definition. I take exception to the term &ldquo;homemaker&rdquo; because it implies that those who are working outside the home while at the same time caring for their children are not homemakers.  It would have been better if the phrase &ldquo;homeworker&rdquo; were used, but that is a relatively minor issue compared with the critical issue of fixing a date when the clock starts to run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations are the result of many years of discussion by the National Pensions Board to find a way of ensuring that people &mdash; primarily women &mdash; would qualify for a pension even though they had gaps in their insurance record because they left employment or took up part-time employment in order to care for children or an incapacitated person. The Minister has acknowledged and accepted the recommendation of the National Pensions Board but the manner in which it is being implemented in the regulations is grossly inadequate.  I appeal to the Minister of State, in particular, to persuade the Minister to delete this phrase, as otherwise it will be useless. It is fine in print and the Minister may go abroad and say he has introduced X, Y and Z provisions in support of the family but the reality is that the regulations do very little.  It is notable that the Minister did not provide a costing of the implementation of the regulations in the next five to ten years.  It would be <Col N="1171" /> interesting if he could supply information on what it would cost if the regulations had retrospective effect of five years.  It is unfair to treat people in this way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen referred to the equality issue that is before the courts and I do not propose to dwell on it other than to mark the fact that the Minister has refused information to this House but after a great deal of pressure has admitted that there is possibly a pool of 70,000 women who might qualify for payment if their court case is successful.  My understanding is that the figure is nearer to 80,000 but, in any event, the court will decide on the issue.  Will the Minister accept the decision of the court and not put the women through further appeals to the Supreme Court and, perhaps, the European Court?  I hope he will accept the High Court decision.</P>
    <P>It is notable that the Minister was not reluctant to deny us a debate on what he regards as good news but when regulations to give effect to the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts were introduced by a previous Fianna Fáil Minister, no debate was allowed.  Although the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, claims consistently that the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts are no longer in force the reality is that all 12 bar one are there and the number has been added to by taxation on unemployment and disability benefits.  Instead of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts we now have the baker's dozen.  The Minister of State may shake her head, but that is a fact and part-time workers will tell her clearly that they are still there.</P>
    <P>I have a specific case, about which I have written to the Minister a number of times, of an old age pensioner who is one contribution short on the basis of the criteria for mixed contribution pensions. I requested the Minister on several occasions to introduce some flexibility in the regulations that cover these criteria. It seems grossly unfair than an old age pensioner who may qualify for a pension of £10 or £11 under the criteria for mixed contribution pension is deprived not only of that money but the ancillary benefits that social welfare pensioners enjoy such <Col N="1172" /> as the free television licence, electricity units, free travel and so on.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister to introduce some flexibility in the regulations that govern the mixed insurance contribution criteria?  It would not cost a fortune to do this but it would make the lives of a small number of pensioners a great deal easier.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Minister to delete the phrase in the regulations to which I have referred.  It is too late for me to table an amendment, but if the Minister is not agreeable to making such a change, I will have to find some other means of achieving this, perhaps by tabling an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to some of the comments the important aspect to this regulation which is, as the Deputies rightly pointed out, of limited effect and will apply in future, is that it marks a turning point in our social welfare structure which has been based on the concept of a family in which there is a bread-winner &mdash; generally a man &mdash; and a dependent spouse &mdash; generally a woman &mdash; at home.  This regulation will recognise that many women wish to have a choice as parents and workers and this will permit that.  In future, if a woman currently in the workforce has a child and wishes to take a substantial period off &mdash; up to six years &mdash; to care for the child, she will be able to do so without affecting her statutory entitlement to a social welfare pension.  The same will apply if the woman becomes a carer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many ways this marks a turning point in the social welfare system we inherited which is based on a system of families and has the concept of dependency running through various elements. The NESF recently examined this in some detail.  There are advantages to the family concept but, particularly for women, there are also disadvantages in a social welfare system based on families. This regulation is significant in that it now formally recognises women who wish to have the choice of staying at home or <Col N="1173" /> working.  It is also appropriate, of course, for many people who wish to work but for whom work is not available at the moment.</P>
    <P>Next week marks another turning point in the social welfare system and one with which I have been particularly associated, namely, the introduction for lone parents of substantial disregards in respect of child minding, travel expenses and earnings.  Again, this is confined to one group, lone parents, who, most Deputies agree, have special needs but I believe the success of this measure may mark a turning point in our approach to the social welfare system which should be freed up to allow people as many choices as possible and for a mix between caring and working.  The new disregards will come into effect next week and we will be watching closely the effect they have on the take-up of employment by lone parents because, for the first time, they will be in a position to earn significant amounts of money, either on a full or part time basis, and to retain it in recognition of the fact that they have incurred child care and travel expenses.</P>
    <P>While in many cases we are dealing with detailed regulations and, as Deputy De Rossa pointed out, a number of anomalies in the system, we also must examine its overall framework towards which we want to work.  We must work towards a system where equality is a principle. That is one of the issues currently under examination in some detail by the working group which I established on the integration of tax and social welfare.  That working group brought forward the suggested reforms in relation to lone parents which will come into effect next week.</P>
    <P>While this regulation may not benefit women until some time in the future, it nonetheless represents an important turning point in the construction of the social welfare system.  The Government, in the Programme for Government, is committed to the concept of equality and we have endeavoured, in each of the Social Welfare Bills and the previous two budgets, to introduce changes which will free up the system and offer people a number of alternatives.  Some of those <Col N="1174" /> alternatives are offered through the locally based initiatives but others will come about through regulations such as this.  Over a period of time we will see a significant change in the overall construction of our social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Women who may be home makers or carers working at home may not wish to remain so indefinitely.  They may wish to engage in such work, which they regard as valuable and important, for only part of their lives.  Everybody in this House talks about being pro-family but if we are we must recognise that that involves choices in relation to the type of family care that different parents and families choose to give their children.  We must also recognise &mdash; and we are increasingly doing so &mdash; the demands of women for return to work opportunities and for education and training.  That is being addressed, particularly through the community development programme and the women's grants for which the Department of Social Welfare is responsible.  It is being addressed also in a significant way in the national plan.</P>
    <P>While this regulation, as the Deputies have rightly said, will apply in future, it marks an important turning point in how we look at how families live, how they make arrangements in relation to their children and, in particular, the mix which I believe most women favour, the option to be part of the workforce when that is suitable and when work is available but also the valued option of staying at home with their children, either permanently as a home maker or a home worker &mdash; in deference to Deputy De Rossa, I am happy with either term.  Many women wish to stay at home with their children while they are small and before they go to school.  This regulation marks a turning point in our approach to how we regulate the participation of women as equals within the social welfare system.</P>

Mar sin féin, is maith an rud, go mór <Col N="1175" /> mhór i mbliain seo an teaghlaigh, go bhfuil an t-aitheantas seo á thabhairt faoi dheireadh do mhná agus d'éinne eile a fhanann sa bhaile ag tabhairt aire do ghasúir agus do sheandaoine.</P>
      <P>I welcome these regulations.  We all wish that such measures could always be retrospective and that we could jump all the fences in one go, but there is an old saying in Irish, tús maith leath na hoibre. These regulations are a step towards getting recognition for people who stay at home to look after old people or children. This measure relates not only to women but to a fair number of men.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the recognition given to all carers of incapacitated or elderly people, not only those in receipt of the carer's allowance but all those who stay at home to give full-time care and attention to old people.  One of the criticisms often heard about the carer's allowance is that it is means tested and restrictive but in this particular case no such restriction is imposed and in time that will have a bearing on the effects of this regulation.</P>
      <P>I accept it will take time for this regulation to take effect because of the time lapse involved but if we did not implement this measure now, we would still be considering the situation in ten years' time.  By taking the first steps we are ensuring that in future this problem will be resolved.  A large number of people want to have a mixed career; they want to work during parts of their career and remain working full-time in the home during other periods.  The average clause caused great problems for such people.  I had the case of a person who worked in the early 1950s and then became a full-time home maker.  Later the person returned to work but there was a difficulty because of the clause.  The problem would not have arisen had this regulation been in existence.  It is a huge step forward in dealing with this problem.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies and the Minister of State for their contributions. Deputy Allen asked how many people would benefit from this.  The total number of women in the labour force survey who come under these categories is 476,000 and the number of men is 4,000.  After that it will depend on how many people are full-time carers and the options people choose in future.  It is important to provide options which will not adversely affect their pension entitlements. It is more a question of ensuring people have an entitlement and are not disadvantaged.  Compared with men, women are disadvantaged under the pension system and we are removing that element of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen asked about the six year provision.  That is the time mentioned in the National Pensions Board's report.  It is to cover the early stage and give the option of staying with children until they reach school going age.  All the other possibilities can be considered in the future.  I agree with Deputy Ó Cuív &mdash; tosach maith leath na hoibre.  I am given to that to some extent.  When there are problems with huge financial implications very often it is by taking out an element and making progress on it that one can prove it is not insurmountable.  I have done that on several occasions and have succeeded in breaking down established ideas and notions based on actuarial studies and so on.  Invariably they turn out to be manageable problems.</P>

      <P>It is important to recognise that this applies to all carers.  The Alzheimers association estimate that there are about 25,000 carers in their association.  There are many other carers to whom it will apply.  The gap will not exist in future and that is important.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa raised the issue of the homeworker as against homemaker. &ldquo;Homemaker&rdquo; is the term used in the report of the National Pensions Board. We can develop that when we come to deal with it further.  Pensions, the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 24 May and the fact that pensions were being studied was raised.  The report is under examination and contains substantial implications.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also suggested that age 66 is under pensionable age and should be removed from the regulations.  We are taking about the pensions legislation and from age 66 down is the age referred to. The averaging is between the time one starts and one reaches 66 years of age. It is for the sake of consistency.  The retrospective element is a separate matter and all these matters can be looked at further.</P>
      <P>I welcome the support for this measure.  Deputies know that I looked for this before the Pensions Board reported.  It was discussed in the House over the years and is something the House wanted.  That is why I was anxious that the Pensions Board would address the issue.</P>

      <P>In his reply to Second Stage the Minister said that the fund must be invested outside the State.  He went on to say: &ldquo;The Deputy referred to property and I want to make it clear that there is no question of these funds being invested in the State, they will be invested outside the State&rdquo;.  Like Deputy Bruton, I have searched through the Bill to see where this is made clear.  In the Bill property means &ldquo;real or personal property of whatever kind (including securities) and <Col N="1180" /> wherever located&rdquo;.  As I understand it, the term &ldquo;wherever located&rdquo; has only one definition.  The Minister seems to be saying that it will be up to the Central Bank to be vigilant on this matter.  I thought it might have related to some provision in section 25 of the Finance Act which teed-up this facility, but there is no provision in that section which excludes investment in the jurisdiction.  I would be obliged if the Minister would again explain this material point.</P>
      <P>This raises another point, that is, the value of an investment vehicle located in the International Financial Services Centre which is totally isolated from the capital markets.  There is no organic relationship there.  The merit of the existence of this vehicle ring-fenced in isolation in the IFSC does not seem to be of any particular moment and it is not something one can get excited about in terms of its economic or tax implications for the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>It appears we will have to rely on the Central Bank to decide whether the very generous tax reliefs we are granting here will be confined to overseas activities.  The Bill does not appear to give a direction to the Central Bank that this is what we want in principle. When a person is refused an application and makes an appeal to the court they will find that there is no provision in the legislation that this partnership should be confined to overseas investments.  The court may say that the Central Bank has adopted an attitude in its regulations which was not set out in the Bill which spawned such a partnership, and the court may take the opposite view.</P>
      <P>I am still not quite clear what this structure of a &ldquo;limited partner&rdquo; means or that of a &ldquo;general partner&rdquo;.  I understood that a &ldquo;limited partner&rdquo; had to be based overseas, although it does not say so in this section.  Are they prospective investors in the funds?  What exactly is this animal, what is it intended it will do and what will define it as being a desirable activity in the eyes of the Central Bank?</P>

      <P>Section 12 provides that it must have a registered office and operate under the aegis of the Central Bank.  Limited partners are shareholders &mdash; the analogy would be a shareholder in a company &mdash; so that the phrase &ldquo;limited partner&rdquo; is equivalent to the phrase &ldquo;shareholder&rdquo;, which is the terminology used in partnership law.  The phrase &ldquo;general partner&rdquo; in the Bill is equivalent to &ldquo;director&rdquo;.  Therefore, instead of having shareholders and directors there are limited and general partners.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, which Deputy Rabbitte mentioned, indicates how the investment will be undertaken.  I take the point about jurisdiction.  The International Financial Services Centre and SFADCo, particularly the IFSC, are ring-fenced from an external point of view in that the companies operating there are not permitted to engage in domestic financial operations.  All of them, whether involved in captive insurance, treasury management, security management and fund management, are required by previous Finance Acts to operate out of the State.  In return for that export-type activity they are awarded a 10 per cent tax rate.  Earlier Finance Acts set up the IFSC as being a 10 per cent tax area with all the companies there operating externally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the last occasion, this Bill is just another item on the menu that the International Financial Services Centre is able to offer international investors, as well as those I just mentioned, captive insurance and so on.  This additional facility is basically one of managing international funds as a business here, there is no other agenda.  These are internationally available funds managed from the IFSC in Dublin and do not cost the taxpayer any money.  While we do not get any money, we receive the fees from managing it and, more importantly, the <Col N="1182" /> 10 per cent corporation profits tax on the profits that flow through the centre.  Of all the corporation profits tax now reaped by the State, well over 10 per cent emanates from this centre which means obviously, it is extremely attractive to those who manage funds internationally to manage them from an office in the IFSC.  We do not have national access to or control over these funds.  The Central Bank has control over the management company and the management company subscribes to the State by way of corporation profits tax and fees for management, in a small but growing way, in terms of jobs in the International Financial Services Centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While not wanting to labour the point I am still confused.  Why is there no requirement that the investments must be overseas?  From all the back-up material my understanding is that that is the intention.  It appears that effectively we are giving the Central Bank the capacity to draw up the rules in relation to a very generous tax concession. Would it not be more sensible for the Bill to set out some of these restrictions so that we would know at the outset the circumstances in which these companies can be established and in which they can obtain the section 25 relief which, I understand, is triggered by the Central Bank acknowledging them?  We need to know that before travelling too far along the road.  I suppose our primary duty is to protect taxpayers and ensure that we are not unwittingly creating a vehicle that could result in abuse of a concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister said but it really does not clarify the matter.  Why is it not expressly stated that investments must be outside the jurisdiction, especially since property is defined in the Bill as &ldquo;wherever located&rdquo;? It seems that subsequently if a lawyer is asked to interpret this Act, in the absence of any express provision stating that the requirement is investment overseas, it must be an open question.  I am curious to know why what the Minister himself <Col N="1183" /> described as a complex and technical Bill does not provide for a very basic requirement. I thought it related to section 25 of the Finance Act.  The relevant subsection of the Finance Act, section 25 (2) states:</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) (a) (i) shall not come into effect until such time as legislation governing the regulation of any class of limited partnerships by the Central Bank of Ireland is enacted and shall come into effect subject to such legislation and on such date as the Minister for Finance shall by order appoint.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the jurisdictional requirement probably relates to previous Finance Acts setting up the International Financial Services Centre but this subsection seems to say that the regulation of this class of partnership is enacted &ldquo;and shall come into effect subject to such legislation&rdquo;.  Therefore, it appears it is subject to this legislation, that this legislation determines the parameters of the investments concerned.  I should like to hear the Minister clarify the position further.</P>
      <P>On the question of limited and general partners, am I correct in understanding that the limited partner is not required to be from overseas, that he could be Irish or domiciled in this jurisdiction, but that the limited partner provides the funds? Are the general partners Irish?  Does the Minister perceive the working of this investment partnership in the form of an international financier flying into Dublin, meeting people in the Shelbourne Hotel who have knowledge of the local scene, when the partnership is effectively set up, in all probability, comprised of somebody from overseas providing the funding, linking up to the local knowledge of domestic persons who again in all probability, would be the general partners but that there is no requirement that the general partners shall be Irish?  Could they, too, be from a different jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the property position, in relation to the investment limited partnerships the law here does not stipulate that they have to be in the International Financial Services Centre <Col N="1184" /> but, if they are not, they would not be subjected to the 10 per cent corporation profits tax rate.  If they want to set up a firm on Grafton Street, say, which is not in the financial services centre they can do so under the provisions of this legislation. It is possible to set up an investment limited partnership outside the financial services centre or outside the Shannon area but there are no tax concessions and there is no benefit to anybody. It is not envisaged that that will happen.  If such partnerships are set up the Central Bank will subject them to much scrutiny under current regulations, because the bank plays a very strong regulatory hands-on role in the whole area of fund management.  I do not envisage many companies taking that route; instead they will go to the International Financial Services Centre.  The Finance Act, 1989, obliges the companies which operate in the financial services centre to invest only in external assets.  That being the case companies who set up in the financial services centre under the provisions of this legislation are subject to the Finance Acts and must manage their funds externally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the limited partnership.  I am advised that under this legislation the limited partner, the shareholder, must be international funds.  The general partner, on the other hand, is the director and as Deputy Rabbitte indicated must be Irish based.  The external funds owned by the limited partners who are the shareholders is foreign money managed by the general partner, the director who is Irish.  The general partners must be Irish and the limited partners, the shareholders, must not be Irish; that is the relationship we want to establish in the legislation.  To manage non-Irish funds we wish to establish Irish limited partnerships in the centre and in the Shannon area under the management of an Irish general partner who will be the director.  There is no cost to the State and no great risk involved.  This is another item on the menu we can offer in the business of fund management for which we are beginning to build a reputation.  I will have to find the exact reference in <Col N="1185" /> the Finance Act, 1989, for the Deputy, as I know he wants it confirmed that companies cannot invest in property in the State.  All the companies in the financial services centre are managing funds overseas.  Therefore, the legislation that deals with that area will also deal with this fund management exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says that the Finance Act, 1989, governs this, I am prepared to accept it but I presume we will see the reference before the day is out.  In respect of the Minister's remarks just now that limited investment partnerships are confined to the IFSC or to Shannon he entered the caveat that they are not necessarily so confined and they can function in the economy outside subject to the normal tax regime and so on.  Referring to the collective investment industry the Minister said on Second Stage that:</P>
      <P>The industry does not primarily rely on the existence of the 10 per cent tax rate and requires minimal use of double taxation treaties.</P>
      <P>If that is the case why would they want to go to the IFSC?  In a later part of his Second Stage contribution the Minister pointed to the fact that this legislation is also a reform of the 1907 Limited Partnership Act.  He referred specifically to:</P>
      <P>Doubt over the precise extent of the liability of the limited partners in the event of a withdrawal of capital and the possibility that creditors could levy execution against limited partners for debts of the firm, notwithstanding the limit on their liability.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is theoretical but if investment limited partnerships were established outside of the area ring fenced, would the same vulnerability in the 1907 Act not apply?  No change is proposed here to guarantee the precise extent of liability on partners in the event of withdrawal of capital and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to clarify exactly what triggers the tax concessions. My understanding is that the tax concessions <Col N="1186" /> involved here are not primarily the 10 per cent relief.  They are concessions on complete exemption from any tax on the investment income of the fund, from any stamp duties, from VAT on certain operations, from interest on capital gains tax and capital duty of 1 per cent on a limited partnership.  My understanding is that simply locating in Shannon does not trigger all those concessions. These are extra concessions.</P>
      <P>The Minister ought to refer to the sections of the Finance Acts which set out the precise conditions which trigger these concessions.  Otherwise we are shovelling it off to the Central Bank and acting on faith that these concessions will be granted solely to activities that are net worthwhile gains for the Irish economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating again the concept of how companies operate in the financial services centre.  Approximately 200 companies subject to the legislation are set up in the financial services centre, employing approximately 2,000 people.  The investment limited partnership company will be subject to the same rules and regulations as all the other companies there.  The rules are not being changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules are not being changed.  Companies such as a captive insurance company, bond management or treasury management agencies are all governed by rules and regulations laid down by the Minister for Finance in the Financial Services Centre Act and in the Finance Acts going back over the last couple of years.  The rules are clear.  This model will have to adhere to the same rules; this Bill will allow such a fund to be managed from the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the figure of 10 per cent which I mentioned.  We like to say &mdash; we probably picked this up from the IDA's marketing blurb &mdash; that companies do not come here to avail of the tax breaks, rather that they come because we have a skilled and well educated <Col N="1187" /> workforce, because we have a particular skill in fund management and trained executives and because they would be close to colleagues in the same centre.  Obviously they come to avail of the tax breaks; the IDA promotes these but does not focus on them exclusively. One of the reasons for this is that the European Union constantly monitors us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have those details.  All the companies located in the centre avail of the same tax breaks.  It is my understanding that because it is an external fund, investment income is not taxable here.  In other words, if a company invests billions of pounds internationally any investment income goes into the fund and is not taxable in this jurisdiction.  It may however be taxable in the country in which the investment is made.</P>

These fees are substantial.  It is my understanding that corporation profits tax is charged on this income.  That matter is being checked.</P>
      <P>In presenting this Bill we did not set out to have a debate on the tax incentives currently on offer at the financial services centre and their effectiveness.  We are certain of one thing: this will be another model and it will be subject to the same financial controls in terms of taxes payable, including stamp duty and VAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The working group recommended &mdash; I have seen its recommendations &mdash; that this limited partnership arrangement would apply in general but went on to state that it expected the Bill when enacted to be utilised primarily by non-Irish investors using the structure for collective fund managements thus creating employment in the financial services centre.  That appears to be in conflict with what the Minister of State said.  While he indicated that they could set up on Grafton Street he seemed to imply that they would still have to be foreign investors.  The original recommendation seemed to envisage the involvement of Irish investors in limited partnerships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working group indicated that legislative changes would be necessary to provide the tax regime complementary to <Col N="1189" /> that in existence for collective investment undertakings and listed the exemptions granted under the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975; under section 206 of the Finance Act, 1992 in respect of stamp duty; section 67 of the Finance Act, 1973 and the VAT Act, 1972.  I do not know where the exemptions are set out either in this Bill or in the Finance Act and how they are restricted to certain activities, overseas investments managed by an Irish firm.  Perhaps we are trying to clarify a matter which should be blindingly obvious but when I looked at these recommendations I thought section 25 would contain a complementary set of tax exemptions and would indicate precisely how they would be restricted to these investments.  I do not see these in either legislation and that is the reason we may appear to be making a bit of a meal out of this at this stage.  There is a need for clarity so that we will know what it is we are creating.</P>

      <P>The question has been asked as to which tax exemptions are triggered by participation in this kind of investment vehicle.  On the last occasion <Col N="1190" /> I referred to the Paircéir report.  As he will recall, unusually and untypically, the Minister of State said that he was only giving expression in legislation to the proposals of the working party which was chaired, presumably, by Mr. Séamus Paircéir.  Unlike me, Deputy Bruton through his typical industry has had access to its report.  Perhaps it is a comment on how seriously we take legislation and the role of the Opposition that when I asked to see it on the last occasion the Minister of State said he would see if this would be possible but in the nature of things it is convenient to forget this and enact legislation in the hope that no one will remember to raise the matter again.</P>
      <P>The general view was, following the infamous &ldquo;step aside&rdquo; period in Irish politics that Mr. Paircéir had stepped aside and it will be news to all but those in the inner circles of the financial community that he is back in whatever capacity and so influential are his views on this subject that we have found it necessary to give them expression in legislation.  I am sure this is wise and I am not questioning the inherent sagacity of Mr. Paircéir's recommendations but it appears from what Deputy Bruton said that there are tax advantages above and beyond the usual tax advantages afforded to other companies within the IFSC.  Is it the case that some companies are afforded advantages in respect of capital gains tax, VAT, stamp duty and so on over and above those normally afforded to companies located in the IFSC?</P>

Are additional tax advantages afforded to this type of partnership which are not afforded to other companies or have all the Paircéir proposals not been taken on board?  Regardless of which is the case, this area of the financial sector is not famous for its transparency.  If it has been found unnecessary to implement some of the Paircéir proposals, so be it.  I accept the Minister may be demonstrating some wariness because the matter has evolved into a wider area of discussion, but when the matter is transferrd to the Central Bank this House will not have a mechanism to pursue this question.  It is one of the few occasions when we have an opportunity to ventilate this type of question.</P>

      <P>In regard to the withdrawal of capital to which Deputy Bruton referred, section 20 provides for the return of capital to a limited partner &mdash; in effect to the shareholder &mdash; out of the investment limited partnership in the case of a dissolution of the partnership. The section provides that such money can be returned only if the general partner &mdash; the directors &mdash; is able to pay its debts after the return is made.  In other words, the return can be made only to the extent that the debts of the directors, the management company, are met in full. Section 20 provides for the return of capital to the limited partner &mdash; the shareholder &mdash; in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to a catastrophe such as insolvency.  From the point of view of the Irish authorities, as the funds are externally owned the limited partners are liable to the extent to which they have invested.

      <P>Section 8 spells out some of the benefits, namely, the Central Bank can collect fees from those companies when authorised.  What is the proposed fee?  How will it vary according to different scales of investment management companies?  How will the proceeds of such fees be applied?  Will they generate net income over and above the cost of regulating such companies, will that be returned to the Exchequer and will it be a significant benefit?  Under section 8 the Central Bank has the ability <Col N="1196" /> to refuse to authorise an investment limited partnership on the grounds that it is undesirable.  What constitutes &ldquo;undesirability&rdquo; in this context?  Do we know what we are asking the Central Bank to do in this respect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection provides that the Central Bank can refuse authorisation where the company name is found undesirable.  This is an important provision as it gives authority to the Central Bank to refuse certification where it considers the name used may be misleading or could lead investors or others involved in the financial services industry to believe an investment partnership was something it was not.  Applicants are given the right to appeal to the court against the decision of the Central Bank and it can refuse the application if it is concerned it is not strong enough for financial reasons.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to investment income, corporation tax and stamp duty.  The fund does not pay tax but those who gain from it pay tax in their jurisdiction.  International partners will, presumably, be liable for tax in the jurisdiction in which they reside.  The fund is not liable for corporation tax on its investment income and, therefore, it is worth looking at the sums involved because the corporation tax on fees appears to be substantial. Regarding corporation tax, companies in the centre engaging in relevant trading operations, as defined by the Act, pay 10 per cent corporation tax.  All those companies are exempt from capital duties, that is stamp duties.  That is the up-to-date information on the pluses and minuses of the tax regime in the financial centre and I will come back to this if I get more data.</P>

      <P>The section permits the bank to exempt an investment limited partnership from the provision of Statutory Instrument 396 of 1993.  This regulation implements Council Directive 96 05 EC.  It extends the scope of the 1986 Act implementing the Fourth Directive on the 1992 group accounts regulations to certain types of unlimited companies and partnerships.  There is an obligation under the European Communities regulations to implement Statutory Instrument 396.  In exercising supervision and application mechanisms the Central Bank is permitted to determine to what extent it should apply by using the statutory instruments.  There is a difference with regard to the definition in subsection (1) where the sole business of the investment limited partnership is the investment of its funds and property.  The reason for the difference in the wording is that the definition used in this subsection is taken from the underlying Directive whereas that in section 5 (1) (a) is that agreed between the Central Bank and the financial services industry.</P>

      <P>The word being suggested to me is &ldquo;prudential&rdquo;.  It is to ensure that the general partner is allowed to certify that the investment company will be able to pay its debts in full before any payment can be made back to the limited partner, whom I have likened to a shareholder.  The time involved is four months subsequent to payment.  If the <Col N="1201" /> Deputy is asking if that applies to limited liability, there is no parallel as limited liability is a different mechanism where one is liable to the extent of one's unpaid-up share capital.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides that if the partnership fails within four months of a return of a contribution to a limited partner it must be repaid with interest.  There is a saving for the limited partner in that the return takes place to discharge a liability incurred during the period in which it represented an asset of the investment limited partnership.  The interest rate would be determined by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 16, after line 51, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A custodian who fails to comply with subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall indemnify any person who thereby suffers loss.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a substantive one. The section outlines the responsibility of the custodians.  However, it is not exhaustive in that section 27 requires a custodian to supply information to the Central Bank as requested.  Subsection (1) outlines six specific requirements that the custodian has to meet.  It will be recalled that in section 8 (1) no single person may be both a general partner and a custodian.  An item to note in subsection (1) (d), for example, is that the custodian is obligated to report to the limited partners each year on the conduct of the general partner in respect of the management of the investment limited partnership. This report will be contained in the annual report.  Subsection (1) (f) is a general provision for use by the Central Bank as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> Subsection (2) caters not only for the custodian but for the general partner and the auditor.  It provides that an indemnity cannot be given where default, negligence etc., arises.  This amendment is to create an offence and provide for a penalty.  A custodian who fails to comply with subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall indemnify any person who thereby suffers loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister what kind of human we are referring to here?  Initially I thought &ldquo;custodian&rdquo; and &ldquo;general partner&rdquo; were the same but it appears they are not.  The definition section states: &ldquo;custodian means a person maintaining a place of business in the State, appointed pursuant to the partnership agreement and discharging its functions in accordance with section 5 (1) (c) hereof&rdquo;.  It is clear that this is the person in whom the assets of the investment limited partnership shall be entrusted for safekeeping.  This causes me to smile because &ldquo;custodian&rdquo; is used more in the area of family law and social legislation, or perhaps in the administration of prisons.</P>
      <P>Are we talking about a bank or a person with an appropriate professional qualification?  Who would discharge this person's fees for the performance of his duties while he is holding the money in safekeeping?  I do not know what mechanism is open to the House at the end of a year's operation of the investment limited partnership.  I would be very interested to see the net advantage to the State at the end of this procedure.  We seem to have clarified the tax advantages involved and so on, but I would imagine that the custodian would take his share of the action too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The limited partner is the person who provides the money, the general partner tells him how the Dublin scene functions and how to get around different matters but he has no money invested and the investment is vested in the custodian who must report to the Central Bank on the operation and performance of the investment <Col N="1203" /> partnership.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like clarification on the role of these people.  It seems the Minister is providing in this amendment for a custodian who is guilty of an offence and is exposed to losses suffered by people from his failure to comply with the regulations.  How does that tally with the notion that it is the general partner who is personally liable? If the custodian fails to pick up on an activity of the general partner and report it, is it the case that the custodian becomes the person exposed?</P>
      <P>Who would the custodians be?  Would they be accountancy companies?  Can the custodian and the general partner be one and the same person or can the custodian and the auditor be one and the same person?  Will there be many persons engaged in the supervision of this practice? Under the Minister's amendment would the custodian become exposed to liability?  Custodians are primarily Irish based and if the custodian fails to ensure certain matters about the activities of an overseas investment he would become liable to substantial suits.  Is the Minister satisfied that custodians, who will be Irish based, are not being asked to take on excessive liability?</P>

There are three separate units required in an investment limited partnership: a limited partner who is a shareholder, a general partner which is the management company and a custodian who is the trustee.  &ldquo;Trustee&rdquo; would probably be a better word, but in line with international legislation we are using the word &ldquo;custodian&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under my amendment the trustee would be liable for not fulfilling his statutory obligations which are laid down in section 5 (1) and section 24.  The trustee could be a bank, an accountancy firm or any financial firm approved by the Central Bank and its job is to hold the owner's funds in trust.  Deputies will be familiar with the trustee principle where the trustee does not own the money, and sometimes does not even manage it; the trustees holds the money in trust.  In this case it is in custody and is not subject to strict trustee legislation.  That is the role of the custodian and if they do not comply with section 24 (1) (a) to (g) they are liable for failing to fulfil their statutory obligations.  If there is any loss arising from their failure to meet these requirements they must indemnify the person with whom they are dealing.  It is not so much a loss of funds but a failure to meet these obligations.</P>
      <P>The reason the third element is necessary is to ensure that a person is operating in the State who can answer for the bigger fund which is owned externally, to ensure a closer relationship between the Central Bank and the trustees.  It is someone with whom the Central Bank could deal on a day to day basis.  Three units are required in a partnership and they must be three different people or companies &mdash; the custodian could certainly be a company, probably a bank.  We want to balance the powers between the three, the manager or person with the income, the owner of the fund or limited partnership and the trustee who would legally hold the money and report to the Central Bank on the operation.  Fines of up to £500,000 are proposed plus a daily default fine and an indemnity.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister's amendment an afterthought dreamt up since we last discussed this matter and would it expose the custodian to a very large liability for failing to ensure that the partnership income is applied in accordance with the regulations?  If the general partner disappears with a bag of money would the custodian be left holding the baby?  No doubt someone who defrauds the partnership would have failed in some of their obligations under section 24.  Are we asking the Irish based custodian to take on a very substantial liability; is that reasonable or is it essential to the concept?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We need more clarification. Would a bank take on this responsibility?  Is the Minister saying that the duty imposed on the custodian under the terms of this Bill is purely procedural and that the task of the custodian is to ensure that the procedure detailed in section 24 is complied with?  The kind of person we are talking about is an international property developer who decides for whatever reason that he wishes to locate one of his investment vehicles at the International Financial Services Centre.  He will do that in order to conduct his property business in Tokyo, Hong Kong or New York &mdash; presumably he will be subject to the law of the jurisdiction concerned &mdash; in a tax effective way and the advantage for him is that the management of the investment by the company located in the International Financial Services Centre is at optimum tax effective rates.  However, should he team up with somebody who is Irish and who is called a general partner, he will be deemed to have effectively a management company, that is, if I understand the Minister correctly.  In other words if we call the limited investment partnership a company, all of the shares are held by the limited partner, the general partner is the management company to whom would accrue fees and so on for administering the company but the custodian is a trustee effectively.  Is that what the Minister is saying?  If the general partner is Irish and must be Irish why can the <Col N="1206" /> Central Bank not deal with him?  I am not sure what is the role of the custodian. Is the Minister saying that property developers &mdash; there are other words to describe some of them &mdash; being what they are and with the expectations in regard to property rates in Hong Kong after 1997, the custodian could not be liable for accidents that take place in the market-place but yet seems to be the person who must indemnify any personal loss incurred?  The Minister must have some ideas: is it proposed that an Irish bank should take on this role presumably for a slice of the action, or is it the auditor who makes a report to the Central Bank annually who fills this role?  I am not clear on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked if the penalty clause was an afterthought, the answer is yes and that is why I have tabled an amendment at this stage.  There is no point in having requirements that the custodian must meet if there is no penalty clause to ensure that the requirements are met.  Although it is an afterthought, it is important that we have caught up with it.</P>
      <P>The best way to describe a custodian is one who is somewhere between a trustee and a watchdog.  There are seven requirements laid down for the custodian, for example under section 24 (1) (c) the custodian must:</P>
      <P>ensure that an investment limited partnership's income is applied in accordance with this Act or regulations made hereunder, directions of the Bank or the partnership agreement;</P>
      <P>Under paragraph (f), the custodian must:</P>
      <P>ensure that contributions and withdrawals of contributions of partners' capital are effected in accordance with the partnership agreement and the Act;</P>
      <P>The space between the custodian and the limited partner would usually be filled by a partnership agreement and between the three units one will find strong written legal agreement as to precisely who does what.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> I see the custodian as a watchdog whose job is to ensure that the instructions of the general partner, that is the directors, are carried out unless they conflict with the Act as well as ensuring that the shareholders' money is applied in accordance with the Act or with the regulations made by the bank or under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asks a very sensible question. If one was starting with a clean sheet in these types of models one could make the argument that there is no need for a custodian, that one could control the limited partnership and the Central Bank could supervise both the limited partnership and the general partnership but experience has thrown up the requirement to have a third unit to act as a watchdog, as a trustee to be based here, to be responsible for ensuring that both the limited and the general partners comply with the legislation and that the fund is managed as it is meant to be managed.  This will apply to each fund. In theory the Central Bank could do it directly but in practice if there was a large number of funds having a trustee based here who is legally responsible for the administration of the fund makes it easier for the Central Bank to control the entire operation.</P>
    <P>I take the Deputy's point that one could argue that a custodian is not necessary, in the same way that one could argue that a trustee is not necessary in a club, that the treasurer or the committee could do the work &mdash; I know some clubs do not have trustees but most sensible clubs have them.  One could argue that on the basis of day-to-day management one does not need them but their function is to be somewhat independent as they watch what is going on and to hold the asset for the owners without themselves being the owner.</P>

      <P>They know how it operates internationally and they know that these types of duties are imposed on them.  The Deputy asked whether they know about this specific penalty but to my knowledge we have not had formal applications to the Central Bank yet so they may not be aware of what is proposed in regard to the specific penalty. Internationally they are used to penalties and to the concept of custodians so they would expect this and certainly as soon as they apply they will obviously receive a copy of these conditions.  If they are unable to meet them they will not be authorised by the Central Bank.  I do not envisage them having any difficulties with this.  It is fairly standard practice to have this type of trustee/watchdog structure based in our jurisdiction responsible for ensuring that the regulations are adhered to.</P>

The Bill is being rushed through the House because of the recess, we wanted to get this up and running so that it can be marketed during the summer.  On the typographical errors, I can only leave that to the Deputy to speculate upon.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is opportune, with all our ambassadors in Orlando, that we would have this vehicle for them to sell there.  As we are coming to the end of the debate I wish to raise a number of points in an omnibus fashion as we may not reach the sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 30, the Central Bank is being given a role in replacing general partners and custodians in these companies if they prove incompetent.  I am wondering whether the Central Bank, as a regulator, should have a role in trying <Col N="1210" /> to influence the success of these partnerships. That would seem to be going ahead of what a normal regulator would do in this area.  If the bank wants to claim immunity, as it seems to be doing under section 30, and if it replaces a general partner or a custodian, it is taking on a substantive role in the operation of the company and cannot simply walk away from its liability.  Will the Minister clarify that?</P>
    <P>On section 40, a fine of £500,000 seems small compared to the scale of the investments that are being managed by these partnerships.  Is the Minister satisfied that compared to other countries running these vehicles, we have sufficient penalties for fraudulent use of this vehicle or whatever else might happen?</P>
    <P>Under section 44, we will have a report from the Central Bank annually.  I hope the Minister will consider an amendment suggesting that the Central Bank would not report simply on administrative matters but also on the benefits or otherwise of our continuing to operate this sort of scheme, whether it is creating jobs, securing linkages in the economy, whether there is synergy, which seems to be the buzz word in the financial services centre as a result of its activity and whether it is generating free income and tax revenue for us.  We would like to know a year from now whether this was a good day's work rather than simply knowing what the Central Bank was doing from day to day regulating it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather these fines are an increase on those in existing legislation for this type of offence, following discussions with the Central Bank.  There is provision for a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or a fine.  I take the Deputy's point about the amount of the fine but it is the largest fine to date in such legislation so it must be regarded as progress.  The imprisonment option, rather than the fine, will hopefully frighten people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 44, the Central Bank will furnish an annual report to the Minister on specified matters and the Minister will lay the report before the House.  Our <Col N="1211" /> amendment to section 44, which we have not yet reached, insists that it be a more general report that is presented to the House on the operation of the scheme. The Deputy is quite right; we backed off from being specific and asked for a more general report which I hope will result in a more qualitative judgment on the part of the Central Bank in regard to how the scheme operates.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's goodwill in the matter, I do not believe his amendment to section 44 deals with the point raised.  As I understand it, the Central Bank is only required to report to the Minister on how the Bill is operating.  There will be no qualitative assessment of the merits of the investment partnership vehicle.  I can foresee a situation where it will not be possible for Members of this House to find out how it is functioning.  We will <Col N="1212" /> get the usual reply that confidentiality obtains and that it is not possible to evaluate what economic merit, if any, derives from this type of instrument.  It is all very well to have a number of additional plates in the International Financial Services Centre but whether it means anything in actual direct staffing is dubious.  It will obviously result in some additional work for professional bodies in the city but I suspect that the corporation profits tax contribution in terms of fees will be minimal.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 4, 8, 28 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>Last April the Government considered the survival plan for Irish Steel Ltd. and approved the opening of negotiations between management and unions to achieve the levels of cost reductions and efficiencies needed to enable the company to continue in business as a viable commercial entity.  This plan was prepared by the then chairman of the company, Mr. Diarmuid Quirke, and identified minimum net savings of £8.4 million per annum.  This is the plan which the new executive chairman is negotiating with the unions and the cost savings identified in it are in those areas identified in the Simpson Xavier report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> Savings must reach at least £8.4 million net per annum as a basic minimum and there is no room for compromise or fudge on that.  Indeed, with losses at Irish Steel continuing to average in excess of £1 million a month it is clear that the company will have to find further ways of reducing costs and making economies to bridge the gap between the planned net annual savings figure of £8.4 million and annual losses of over £12 million.  Ways of achieving these additional savings are being examined by the Irish Steel board and will not require a further contribution by the workers at the plant.</P>
    <P>Unless agreement is reached by tomorrow on the cost savings package there can be no question of further Government investment in Irish Steel.  Without cost savings of at least £8.4 million net and further State investment there is no future for the company.  Closure, regrettably, is the only alternative.  I have repeatedly made that clear.  I have also made clear the implications of closure.  It is the immediate loss of 560 jobs.  Further job losses in other local industries which supply goods and services to Irish Steel would also be inevitable.  Admittedly job losses are envisaged under the cost savings plan but there is a big difference between the 151 redundancies in the plan and the 560 redundancies which closure of the plant would entail.</P>
    <P>The European steel market continues to be extremely difficult and while recent events in Brussels suggest that the European Commission's restructuring plan for the industry, which involves capacity cutbacks of at least 19 million tonnes in hot rolled products and 70,000 or more job losses, is back on track it is still too early to say whether it will be successful.  An improvement in steel prices would be expected to follow its successful implementation and this would, of course, benefit Irish Steel.  However, given the company's scale of losses an improvement in steel prices would not, in itself, be sufficient to eliminate the cash haemorrhage and achieve commercial operation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in regard to the European <Col N="1216" /> Commission the regime on State aid operated by it for the steel industry means it would be necessary to secure the unanimous approval of all the other member states to any further State investment in Irish Steel.  An important aspect to getting this approval would be to show that Irish Steel can function as a viable commercial entity in the market-place. Irish Steel as it stands is not viable and cannot hope to be unless the £8.4 million net cost savings are agreed and implemented in full as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The 30 June deadline set by the Government for the conclusion of negotiations with unions is upon us.  Even at this eleventh hour I appeal to all concerned, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, to use what little time remains to reach agreement on the cost reductions plan.  The scale of the company's losses does not allow the deadline to be extended or a smaller cost reduction package to be agreed.  Should the Irish Steel board report to me on 30 June that the management and workforce have not been able to achieve agreement on the cost reductions plan, I will regrettably have no option but to recommend closure of the plant to Government. That, unfortunately, is the harsh reality facing us all.</P>

      <P>Why is the Minister so adamant about the deadline of 30 June if both sides are meeting with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission?  Is it not foolhardy to set such deadlines? Will he agree that if everyone adopts the approach of waiting to see who blinks there will be a disaster?  Echoing what members of the clergy and the Cork community are saying, will the Minister allow time to settle this in a way which would save the company?</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern. It is not an arbitrary timetable.  The company is losing money as we speak. The timetable was set out in April following the Simpson Xavier report which was produced after Christmas following previous discussions and negotiations. Postponing the deadline will not change <Col N="1217" /> the figures.  There is little more to be discovered but if something is found of course any reasonable and sane person would be open to considering it.  Postponing the deadline from 30 June to 5 July will make no difference to the need to find savings of £8.4 million.</P>

      <P>As we speak, negotiations are underway and I am very conscious of not making any comment which might prejudice their outcome &mdash; the matter is much too serious.  Has the Minister received any indication as to the way the negotiations are proceeding and whether any agreement has been reached?  If he was assured by the chairperson that the negotiations could be successfully concluded, would he reconsider his decision and allow an extension of time so that the negotiations could be completed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's comments, and I want to thank all Deputies in the House for their co-operation in this very difficult and sensitive matter.  We are talking about the future of 560 jobs in a company which is the lifeblood of a community in Cobh.  I understand that progress is being made at the negotiations.  The net points of the negotiations are well known to everybody at this stage.  As I speak, there are 36 hours remaining for the negotiations and I hope that these points and any additional information which may have been outlined in SIPTU's confidential consultants' report will be of assistance in arriving at savings of £8.4 million.  I have no prescription as to how the savings of £8.4 million can be made but I am reliably informed that this is the net saving required.  If agreement can be reached by 30 June so much the better, but if the chairman says an extra few hours will ensure that the negotiations can be completed successfully then, of course, I will be reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To respond honestly and frankly to Deputy Quill's question, I would not like it to be taken that the negotiations can be let run on indefinitely.  The Government and I &mdash; and other Ministers have had responsibility for Irish Steel from time to <Col N="1218" /> time &mdash; want to see a satisfactory solution and if a little more time will produce this, of course I will respond positively.  In saying this I want to make it clear that the deadline by which they must report is 30 June, at which stage I will review the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given his indication that once he knows the position he may be flexible and extend the deadline of 30 June, how does the Minister propose to deal with any legislation necessary for investment in Irish Steel if the Dáil is not in session?  Does he propose to introduce legislation which would give him the capacity to deal with this issue?  An extra half an hour or hour may not be sufficient to solve all the issues.  Will the Minister make extra time available if discussions are proving fruitful?  If he imposes the deadline there will be a loss of 560 jobs on Friday and a receiver will be appointed on Monday.  Those are the stark and tragic consequences of inflexibility.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the points made by the Deputy and I know Deputies on all sides of the House would not want me to make a comment which might prejudice the outcome of what I understand are fairly productive negotiations. That said, I believe a restructured Irish Steel can be a viable commercial entity and I will do everything possible to ensure that this is the case.  The company is losing money on a monthly basis but at least the unions and management are talking to each other in a constructive and calm manner with a desired and shared objective.  This lesson might usefully be transported north of Cork.</P>

If subsequent legislation is needed to enlarge the plan this can be done in due course.  There is no legislative impediment to the implementation of the survival plan.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Quill's desire that Irish Steel should be put on a sound viable footing.  All State companies can and must be sound, commercial and innovative. The state-owned Renault car corporation in France is the sort of model to which we could usefully look in this regard.  There is an additional factor to which we should have regard, that is, after Spain we have the highest level of unemployment in the European Union. The maximum number of jobs possible should be retained in the plant.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 48, 50 and 53 together.  On 20 May I met representatives of the Irish banking community to initiate a process of closer co-operation between the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the main providers of finance to business enterprises.  Among the issues discussed at this meeting was the operation of loan guarantee schemes such as those operating in the USA which benefit small US business.  While this issue is being further considered by officials in my Department I have no plans to provide State guarantees to banks lending to Irish businesses.  The question of a possible role for a third banking force in the context of such a scheme was not discussed.</P>
      <P>At this meeting I also indicated the concerns expressed to me by the business community regarding the difficulties which small business operations can experience in accessing funding for their activities.  Since my meeting with the banks, Ulster Bank launched, on 17 June, a scheme of long term loans &mdash; up to 20 years &mdash; for small businesses where borrowers are not required to commit the family home as security for such loans. This is a scheme which addresses a number of the particular financing needs of Irish SMEs and as such it is a very welcome initiative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree <Col N="1221" /> that the Government is sending out conflicting signals about its approach to banking?  Is it not true to say that the Minister, the Taoiseach and his Minister of State have been highly critical of the banks' decision to impose excessive mark-ups on their lending to small business with too great a spread and to impose excessive charges?  Will he agree that it is inconsistent with that stand to talk now about the taxpayer picking up the risk on loans which the banking system incurs on small business?  Will he agree that it is not consistent to say that the taxpayer should carry the can for failed entities and, in the same breath, criticise the banks for excessive markups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the use of the word &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; which the Deputy used.  It has been reported to us &mdash; I am sure Deputy Bruton, the main Opposition party spokesperson, has heard similar reports &mdash; that small and medium sized Irish businesses in particular are very dissatisfied with the collective relationship they have with the banks. The small business task force pinpointed this issue in a very substantial way.  As a Government we have rightly brought it to the attention of the banks in a number of different ways.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, has met the banks within the context of the Consumer Credit Bill, 1994.  I would have to say that the response of the banks has been quite positive in that they have responded in a competitive sense to the guaranteed £100 million loan fund introduced on foot of the budget by introducing not dissimilar schemes themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have just given the House an indication of another such response in my reply, that being the scheme launched by the Ulster Bank.  In the context of the meeting I had with them, when I asked why it was they were seeking such security from small businesses, they indicated a number of reasons, including the relatively high failure rate.  They went on to say that in some states in the United States &mdash; New Hampshire being the one mentioned specifically &mdash; there was a loan <Col N="1222" /> guarantee scheme in which the state authorities had participated.  I indicated that we would be interested in looking at the details of that scheme, without any commitment. If we can ensure more business start-ups and more business survivals with the use of taxpayers' money does it really matter whether we give it in the form of a grant or a loan guarantee provided that the ultimate objective is to ensure the consolidation and development of Irish businesses leading to increased employment?  The evidence of my tenure in office and that of this Government to date is that we will not be reckless with taxpayers' money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the import of what the Taoiseach was saying was that a reduction in the spread, with the costs carried by the banks, was what was needed?  Would he agree that what seems to be the outcome, namely, that the taxpayer will have to pick up the risk on loans to small business and not the banks, is totally at variance with what the Taoiseach and other Ministers indicated in the course of an election campaign? Would he agree that there is something cynical about the approach of Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think both can be pursued simultaneously, that we can look for a reduction in the spread.  People will argue, as the Deputy's party leader argued consistently, that the cost margins and the portion the Irish banks, particularly the four main banks, have taken is way in excess of comparable European banks.  People can argue &mdash; and I would share the view &mdash; that that cost spread should be reduced and that the overall general cost of money, if one looks at the real rate of interest as against the rate of inflation, should be reduced.  In the case of small and medium-sized businesses which, chronically, have difficult access to working capital or to start-up capital, according to themselves, as the Government is clearly committed to promoting such businesses, provided we are satisfied with the details the banks furnish, which <Col N="1223" /> is where we are at present, the use of taxpayers' money in that way, if it achieves a positive result, is totally consistent with the usage of such money to give grants to businesses to start up in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Section 38 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, enables the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to request the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court or another person or body to inquire into a dispute of special importance and furnish him with a report.  The enactment of section 38 (1) and 38 (2) was intended to put the practice of referral of disputes by the Minister to the dispute settling agencies on a clear legislative footing.  Prior to the enactment of these provisions, section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, which was designed to enable the Minister to request a report from the Labour Court on the employment conditions of any class of workers, had been used when the Minister wished to refer a dispute to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Minister should have legislative power to refer disputes <Col N="1224" /> of special importance, or disputes which affect the public interest, to the commission or the court and, taken together, sections 38 (1) and 38 (2) provide considerable flexibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>As was the intention at the time legislation was enacted, this section is rarely invoked and then only in exceptional circumstances. In fact, the first ever referral under this section was recently made by me in the case of the dispute at TEAM Aer Lingus, when I requested the Labour Relations Commission to conduct an inquiry into the dispute and furnish me with a report.  The exceptional circumstances which necessitated the section 38 (2) referral in this case are well known and have been discussed already at length on a number of occasions in this House.  While the Labour Relations Commission was unable to report that the dispute had been settled, as I had hoped at the time of the referral, a comprehensive report containing settlement proposals was furnished to me in accordance with the provisions of section 38 (2).</P>
    <P>As section 38 (2) has been used on one occasion only since its enactment it is not possible to make any definitive judgment on its operation yet.  However, the fact that there has been only one section 38 referral since the legislation was enacted in July, 1990, clearly shows that it is used only in exceptional circumstances, as intended.  With regard to the section 38 (2)  referral in the case of the dispute at TEAM Aer Lingus, I am satisfied that I took the correct course of action, having regard to the circumstances.  I am also satisfied that the Labour Relations Commission carried out its functions correctly in accordance with section 38 (2) in furnishing a comprehensive report on the dispute, the circumstances in which it had arisen and also providing settlement proposals.</P>
    <P>In so far as the TEAM Aer Lingus dispute is concerned, the industrial relations process has been fully utilised at this stage.  Both parties have received the settlement terms drawn up by the commission; they have been accepted by the company and, in view of the serious situation facing the company and the <Col N="1225" /> need for urgent action to resolve the financial crisis, I would again urge the unions and the workforce to accept these settlement terms as the only means of overcoming the immediate problems which confront TEAM Aer Lingus at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is nothing in section 38 (2) to indicate that the report on the work of the Labour Relations Commission would become a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; final settlement with no further negotiation? Would he agree that the Government never indicated that it would treat a report in that fashion?  Furthermore, would he agree that he has undermined the future use of this section and the faith people might have in it by so treating it on this occasion?  In respect of the present crisis in TEAM Aer Lingus, would he agree to the Fine Gael motion to seek just three days to allow the huge level of misunderstanding out there to be dispelled and secure an agreement that can provide a future for TEAM Aer Lingus?</P>

      <P>My reference to section 38 (2), following the sequence of events, was a correct usage of the section.  The manner in which the Labour Relations Commission went about its business was correct.  The settlement terms, or proposals &mdash; two different terms have been used &mdash; which they drew up in view of the failure of both sides to negotiate such a set of proposals themselves, constituted a constructive contribution. Indeed, as has been said here by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, and others, it is for the unions to accept those terms.  They can sit down on that basis. Within the framework of those terms there is a mechanism for elaboration and <Col N="1226" /> all the other matters to which Deputy Richard Bruton referred.  As you have indicated, Sir, this matter will be the subject of a continuous debate later today.</P>

      <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, provides that the Minister for Justice shall have absolute discretion to grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation, although the statutory conditions are not wholly satisfied, where an applicant has Irish associations.  Applications may be considered within this provision where the Minister for Justice is satisfied, on the advice of a Minister of the Government, that the applicant has invested a substantial sum in the State in a viable business with job-creating potential.  Other than providing advice in the latter context, my Department has no function &mdash; in particular no statutory function &mdash; in regard to the consideration of applications for naturalisation.  The question as to whether a particular application meets the requirements of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  As the Deputy, no doubt, will be aware the so-called business migration scheme is at present under review and any changes in the present arrangements will be announced in due course.</P>

      <P>I am puzzled by the Minister's reply.  I know you will not permit quotations at Question Time but a document circulated by the Minister's <Col N="1227" /> Department highlights unease within it about the operation of the business migration scheme and that is referred to in the Minister's reply.  Is the Minister satisfied with the operation of the business migration scheme as revealed recently in the case of the family business of the Taoiseach?  Is he satisfied about the distinction drawn between an investment and a soft loan and about the extent of transparency?  Is he satisfied with the residency qualification and the duration of the investment?  All these matters were referred to in the document from his Department.  Does he stand over that document and will he make recommendations on the lines contained in it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a number of supplementaries, all of which I will attempt to address.  My Department has a specific function when requested by the Department of Justice &mdash; and only when requested by the Department of Justice &mdash; to advise on the economics of a particular application for naturalisation for the business migration type passport. The sole question, usually seeking the advice of the former IDA, now IDA Ireland or Forbairt, is to advise on the economic viability or suitability of the proposed investment.  I am satisfied that we have the ability and the capability to provide adequate and objective advice in that respect.  With regard to recent events I would simply say, without prejudice, that the Government is setting up a review of the process with a view to examining what changes in the present arrangements can be effected to address some of the concerns expressed.  I cannot anticipate the outcome of that review. When it is published I am sure the House will have an opportunity to discuss it.</P>

In relation to his remark that he is only involved in the matter when requested by the Minister for Justice to comment on it, the Minister told us &mdash; you will not permit me to quote &mdash;<Col N="1228" /> on 31 May in a debate that the Department of Justice passed on all such applications to his Department and that they in turn were passed on to the IDA in all cases.  The phrase used was &ldquo;in most cases, if not all, the IDA is requested to do an evaluation&rdquo;.  Will the Minister confirm that the IDA in the case of the family business of the Taoiseach was not so requested?  Did the Minister or his Department make any recommendations on that application since he told the House on 31 May that it was normal practice for the Minister for Justice to transfer these applications to the Department of Enterprise and Employment?</P>

Is he also aware that the long term unemployed in the sector are only getting about one-fifteenth of all places that become available? Will he agree that a proper national job and guidance service has proven very effective in the UK and France in helping persons who are long term unemployed?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed most recently by the National Economic and Social Forum report, No. 4, which made suggestions in relation to changes in the employment placement service.  FÁS has 49 employment service offices located throughout the country, supplemented by approximately 80 clinics. Clearly, no single agency could be responsible for all the placements.  To presume that FÁS should have that responsibility, although the Deputy did not, would be a bureaucratic nightmare.  Part of the difficulty is that not all the vacancies are notified to FÁS.  In conjunction with my Department FÁS is examining ways in which its employment placement services can be improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the areas being examined in the light of the NESF report as well as the whole question of how we can improve FÁS placement services. There are, as I may have told the Deputy on a previous occasion in the House, clients of the social welfare system who do not interact with the FÁS <Col N="1231" /> placement services.  With the facilitators, we are trying to ensure that there is better interaction.  Given the large number of long term unemployed and the fact that the projected figures are less than positive I would be the first to admit that we need to do more in this area.  That is the reason we are examining the matter with a view to improving the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputies are referring to the approval of grants from the county enterprise fund, which are approved by the county enterprise boards.  County enterprise fund grant applications are, first, examined by the county enterprise officer and then, if suitable, submitted for assessment by the county enterprise board evaluation committee, which advises the board on commercial aspects of the proposal in relation to its decision as to whether to approve assistance.  Under the interim arrangements currently in force, pending the establishment of the county enterprise boards as independent bodies, my Department's confirmation is required to validate a grant approved by a county enterprise board.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give a general indication of how long the county-level stages of this process takes, as this will vary from case to case, and to some extent from board to board.  A proper evaluation of any project at this level would in any event appear likely to take some weeks.  At the level of my Department, except in the small minority of cases where queries arise on an application, I have put in place a procedure which requires that responses normally issue to boards on foot of their county enterprise fund approvals, in the case of small grants, £10,000 or less, within four working days of receipt in my Department and, in the case of larger grants, within ten working days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, any system of grant approvals involving the commitment of public moneys requires a certain amount of time for the evaluation of applications received, to ensure that the limited funds available are committed to projects which are viable, and which are consistent with the objectives of the county enterprise fund in promoting enterprise and employment creation at local level. In devising the evaluation structure of the county enterprise boards, I have endeavoured to balance this requirement with the objective of ensuring that the grant approval system operates with the <Col N="1233" /> greatest possible speed and simplicity, to the benefit of the small businesses which are the clients of those boards.  While some lapse of time in obtaining approvals is inevitable, I, and my Department, are determined that unnecessary delay in the processing of county enterprise fund grant applications is avoided.  In this connection, I should point out that the establishment of the boards as independent bodies, in obviating the need for departmental confirmation of individual grant approvals, will remove one minor element of delay in the process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's information that undue delays are encountered in processing grant applications submitted to a number of county enterprise boards and that as a result many worthwhile job generating projects are being held up?  Is it the Minister's opinion that it should not be necessary to seek validation by officials of his Department of smaller grants of up to £50,000?  In asking county enterprise boards to comply with this overbureaucratic requirement not alone are worthwhile projects being delayed but the spirit which underpinned the setting up of the county enterprise boards in the first instance, and the belief that they could respond quicker to good ideas to generate jobs, are being undermined.  What is the Minister doing to free up the system and give county enterprise boards the discretion that we were led to believe they would have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the legal format to enable the county enterprise boards to be established with a limited guarantee is being finalised.  They will then have a degree of discretion which they do not currently have.  While £50,000 may be considered to be a relatively small sum of money, it is taxpayer's money and the Secretary of my Department and I are ultimately accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for money voted in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The western development fund was the model used to get the boards up and running and that was the system of <Col N="1234" /> approval used.  It has now been streamlined. With some exceptions, applications for grants of up to £10,000 are being processed within four working days and within ten working days in the case of grants above that figure.  This is the rate at which applications for similar sums of money are processed in most finance houses, particularly in the case of a start-up business.  On the question of delays, I share the Deputy's concern and he should bring any specific cases to my attention but I am not aware of any administrative delays.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that progress has been slow in establishing the boards on a legal basis.  We have engaged in a consultation process.  We forwarded the draft articles of association to each of the 35 boards for their comments as we wanted to allow them have an input.  This has delayed the process.  I hope the boards will be established on a legal basis in a matter of weeks.  They will then have discretion not only to allocate loans in the manner I have outlined but to provide loans as distinct from grants and assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has answered my question but I seek clarification.  Will he confirm that when the boards are legally established his Department will have no further function and that the process will begin and end with the boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the normal safeguards relating to the distribution of public moneys, it is the intention that the boards will have discretion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the authority of his Department will not be required by the county enterprise boards in processing grant applications from individual applicants?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that county enterprise boards will have maximum autonomy to make those decisions.

The present system under which individual applications have to be validated by the Department will be replaced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the guidelines which are broad, individual applications will be approved at local level and will not have to be cleared at national level as is the case under the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that in future the county enterprise boards will have autonomy.  The teething problems have been eased.  Will the Minister address the question of providing feasibility grants as opposed to capital grants? In launching this new venture is the Department concerned that the emphasis may be placed more on feasibility grants in connection with projects which may not lead to the creation of long term jobs? Will the Department set down specific guidelines to indicate to the county enterprise boards that a certain amount of money should be set aside for both feasibility and capital grants?  There is a danger that if the emphasis is placed on feasibility grants we may end up with few jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always a dilemma when a Government attempts to devolve decision-making and autonomy to local level because it must do so without any &mdash; or a minimum level &mdash; of interference. If, say, a sum of £500,000 is allocated to County Limerick, I presume the board which would have been carefully selected and, in some cases, nominated by the <Col N="1236" /> local community and local authority would have the good sense to ensure that 80 per cent of the money is not spent on feasibility studies.  If guidelines are necessary, they can be made available. We had a series of consultative meetings with the chairpersons and chief executive officers of boards to answer various questions which arise from time to time.  It is my instinct to allow common sense to prevail at local level which would mean a minimum of guidelines.  However, I am concerned that there is not destructive duplication in terms of job displacement, wasteful expenditure of taxpayers' money, and that the money is used to create sustainable employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should follow his instinct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to labour this point, but I am sure the Minister will agree that in some cases speed is of the essence.  Many prospective small enterprises are interested in the Minister's reply to this question.  Is he saying that if county enterprise boards approve the maximum grant of £50,000 following due process of evaluation by the committee that the cheque will be in the post within a reasonable period and not second-guessed by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the nature of the Deputy's question I want to give him an accurate answer, subject to confirmation in writing if necessary.  Individual cheques will no longer be sent from the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  It will submit a block allocation with guidelines as to how it should be spent and the normal safeguards attached to the spending of any such money will apply.  A representative of the county council will be a member of the evaluation committee because of the experience such persons have in handling public moneys.  Subject to finalisation in the articles of association for the boards, a project by project evaluation would not take place.  For larger projects we would require notification after the event.  It would defeat the object of the exercise <Col N="1237" /> to have people making decisions at local level and somebody second-guessing them <i>de novo</i> in Dublin.  If that were the case one might as well dissolve the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not allow the Department of Finance to put him off that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we must have the boards legally established and I regret it is taking longer than envisaged.  It would be a matter for the board to obtain a block allocation as in the case of the IDA who, for projects above a certain figure, must get approval from Government, but that would be on a much larger scale.  However, the principle is transportable when the scale of operation is changed.</P>
      <P>The object of the exercise is to allow local decision-making to prevail with the minimum of interference from central Government, but with the maximum number of safeguards in respect of taxpayers' money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The industry research and development initiative was introduced in 1993 on a pilot basis as part of the 1989-93 operational programme for industry. An amount of £13.4 million was initially made available for 1993.  As a result of the high number of quality proposals <Col N="1238" /> and, in particular, because it was possible to free-up some Structural Funds, an additional £10 million was made available, bringing the total 1993 allocation to £23.4 million.  This amount was fully taken up by way of 66 company project approvals.  The Government recognises the importance of research and development for industrial development as evidenced in the first instance by the introduction of the scheme in 1993.</P>
      <P>The low level of research and development expenditure in Ireland relative to other countries was a major factor in introducing the scheme and it can be expected to lead to positive growth in the overall level of business expenditure on research and development.</P>
      <P>The Government's continued commitment is further evidenced by the £16 million which has been made available for 1994.  While this is lower than the 1993 allocation it should be recognised that, as with any new scheme, an initial peak of applications can be expected while ongoing numbers of quality applications can be expected to level off somewhat.</P>
      <P>The operational programme for industry 1994-99, which includes this scheme, has not yet received final approval from the EU Commission.  Discussions are ongoing and final agreement is expected in the next few weeks.</P>

Furthermore, will he agree that manufactured goods have a shorter life cycle and that some products on the market are out of date when a newer version is at research and development phase?  In that context, will he agree that a cut of £7 million in the already very low level of investment in research and development is the last thing the Government and the country should be doing in terms of industrial development policy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's analysis of the changing pace of industry and the need for research.  As Shakespeare would put it, I have been <Col N="1239" /> hoist with my own petard in this regard. The figure announced last year for support for industry was £13 million.  During the year it became obvious that I could get my hands on another £10 million from funds left over from other programmes. I succeeded in doing so, bringing the total to £23 million.  If I had not been so active on that front I would not now be faced with what appears to be a cut in the figure.  Because I obtained additional funding in the middle of last year it now appears that there has been a cut in the figure.  If I had been less ambitious I would be announcing an increase now.</P>
      <P>I acknowledged in my reply that we do not meet international standards in respect of research and development and we must endeavour to do so.  In 1987 State spending on research and development programmes was just under £4 million. Last year the figure was almost £50 million, a substantial increase in six years.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that the average OECD investment in research and development is approximately 2 per cent and our investment is only a fraction of that, approximately 0.2 per cent?  The expenditure on industrial policy this year amounted to approximately £800 million, but we chose the area of research and development to make a saving of £7 million. It is not a good idea for the Minister <Col N="1240" /> to announce figures of £10 million which he does not have.  Much as I would like to, I cannot give him plaudits for that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct, we are not meeting international levels of spending on research and development.  The State spends approximately £600 million every year under the broad heading of research and development.  I recently established a science, technology and innovation council to urgently examine that figure. While that figure covers the bricks and mortar of universities, lecturers in physics, chemistry, technology and industry programmes, the overall level of spending of £600 million is phenomenal.  I am keen to co-ordinate matters.  That is why I asked the science council to establish priorities with regard to that figure.  We are not up to international standards and we must attain them, but we have made phenomenal improvements in the past seven years.</P>

      <P>Are the figures the Minister of State quoted not somewhat misleading?  Is it not the case that measure 6 is funded entirely by the European Commission with no Exchequer funding put into it?  Would it not be fair to say that the Minister is playing tricks with the House by suggesting an increase under that heading was brought about by the State's good offices; was it not brought about by the European Union who pays the bills?  Will he accept that <Col N="1241" /> the Estimates for his Department for the past three years show that State funding for research and development fell from £27 million to £20 million and it is now down to £18 million?  There has been a consistent decline in funding.  Will he agree that all indicators point to the fact that we are not making a decent research effort?  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, told us that we rank 21 out of 22 in the OECD and our target is less than half that of the EU. The Commission is appealing to us to increase our commitment and the State is not doing so.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that one of the fundamental weaknesses in our industrial infrastructure is the failure to develop new ideas on product development?  Not alone have we not reached international standards, but last October the international science journal, &ldquo;Nature&rdquo;, launched a blistering attack on our input into research and development and, apart from the OECD report, it categorised us in this area as 22nd of the 23 countries surveyed.  Apart from a cut of £7 million last year for the science and technology development <Col N="1242" /> programme, the basic research programme for universities has been slashed and is virtually non-existent aside from the pressure applied by the science teachers who manage to extract from EOLAS a small amount of money.  By not investing more in research and development we are amputating an essential arm of our industrial infrastructure. Of the 66 companies the Minister mentioned which received substantial funding last year from the EU, one of which was C &amp; D Limited, in County Longford, what follow up procedures and monitoring were undertaken by the Minister's Department, EOLAS or some other agency to ensure such funding was used for research and development?</P>

      <P>The scheme was approved and is monitored by the EU. Professional consultants and accountants were engaged and various IDA committees and so on dealt with the matter professionally.

If I published a science magazine I would launch a blistering attack on any Government to secure more funds for science.  I expect a magazine of that nature to seek more investment in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems is that there is widespread disagreement between academic scientists, those who plead for more investment in blue sky research, inventions and major scientific and technical breakthroughs and the opposing side who do not want me to concentrate on that, but to invest in industry as that is the area from which we will benefit.  There must be a balance, there must be blue sky research even though we will not see a return on some of our investments, but we must invest in what might be possible as well as investing in industry.  That is why I asked the science and technology innovation council to submit by the end of the year a set of proposals, from which I would like <Col N="1243" /> to draft a White Paper on science and technology so that we can set out the State's priorities and its view of where science and technology and innovation investment should be placed.  I am not satisfied that some of our investment in science and technology is worthwhile. Does it make sense to spend a few million pounds building a new &ldquo;ology&rdquo; building of some sort without being clear about what should be put into it?  Maybe we would be better spending our money on programmes to develop our products rather than in bricks and mortar and hoping inventions will follow.  The world's greatest inventions did not come out of glamorous buildings, they came out of attics and basements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister betrayed his view on the question of research and development.  I welcome his promise of a White Paper which will give us an opportunity to discuss those issues.  In the interim does he acknowledge that in the absence of an indigenous research and development sector in our economy we are reliant on the vibrant research capacity in our institutions?  In so far as multinationals carry out extensive research and development, they do so in their country of origin.  Our domestic industry has not invested in research and development and both sides are in agreement that the State has not supported it. Whatever about the merits of engaging in blue sky research, we are left with supporting academic researchers and scientific people within institutions, the universities, Teagasc and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quibble with that.  We must undertake more research and development, particularly by multinational firms located here.  The IDA is adamant in trying to encourage them not just to locate a manufacturing base here <Col N="1244" /> but also their research and development bases.  That is why I asked the science and technology council to look at a specific area.  Under our taxation system, the corporation tax for the manufacturing sector is 10 per cent.  If a company writes off its research and development expenditure at present it gets a 10 per cent tax break on it.  Other countries have a higher corporation tax and if expenditure is written off where corporation tax is 40 per cent there will be a higher benefit.  Our tax policy is not in tune with our industrial taxation policy for manufacturing industry. If a multinational spends £2 million on research and development here it will receive a 10 per cent write off on its investment.  If it invests in another country with a corporation tax of 40 per cent it will get a 40 per cent write off on its investment.  Where would a company carry out its research and investment?  I would be tempted to invest in research in a country where the corporation tax rate is 40 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 15 and 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen the recent IBEC report on the training of the employed.  The conclusions in this report correspond to those contained in reports such as those of Culliton, the NESC and others which, as Deputies will be aware, also highlighted the importance of training in industry and the need for Irish companies to place a greater emphasis on training. These reports also pointed to the role <Col N="1246" /> which the State might play in encouraging industry in this regard.  In response to the conclusions in these reports the Government have developed proposals in the National Development Plan and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>While the ultimate responsibility for training in employment must rest with individual employers, I accept that the State will continue to have a role to play in ensuring that industry recognises the importance of training.  For this reason, I recently set up a working group in my Department to draw up a clear policy statement for training of the employed and to put forward programmes and structures to achieve the policy aims.  This group comprises representatives of FÁS, Forfás, and Forbairt, which are involved in the administration of existing schemes for the training of the employed, and my Department and a number of individual industrialists.  I hope to be in a position to take whatever proposals this group come up with to Government by the end of July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the retention of even one job that is at risk is as important as creating a new job?  Will she further accept that jobs are often at risk because of bad management, bad work practices, poor procedures and skill levels that are low or have not kept pace with events in the marketplace? That being so, will she not acknowledge that there is no justification for the imbalance between the amount of money spent on training through FÁS and other bodies and the very small amount of money spent on in-house training within industry?  Of the £260 million spent last year on training, only £2.8 million was spent on training in industry.  What steps does the Minister propose to take, given that often what is needed is to provide appropriate training at a crucial time in the development of industries, particularly of older industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the retention of existing jobs is as important if not more so than the creation of new ones.  I <Col N="1247" /> do not accept the Deputy's figures.  Many industries are funded by FÁS and other agencies which are not encapsulated in the £2.8 million.  I have in mind the training of young apprentices which attracts much State funding and some EU funding which is for employment within industry. There are other schemes, particularly the TSS, which is of great interest to employers.  In the main, the IBEC paper which was the subject of intense discussion and scrutiny, put forward many interesting suggestions which I am sure we will be able to take on board, particularly on the need for a crusade on training and the need for employers to take to heart lessons learned in regard to the needs of managers of small, medium and large industries.</P>
      <P>There was clear acceptance that strategic decisions have to be taken by well motivated people who have short, medium and long term interests in view. The skills needed for such decision-making are not there <i>au naturel</i> and need to be put in place through self-development and training strategies.  IBEC also indicated that it wanted a separate employer-led body which would have a policy and philosophy on training.  I accept their desire for separateness in dealing with training but I do not know if the setting up of a new structure is the right way to develop training for people in employment.  However, the document is timely, coinciding with our own policy document which we will have at the end of July, culminating in the autumn with the Community Initiatives under which there is scope under various headings for innovative measures for training.  All of that will bring about an interesting milieu in which training policy will get much greater emphasis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a danger in being swamped with schemes and not knowing what the Government's basic policy is.  Is the Minister aware that the Culliton report was critical of the fact that 90 per cent of the FÁS budget was going into work experience and community work type schemes and only 10 <Col N="1248" /> per cent towards training provision within industry?  What is the Minister's target?  Does she have in mind a ratio of 80:20, 70:30?  What is the Government's view on the allocation of training budgets as between industry and those not at work?  Let me ask the Minister a specific question.  Why is it that her Estimate shows that both the IDA and Forbairt are recording 50 per cent cuts in the training moneys that they make available to industry in this year's Estimate?  Is that cut not completely out of line with the philosophy the Minister is expounding, that we should have greater training activity within industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are seeking to rationalise the provision of training.  I cannot be specific because I do not have the Estimates here but I would imagine that whatever is conceived within training budgets in individual agencies is a product not of a cut but of a more focused approach to the provision of training.  I regret not answering Deputy Quill but I will include an answer in my reply to Deputy Bruton.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about the disparity between the amount of money available for training of unemployed people and that available for those who are employed.  I do not like to see it put like that because it makes for division and creates a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; scenario.  Every penny spent on the unemployed is well spent and we should seek more rather than creating a false dichotomy.  Our aim for those in employment is to have a more focused approach within an overall departmental budget for training of people in employment.  That is our policy.</P>

There is a rigorous evaluation unit within the Department, funded by Europe, whose measures have been endorsed.  They are systematically going through all the training programmes not just for us but for all the other Government Departments that have training programmes.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment has responsibility for the overall funding for training.  They are systematically going through each of the programmes, making very significant suggestions which have been taken on board, particularly in regard to rationalisation and looking for value for money.  We hope to get more money for training for people in employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of Government policy in relation to enterprise and employment is to achieve the maximum increase in employment levels and in this way to reduce the numbers of the unemployed, including long term unemployment.  There is no level of long term unemployment which can be regarded as acceptable.</P>
      <P>Government policy seeks to promote economic growth and to increase the employment intensity of that growth in order to maintain employment and create new jobs.  In addition, a range of active labour market measures to improve access to the labour market and jobs and to develop job-related skills is pursued by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A measure of particular relevance to tackling long term unemployment is community employment.  The target is to <Col N="1250" /> have 40,000 participants on the programme by the end of 1994.  This is a significant increase on current levels of participation on programmes which operated prior to the launch of community employment on 11 April 1994.</P>
    <P>The employment incentive and enterprise schemes also assist the long term unemployed.  In the area of training, a special emphasis is given to accommodate the long term unemployed on FÁS training courses.  A range of other measures operated under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Social Welfare includes, respectively, local development initiatives and the back to work allowance scheme.  I recognise that long term unemployment will continue to represent a major challenge over the coming years and I believe the approach the Government is taking is the correct one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that long term unemployment has consistently increased since this Government returned to office?  Is he aware that the ESRI recently published a projection for the next five years &mdash; which took into account the National Development Plan &mdash; in which it indicated that long term unemployment would remain at its present level of 130,000?  Does he recognise that implicit in that projection is a serious criticism of the inability of the existing strategy to reduce long term unemployment, despite the huge once-off injection of EC money?  Would the Minister agree that when in Opposition he and his party indicated that they had the capacity to reduce long term unemployment to 25,000?  What has happened to their policies since then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the accuracy of the Deputy's statistics.  Perhaps he should have added that since I came to office the numbers on the live register have been reduced by 13,000.  It is sad that the longer somebody is off the pitch, so to speak, the less likely they are to get a game.  Members who participated in the Oireachtas Committee on Employment will be aware that even though there is an <Col N="1251" /> upturn in economic activity, with many people on unemployment benefit getting jobs and many coming into the labour market for the first time &mdash; a former leader of the Deputy's party wrote very extensively last Saturday about the good news facing young school leavers in this respect &mdash; the residual problem is with the long term unemployed.  Nobody in Europe has a menu of answers that specifically addresses this problem.  We are probably more advanced than most, which is as it should be because our problem is greater than most.</P>
      <P>We are currently working on various initiatives.  In reply to an earlier question from Deputy Finucane I stated that in getting more specific profiled information on the long term unemployed, through the Department of Social Welfare, we will be enabled to tailor effective and inexpensive measures to deal with this problem.  I would say in all sincerity &mdash; I am not making a party political point &mdash; that this is perhaps the one residual major economic problem that is a contradiction of all the other things happening in society at present.  This is not unique to Ireland; it is part and parcel of the European problem.  While we can develop solutions here &mdash; we are currently doing so in the Department &mdash; they will have to be validated and extended across the European Union and we will have to get European assistance to resolve the problem.</P>

    <Title>Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1994: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In the confidence in Government motion on 5 November 1992 the Leader of the Labour Party, now Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, said &mdash; columns 2312-13 of the Official Report &mdash;&ldquo;In common with a clear majority of this House, the Labour Party have no confidence in this Government, and we will be hoping to see it swept out of office when the vote is called this evening.&rdquo; He went on to state, at column 2313:</P>
      <P>For three and a half years, this country has needed grown-up, adult politics.  It has needed clear choices, and an opportunity to rally around those choices.</P>
      <P>Later in the same column he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of grown-up politics, we have had a Government beset by scandal.  They have been obsessed with so-called &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; which have always failed to include the people who elected them.  By their behaviour, time and time again, they have cheapened and debased one of the highest callings <Col N="1359" /> there is, and dishonoured those who serve the public in political life.</P>
    <P>That railroading of the then Government was directed principally at the Fianna Fáil Party, then in Government with the Progressive Democrats.  It is the same Fianna Fáil Party now in Government with the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Bill was described by Deputy Currie last week as a disclosure of interests Bill and in that context only it has the qualified support of this party.</P>
    <P>There are a number of serious issues that need to be addressed on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will take cognisance of them in the course of the debate.  I find it arrogant and presumptuous of the Minister to speak of strengthening the foundations of our democracy.  I find this phrase particularly nauseating, coming from a Minister whose party, when in Opposition, was more than virulent in condemning low standards in high places, a party that had no sooner joined forces with the party it had originally railroaded when it adopted the same standards it had criticised, and indeed surpassed them in effrontery.  In these circumstances the Minister might more appropriately have titled this Bill the &ldquo;Closing the stable door when the horse has bolted Bill&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Gamekeeper turned poacher Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The pretentiousness of the exercise leaves a sour taste in the mouths of the many decent honourable people who come within its scope.  Essentially, the Bill aims to visit the sins of the few &mdash; all of whom I might add are on the Government side of the House &mdash; on the great majority who are sinless.  The assumption underlying the Bill is that because a Minister, a Deputy, a civil servant or other official has what is known as a material interest in a particular proposal, his or her attitude to the proposal will be affected by that interest.  Many people who come within the scope of this Bill will find that assumption gratuitously insulting and a slur on their integrity and <Col N="1360" /> I agree with them.  However, this is the philosophy on which the Bill is based and, therefore, it must be unsound.  In essence it is taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not been forthright in her approach to the Bill.  In her statement she claims that our financial and political lives have become much more complex, necessitating this Bill.  To what complexities does she refer?  Would it not be more honest and forthright and in keeping with her stated need for open Government to give us the facts &mdash; that this Bill is being introduced because of her party's criticism when in Opposition? Her party has succumbed to the temptation to take advantage of its position in Government, appointing cronies and henchmen, winding up with egg on its face and now desperately trying to restore some measure of credibility.  That would be a fair if unpalatable approach. Corrective action is clearly needed as a result of abuses, or failure to take action on abuses, by the two parties now in Government.</P>
    <P>We are all human and there will be lapses from time to time.  None is above reproach &mdash; I do not want to point the finger at any individual &mdash; but where there is a breach of accepted standards, it is up to those in charge, as in any other organisation, to deal with them.  It is the failure on the part of those now occupying the Government benches to take appropriate action where such breaches have occurred and the public reaction to such failures that has necessitated corrective measures.  In the political arena there is always the ultimate sanction for those who do not practise what they preach and do not conform to expected norms.  They have to face the electorate who will not be fooled for long as the Government members know from the European, urban and by-elections on 9 June.  The argument can be made that in the political arena, with the ultimate sanction of having to face the electorate, there is a need for only minimum regulation &mdash; leaving it to the good sense of the electorate to deal with abuses, as it has always done effectively in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> This brings me to a related point.  In support of the Bill the Minister said that, in effect, it will bring this country into line with the practice in many other countries with regard to the disclosure of interests. The Minister did not say however, whether the disclosure of interest is required by statute in those countries.  I would like her to respond to that point, by taking a cross section of countries, particularly smallers ones.  The Minister should not have swallowed, hook, line and sinker, the practice that applies in other countries.  No two countries are the same with regard to attitude, culture and tradition; legislation to the extent that it is needed should be tailored to meet our needs.  In this connection I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that she has not given any indication whether she considered an alternative approach to that proposed in the Bill to meet the public interest, which is surprising.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister and her Labour Party colleagues have been effectively railroaded into introducing this legislation. For example, has the Minister considered whether a non-statutory requirement that particular classes of the type of encompassed in the Bill should place on record with an appropriate authority within their own organisation any interest of theirs that might be regarded by others as prejudicial to the discharge of certain aspects of their work, for example, the Houses of the Oireachtas or the appropriate Minister in the case of staff in the Civil Service, State bodies and so on?  We could then make suitable amendments to the prevention of corruption Acts to deal with cases where criminal proceedings might be justified, as proposed in the Bill.  Will the Minister respond to this point in her reply?</P>
    <P>I do not like the Minister's tunnel vision approach.  In considering legislation, it is important to ensure that needs have been examined from all relevant angles and that where it is proposed to introduce legislation, there is no satisfactory alternative to it.  In particular, has the Minister considered imposing restrictions as part of the conditions of employment in certain cases rather than <Col N="1362" /> governing them by statute which is rigid and inflexible.  The Minister said that the objective of the Bill is to ensure that the public is served in the best possible manner by those whom they elect and those chosen to serve them.  Has the Minister satisfied herself that this Bill meets these objectives?  It is possible that the Bill could have the opposite effect in some instances, for example, by placing severe restraints on public servants.  If a higher civil servant in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry or a close relative has a farm would it effectively debar civil servants from advising the Minister on policy changes which might be beneficial to him or her or a close relative?  Similarly, in the case of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, would civil servants be effectively debarred from recommending budgetary changes that might benefit them?  I recognise that what the Bill seeks is that they should disclose a material interest and that in practice this would not debar them from giving such advice. However, will a civil servant not be more circumspect in giving advice, making recommendations or advising on changes in instances such as that where his or her integrity to give impartial and unbiased advice will appear to have been called into question by the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister and the Labour Party are particularly sensitive at this time because of media reaction, election results and the public odium engendered by their appointments of specialists advisers and so on but it appears unnecessary to go to the lengths the Minister proposes in this Bill on the future of such advisers.  He should realise that a provision in the Bill cannot undo the damage her party did to itself by making such an appointment.  As soon as you shoot yourself in the foot, the damage is done.  That being the case, I suggest the Minister might look soberly at the provision on specialist appointments. What are the thoughts of the Government about the type of person who should be given a specialist appointment? Ministers' requirements in regard to <Col N="1363" /> specialist advice may vary, depending on their qualifications and attitudes.  I would not like to see the possibility of somebody with a commonsense and a feel for the public good ruled out on the basis of not having a sufficient number of paper qualifications, as seems to be implicit in some of the Minister's proposals here.</P>
    <P>What is the position of a civil servant appointed as a specialist adviser to a Minister?  Would he or she return to previous employment on the Minister leaving officer or would the Minister be precluded from giving that person out of turn promotion, as happened in the past? I am not advocating a particular course of action but I would like to hear the Minister's view.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes two separate bodies to oversee the proposed legislation, one covering the ordinary Members of the Oireachtas and the other covering Ministers and public servants.  The Minister's justification for this is that under the Constitution each House of the Oireachtas regulates its own affairs.  Could the Oireachtas not agree to have this aspect of its affairs dealt with by an outside body and so avoid a further proliferation of bodies essentially dealing with the same issue?  Obviously I have the utmost respect for the integrity and ability of the members of the proposed commission, but would it not be better from a public confidence view point &mdash; with which the Minister seems to be concerned and indeed obsessed &mdash; to give the overseeing of this legislation to persons who cannot, in the public mind, be associated in any way with the objectives of the legislation? Perhaps the task could be given to members of the Judiciary.  As Deputy Currie pointed out in his contribution they should be brought within the scope of this or corresponding legislation, in regard to their appointment to the Bench.  The Minister's proposals envisage annual reports by the proposed Commission although not by the select committees in each House.  Why is there a different treatment in this regard?  I am opposed to annual reports where reports have to be made in individual cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> On the definitions in section 2, part I of the Bill, will the Minister indicate whether the reference to the chairman and the deputy chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas refers to the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the Dáil and to the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad and, if so, why are they not referred to in these terms in the Bill before the House?</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the provisions for special advisers.  The legislation proposes that senior special advisers will be required to undertake not to engage in any other employment which might reasonably be seen as capable of interfering with or being incompatible with the performance by the person of his or her functions as a special adviser.  Does this again show the guilt complex of the Government?  Surely this is a matter within contracts drawn up between individuals and not for legislation.</P>
    <P>Under section 30, a person may be directed to produce to the Committee or Commission any specified document or thing in his or her possession or power. What is the Minister's definition of a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;?  The section also provides in subsection (9) that sittings of the Committee or the Commission for the purposes of an investigation by it under the Act may be held in private.  Surely that should read &ldquo;shall be held in private&rdquo; The report issued by the Committee or the Commission, including the findings on the question at issue, should be adequate to satisfy any public unease.  If a prosecution follows, it would then take the normal course for such prosecutions.</P>
    <P>I notice also that in the First Schedule of the Bill a public body, for the purposes of the Act, shall be a Department of State, the Office of the President, the Office of the Tánaiste, the Office of the Attorney General and some other specified offices such as that of the Ombudsman and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Perhaps I am innocent but it never occurred to me that the Office of the Tánaiste was not a Department of State and that the Tánaiste's office had a separate and distinct existence which <Col N="1365" /> would require it to be named specifically in the Bill.  Why is this necessary?  Is the Tánaiste's office funded in such a way that it does not allow any other holder of that office in future years to transgress the borders of public office as has been alleged about the present Tánaiste?</P>
    <P>Much of this Bill is a charade designed to cover up the shenanigans of the Government parties.  Essentially what is involved is not more open Government, as the Minister claims, but a covering up of the breaches of public trust which should not have arisen and which could and should have been dealt with by those responsible, without legislation such as this.  In trying to recover lost ground, much damage has been done to all those covered by this proposed legislation to make up for the lapses and the wrong-doings of the few.  We are being tarred with the same brush.  The underlying theory on which this Bill is based is that those covered by it are untrustworthy and will allow personal interests to colour their judgments on matters relating to their public office.  That is a false assumption and the Bill based on it is flawed in consequence.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to strengthen the foundations of our democracy, which I am sure she does before introducing the next stage of this Bill, she should radically amend it, remove the underlying highly objectionable slur, and consider whether an approach on the lines I outlined earlier would be more in tune with what is needed.  Nobody objects to a minimal declaration of interests as applies in the case of local authorities and indeed in many other parliaments, but this Bill contains many items that are dangerously nonsensical.  The Minister is leading us down a road from which it will be impossible for any ordinary person to come into this House and serve the public under the Constitution and the democratic system which elects them to office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In her speech the Minister stated that this is probably one of the most significant Bills the Government will bring forward.  The Minister has shown great interest in it since the election <Col N="1366" /> in November 1992 but I would not regard this legislation as earth shattering. I agree there should be some regulations requiring Members to declare their private interests, particularly where it might be perceived that the conduct of politicians is being influenced by those interests.</P>
      <P>I agree with the idea behind the Bill.  I am happy that the annual declaration of interests is now reasonable and that the more ridiculous suggestions put forward by various people in the early days of the Government have been set aside.  This will be worthwhile legislation if it encourages openness and trust in our democratic system and if it is perceived by the electorate to make the system more transparent.</P>
      <P>Recently politicians have not been very favourably perceived.  Many people engage in mindless criticism of politicians. We certainly do not deserve that and I doubt whether the attitude can be changed by legislation.  However, I wish the Minister well in her campaign.</P>
      <P>The negative perception of politicians has been helped in part by a minority of people in the media who seem to be on a continuous witch hunt.  This legislation, rather than being seen as the first step towards changing the existing perception of politicians, might open up a new campaign which will result in politicians coming under more scrutiny in the future. The first issue of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> will be eagerly sought by many but I hope whatever interest it generates will be short term and in time the novelty will wear off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A register of interests by elected Members is not exactly a new feature. Many countries have such a register as a standard feature of their democracy. Indeed, local authorities always had such a register of interests.  The public has a reasonable right to know the private interests of politicians which might perhaps influence decisions.  If one declares an interest at local authority level one is supposed to opt out of speaking and voting on the issue concerned.  If that applied in the Dáil it would cause a problem <Col N="1367" /> if the Government had a small majority.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Member ever came into the House hoping to influence policy making for his or her own benefit.  The vast majority of politicians enter politics because they have something to offer.  It would be foolish to say no politician was ever tempted or succumbed to temptation. We would all like to feel we are pure and beyond temptation but the real test arises when the opportunity is presented.  There are people in every walk of life who fall and the regulations for entry into public life are not so strict that we could say with certainly no one who felt like that ever slipped through the net.</P>
    <P>The Bill lays down rules for behaviour. Standards are ingrained in us.  It is difficult and awkward to legislate by laying down rules.  If a person needs to look at the rules he or she is already in trouble. There may be cases where no rule is broken but the action engaged in might leave a bad taste in the mouth.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to amend the <i>ad hoc</i> declaration.  There should be some less public way of declaring an interest. If it is to be printed in the Order Paper on a daily basis it would open up a new form of journalism.  Each newspaper could nominate a journalist to look at the Order Paper every day.</P>
    <P>A declaration of interests is made in other countries but it has not succeeded in avoiding scandals.  Rules and regulations are of some benefit but they are not the whole answer.  The Minister mentioned the passports issue and advisers. To some extent we seem to be making up the Bill as we go along and taking on board issues which have surfaced recently.  Are we trying to cure a common cold when there is a potential epidemic which has not come to our notice?</P>
    <P>Advisers are covered by the Bill but when they leave their positions they take a lot of information with them.  There is no legislation governing this aspect.  It was mentioned last week that the TEAM unions wanted to see the LRC report but it was felt there was something confidential <Col N="1368" /> in it which they should not see. Yet many people had possession of that information, including ex-TEAM managers working in competitor companies. At the committee meeting yesterday unions and management were accompanied by consultants.  Many people have this information.  Sometimes I wonder about rules and regulations.  I would like to see something in place which would debar an adviser from being involved in certain business interests for a specified number of months after they leave their post.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, in essence, the Bill asks politicians to declare those interests which could potentially influence their decisions.  The Bill is about income, shares, directorships, property, gifts and so on.  They are all material things but the title of the Bill is the Ethics in Public Office Bill.  Why was the Bill not called registration of interests Bill?  Surely &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; should cover more than material goods.  If we want politicians to declare interests which could potentially influence their decisions we should extend the Bill to cover their views on social issues.  For example, in discussing homosexuality, divorce and abortion should there not be a regulation requesting politicians to declare an interest in these matters?  The Minister used the word &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; in the title and I think she was going beyond directorships and shares yet no section in the Bill deals with the issues to which I referred.</P>
    <P>We are all conditioned by our backgrounds and many people might have entered politics in order to influence certain decisions and social issues.  Politicians who are members of organisations whose express policy and purpose is to change the ethos, culture or social habits of society should have to declare such membership.  I am thinking of organisations such as International Planned Parenthood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Declaring that one is a member of such organisations is far more important than declaring if one has <Col N="1369" /> £10,000 or £15,000 worth of shares in a public company.  Such a number of shares would not give one a real say in a company whereas membership of an organisation would mean one is a zealous advocate of one's cause.  I am surprised that the Minister has not looked at this area since she used the word &ldquo;ethics&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Before I entered the House I had the perception that politicians mixed business and politics.  I worked in CIE and one member of the Oireachtas was chief executive of the transport organisation which was openly lobbying for changes in the Road Passenger Act at the time. Workers in CIE used to talk about this person who seemed to be very influential in his political party which was promoting the same views as his organisation.  He was supposed to be on a salary of £26,000 and had the use of a company car, which was envied by many workers.  He openly pushed the views of his organisation through his political party.  I, therefore, welcome the provisions in relation to political lobbyists.  We can only wait to see the impact of these provisions because many people who receive money are not as open as this man in acting as a lobbyist.</P>
      <P>It is not proper that a Member who belongs to the legal profession should be seen to be suing the State on behalf of a client or representing the State.  Reference has been made to a case involving Dublin Corporation where a politician who had an interest in a legal firm was seen to be generating legal business through his political contacts.  When our constituents have problems we make phone calls, write letters and table motions at local authority meetings.  The perception was that instead of following the normal procedures this individual would institute an action against the corporation. This was not looked on favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and am glad that some of its more extreme provisions have been dropped.  I hope it will be a success. I do not think it will improve people's perception of politicians overnight but I hope I am proved wrong.  Regardless of what we do, some people will believe what they want to and we can only pitch <Col N="1370" /> our case at reasonable people.  It is in all our interests that we try to improve the level of respect for politicians.  Sometimes we are our own worst enemies &mdash; we cannot resist the opportunity to score a few cheap political points against one another.  We are also greatly affected by public opinion and tend to be over-correct. For example, yesterday when one half of the workforce took the day of work and the other half took the afternoon off, the business of the House was kept going during the match.  This did nothing to improve people's opinion of us.  At times it is better to stand up and do what is right and proper instead of running scared.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that some Ministers were so upset at the suggestion that the only reason they were going to America was to see the match and not to do business that they cancelled their trips.  While most Irish fans paid their way to America, some people got freebies of one description or another.  We will pay for their trips when we buy the products of the companies who sent them.  Regardless of whether they saw the match, Ministers would have done more meaningful work during their time in America.  We should not run scared at every criticism. We must work hard at improving our image and reputation, pitch our case at reasonable people and ignore the begrudges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Deputy Ahern about yesterday's match.  No politician will admit that he or she did not watch the match, yet collectively we did not have the courage to suspend the sitting of the House. I may be as much at fault as anybody else &mdash; I assumed the sitting would be suspended.  I also agree that the Bill should more accurately be called the register of interests Bill.  The long title, which details the purpose of the Bill, spells out clearly that this is what the Bill is about.  To a large extent the Bill in its title and in much of what it seeks to do is very much a cosmetic exercise, a face mask.  There is an assumption that once the Bill is on the Statute Book people will no longer have to wrestle with their <Col N="1371" /> conscience and the Labour Party in particular will be able to exonerate itself from many of the decisions with which it has been associated in recent times.</P>
      <P>The Bill is based on a false premise. One cannot legislate for ethics or good behaviour.  The introduction of legislation of this kind will not make a dishonest politician honest and will not do anything to end public cynicism about our political system.  I will refer to this point in greater detail later.</P>
      <P>I welcome some of the provisions of the Bill and support the idea of a declaration of public interests.  In the main it is those who have nothing to hide, those who are honest, whose privacy will be invaded by such a declaration.  Nonetheless I welcome the provision.  As a single person, I believe the Bill discriminates against married couples.  If a single person lives with somebody and has children by them the children will be covered but the person with whom they live, who is not a spouse in the strict legal sense, will not be covered under the legislation.  I make that point in passing as our society has changed enormously.</P>
      <P>The low public esteem in which politicians are held is very worrying and dispiriting. Politician-baiting is clearly set to continue; it is a national pastime, almost a legal blood sport.  To a large extent the reason people hold us in low public esteem is due to us.  Many believe that most people are in politics only for what they can get out of it, that we are all the same.  In my experience the vast majority of people who enter public life do so because they want to serve the public. That sense of public service commitment also exists to a large extent in the public service.  Many of our senior and very lowly paid public servants would be much more handsomely rewarded if they were to take up comparable positions in the private sector.  Yet they stay in the public sector out of a strong sense of duty and commitment to serve the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is this strong sense of commitment in this House and in the country and I find it very dispiriting that so few people believe this.  When I was involved <Col N="1372" /> in setting up a new party I found it very difficult to encourage some professional people to counterance a career in politics. Many refused because of the low rate of remuneration for the job &mdash; we are badly paid and overworked &mdash; and the general nature of politics.  To a large extent this is our fault: we are afraid to pay ourselves appropriately.  As I said on many occasions, pay peanuts and you get monkeys. We have too many politicians, but they are underpaid for the job they are expected to do.  We bring that odium on ourselves.</P>
    <P>We have also failed to tackle the shortcomings in the system, beginning with the Dáil.  The Government has committed itself to spending £10 million to improve facilities for the Oireachtas.  I support this necessary development but we could bring about much more effective reform if we spent a few hours dealing with the procedures of this House instead of spending this £10 million.  That money, although it is important and necessary, like all the facilities, will do nothing to improve the workings of the Dáil or Seanad unless we change the procedures. Is it not a farce that current issues cannot effectively be raised in this House and that the Taoiseach will not, and is not expected to, answer questions unless he is given three days' notice, except in very urgent circumstances when Private Notice Questions are allowed?  There is no accountability.  The procedures and the way we do our business are not professional or modern and contribute to public cynicism.</P>
    <P>The rigid Whip system is also bad for politics and I spoke about this very recently.  I agree with some of what Deputy Noel Ahern said a few moments ago although I will approach the matter from a different perspective.  There is nothing more demoralising than Deputies having to vote against their consciences or sacrifice their careers, effectively, that is the choice they are given.  I am not talking about economic issues or Northern Ireland, I am talking about issues connected with what are broadly regarded as private morality questions, issues of conscience and religion.  It is bad <Col N="1373" /> for politics and politicians to continue to operate such a rigid system.  Many people feel degraded and their self esteem is eroded when they must walk through those lobbies and vote against something they believe to be wrong.  Even when we had the vote on hare coursing, on a simple issue like that, parties could not bring themselves to allow their members a free vote.  Even if the Government had been defeated would it matter?  Would it not be far more important to have a healthy, democratic system, open and honest debate and not to be afraid to face up to the issues squarely?  These are among the issues politicians must tackle if we want the public to have regard for us and to believe that this is an ethical and honourable profession.  No amount of legislation will change that.</P>
    <P>There was a reference in the debate last week to the culture of certain parties. It would be wrong of me to talk about that because it is not appropriate.  I would prefer to talk about the culture in our society which believes that if you know the right people you will always get the favour, that to get on in life you have to go along with certain things, that is the way business is done.  Indeed if you raise questions about these things you are considered holier than thou.  Quite honestly, I am tired reading editorials and journalists' comments to the effect that those of us who believe that standards in public life are important or that there is a difference between what is legal and what is right, are holier than thou and that we should cop on to ourselves.  I will not be intimidated by abuse like that.  Yes, we would prefer popularity to contempt. Equally we have a duty to highlight what is wrong and render people accountable. It is all about making the Government of the day accountable to the Oireachtas.  I see that as my first duty and will not be put off simply because some people might not like it.</P>
    <P>We tolerate a code of practice in politics and public life generally that would not be acceptable in most democracies in the western world.  People have resigned and been hounded out of office in many other countries for misdemeanours more <Col N="1374" /> minor than things that happened here over a considerable length of time.  That has to do with what I call the culture in our society, what is and is not acceptable. There is a general view that it is all right if you are not caught, it is acceptable if people can get away with bluff and bluster. I do not share that view and it is a pity it is current in society.  I do not necessarily blame the media because they and the political system are all part of the culture that exists in this country.</P>
    <P>I believe in more openness and accountability and in the commitment in the Programme for Government which said:</P>
    <P>It is the Government's aim to restore confidence in the democratic process by encouraging greater openness and participation at all levels by improving public accountability, transparency and trust and by ensuring the highest standards in public life.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, before the ink had dried a Kremlin-style battalion of advisers of all kinds was recruited, by the Labour Party in particular, costing £2 million per annum.  We need outside advisers that is good for Government and for the public service, but the volume of advisers recruited by the Government would make many larger Governments look very weak.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister of State she said in her introductory remarks last week that there were lessons to be learned from the manner in which those advisers were recruited.  They all seemed to be either members of the Labour Party or relatives of Labour Party Ministers. That has not happened before, certainly not on that scale.  However, the Minister was very coy when she spoke about learning lessons because not long ago, in April, it was announced that a former RTE journalist and press officer for the Labour Party would work as the Minister's press officer but that, in the meantime, she would work for one of the Labour Party candidates in the European elections.  When I read that I wondered whether the Minister sponsoring this Bill <Col N="1375" /> had learned the lessons she claimed should have been learned.</P>
    <P>If I might quote the religious cliché, there is a difference between prayer and doing good deeds.  Prayer alone will not result in our salvation; we need to do good deeds as well and make the rhetoric a reality, yet on so many occasions that has not been the case.</P>
    <P>When launching the Bill the Tánaiste spoke about the public having a right to know.  I agree but the public has not been given that right by the Tánaiste, the man who was going to bring trust into politics. I will give a couple of examples of where the ethics in public office, which this Bill is supposed to be about, have not been practised and where openness and the public's right to know have not been honoured.</P>
    <P>Take the current issue of the appointment of the next President of the European Commission.  The public have not been told why the Government vetoed the appointment of Mr. Peter Sutherland and effectively prevented him from having any chance of becoming the President of the European Commission.  I know, and most people here know, that there was a great chance that, if his name had been on the table in Corfu, Mr. Peter Sutherland would have been an acceptable compromise candidate.  There was nobody against him except his own Government, his own country.  I do not merely advocate his appointment because he is Irish, although I think that is important, we are a small country on the periphery of Europe at a time when enormous challenges face the Community. In the main I advocate him because of his calibre, his commitment to Europe and his record in previous portfolios, that of Commissioner for Competition which he held formerly and his present post as Director-General of GATT.  Those are the main reasons he would have been an excellent choice as the forthcoming President of the European Commission.  He would have had great status and clout, and have been a great ambassador for Ireland.  In political terms he would have done the equivalent <Col N="1376" /> of what the Irish soccer team are doing for us, very successfully, in the United States.  The Tánaiste has not told us the truth about that, he has not ensured that the public has a right to know.  For example, did foreign Ministers communicate with the Tánaiste, officially or unofficially, and say they would be prepared to support the candidacy of Mr. Peter Sutherland?  Why has the Tánaiste been so silent about this matter in recent weeks?  Have we not a right to hear from him?  If the Tánaiste was in my position he would be assailing the Government of the day for its shortcomings &mdash; he was never slow at doing so &mdash; and we gave a right to know.</P>
    <P>The public also have a right to know what happened at the Edinburgh Summit and the famous £8 billion but were never told.  The public had a right to know before the European elections where the cutbacks would be implemented in the National Development Plan but were not told.  The public had a right to know things about the passport affair with which I now want to deal in the context of what is legal and right, and there is a difference.  The Minister for Justice said in this House &mdash; I want to quote her exact words because it is important: &ldquo;There was nothing underhand, this was an ordinary transaction.&rdquo; I challenge that statement, it was not an ordinary transaction. There are only 20 such applications a year.  Is it not extraordinary that one such application should benefit the family business of the Taoiseach?  I do not think that is an ordinary matter.  The Minister for Justice told the House that, to qualify, there had to be a permanent investment, a commitment to the country and residency here for a considerable period.  No such criteria were honoured.  It was a soft loan of £1.1 million at a 5 per cent interest rate.  There was no residency here.  It was not a permanent investment.  All the criteria the Minister for Justice told the House were necessary were broken and yet she said it was not underhanded or extraordinary.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, on 1 June 1994 on the same matter said that the criteria excluded any soft loan but <Col N="1377" /> included a residency requirement.  Yet, a few days later, even though it was a soft loan and there was no residency he told us the matter was properly handled because he had looked at the files.</P>
    <P>How can anybody believe in somebody who can change their tune so much about something that is so fundamental?  As politicians we must give example.  The Taoiseach was the biggest shareholder in that company, the greatest beneficiary of that soft loan.  It is not extraordinary that a colleague of the Taoiseach meets a man he never met before and is able to give a character reference and say he will invest in a company in the midlands that will create jobs &mdash; a criteria for the passport under the business migration scheme &mdash; and yet he did not know where the investment would take place and he said he never asked.  It is difficult to accept all of that is true.  I am not suggesting people are telling lies but I am saying it was no ordinary matter.  It was an extraordinary matter where one Minister was able to do something to help another; where one Minister told us it was discussed at Cabinet and a former Minister said it was not or <i>vice versa</i> and the Tánaiste was able to say the whole affair was properly handled. Those kinds of decisions bring politics into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we create a society where fair play operates and where all people have the same entitlement to compete. The public tendering system that operates here is not fair.  I tabled a parliamentary question yesterday on the Tallaght Hospital and the subcontract element of that hospital.  I am not happy with what I hear about it.  A contract worth almost £4 million, the biggest single contract ever in its field, has been awarded to a company and I believe the proper procedures have not been in place.  Were the procedures followed to ensure that the successful tenderers have their tax affairs and company registration office filing requirements in order?  What procedures were followed to ensure that the successful tenderers had a profitable trading record and how many years were investigated?  Have any of the successful tenderers received, in the last five years, <Col N="1378" /> special mitigation of tax liabilities because they were not able to pay their tax?  What procedures were followed to ensure that the successful tenderers have sufficient experience and competent staff to ensure they can undertake and complete the relevant contract?  Are the financial resources of all the successful tenderers sufficiently adequate and financially secure to ensure they are capable of undertaking and completing the contract?</P>
    <P>The greatest level of public disquiet exists in the award of public contracts.  In the Dáil on 3 March 1994 my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, asked a question of the Minister for Finance on the Kentz Corporation, a company which owes £11 million to the Revenue Commissioners, a company that had a tax clearance certificate and was able to tender for public works.  The Revenue Commissioners acquiesced in the appointment of an examiner even though there would have been a preferential creditor had there been merely a receiver.  Various questions were asked.  The Minister, in reply, said that, because of confidentiality, he would not be able to give any answer, that we are not entitled to answers unless we are asking a question on behalf of the company.  We are not entitled to ask questions on behalf of the taxpayer and the public.  The Minister's answer that day sums up the type of cynicism that most people feel about politics.  They have a view that if things go wrong there will be no answers, no transparency or openness.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister and the Tánaiste.  They can do more for politics and for ethics in public office by having transparency and openness and by telling people what is going on.  I look forward to the freedom of information legislation. We do not need freedom of information legislation if Ministers adopt that attitude. It has already been established at the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry that if Dáil questions were answered we would not need many of these inquiries and tribunals.  In a democracy debate and openness are important.  In a democracy Ministers <Col N="1379" /> should be accountable and should give answers because we all hold office on behalf of the public.  That has not happened and that is why I find it so difficult to accept that the culture referred to earlier is not still rampant in all sections of the Government as well as a reluctance to give information.</P>
    <P>On the passport issue I recall hearing representatives of the Labour Party say: &ldquo;It happened before we went into office&rdquo;. During the presidential election when a particular matter arose, even though it happened eight years earlier, the Labour Party was first to put down a motion of no confidence in the Government.  The time factor was not relevant then and should not be relevant now.  The only reason it is not relevant now is because it is in Government.  If the rhetoric is not made reality this Bill, and similar Bills, rather than reduce public cynicism in politics and public service here will increase it.  That will have enormous consequences for all of us and our democratic institutions.</P>

      <P>When the Labour Party decided to enter into a partnership Government with Fianna Fáil one of our principal objectives was to restore confidence in the democratic process by encouraging greater openness and participation at all levels, by improving public accountability, transparency and trust and by ensuring the highest standards in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with our commitment to open Government and transparency in Government actions, we ensured that proposals to enact an ethics in public office Bill, a register of Members' interests and a similar register of interests for senior civil servants, special advisers etc. would be included in the Joint Programme for a Partnership Government. Despite opposition, and the whingeing <Col N="1380" /> from those who should know better, despite the many and varied interests who would see such legislation as a threat, Labour in Government is delivering on its commitments and the Ethics in Public Office Bill is another step in restoring confidence in the democratic process.</P>
    <P>Down through the years, but particularly during the past two decades, there has been growing concern among the public about the activities of numerous business interests and their possible connections with politicians and political parties. While there may not have been any hard evidence to suggest that some politicians were abusing their positions, there is definitely a public perception that a number of politicians worked hand in glove with certain commercial and financial interests over the years at the expense of the public good.</P>
    <P>I am amused that some politicians were initially opposed to this legislation.  We were told there was no need for such ethics legislation in Ireland.  We were told it reflected badly on this House and its Members.  Indeed, it was suggested that Irish politicians were incorruptible and when one entered this House one entered the isle of saints and scholars.  However, those of us who live in the real world know better.  The great majority of people who enter public life are honest and decent but there will always be some with their own agenda who have little or no interest in the public good.  We must recognise that possible conflicts of interests can arise between the private interests of some people in senior public office or employment and indeed the public interest.  In such situations, it is vital to public confidence and trust that people working on their behalf put the public interest first.</P>
    <P>This Bill will bring real benefits to the Dáil and Seanad by providing for greater openness as regards business interests held by Members.  Disclosure of interest, by all Deputies and Senators in a public register and the disclosure of certain private interests will enable the public to see the clear separation of public and private interests.  The Bill adopts a particularly <Col N="1381" /> firm approach in ensuring the careful separation of private and public interests of office holders and the formal recording of any instances where conflicts of interests may arise.  This is done by imposing obligations on Ministers and Ministers of State in addition to those for ordinary Members.  These requirements are far reaching and comprehensive. They address family interests, conflicts of interests in performance of ministerial functions, gifts and special advisers.  In addition to the annual public statement of their interests, office holders must provide a confidential statement of those interests of a spouse or child, of which they are aware, and which could materially influence them in their work.</P>
    <P>These statements will be provided to the independent commission which will oversee the implementation of key aspects of the Bill. Any gift over £500 given to an office holder, spouse or child by virtue of ministerial office will become the property of the State.  The Bill also proposes far reaching guidelines on the provision of property or services free or below cost to an office holder, spouse or child arising from ministerial office.</P>
    <P>All Ministers and Ministers of State will have to lay details of contracts of appointment of advisers before the House and in the case of senior advisers will have to set out their qualifications for the position and provide an annual statement of the interests of that adviser which might be relevant to his or her job.  The Bill specifically requires that the appointment of each special adviser ends with the termination of office of the office holder and that the Government may not appoint such advisers to permanent positions in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable the Government to require anyone in a directorship in the public service to make an annual statement of interests and an <i>ad hoc</i> statement where conflict of interest may directly arise.  The Bill will ensure that this will happen in any case where the public interest would be best served by such a disclosure.  The Bill sets out strict requirements to be followed when a direct conflict <Col N="1382" /> of interest arises.  Compliance with the Bill's provisions in respect of annual statements of interests and <i>ad hoc</i> statements of conflict of interest will be a condition of employment.  Failure to comply will result in a breach of contract and expose the individual concerned to servere disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>The net result of these provisions is that the public can be fully confident that public servants act in the public good and that any contravention of this principle can be investigated and dealt with effectively. The real benefit for the public service is that the Bill will demonstrate the commitment and integrity of our public servants who have served this country so well.  The Bill is comprehensive, well focused and well designed.  It carefully balances its requirements by reference to the power of the positions involved.</P>
    <P>Recently in my constituency we had a case which raises many questions about the role of politicians and public servants. Four weeks ago at a meeting of Sligo Corporation from which the press was excluded, an attempt was made to sell off a large development site in Sligo town worth in excess of £50,000 for less than half its price to two local developers.  This land was not advertised for sale or put on the open market to allow all citizens and developers an opportunity to make a bid for it.  When I objected to the proposed sale of the site at the time, I said that any attempt to sell off public property for less than half its value in a private deal behind closed doors could only be described as outrageous and appalling.  I pointed out that not only would it be unethical but would be bad business practice and an affront to the people of Sligo.</P>
    <P>That the property was owned by the Office of Public Works at the time has caused further confusion.  If the Office of Public Works wished to sell public property to the developers in question why did it not do so directly?  Why did it insist on disposing of the property to Sligo Corporation on condition that it would be sold for half its value to the two private developers?  It would now appear that the Office of Public Works was precluded <Col N="1383" /> by law from selling this site to private developers without placing it for sale on the open market.  It appeared to be using the local authority to sell it to the named developers for less than half its value. Many members of the public have since asked if this was some type of laundering operation.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, due to my objections, the fact that this matter became public knowledge and the expressions of interest in the property by other developers, corporation officials eventually recommended that the proposed sale of the property should not go ahead.  Many questions have been raised rightly by the general public as a result of this controversy. It has been asked if this type of affair occurred in the past behind closed doors in other places.  In this context, we urgently require ethics in public office legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about deepening our democracy through greater openness and transparency.  It is about honestly showing the public that we in the Houses of the Oireachtas have nothing to hide and enabling the Government to demonstrate that the power of public office is used for the common good.  It is about confirming the integrity of those in public service and more fundamentally, building greater public confidence in our democracy through disclosure and the clear separation of public and private interests. The great majority of people in public life have nothing to hide.  In due course the Ethics in Public Office Bill will demonstrate this.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as landmark legislation which fulfils a key commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government and sets out comprehensive measures to ensure greater transparency and accountability in the conduct of public business.  The Labour Party is delivering on its commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I listened to this debate, I could not help thinking that it is very difficult for the Labour Party to win on many issues and for the Government to win on this Bill.  Some of the <Col N="1384" /> critics have said that it is flawed and not strong enough while others have said that it is too intrusive almost as if Big Brother is looking over the shoulder of public representatives and civil servants.  It is very difficult to determine who is right and who is wrong.  Why, if the Bill is so bad and so weak, have the critics not brought forward their own Bill?  Fine Gael has been in office many times while the Progressive Democrats have been in office more recently and neither made any attempt to introduce an ethics Bill.  I do not therefore take their criticisms too seriously.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney, who has now left the House, said that this is a cosmetic exercise; it is not.  The Bill marks a serious attempt to introduce legislation on a sensitive but important matter.  Last week her colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, came into this House with all guns blazing.  I was reminded of the charge of the light brigade which is appropriate given that the Progressive Democrats are getting lighter every day.  They are falling apart at the seams very rapidly.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell, who is a member of the legal profession, led the charge on this Bill in a flamboyant and swashbuckling speech.  He gave good value for money and I enjoyed his contribution. Indeed, his performance have reminded me of the boy on the burning deck.  I put it to him that he should look at ethics in his own party, with particular reference to selection conventions, or more nearer home, at ethics in the legal profession, particularly the restrictive practices used by its members to boost the earnings of senior and junior counsel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal profession is not squeamish when it comes to taking money from anybody, be they bank robbers or drug dealers. They never refuse money and do not worry about ethics when it comes to taking money from criminals.  That is how they make their living in many cases.  Let the Deputy look into that and come back to us on it.  I did not take the Deputy too seriously.  If he was serious about this matter he would have drafted his own Bill as an economist and member of the legal profession he would be well capable <Col N="1385" /> of drafting a Bill to highlight any of our deficiencies.</P>
    <P>Likewise Deputy Rabbitte of Democratic Left who also criticised could have drafted a Private Members' Bill if he was so concerned.  Democratic Left which originated from Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin the Workers Party and The Workers Party is not in any position to talk about ethics. In the last Seanad elections, having condemned each other during the course of the campaign, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left came together to make arrangements to elect each other.  I saw nothing ethical in that arrangement.  While it may have been pragmatic and effective, one could not describe it as ethical.</P>
    <P>There has been much misrepresentation and distortion of this Bill which sets out to achieve certain objectives. It seeks to ensure that the public have a right to know that private interests do not influence the decisions of policy-makers, be they public representatives or civil servants.  It also sets out to separate public and private interests of politicians and civil servants.  As my colleague, Deputy Bree, said, money can sometimes distort democracy which is not a fixed or static entity but a developing process.  Financial dealings have become more sophisticated and complex recently and this legislation attempts to keep pace with the rapidly changing financial world and to ensure that these financial dealings do not damage or infringe on the public interest or the democratic process.</P>
    <P>The Bill is working towards more open Government and administration.  As Deputy Bree also said, some well-known politicians have enriched themselves by using privilege or inside information to advance their financial interests and those of their friends.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney was critical of the Labour Party, but the foundation of her party would warrant a thesis.  The Progressive Democrats Party received a large amount of money from private business interests but its members were not concerned from where the money came and there were no ethical considerations in its use to boost the party's image to <Col N="1386" /> have some of its members elected to the Dáil and the Seanad.  Members of the Progressive Democrats when elected to this House acted as if butter would not melt in their mouths but, like all of us, they are robust politicians.  Many of them are former members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Deputies Harney and O'Malley were Members of the House during the Taca days and there was nothing very ethical about Taca.  Deputy Deasy was also around in those days.  Deputies O'Malley or Harney were not very concerned about the dealings of Taca and the other fund-raising groups involved. They are not &ldquo;born again Progressive Democrats&rdquo;; like Democratic Left they have come up through the democratic process.  They do not fool me by coming into this House like sheep and acting as if butter would not melt in their mouths. I do not accept that attitude.  They should accept that most of the large parties here have been funded by donations from big businesses in the private sector, but my party received no such money.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not perfect or written in tablets of stone.  There is room for improvement and if worthwhile amendments are tabled on Committee Stage, they will be considered.  Other speakers referred to the passport controversy and applications for citizenship.  The Bill can be amended to cater for them.  I was made aware of people's feelings on that matter on the doorsteps of Minister in the run-up to the European elections. People's feelings on the matter are well known and I am concerned about what happened.  Not everybody believes the statements that were made.  I hope this Bill will improve the position and alleviate concerns in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill also sets out practical requirements for public representatives, including Ministers and civil servants, which can be easily met by honest politicians. If necessary, those requirements can be improved.  The economist, Galbraith, referred to cultural contentment.  We have cultural contentment in our society even though it is disturbed at times.  We frequently take things for granted.  We are a tribalistic society and tend to accept <Col N="1387" /> the nod and wink approach.  We look up to swashbucklers with an heroic air about them and fail to consider how they achieved their money.  The Bill proposes to curtail the activities of such swashbucklers, people who have made a great deal of money in the past by using inside information and private, privileged knowledge.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney was critical of the appointment of programme managers, advisers and other officials and quoted a figure of £2 million for them.  She said we are not receiving good value for money from those people, but she has a blinkered attitude to the matter.  I am satisfied that those advisers and programme managers are giving good value for money. One cannot look at this in a blinkered fashion.  Are the relatively well paid senior officials in other semi-State and State establishments giving similar value for money.  I would be happy if they were. The Government's programme managers and advisers are giving far better value for money than most public officials.  If they assist in providing a more transparent Administration and in introducing more legislation, they will have justified their stewardship.  So far as I am concerned Members who are critical of them are merely playing to the gallery in an attempt to score cheap points.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney went on to advance the name of Peter Sutherland for President of the European Commission.  On the one hand, she accused the Labour Party of nepotism and appointing members of its party to various posts and then went on to advocate Peter Sutherland for President of the Commission.  Surely that is another form of nepotism.  Opposition members are shedding crocodile tears, not in an attempt to advance Peter Sutherland's case but in an effort to embarrass the Government.  Most of the time they do not believe what they say.  I certainly have doubts about Deputy Bruton's enthusiasm for Mr. Sutherland, he is using this matter to embarrass the Government.  I do not believe what Deputy Harney said earlier.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a step in the right direction <Col N="1388" /> and some of the criticisms of it have been knocked on the head.  For example, the tax amnesty brought £240 million into the Exchequer and the Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, spent most of it on worthwhile projects.  I have not heard anybody say that we should give back that money.  We chose the lesser of two evils and it will be more difficult for those who have been brought into the tax net under the amnesty to evade paying their taxes in the future.  Also, the penalties for tax evaders are much more draconian. From where does the Opposition propose the Government should get £350 million to pay off the transitional payments to married women as a result of the success of the equality case in Europe?  On the one hand, Members opposite criticise the Government for public expenditure and, on the other, they demand such payments. Such inconsistent attitudes are unfair.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill is passed by the House today.  It is not the Holy Grail, but an honest attempt to make public life better.</P>

      <P>The last thing I would wish to see brought into this debate is politics. The trust of the debate should be to do what is best for everybody.  The Bill is inadequate, but it is a definite attempt to improve the position.  What we should be talking about is ethics in every walk of life and in that regard the best thing to do is to start with Members of the Oireachtas.  We are addressing only a minor detail of a much greater problem relating to dishonesty and racketeering. I do not believe anybody will be deterred by this legislation from acting illegally if they wish to do so.  There are very few dishonest politicians, but those few will drive through this legislation with a coach-and-four and laugh all the way to the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened to those who made a fortune from their inside knowledge of the affairs of the Irish Sugar Company? People made millions, but nothing happened. What has happened to those who made millions of pounds from the scandal in Aer Lingus Holidays?  We are told periodically that proceedings are taking <Col N="1389" /> place.  I take all those pious aspirations and statements with a grain of salt because I have not heard of one of those people being charged not to mention going to prison, but a mother of ten would be sent to prison for six months for stealing an item worth 50p from a supermarket.</P>
    <P>The bigger the crime the more likely the offender is to get away with it.  I am sure Members will have heard of Tammany Hall in the United States.  The Irish were instrumental in organising the rackets. I expect other nationalities came around to seeing the error of the Irish ways and tried to stop them.  They have stopped them to a considerable extent.  It is not uncommon to see one or more of the advisers to the President of the United States going to prison for breaking the law.</P>
    <P>Recently, I heard that 14 members of President Reagan's administration were sent to prison.  How many members of any administration here appeared in court or spent one day in prison?  An American President was impeached, dismissed from office by his peers.  Could that happen here?  It could not because dishonesty and criminality are ingrained in our society to such a degree that the bulk of the general public will clap a person on the back even if he or she is known to have swindled millions of pounds as long as that person gets away with it.  We live in a society where the main object is not to be caught.  With the best will in the world I do not believe this legislation will catch the perpetrators, those who are abusing the system.  We cannot pass retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>We know of politicians who have made millions of pounds dishonestly because of membership of this House.  They are great in the eyes of many people.  That saps the morale of decent people.  They have given up on this long ago and do not believe that anybody will be prosecuted, convicted and put behind bars.  Many people reached the point of despair long ago.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Greencore, Aer Lingus Holidays and I could also mention Telecom, episodes into which some of our <Col N="1390" /> strongest and most powerful financial figures have had an input.  What has become of those scandals?  I am not making a political issue out of this.  The Labour Party received a big vote in the last election because it expressed the view that it would deal effectively with these law breakers and those whom I would call major criminals.  If this Bill helped to do that I would applaud it, but we cannot legislate in retrospection.  Who will pursue those people?  The system under which we work is one of nods and winks.  It is difficult to get hard evidence and to get people to swear in court that a crime was committed and fraudulent activity took place although we all know it has taken place.</P>
    <P>We are all waiting, with bated breath, the publication of the report of the beef tribunal.  If people at the top are indicated by it we will have to wait and see if we have the guts to follow the matter through.  What has become of the planning scandals, the rezoning, particularly by members of Dublin County Council, where huge sums of money passed between certain individuals?  Nothing has happened.  What about the continual abuses by certain local authorities of section 4 motions, a device to override and undo the regular planning process? That can only be used with an ulterior motive.  Sometimes a county manager or a planning officer could be so intransigent that a section 4 motion would be needed to address a problem, but when local authorities apply section 4 motions week in, week out, one would be a fool if one did not realise corruption was involved. Corruption is the word that applies in relation to Greencore, Telecom, Aer Lingus Holidays or the rezoning of agricultural land for building and industrial purposes.  The list is probably very long but those are some of the obvious ones which involved millions of pounds for a number of individuals, none of whom has been or will be brought before the courts.  I do not believe I am wrong.</P>
    <P>The system is as crooked as a corkscrew and we should face up to that.  That is not the fault of Members of this House, it is ingrained in our society.  Maybe there <Col N="1391" /> are a few sharp operators in the House, but by and large politicians are strictly honest.  However, there is a system of crookedness which nobody has attempted to unfurl.  I would like to believe otherwise, but I am afraid this legislation will not scratch the surface of that crooked system.</P>
    <P>I will be lambasted for making the following statement.  The media have much to answer for because &mdash; I will not say it condones &mdash; it goes along with the belief that what is happening is crooked and that crooked people are fine people unless they are caught.  Above all, we lack investigative journalism.  We do not have the investigative programmes like <i>The Cook Report or World in Action</i> or other such programmes which we receive through British and American networks. We do not have that system because we are too cosy.  Many political correspondents, editors, radio and television programme presenters and managers are too cosy.  They are part of the social set and they do not want to upset the apple cart.  Their attitude appears to be, we have a lovely system so why rock the boat?  Am I a fool, am I wrong?  I do not think so, but I will be portrayed as being wrong and told that I should not have said what I said.  The way they do that is to ignore me, black me out or pretend I did not make that statement or that I do not exist.  Society is answerable and, with due respect to the Minister she is doing her best, but she has not a hope, others are laughing at her.  She is naive, an innocent abroad and I do not say that with any malice; I say it in all sincerity.  Stronger people than her have tried but they were pushed into the background and left talking to themselves as if they were cases for a mental home.  That is what happens. The system as it stands cannot be beaten and, unless we take on the people who are allowing it to happen, nothing will be done.  I probably should have brought a prepared script with me, but I did not so it takes a bit of effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not at all.  I could say too much.  It seems that everybody has given up.  Deputy spring and the Labour Party polled strongly at the last election because they held out the promise that they would do something about corruption, about the golden circles.  The higher up people were, the more corrupt they were, and the Labour Party promised to do something about it.  This Bill is the result, but it does not address the problem.</P>
      <P>Power corrupts and it even happens in politics.  I would like to see politicians being honest enough to admit that society is rotten with insincerity and financial corruption.  I am amazed that so few Members are offering to speak.  The reason they are opting out is that they have given up hope.  I will not give up.  We should all stick with it.  I admire people on all sides of the House who are courageous. Deputy Kemmy speaks his mind but does not get the appreciation he deserves.  Deputy McDowell speaks his mind and although everybody may not agree with him, he says it.  Such people are too few and the indifference of the vast majority means that the few who speak out are not listened to.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Deasy I am not giving up hope.  I welcome the Bill and I see it as setting down certain minimum rules of conduct.  Nothing in this Bill as it applies to the office holder could be described as difficult or extraordinary and I am happy to comply with its provisions.</P>
      <P>However, this legislation does not provide for ethics in Government.  No legislation could do that.  Some have commented that this Bill represents a coming of age of politicians.  In bringing in this legislation politicians are supposed to be facing reality and dealing with it. With the benefit of hindsight I suspect that this Bill will be viewed less as a coming of age than as a loss of innocence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 20 years that I have been a public representative there has been no significant drop in standards in public life, ethical or otherwise.  In certain respects standards have risen.  As our population <Col N="1393" /> has become more educated and informed, so too have our politicians. Anyone who compares the make-up of this House with that of 20 years ago would see a great deal of change not only in personnel but in the type of person coming here.  What has also changed significantly is the level of scrutiny to which politicians are now subject.  The electronic media provide an instant and enlarged view of our affairs.  Significantly, television particularly is not geared towards any type of in-depth coverage of issues.  In recent years the print media have increasingly tended towards the sensational.  Furthermore, commentary rather than reporting is the norm in political coverage in the print media.</P>
    <P>It is fair to ask if the perceived drop in political standards is about politicians or how they are portrayed.  The current price war between British newspapers and the potentially devastating effect on Irish publishing could have a greater effect on Irish political ethics than any Bill published in this House.  The Minister could probably do more for the standing of Irish politics by removing the 12 per cent VAT on Irish newspapers than by worrying about who might be paying for my lunch.  If Irish politicians think they are getting a raw deal now from the media, God help us when Rupert Murdoch comes along.  The spectacle of Irish politics viewed through a telephoto lens hidden in bushes would hardly be edifying.</P>
    <P>This Bill meets a perceived need in that, like Caesar's wife, we must be beyond reproach.  Legislation like this may bring about greater transparency but it will not create ethics in politics.  It should also be borne in mind that, with transparency, there is a law of diminishing returns.  Respect for politics has been undermined, not by thieves but by knaves.  Innuendo and unsubstantiated charges, made under cover of parliamentary privilege have become the order of the day in some quarters.  Irish politics are being undermined by a fifth column who are prepared to undermine the institutions they supposedly serve for short term advantage.  A pattern has <Col N="1394" /> arisen of the few wrapping themselves in righteousness and then promptly abandoning any ethical consideration or principle in pursuit of the lowest political considerations.  Much, if not all, this behaviour has come from the Progressive Democrats.  Almost singlehandedly they have done more to undermine confidence in politics than any alleged scandal.  They are now at the point where their own clearly exhibited double standards are an open sore on the Irish body politic.  Much play has been made of the &ldquo;gravy train&rdquo; enjoyed by politicians.  None made more hay out of this than the Progressive Democrats.  Their then pensionable Ministers made an especially ostentatious virtue of renouncing their ministerial pensions but that vow of poverty was soon broken.  Not only did they break their vow of poverty, they went on to break their vows of chastity and obedience. That pillar of public virtue, Deputy O'Malley, did a U-turn on his promise to the people of Limerick not to run for the European Parliament.  He sought to double his Dáil salary of £31,495 to £62,990 by seeking election as an MEP. On top of double jobbing, Deputy O'Malley would have been happy to collect a basic salary of £77,000 before collecting a pension and a double scoop of allowances as an MEP and Dáil Deputy. On £77,851 a year it must be very easy to sleep the sleep of the just and righteous.</P>
    <P>Of course the Progressive Democrats are entitled to their wages, but they are not entitled to drag Irish politics down by their litany of broken promises.  The contrast between their public virtues and private vices could not be greater.  Will Deputy O'Malley request the taxpayers to fund his considerable cost at the Beef Tribunal?  He has not yet denied that suggestion?  Are we to take his silence as suggesting that he will ask the taxpayers to fund these costs, which are suggested to be £750,000?  The people of Munster served the Progressive Democrats, including Deputy O'Malley, their just desserts.</P>
    <P>No consideration of ethics in politics would be complete without the observation that it was the Progressive Democrats <Col N="1395" /> who, in repeated fits of Miltonic pride, would sooner rule in hell than serve in heaven.  Sadly, because of certain perceptions, this legislation is now a political necessity but law cannot create virtue.  There is no substitute for personal integrity, and anyone who has not learned the difference between right and wrong before they come into politics is not likely to learn it here.  Ethics in politics are about decent people trying to do the right thing.  As well as not putting your hand in the till ethics in politics are about pursuing policies bravely and consistently, about resisting pressure, even if that means unpopularity.  Our ethical standards will be judged by the way we respond to the crisis at TEAM Aer Lingus and other crucial issues. Ethics are not a composite of easy options, smart remarks and wishful thinking.  Fundamentally ethics are outside the scope of this Bill and all other legislation.  This Bill simply increases transparency in public affairs.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an amendment suggested last week by the Minister.  While I understand her reasons for such amendment I would sound a note of caution because it might make the job of governing cumbersome and difficult.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A fundamental point is being missed both in the Bill and in the debate so far.  What is happening is that a two tier society is developing.  I recall what attracted me to politics in the early 1960s.  It was not the concept of the local socialist who lived on the back road, in the big house with a swimming pool, while there was no such facility as a swimming pool for the remainder of the people.  I have been often asked since why I joined Fine Gael.  There were many fine people in the Labour Party at that <Col N="1396" /> time for whom I had great regard, such as the late Brendan Corish and the late Frank Cluskey, but I did not see anything in what was put forward by that party as socialism that was in the interests of the ordinary people.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand people who practice capitalism in purporting to support socialism for the masses.  Many such capitalists are millionaires who live off the backs of ordinary people.  Some of those who brand themselves &ldquo;socialists&rdquo; know as much about the working man or woman as did the Shah of Iran.</P>
      <P>In the 1960's people such as Declan Costello and a young Garret FitzGerald held out hope, hope of a just society, and that attracted many people to Fine Gael. It caught the imagination of many but the talk now is of an economy, not a country. Everyone refers to economics, and the rules are constantly changing.  We are told now that there is an economic boom, that inflation is low, the debt-GNP ratio is under control and that there are improved growth rates.  God be with the times when economic success was measured by unemployment and emigration statistics.</P>
      <P>The basic flaw in this Bill is that we are being told the big lie by the Government, and we have bought it hook, line and sinker.  We have sold our hearts and souls to the economists.  The sooner we call a spade a spade, identify matters accurately and compel Governments to be accountable, the sooner we will have ethics in Government.  The motto of Governments in this country has become, &ldquo;the truth is what we say it is&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that there is a two tier society.  There are those who are milking the system, who are in the golden circle, and there are those who are living, primarily in cities but also in rural areas, in extremely difficult circumstances.  There are people living in flat complexes which, as I have been trying to persuade the House for the last ten years, should be refurbished.  However there has been little support in this House for that area. There are 10,000 people living between the canals in Dublin, in local authority flat complexes which nobody in this <Col N="1397" /> House would aspire to live in.  We should not tolerate those living conditions for our citizens.  I have raised this matter time and again with Ministers and at committees, but nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>As Lord Mayor of Dublin I set up the Lord Mayor's Commission on Housing, chaired by Dr. Garret FitzGerald who presented what has been referred to as the best report on housing since 1914. The response was by way of meagre advances, putting windows in flat complexes. For the people who live in very bad conditions in those flat complexes, third level education is not even on the agenda.  We talk about justice, a just society, socialism and so on, but we cannot make people equal.  We should at least tell that truth.  However, we can give people equal opportunities, and the way to do so is to give them access to decent housing and third level education.</P>
    <P>We should get rid of the &ldquo;isms&rdquo;.  Socialism has not changed very much&mdash;I regret to say this because I know I am provoking many people who hold strong views in this regard, and I respect their right to hold those views &mdash; from the time of the socialist on the back road, with his big swimming pool in the front garden.  These people do not know much about the working classes, and that is the problem. If we are serious about changing ethics in public office we should concentrate on the people in the inner circle and remember the Telecom Éireann scandal, the Greencore scandal and the Aer Lingus Holidays scandal.  A few of those involved in those scandals were Members of this House and some of them are continuing in public office, appointed by Governments who are supposed to be accountable to this House.</P>
    <P>When will we get honest answers to questions?  As the Chairman of the Beef Tribunal stated, if a proper parliamentary system operated here we would not have had the scandal of that inquiry.  Can the Minister opposite say what is to be done about making answer time as interesting as Question Time? When a Member of Parliament asks a question he or she should get an honest <Col N="1398" /> answer.  When will civil servants be imbued with the tradition that you do not hide the truth from Parliament?  Parliament should be told the truth.  We, the elected representatives of the people, should get straight answers to our questions. That is what ethics in Government is about and when we see it we will have ethics in Government and in public office.</P>
    <P>It is a nonsense to toy with it here. Politicians are constantly jibing at themselves and weakening the body politic. They have handed power to all types of commissions but some of the people who have been put in control of the great assets of this State have abused their position; nothing has been done about it and they were allowed walk away.  If a poor devil was caught with his hand in the till taking £20, he would lose his job in the public service and would be barred from appointment forever.  A constituent of mine was barred from taking up a trainee appointment in Telecom Éireann, before it became a semi-State company, because on one occasion he urinated in public on his way home from a pub when he was 19 years old.  He was brought to court and thereafter was barred from appointment to the public service for the rest of his life.  I raised that question in the House time and again but he still was not given the job even though he had been selected for it.  Ethics in Government? That did not happen to any of the boys at the top or any of those involved in the big scandals and it will not happen under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say it straight to the Minister's face but this Bill was prepared by a naive Minister with the assistance of naive and inexperienced civil servants with probably a few political lackeys throwing it in.  It is not a good Bill.  It is not a smart move and it will not deal with real ethics in Government because the Minister does not understand the basic needs of the second tier.  The Minister is part of the first tier, part of the inner golden circle.  The Minister and a great many like her hide behind a brand of socialism which would be enough to make decent socialists who are dead and <Col N="1399" /> buried, such as Frank Cluskey and Brendan Corish, turn in their graves.  Let me say that it does not apply to everyone and I am sure the vast majority are not in that category.  This Bill goes nowhere near dealing with the real problem of ethics in public office.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty whatsoever with the declaration of interests.  I see no reason why this should not be the case, but it will be used by some journalists who constantly titillate the interests of the public by claiming that TDs are earning £60,000 per annum, because somebody has an outside interest which is yielding more than £2,000 per annum. We cannot do anything about that except perhaps introduce an ethics in journalism Bill or ethics in trade unions Bill.  The real base of power has gone from this House.  Decisions were made behind closed doors during the negotiations leading to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Some trade unionists are earning very high salaries but we dare not criticise them.  They are like the church of old, we dare not criticise them.</P>
    <P>Trade unions have done a good job by and large but they should not be beyond examination and valid criticism.  Business people have said behind closed doors that their objective is to make profit and not job creation; they are negotiating with the Government of the day and making decisions behind closed doors.  How does this Bill affect them?  In so far as it affects Members what power do most Members, who are not members of the Government, yield?  Government backbenchers yield some power but they do not exercise it in this House, they exercise it at parliamentary party meetings or in cosy meetings with the Minister where there will be no declarations of interest.  It is total nonsense.</P>
    <P>The amounts above for which a Member must declare an interest have been set out in the Bill and I hope the Minister has allowed for indexation of the figures.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Mitchell I was reminded of a quotation I saw the other day about ethics being the greatest happiness of the greatest numbers. The big ethical scandal in this country is the scandal of unemployment, the lack of equal opportunity and the denial of social justice, as Deputy Mitchell said. I quite agree with him that this is the issue as well the secret deals which we have seen on pay agreements and various sectional interests.  This has meant that the real problem of unemployment has not been tackled in the way it should be. Dr. Kieran Kennedy, in an article which he wrote, said that he felt there was no moral or political consensus to really tackle unemployment.  As a member of the National Economic and Social Forum, which has been examining long term unemployment, I can say that the evidence we have looked at convinces me that he is right.  That is the big ethical question that needs to be tackled in this country.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Labour Party can come in here and ask us to consider its Bill without regard to its context.  I agree with the register of interest and the other contents in the Bill but when I put it in the context in which it is being introduced and the various actions of the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil in the past years, my point of view is different.  I think this Bill is designed to convince the rest of us that the Labour Party are the moral guardians, the people who can be trusted to keep Fianna Fáil straight.  The Labour Party wants to inspire confidence in politics. It is a shame that it is only periodically and selectively that it does this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has a grand title for a rather <Col N="1401" /> straightforward piece of legislation.  The title tells us more about the grandiosity of the Labour Party and its symbolic approach to ethics than what it tells us about the Bill.  There is no doubt that this register of interests legislation is common to many democracies.  It is absolutely essential and is a basic of civilised parliamentary democracy at the end of the 20th century.  Politics is complex.  Politicians are meant to be leaders in our society and the way we behave in this Parliament and the approach we take to ethical issues will influence the rest of society.  Whether a straightforward register of interest will lead to more ethical behaviour or reduced ethical conflicts of interest is questionable and is far from clear.  Would this Bill, if it had been enacted, have prevented any of the scandals we have seen in recent years?  That is open to question.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of the Bill need to be discussed on Committee Stage.  It has to be remembered that many Legislatures around the world have the most cumbersome and detailed disclosures of interests regulations.  An American Congressman told me Congress had a thick book covering ethical issues for Government but that does not mean that political scandals will not take place.  It is a clear indication that simply having a register of interests is not the answer and does not necessarily create the milieu for ethical behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets up a Commission of Investigation and Committees of the House. The Commission, which this Bill proposes to set up will have power to summon witnesses and send for records to help in its task.  I welcome that, yet committees in existence do not have these powers, which they ought to have. The committee system was meant to reform this House and change the way the House operates but the committees do not have power to send for witnesses and serious ethical questions can arise in the areas they discuss.</P>
    <P>The question raised by Deputy Dukes about what kind of abuse the measures were designed to guard against merits detailed discussion.  The discussion has <Col N="1402" /> been very interesting.  Some Members are despairing at the standard of morality in public life but I do not think we should fall into that habit.  The question of intent to deceive as opposed to a technical failure to comply is not dealt with.  Neither, of course, has there been any discussion on what constitutes political ethics and we have not been given any background to the register.  Members and others will have to make a statement of their interests and financial assets.  That is proper; it is right that income, directorships, ownership of land and paid positions are named but the register is nothing more than that and, unfortunately, will not guarantee more ethical behaviour in political life.  It cannot do that because it steers away from the real issues of power and influence, the pull and partiality and the corruption and favoured treatment that we see.</P>
    <P>The real questions concern the secret society that party politics has been in this country, the lack of information generally in our society and the public's right to know.  As an Opposition Deputy I am aware of the difficulties in assessing where real decisions are made; for instance, the ongoing appointments to State and semi-State boards, particularly of unqualified people who belong to a particular party.  We must think about the way that is influencing the quality of decision making in this country.  The ongoing influence that is exerted through those boards and other major appointments, and the secret nature of many of those appointments, is the real unethical behaviour in Irish political life.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party in Opposition had eyes and ears and honesty.  It knew about the contracts that were put out to tender, the bits of information that were given out and the deals that were done but now that it is in partnership, the Labour Party has no plans to do anything about those matters.  This Bill will not change the cynicism that exists about politics.  Unfortunately, political life will continue unchanged unless action is taken in a range of other areas.  The public has a right to more information and to have a <Col N="1403" /> more open society.  That is what ethics are about.</P>
    <P>I sat in this House for weeks listening to the debate on the Structural Funds. At the time I called it an &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; discussion.  Every time Ministers came in here and told half-truths and did not own up to the reality of the situation represented an abuse of power.  Their performances were shoddy and unethical and that continued day after day.  One can see here that information is continually kept from the Dáil. Deputy Mitchell is right about the changing power in this society and the way the Dáil is used.  That issue must be examined. Members of the Opposition must constantly face obstacles in their pursuit of the truth.  There is an imbalance in background resourcing compared to other Legislatures where a high level of information is available to politicians irrespective of who is in power.</P>
    <P>Although we criticise the United States, conflicts of interest can be identified as a result of the level of information available there.  The level of information available to Deputies in this House, however, is outrageous.  We will now invest £10 million in new buildings. That £10 million should be invested in trying to make this Parliament a more open, informed, democratic and resourced institution so that the level of discussion on a range if issues would be far higher.</P>
    <P>We must break the cynicism that exists in regard to politics and politicians.  This register will go some way towards achieving that but only high standards, open behaviour and clear information will help to break that cynicism.  The Labour Party's breach of trust in the last election was unethical.  Those people who voted Labour to keep Fianna Fáil out of office were very disappointed when they saw how the Labour Party had changed.  That was very unethical behaviour on the part of the Labour Party and it will have a long road to travel before that breach of trust is repaired.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Structural Funds debate, the changing National Development <Col N="1404" /> Plan, the approach adopted in regard to the passport issue, all of which lead to cynicism.  This Bill will not eliminate that cynicism but as a basic measure in terms of stating interests it is important and represents one step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>In the last election the Labour Party's election manifesto, &ldquo;Putting Trust Into Politics&rdquo;, proposed a range of measures to restore trust to politics, provide more open and better Government, ensure transparency in Government transactions and the establishment of a framework for Government that upholds the trust of the people.  The manifesto also called for a procedure for the declaration of interests and the disclosure by candidates and political parties of financial contributions.  Those measures were contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government which undertakes to enact an ethics in Government Bill, the registration of Members' interests, a similar registration of interests for senior civil servants and senior executives of State companies and the introduction of State funding for political parties in line with European models.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as significant and major legislation which implements the commitments given in the Labour Party manifesto and the Programme for a Partnership Government.  It is being enacted because the public has a right to know about the private interests that could potentially influence decisions taken by policy makers.  Public and private interests should remain separate.  The Bill recognises that in the complex world of financial and political life the potential for conflicts of interests has increased. The procedures proposed in the Bill provide a way of acknowledging and dealing with that potential conflict in a manner <Col N="1405" /> that enhances our democracy and our high standard of public service.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Bill is not concerned with catching out politicians. The vast majority of our politicians are hard working public servants who have entered public life not for financial advancement but for the good of the country.  Indeed, the Bill is not a new idea.  A public register of members' interests is a standard feature of most modern democracies.  Members of the Dáil who are or who have been members of local authorities have had no difficulty in declaring their interests at that level. Our MEPs have been declaring their interests for years.  Of course, for politicians, the ultimate judge of standards in public life is the electorate and the ultimate judgment takes place in the ballot box.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy Deasy who made an excellent contribution. He referred to the public perception of scandal and corruption and gave examples in that regard.  He referred to the question of land rezoning and the public perception of what was happening in that area.  I wish to comment on that because as a member of a local authority I witnessed some of those rezonings, particularly in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Part of my constituency in Dublin North-East takes in Baldoyle and Howth and because section 4 motions were amended by legislation which required a three-quarters majority, the only mechanism available for rezoning was the county development plan.</P>
    <P>Last year in County Dublin we witnessed some amazing attempts to rezone amenity land.  Several unsuccessful attempts were made to rezone the old Baldoyle racecourse which had been open space for 20 or 30 years.  Councillors who went completely against the wishes of the local people proposed motions and refused to turn up at public meetings which were called by the local people to discuss the proposals.  The councillors withdrew their motions only at the eleventh hour, following public protests outside the county council offices.  There was a similar experience in Howth.  Attempts <Col N="1406" /> were made to rezone a high amenity mountain area of Howth for housing development.  The councillors in that instance were going against public opinion.  Actions such as those raise questions about standards and the reasons why councillors, in particular, make such proposals.</P>
    <P>Some of the councillors to whom I have referred were members of the Opposition parties, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and other parties also.  This issue has been highlighted in the past and was referred to courageously by Deputy Deasy.  That action gave rise to the public cynicism about politicians in general. One of the reasons why this Bill has been brought before the House is to put in place mechanisms so that members of this House who may have conflicts of interests will be required to declare them. Procedures and committees will be established to deal with that.</P>
    <P>This comprehensive Bill enables the Government to bring any post or directorship in the public service within the scope of the Bill's requirements prescribing it as a &ldquo;designated position&rdquo; or &ldquo;designated directorship&rdquo;.  It means that not only civil servants, executives and directors of semi-State bodies come within the scope of the Bill but also health boards, local authorities and other local bodies.  In addition the provisions can apply to any organisation financed wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the following requirements for employees and board members in the State sector: an annual statement of one's interests and those of a spouse or child which could influence the performance of a job; a formal declaration where direct conflict of interest may arise in the course of work; a prohibition on acting where conflict arises unless there are compelling reasons to do so.  In such circumstances, a written explanation must be available to the independent commission and the local employer setting out the precise reasons.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it a condition of contracts of employment or appointment of each employee and board member that <Col N="1407" /> they fully comply with these requirements. Where a conflict of interest arises and a director or public servant performs the function without compelling reasons that person not only contravenes the Bill but breaches the contract of employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill builds on existing arrangements for board members set out in guidelines for State bodies and extends them to other State employees.  It is noteworthy that annual declarations of interests by board members and statements which arise in the context of a conflict of interest will be furnished to the independent commission.  Similarly, declarations by employees in designated positions of employment in the Civil Service and public service will be available to the commission.  These provisions firmly address the issue of disclosure of private interests by people in the public service and of the resolution of potential conflicts of their private interests with public business.</P>
    <P>The Bill is unequivocal regarding the appropriate action to be taken where such conflicts arise and establishes a powerful overseeing mechanism to facilitate compliance and identify contraventions. The provisions are comprehensive and effective in that they open up the disclosures of interests and conflicts of interests by those in the public service to scrutiny by an independent commission outside the individual's organisation.  The commission comprises the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Ceann Comhairle and Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad and has full powers to enable it to operate effectively.  Investigations of possible contraventions by designated directors and those in designated positions of employment may be initiated by the commission, a Minister or relevant public body.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the commission can require the attendance of the person who is the subject of the investigation, the attendance and giving of evidence by witnesses, the production of documents, etc. Failure to comply with a lawful instruction <Col N="1408" /> of the commission will be an offence akin to contempt.  Similarly the giving of false evidence will be akin to perjury. Such offences will be punishable by fine and other penalties laid down in the Bill. Where the commission finds that a civil servant, public servant or board member has contravened the Bill they will be in breach of their contract of employment and liable for disciplinary action. Depending on the circumstances of the contravention such sanctions range from loss of remuneration to suspension and other penalties.</P>
    <P>The Bill is tough on corruption.  It will strengthen and update existing statute in this area and ensure that the Prevention of Corruption Act applies not only to all public sector employees but to directors of public bodies as well as office holders and special advisers.  It sets out effective disclosure mechanisms to show that those in key positions in the public service act in the public interest.  I welcome the provisions which will demonstrate the integrity and commitment of our public servants who have and will continue to serve democracy well.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Mitchell who gave a lecture on his interpretation of socialism, why he did not join the Labour Party and what he thought of former Deputy Garret FitzGerald, about whom no one in the House has any doubts about his honesty and integrity.  One would think Deputy Mitchell and Fine Gael were the keepers of ethics.  Another Fine Gael leader, Deputy Dukes, will be seen as an honest man of great integrity but when the Tallaght strategy did not work he was dealt with in an unethical way and removed.  It is not so long ago when an unethical attempt was made to kick out the present leader, Deputy Bruton, an equally honest man.  It looks as if the track record for honest men in Fine Gael has not been successful.  When it comes to ethics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it preaches to the Labour Party but does not practice what it preaches. If that is its interpretation of democracy it is not the public's concept of it.  The way those three honest men were dealt with would not be seen as ethical by the public.  They were three successive leaders of that great party, Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>I am glad Fine Gael will not oppose the Bill and I look forward to the Opposition amendments on Committee Stage.  The Minister and the Labour Party welcome any reasonable measures to strengthen the Bill.  I welcome the Bill as part of the Programme for Government.  We were told by all sides of the House that a Bill of this nature is necessary.  It was included in the Programme for Government and has not been brought forward but we are now criticised for doing so.  The Progressive Democrats waxed eloquently about ethics but I will not deal with that because I do not wish to have a dog fight on this important Bill.  However, when we see the amendments Deputy McDowell will bring forward to strengthen it we might have something to say about ethics in politics.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation and a genuine attempt to change the public concept of politics.  Many of the contributions by people in public life have created in the minds of the general public the impression that everyone in public life, not alone in political parties, are corrupt.  They should look at the position in the US, Japan and the Mafia in Italy and they would have some idea of corruption in public life and politics.  I am glad to have been part of the democratic system for the last 30 years.  Very few people from any party could say there was corruption in political parties or in the political system here, particularly compared with what is happening throughout the world.</P>

    <P>I have no worries about the Bill.  As far as I am concerned this Bill was not necessary because I have one job.  I am a Member of Dáil Éireann, subject to reelection. I have no business or professional interests.  If I am not re-elected I will receive unemployment benefit or <Col N="1410" /> assistance if I qualify for either.  I would have to live on a meagre pension of approximately £120-£130 per week.  That is all I would get after 30 years in politics. I do not own any property, have no involvement in any land deals and have no assets in the bank.  After the European election campaign I owe the Bank of Ireland in Lawrence Street, Drogheda, approximately £7,500.  I would be delighted to show my bank balance to anyone who wants to see it.  I had to take out a mortgage on my house to get that loan.</P>

      <P>The scandal in section 4 motions relates only to Dublin; it has nothing to do with County Louth.  I have been a member of Drogheda Corporation for 20 years and only four section 4 motions have been put through during that time. On average one section 4 motion is put through by Louth County Council every two months and these normally relate to dwelling houses.  None of the section 4 motions put through by the local authorities in County Louth related to land zoning.  The scandal in section 4 motions relates to the Dublin County Council area, where the big money was to be made but those motions were not put through with the support of Labour Party councillors; the bulk of them were put through with the support of the Fine Gael members of Dublin County Council, and they know that as well as I do.</P>

      <P>This is not an Ethics in Public Office Bill, it is a declaration of interests Bill.  After all the promises made in the House in the wake of the Programme for a Partnership Government and its long period of gestation one would have expected &mdash; Deputy Seán Kenny seemed to think that we have such a Bill &mdash; a comprehensive all embracing measure which would root out and eliminate any trace of corruption in the political process.  This Bill will not do that. This naïve, narrow and limited measure deals only with possible areas of financial interest.  As has been repeatedly said in the House, it is little more than a window dressing exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of a Bill is usually set out properly in the explanatory memorandum. For example, in the case of the recently published Heritage Council Bill, 1994, the explanatory memorandum states &ldquo;The purpose of this Bill is to establish a body, to be known as An Comhairle Oidhreachta or, in the English language, The Heritage Council to perform certain functions in relation to the physical heritage&rdquo;, while in the case of the Refugee Protection Bill, 1994, the explanatory memorandum states: &ldquo;The purpose of this Bill is to provide in Irish Law the protection extended to refugees in International Law.  The need for such legislation is clearly stated in the Interim <Col N="1413" /> Report on Applications for Refugee Status of the Interdepartmental Committee on Non-Irish Nationals of 25th November, 1993&rdquo;.  The purpose of this Bill is not set out in the explanatory memorandum. This is the first time I have ever seen this exemption.  This is very strange and the Bill is nothing more than a salve to the conscience of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the contributions, there does not seem to be any marked enthusiasm among Labour Party Deputies for the Bill and there is very little enthusiasm for it among Fianna Fáil Deputies.  The failure to set out the purpose of the Bill in the explanatory memorandum indicates a certain lack of thrust and purpose.  Given the long period of gestation, the great expectations and the promises given on the order of business, one would have expected the purpose of the Bill to be spelt out in the clearest possible detail.  Instead we have an elaborate superstructure covering a very limited area of activity which mainly involves politicians and their appendages.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that only a few weeks after the sale of passports controversy a Bill should be published without any explanation of its purpose which does not seek to address a business practice which is open to serious question, that is, the sale of passpots.  The Minister has given an assurance that this issue will be dealt with by way of a Government amendment, but surely the Bill should not have been published in its present form without dealing with such a topical issue?</P>

      <P>It is with an air of very deep apprehension I speak on this issue because, as I do a very black cloud hangs over Irish Steel which has many factors in common with TEAM Aer Lingus. There is a grave danger that a plant worth more than £7 million to the locality will be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against that background I speak about the crisis in TEAM Aer Lingus, <Col N="1415" /> which presents this country, and its economy, with a very frightening prospect. With more than 850 workers laid off and a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the jobs of approximately another 1,200 workers, the scale of the problem is truly frightening.  When account is taken of the families of these workers it is obvious that the livelihoods of many thousands of people are threatened and the budgets of many family homes will be under severe threat.</P>
    <P>The background to this crisis has been well rehearsed and there is little to be gained from going over old ground, but there is no escaping the fundamental marketplace realities underlying the present position.  The aircraft maintenance industry worldwide is facing serious problems of gross over-capacity, in turn triggererd by a massive oversupply of aircraft, with an estimated 1,000 'planes taken out of service, parked in United States deserts and elsewhere, as the industry grapples with the aftermath of the global downturn following the Gulf crisis.  One result is that aircraft maintenance centres, including TEAM, are in serious crisis, losing huge amounts of money.  For example, some like the prestigious MBB plant in north Germany has closed down and the FLS facility in Britain has lost in excess of $50 million. Another crippling feature of the crisis is that older aircraft, more in need of regular overhauling and maintenance, are being retired from airline fleets, while those being brought into service are newer and, therefore, require less maintenance.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the position at TEAM cannot be considered in isolation from these global conditions.  The days of protectionism and monopoly in the airline industry are over.  With the exception of servicing the Aer Lingus fleet, TEAM cannot seek special conditions elsewhere. TEAM has to compete on the open international market for business.  The bottom line is that it cannot win and retain such business as would render it viable if its prices are uncompetitive, as indeed they are.  The cut-throat nature of the business <Col N="1416" /> is underlined by the fact that even Shannon Aerospace, the joint venture involving GPA, Swissair and Lufthansa, whose pay rates are little more than half those in TEAM &mdash; I did some checking today and understand that the pay rates at Shannon Aerospace are just little more than 60 per cent of the pay rates in TEAM &mdash; is not as competitive as similar operations in the United States and is more costly than the TAP operation in Portugal. They are the facts of life.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, from any observation of the TEAM operation, that radical changes will have to be made to give the operation any chance of survival and that it is not feasible to have the company cross-subsidised from the parent Aer Lingus organisation which has sufficient problems of its own.  It appears that the level of cross-subsidisation is now running at £500,000 per week, that, in recent years, the operation has clocked up appalling losses and has only managed to survive because of the uncompetitive price paid by Aer Lingus for its own fleet maintenance.</P>
    <P>It was management that failed to come to terms with the passing of the protectionist era which enabled it to charge exorbitant prices for services, to remain cosily cocooned by the absence of competition and the maintenance of monopoly for which the general taxpayer and the air-travelling public in particular had to pay.</P>
    <P>However, the wolf is now at the door of both Aer Lingus and TEAM.  There is little to be gained from a union or, indeed, political point of view in engaging in recriminations, placing the blame and responsibility on management for the current sorry mess.  While, at the end of the day this form of blame-passing may make us all feel somewhat better, it will not render the job of even one employee there more secure.</P>
    <P>All the issues at the heart of the TEAM crisis have been ventilated at great length in recent weeks.  It is obvious there can be no future for this company unless some very radical and painful changes are effected.  Some might contend that there is no particular great merit in the <Col N="1417" /> Fine Gael proposal, that the idea of a three-day round table discussion involving the TEAM unions and the company management adds little to the existing avenues available to both sides to seek to begin the search for a solution.  It is also true that the findings of the Labour Relations Commission on the dispute must be central to any settlement talks. Both sides must accept that.  However, much of the current stand-off appears to stem from a lack of trust between unions and management, also from the sheer pain of adjustment implicit in any survival plan so far as the workers' pay and conditions are concerned.  Valuable time is drifting by.  There is a grave danger, as the stand-off continues, that the very scarce work and maintenance contracts at TEAM will be eroded further.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is difficult to see what would be lost by convening a three-day round-table discussion which would bring both sides in the company into face-to-face analysis of a crisis that could ultimately engulf and destroy them all and where common ground is essential.  With that in mind, and conscious of the undoubted shortcomings of this formula, the Progressive Democrats will vote to create scope for the discussions and will be supporting the Fine Gael motion.</P>

      <P>As is well known to all Members and everybody involved in this dispute, TEAM Aer Lingus is faced with a major financial crisis which will lead to the closure of the company unless immediate steps are taken to rectify the problem.  The company is currently losing £500,000 per week, has accumulated debts of some £65 million, has a negative value of £15 million, has no further bank facilities and is operating uncompetitively in an extremely competitive marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> The present position is not just unsustainable, it is catastrophic.  As my colleague the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, has already informed this House, TEAM has run out of work and money and is surviving only because its external debt is guaranteed by its parent Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Members are aware that Aer Lingus is now in the process of implementing extensive restructuring measures to ensure its survival.  These measures, which involve radical and difficult changes for the workers in Aer Lingus, were only possible because management and unions in the airline were able to negotiate a restructuring programme to overcome their problems with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the Labour Relations Commission, it has not been possible to reach a similar agreement in TEAM.  While remedial action is being taken in Aer Lingus it still has a long way to go before its future is secured.  The airline is becoming more competitive in its own market but it must reduce its excessive burden of debt.  Supporting an uncompetitive enterprise, such as TEAM is at present, represents a massive cash haemorrhage from Aer Lingus which could jeopardise the future of the entire group.  At present it is costing the parent company £500,000 per week to keep TEAM in existence.</P>
    <P>The need for immediate action to solve the company's critical financial problems cannot be over emphasised.  While management and unions are talking about the problem the company's competitors are taking more of its market share.  Fundamental structural changes in the aviation industry have resulted in fewer aircraft to be serviced and maintained, while competition for the limited amount of work available is becoming more and more intense.  At present the company's man-hour costs are seriously in excess of those of its competitors.  Before the company can develop its services and seek new work it must first take measures to retain its existing market share.  To do this it is imperative that its unit costs <Col N="1419" /> be brought into line with those of its competitors, who have adapted to the changed requirements of the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The only financial contribution which the Government can make to the future of the company is an equity injection of £25 million.  EU competition laws prohibit the Government from making any further investment in the company.  The £25 million equity injection is conditional on proving conclusively to the EU Commission that the company will return to viability.  This can only be done if management and unions reach agreement immediately on measures to solve the company's critical financial problems.</P>
    <P>The current crisis facing the company did not happen suddenly.  All those involved in the company have been aware for some time that it was in serious financial difficulties and uncompetitive.  We have only recently been made aware that the rosy picture presented when TEAM was established and in its set-up phase was a bit off the mark.  Our optimism was grossly misplaced.</P>
    <P>There have been protracted negotiations between the parties both directly at local level and with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission to try to address the fundamental problems in TEAM and to ensure survival.  When conciliation talks broke down on 6 June I asked officials from the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to meet management and unions with a view to establishing if any basis for resolving the problems could be found.  Having been briefed by the officials from IBEC and ICTU on Wednesday, 8 June, I requested the Labour Relations Commission to conduct an inquiry into the dispute under section 38 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  This was the first occasion this section was invoked since it was enacted, which clearly illustrates the seriousness with which I viewed the crisis in TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The Labour Relations Commission furnished its report to me on Tuesday, 14 June, and informed me that the submissions <Col N="1420" /> made by the parties did not provide a basis for a negotiated settlement. Because of the failure of the parties to reach agreement the Commission included settlement proposals in its report.  The proposed settlement terms were accepted by the Government that evening and were forwarded to the parties with a request that they accept them. The proposals were accepted by management but rejected by the craft unions and SIPTU operative grades.  SIPTU clerical grades have accepted the proposals.</P>
    <P>The Labour Relations Commission through its long involvement with Aer Lingus and TEAM is familiar with all aspects of the problems facing the company. Its settlement proposals are based on an intimate knowledge of the company and the issues in dispute, and represent a fair balance between the conflicting views of management and unions as to how the company's problems can be overcome.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the plan drawn up by the craft unions for the future development of the company is not receiving the consideration it merits. That is not so.  In its report, the Labour Relations Commission stated that the potential of the plan produced by the craft union group and the trade union groups together make significant contributions to the efficiency of the organisation and the development of its business and must be acknowledged.  The Commission went on to propose that the parties establish immediately a joint non-negotiating forum whose major initial task would be to examine in detail the practicalities of adoption of the plans and to set a course for putting into place those strategies which can make a contribution to the future of the company.  Clearly, therefore, the plan produced by the unions can receive full consideration in the context of the Labour Relations Commission's proposals but action must first be taken to deal with the immediate financial crisis facing the company. Regardless of the merits of the unions' proposals for future development the company will not survive unless it solves <Col N="1421" /> its immediate financial problems &mdash; the only solution to these problems is the immediate implementation of the LRC proposals.</P>
    <P>The industrial relations process has been fully utilised at this stage.  Both parties have received the settlement proposals drawn up by the Commission.  I again emphasise that acceptance of the LRC proposals do not preclude consideration of the plan drawn up by the craft unions.  The merits of that plan can be considered in the context of these proposals.  The settlement proposals have been accepted by management and, in view of the serious situation facing the company and the need for urgent action to resolve the financial crisis, I again urge the unions to accept these settlement terms as the only means of overcoming the immediate problems facing TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>To assist in finding a solution, I am asking the Chief Executive of the Labour Relations Commission to invite the parties at TEAM, without prejudice or preconditions, to discuss the LRC proposals and in particular Clause 24 of the Settlement Terms on the potential of the plans produced by the craft union group.</P>

      <P>Obviously, the initiative by the Minister is welcomed by all.  It is an opportunity for both sides &mdash; the unions in TEAM Aer Lingus and the employers &mdash; to come together and tease out the LRC proposals which, unfortunately, have been rejected to date. Having read the document, I am aware that the unions and the membership generally would have difficulties with it. Coming from a trade union background I know the difficulties the union officials have in trying to convince members that they should go a particular road when there is an erosion of conditions they enjoyed for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the motion before the House is <Col N="1422" /> well meaning &mdash; having discussed it with members of the Opposition I know they are as concerned about TEAM Aer Lingus as the Government &mdash; it could not possibly deal with the complex issue facing TEAM Aer Lingus.  Those of us who sat in at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, yesterday and today, and listened to both sides are aware there are serious problems. To ask the chief executive of the LRC to bring both sides together is an excellent idea.  However, this House is not the place to deal with industrial relations problems.  From my experience the best people to deal with industrial relations problems are the people concerned &mdash; the management and workers but in this case the problems are so difficult that the help of the chief executive of the LRC must be welcomed.  At the time the LRC was asked to intervene they may not have had sufficient time to tease out fully the proposals put forward by all.  With the best will in the world it was not possible to devote the amount of time needed.</P>
    <P>The unions are now being given an opportunity to return to the Labour Relations Commission to discuss not only its document but their document which they believe has much merit.  I appeal to them to prepare their case well during the next few days.  They prepared it well for the State sponsored bodies committee meeting.  They should consult with their colleagues as this problem affects not just the craft unions but general operatives, clerical staff, technical supervisors and other staff.  Without their involvement a solution cannot be found to ensure the viability of TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The management of the company has serious questions to answer.  A number of questions were posed yesterday and today about the way the company has been operated.  It has been alleged that a customer may not receive an invoice for between three to nine months after the work has been carried out.  If this is true or even half true no company could survive in such a climate, particularly in the <Col N="1423" /> business in which TEAM Aer Lingus is involved.</P>
    <P>Like many of my colleagues, none more so than those who represent the north side of Dublin where the vast majority of the employees reside, I have been under considerable pressure for some time in relation to the problems at TEAM Aer Lingus.  We have an obligation to try to impress upon the workforce the seriousness of the difficulties. This Government stood behind Aer Lingus when another Government would not, and we have been criticised for this. The easy answer was to sell half the company to finance the remaining part, but this Government did not do that.  It decided to provide £175 million of taxpayer's money.</P>
    <P>I appeal to my ex-colleagues in the trade unions to accept the Minister's proposal and, with their colleagues in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to put forward their case with confidence.  I believe, as they do, that they have the answers to some, if not all, the problems facing TEAM Aer Lingus.  I am quite certain that the company can be turned around and be extremely successful with the help of the Government and all concerned. I appeal to my colleagues sitting behind me to encourage those involved in TEAM Aer Lingus to accept the Minister's initiative, return to the Labour Relations Commission and to take it from there.  The industrial relations machinery should be utilised in the interests of all concerned.</P>

      <P>Every time I rise to speak Deputy Gay Mitchell has a good word to <Col N="1424" /> say about me and gives me encouragement. It would take a long time to dissuade or discourage me from saying what I want to say.</P>
      <P>As it is better to count one's blessings than curse the darkness I welcome the Minister's initiative.  There is no point in adding to the problems of TEAM Aer Lingus; what it needs is a solution.  The Minister's initiative marks an honest and genuine attempt to break the deadlock. This dispute will not be solved on the floor of this House as anyone who knows anything about industrial relations knows well.</P>
      <P>Negotiations must take place between the trade unions and management and they must be honest, realistic and meaningful. We must not turn our backs on the workers of the company who are intelligent, experienced people skilled with a good track record.  We will not do anything in this House to take from them. We recognise their value not only to the aviation industry but to the economy.</P>
      <P>We must also recognise that there are problems at TEAM Aer Lingus.  We will solve nothing by running away from them; there is too much evasion in society.  No matter how difficult it may be one must not be reluctant to confront problems and to face reality.  For a combination of reasons TEAM Aer Lingus with no money and no work has very few options left.  It is operating in a volatile and competitive industry which relies on high productivity and high wages.  I would not turn my back on the workers and I would not like to see a return to Victorian values and industrial relations but we must go forward, not backwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right to condemn the bad management of the company as well as the golden handshakes given to some people who joined competitors of TEAM Aer Lingus in return for enhanced wages.  It is right too, to condemn bad industrial relations.  However, this will not solve the problem.  The Labour Relations Commission document is a <i>fait accompli</i> and provides a drastic remedy which was put on the table to bring us back to the reality that TEAM Aer Lingus is bankrupt. If it was a private company, it would <Col N="1425" /> be put into liquidation and included in <i>Stubbs Gazette.</i></P>
    <P>There is no point in cursing the past; we must face economic reality.  The talents, skills and experience of the workforce must be used in finding an answer to the problems at TEAM Aer Lingus.  I have enough confidence in the workforce to deal with their problems.  In a changed industrial world the miners and printers in Britain &mdash; fellow craftspeople &mdash; went down the wrong road and turned their faces against productivity and technology. We must learn from their experience. The workforce at TEAM Aer Lingus has the resources to find the way forward.</P>
    <P>Kieran Mulvihill's proposals are not written on tablets of stone; they are a drastic attempt to bring us back to the reality that TEAM Aer Lingus has no money and no work.  The craft unions have presented a very valuable document worthy of serious consideration but it has not been considered to date.  The Minister's initiative will, however, guarantee that meaningful negotiations on all aspects of the company's operations will take place and above all, the unions will have an opportunity to find a way forward.</P>
    <P>It is time to begin again; we can learn from the past but not live in it.  TEAM Aer Lingus has a sad and unhappy past and the same is true of Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus has, however, shown that things can be turned around perhaps with some pain provided a realistic assessment of problems is made.  We have to compete with our competitors.  Competition will not stop just because we are weak.  In this regard, changes have been made at Shannon Airport and I have to learn to live with these no matter how painful this might be for me.  The aerospace industry at Shannon is finding it difficult to compete and TEAM Aer Lingus must also learn from this.</P>
    <P>We must all change.  Like my father and grandfather, I am a craftsman and have been branch secretary of the trade union movement for the past 34 years. Nobody need tell me anything about industrial relations or change.  The building <Col N="1426" /> industry is an example of constant change.  We must face up to change and I will not turn my back on this opportunity afforded by the Minister for the trade unions in TEAM Aer Lingus to negotiate a future, not based on jackboot tactics or draconian measures, but on guarantees of fair wages for the workers and productivity of the company.  I urge all concerned to grasp this opportunity and chart a new era for TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody could emphasise the importance with which we regard the future of Aer Lingus and TEAM.  It is a major industrial base on the north side of Dublin and members representing the people of that area have been striving since elected to Dáil Éireann in November, 1992, to ensure the survival and commercial future of Aer Lingus and TEAM.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has been successfully restructured, in which we assisted.  We are deeply concerned that TEAM survives and prospers and we do not want even one of its 1,900 employees to be made redundant.  One of the most important concerns for us in the present difficulties facing the company is jobs.</P>
      <P>With the exception of Democratic Left, all parties opposite called for the privatisation of Aer Lingus and TEAM. Fine Gael, who tabled this motion, is hypocritical.  It wants Aer Lingus and TEAM to be privatised and the Progressive Democrats hold a similar view. We have stood by TEAM and Aer Lingus and insisted that a proper package of proposals be put in place to ensure that TEAM remains a successful semi-State body.</P>

      <P>We hoped that there would have been successful negotiations in the past 12 months, but last March we were disappointed in that regard.  We are now in the 12th hour in respect of this matter.  The Minister appointed the Labour Relations Commission to conduct an inquiry and we are now discussing <Col N="1427" /> a very serious position in TEAM Aer Lingus.  Last Wednesday we called for a new initiative whereby the proposals of the Labour Relations Commission and the union strategy document could be put on the table.  We noted that the position of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, had softened somewhat.  He emphasised the seriousness with which the union proposals as well as those of the Labour Relations Commission would be considered. We provided a formula and the Minister provided a mechanism today to proceed with that formula.  He indicated he will be calling on the chief executive officer of the Labour Relations Commission to bring together both sides to discuss, without prejudice or precondition, the proposals of the Labour Relations Commission and the proposals of the unions.  That is the basis of the formula we enunciated at the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting last Wednesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's new initiative has brought this matter a substantial step forward and is the basis for resolving the impasse.  The unions and management are willing to embark on a new set of talks, our difficulty is to find a suitable mechanism.  While the Labour Relations Commission conducted an inquiry, it did not embark on discussions or negotiations. The union strategy plan should be submitted to the Labour Relations Commission for consideration, without prejudice or precondition, in an effort to find an acceptable solution.  This will be our last opportunity to resolve the matter.  I do not want industrial action which could affect the future of Aer Lingus and TEAM.  We are making good progress in restructuring Aer Lingus and an industrial dispute at this time would undo all the good work.  We made a commitment to stand by Aer Lingus and TEAM, we honoured it in the past 18 months and the Minister's new initiative is an indication of our intent to continue doing so.  When we examine the new channel which has been opened to workers and management to bring about a successful resolution to the impasse we <Col N="1428" /> will end up with a strong, prosperous commercial TEAM organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>I welcome the debate.  Fine Gael deserves credit for dropping the matter it had planned to take this week to allow the House an opportunity of a full debate on the crisis in TEAM Aer Lingus.  Given the seriousness of the crisis facing TEAM, it is deplorable that the Government should have resisted all attempts to allow the House a full debate on the issue and that Members were restricted to inadequate procedures such as Private Notice Questions and Adjournment Debates to deal with such a major crisis.</P>
      <P>The loss of TEAM Aer Lingus would be an industrial catastrophe for the north side of Dublin.  The financial and economic implications would reverberate throughout the city and possibly threaten the future of Aer Lingus.  It would be the equivalent of the closure of three Digitals and, in one stroke, would wipe out the equivalent of the new Motorola jobs promised by the Government earlier this month.</P>
      <P>When I managed to raise the matter on the Adjournment last Thursday I warned that this was one of the most serious crises we had witnessed in a public sector for many years.  A week later we are no nearer to a resolution.  The Government position remains entrenched, it rejected the formula put forward at the end of last week for the establishment of a negotiation forum to consider all aspects of the company's future.  This offered the Government an opportunity to get itself off the hook of intransigency on which it has been impaled by the bloody-minded &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; attitude of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of the Minister is a factor in this dispute, one which is not contributing to a successful conclusion.  The Minister clearly relishes the reputation he has won as the hard man of the Government who is sent in here to hold the line when the Government is under pressure.  He believes he has a mission to sort out &mdash; as he sees it &mdash; the semi-State <Col N="1429" /> companies for which he has responsibility, irrespective of the social consequences for those who may have worked in them for decades.  The bloody-minded approach of the Minister will not secure a solution to the TEAM crisis and runs the risk of pushing the company over the precipice.  What is needed here is not the hard man approach of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, but the negotiation skills shown by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, when faced with similarly difficult disputes in the past, the ability to find a solution when none seems possible, the capacity to find a compromise, the willingness to give and take and, most important, the determination to keep talking until a deal is hammered out.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not merely a Cabinet Minister with responsibility for aviation, he is also the custodian of the taxpayers' shareholding in TEAM Aer Lingus and he should leave no stone unturned in his efforts to find a solution instead of adopting a confrontational posture. What is most extraordinary about this crisis is the refusal of the Minister to even talk to the unions.  The motion before us is a simple one which merely calls on the Government to convene a round table discussion for a period of three days to allow parties to talk directly to each other.  It does not commit the Government to spending a penny of public money.  It does not even commit the Government to accepting any formula that might be worked out at such round table discussions.  It is a reasonable restrained motion which nobody who has TEAM's interest at heart could vote against.  The old Churchillian saying about &ldquo;jaw jaw&rdquo; being better than &ldquo;war war&rdquo; is as true of the industrial area as of other areas of conflict, but the Minister seems to be digging and preparing the trenches for open warfare.</P>
    <P>It is also make up your mind time for the Labour Party Deputies who have been so vocal outside the House in their concerns about the position of TEAM. This motion falls short of the demand they issued following the Labour Parliamentary Party meeting last week which <Col N="1430" /> called for equal consideration of the report of the Labour Relations Commission and the recovery plan put forward by the unions.  How can Deputies Ryan, Shortall, Kenny, Broughan, Costello and McDowell, the so-called Northside Six hope to retain any degree of political credibility if they refuse to support this motion?  Labour Party backbenchers have to accept that they cannot act as an Opposition party when they are on the plinth outside this House talking to Charlie Bird and then perform as mindless lobby fodder when the same matter comes up for decision in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>Pledges given outside this House now have to be backed up by votes.  One would have hoped that with the presence of so many Labour members at the Cabinet table the Government would have shown greater understanding of the position of the TEAM workers and displayed a more sensitive approach to the search for a solution.  Instead this Government, with a substantial Labour presence, has been more intransigent, hard-line, inflexible and authoritarian than virtually any other Governments in recent times.</P>
    <P>One of the most objectionable features of the TEAM crisis has been the manner in which attempts have been made to make the workers the collective scapegoats for the current difficulties.  Whoever is responsible for the economic problems now threatening to strangle TEAM, it is not the workers.  It was not the workers who undertook the initial viability assessment of the project.  It was not the workers who got their sums wrong.  It was not the workers who badly misjudged the market and the competition the company was likely to face. It was not the workers who made chronic errors of scheduling causing massive waste in overtime payments.  It was not the workers who allowed bad debts to mount up and remain uncollected and they did not calculate that redundancy payments would cost £12.5 million when they amounted to £28 million.  The workers were not responsible for any of those appalling mistakes and they should <Col N="1431" /> not be pilloried as the cause of TEAM's problems.</P>
    <P>Management at TEAM insist that the basic issue involved at present is its right to manage.  It must be said that whatever about its right to manage its performance does nothing to inspire confidence in its ability to manage.  In the modern industrial world management cannot be conducted in an adversarial or authoritarian manner.  It must be based on co-operation and consent.  It cannot be imposed through muscle by one group on another.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that the TEAM workers should want to defend their jobs and their economic position to the fullest extent possible.  Many of them gave up other jobs to work in TEAM.  Others moved to new houses to be near the job, taking on new mortgages and commitments. They more than anyone have a vested interest in securing the future of the company and, with the support of the Government, it should be possible to find a solution to the current problem which will secure the maximum number of jobs possible without impoverishing the workers and which would guarantee the future viability of the company. However, we will face an industrial disaster unless something is done to break the current deadlock.  Negotiations will have to take place sometime.  It is preferable that this should be done now when there is something to save rather than when the only task facing the negotiators will be to pick up the pieces.</P>
    <P>Those who read the submission made by the craft group of unions to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies could not fail to be impressed by the constructive manner in which they are approaching the problem and the major efforts they are making to find a solution.  The document acknowledges cost savings will have to be achieved and that sacrifices will have to be made by them.  Their document says they will offer 100 additional voluntary redundancies over and above the 200 requested in the Cahill Plan; agree to total functional flexibility across both engineering groupings, avionic and <Col N="1432" /> mechanical; agree to numerical flexibility to alleviate the high overtime costs; agree to the hiring of temporary workers but not exploited Third World cheap labour; agree to variable shifts including night shifts and they will enter discussions with Mr. Donnacha Hurley &mdash; who for some strange reason has not yet agreed to meet them &mdash; with a view to agreeing new enhanced cost-saving arrangements to attract new business and further cost savings totalling an additional £15 million. That is not the approach of wreckers and destroyers.  It is the constructive approach of workers who have put much into TEAM and who do not want to see it all go to the wall.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact they have made the submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies which disposes of many myths about their position.  What will the committee do?  It must report urgently before the Dáil goes into recess on Friday so that we will have an opportunity to consider its recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment to the motion again demands unconditional acceptance of the document produced by the Labour Relations Commission, but the Labour Relations Commission document should not be regarded as being written in tablets of stone.  I do not question the bona fides of those who drafted the Labour Relations Commission document but it was prepared under great pressure of time and by people who are not aviation experts.  It also dealt primarily with industrial relations problems other than the broader viability issue.  It largely took on board the proposals of management which were deeply flawed and appeared to take little account of the trade union development proposals.</P>
    <P>Of the 25 recommendations in the Labour Relations Commission report, 23 were management demands and just two reflected the unions' submission.  This is not a routine industrial dispute.  The problems arise from the economic condition of the company.  It is possible for cost savings as great or even greater than those proposed in the Labour Relations Commission document to be effected <Col N="1433" /> with the co-operation of the workforce through a well based viability plan, but it must be done through co-operation between management and workers living up to the name of the company and acting as a team.  Neither management nor unions can impose their will on the other side.  Victory for one may spell ultimate defeat for both.  There does not seem to be any logical reason that the Labour Relations Commission document and the trade union development proposals should not both be on the table with management, unions and the Government sitting down together to draw out and implement the best of both documents.</P>
    <P>The Government, as the shareholder and custodian of the public interest in the company, cannot stand on the sidelines and act like some neutral observer.  The Minister and his colleagues should encourage, facilitate, prompt and do everything possible to bring the sides together.  The saving of the company and its jobs rather than the niceties of industrial relations protocol should be the priority.</P>

      <P>The crisis in TEAM Aer Lingus must be seen in the context of the Government's agenda for the semi-State sector.  When the Government was formed we heard a great deal particularly from the Labour Party and in the Programme for Government that there would not be privatisation.  As each day passes that commitment is wearing thinner. What is happening at TEAM Aer Lingus is part of a pattern that started with Aer Lingus and will continue with Telecom, An Post, the ESB, CIE and each of the semi-State sectors.  It is a Government agenda which involves massive reductions in the numbers employed in those State companies, their possible dismantling and so-called restructuring and ultimately possibly their privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> The reason there is a crisis in TEAM Aer Lingus is because the Government has deliberately chosen TEAM Aer Lingus to soften up the entire workforce in the semi-State sector.  The workers and trade unions at TEAM Aer Lingus are being made the scapegoats in this process. They have to be taught a lesson so that every other employee and trade union in a semi-State company will be cowed into submission when their rationalisation and restructuring proposals are put on the table.</P>
    <P>We are getting from the Government a public position which states that the unions and staff at TEAM Aer Lingus have to accept the Labour Relations Commission proposals.  It makes nice noises about the desirability of all this being settled by agreement while privately the handlers of the Government are going to every journalist in this town bad-mouthing the unions and the staff in TEAM and making them appear to be some kind of industrial dinosaur.</P>
    <P>There has been much talking with forked tongues in this dispute.  Last week there was a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party from which backbench members emerged and said that the position agreed by the Labour Party was different from that expressed by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, while Labour Party Ministers who attended the same meeting stated that it was in agreement with it.</P>
    <P>Tonight we have what is called a new channel, a little glimmer that something is about to happen to reopen discussions. This is represented by Deputy Costello as a breakthrough, almost a full-blooded reopening of negotiations.  He is representing it, just as it was represented last week, as something different from the Government's position.  By tomorrow morning, when this vote is over, it will be represented by the Minister Quinn and the other Labour Ministers in the Cabinet as essentially the same as the Government's position.</P>
    <P>The channel that has opened is not a new channel for discussions with the unions and for the settlement of this dispute, the only channel that has opened <Col N="1435" /> up is a way out for those members of the Labour Party who will find it difficult to vote for the Government's amendment.</P>

      <P>Faoi dheireadh thiar thall, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Fine Gael motion will clearly not enjoy the support of Minister Cowen.  In spite of the fact that on 2 March last we were all delighted to learn that agreement had been reached on a package to save TEAM, the Minister expects the latest terms to be accepted in advance of examining the plans drawn up by an experienced workforce and independent consultants.  The workforce proposals have been costed and are viable in the eyes of O'Riada Stockbrokers and Fielding and Flynn, very reputable firms.</P>
      <P>Minister Cowen has taken on the appearance of Captain Bligh of the <i>Bounty.</i> His amendment to the motion demands that the workforce start to walk the plank now, and while they are walking their plan will be looked at.  In fact, the LRC settlement terms are designed to hit the workforce, not management. The small 2.5 per cent of company costs that will be saved will mainly hit wages and work practices.  Mr. Bernie Cahill calculated that, to be competitive, the hourly cost for aircraft overhaul needs to be £33, down from the current £41.75. The LRC settlement terms only forecast a £38.56 hourly rate; yet Minister Cowen trips the light fantastic telling us in his amendment that the survival of the company will be assured by acceptance of the LRC settlement terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, let me warn any Government backbenchers who were supporting the other team last night on television while Minister Cowen was speaking to the Opposition, that he veered from these &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; sentiments about survival being assured.  This time <Col N="1437" /> last night the Minister suggested that with acceptance of the LRC terms the company would &ldquo;survive in the short term&rdquo;. Acceptance would be a &ldquo;short term measure&rdquo;, a &ldquo;first step&rdquo; and would &ldquo;represent a victory for nobody&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The workforce are not lemmings.  They want long term, viable measures, that will not have everyone in disarray in three or even six months down the line.  The big question is whether the concerned Labour Party backbenchers, especially the Enid Blyton-styled &ldquo;Northside Six&rdquo; will be lemmings tonight.  Already a statement by the Parliamentary Labour Party tells us that Labour insists on unions and management at TEAM accepting the LRC terms and the trade union development plans together; that they will not stand for any &ldquo;mutiny on the Bounty&rdquo;&mdash; style tactics or for being told to take it or leave it and to start walking down the plank and talk later.  Those are the tactics of Captain Bligh, alias the Minister, who risks losing the whole ship unless he puts away his sword and starts talking to the people who know how to reduce costs, who have already reduced turn-around time on their own initiative and who have already developed specialised tools in plastic and metal which I examined in Drogheda last Saturday at a very angry meeting of TEAM workers and their families.</P>
    <P>How can the &ldquo;Northside Six&rdquo; and their Labour colleagues turn their backs on the skilled personnel who are able to cut costs with or without the thanks of an indifferent management?  The Minister should listen to what the unions and the independent experts in aviation and finance say and get the management to listen to the unions and to their own expert consultants, Airline Maintenance Associates, who tell us clearly that pricing, specifically labour pricing, is not the primary selection factor in repair management. The overriding criterion for selection of a repair agency is turn-around time.  Every day a Boeing 747 is on the ground TEAM loses $100,000 in revenue.</P>
    <P>The LRC does not go into the long term strategy or include full trading figures. <Col N="1438" /> It does not provide for any investigation or sanction on the record of management in taking decisions which have cost this company millions of pounds or decisions which management has not taken which have also cost TEAM millions of pounds.  It does not deal with the decision of Aer Lingus management to withdraw support funding of £20 million which was required to ensure the IDA would grant aid building of hangars. This was withdrawn, resulting in a massive mortgage on TEAM, a tidy earner for the banks but a deadly burden on TEAM and its 2,000 staff.</P>
    <P>Government and management cannot get away with these irresponsible actions and lack of constructive action.  On 3 March 1994 we read in our newspapers that as terms had been agreed by management and union leaders at Aer Lingus and TEAM, the injection of £175 million State equity would see the Cahill plan finally implemented, and that Aer Lingus would put £25 million in equity into TEAM which could turn the company around from the enormous losses it was experiencing.  These unions, unlike many others, are prepared to accept the pain, management and Government must do the same.  They can guarantee gain.  At present on management figures only 44.4 per cent hours of capacity are being sold at a cost of £41.75, causing a loss of £7 million.  How does management get away with such an appalling sales record?  All that is needed to break even is a further 200,000 hours work or 56 per cent of available hours.  That amounts to only five extra C-checks, that is five extra aircraft. This brings the hourly rate down to £33.</P>
    <P>They are management figures with which the unions agree but the LRC terms do not include them. It is not a plan, unlike what Senator Ross said in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> Labour said it wishes to act on its concern.  However, abstaining is not acting while voting for the Opposition motion is.  Any respect which remains for the Labour Party is now on the line.  I urge it not to let down <Col N="1439" /> the workers and this fine company but to support the Opposition motion.</P>

      <P>In the past Fine Gael sought a strategic partnership to ensure the future of Aer Lingus.  That is strongly supported by many trade unionists.  It is ironic that Deputy Costello attacked the proposal which is strongly supported by many people who see a partnership as a way forward for Aer Lingus.  Not since the Munich agreement has anything been as misleading as the so-called agreement of 2 March.  Why has management not been asked to explain the reason for this agreement on 2 March and why it lost the trust and confidence of its workforce by going back on the agreement?  Would any of us do business in that way?</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister come in here point the finger at the workforce and blame the unions?  Why did the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, and all the other Labour and Fianna Fáil Ministers and backbenchers say last week that there could be no further negotiation and or reference to the Labour Relations Commission? We find tonight, when Fine Gael got the agreement of the House to put forward this matter during Private Members' time, all of a sudden a fig leaf is produced to cover the embarrassment of the small-minded &ldquo;Northside Six&rdquo; who are not here, having scurried out of the House with red faces.  An agreement was made between a State body and its workforce but we now find that the basis on which the agreement was made was wholly unacceptable to the management who shook hands on it and overnight decided not to sign it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document submitted today by the trade unions welcoming a new way forward is a further indication that the trade union members and workforce are not militant or irresponsible.  I met a number of these people &mdash; I am a southside Deputy whose constituency is not <Col N="1440" /> affected by this crisis &mdash; and I have been struck by the reaasonableness of their approach, by the research they have done and the way they are prepared to argue their case.  In the past we have argued for the workforce to become involved in industrial democracy.  Not only has the Government, with its huge majority, trampled democracy in this House where everything is to go through as it says but now industrial democracy is dead.</P>
    <P>The trade unions and workforce in TEAM Aer Lingus put forward constructive proposals, costings and a cogent argument, and the Labour Relations Commission was asked to adjudicate on the matter.  What credentials has the chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission to examine the balance sheet of a company, to consider the financial position and make a report which the Minister finds so compelling?  This report has brought us to the brink of closing a company which will result in the loss of almost four times the number of jobs lost to Digital.  These people will be out on the streets and their families left in difficult circumstances.  Why have we painted ourselves into this corner?  We have done so because the Government, with its huge majority, forgets what democracy is.  The Labour Party members of Government who pretend to be supporters of the workforce, who at one time were supporters of the workforce, forget what industrial democracy is.</P>
    <P>The workers have offered to participate in any reasonable way forward. The Minister has ignored what they said in a submission today to the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies:</P>
    <P>We welcome the arrival of our new chief executive officer, Donnacha Hurley, and we believe that, given what has transpired up to now, this offers the best way forward.  In the interest of making genuine progress we would welcome meaningful discussions with Mr. Hurley under an independent chairperson (not the Labour Relations Commission) with his agenda on the table.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> The Minister did the complete opposite to what the workforce asked.  How can the Minister assuage the fears of the workforce?  How can he expect them to have confidence in a management that walked away from a deal made with them on 2 March?  The Government wants to go back to the Labour Relations Commission at this eleventh, twelfth or thirteenth hour, but that is what the unions have specifically said they do not want.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael proposal will be voted down by the Government.  The Labour Party TDs will come in whingeing and whining, wringing their hands.  They have an opportunity to show whether they support this motion.  The Government put down an amendment to the motion deleting all the words, and praising itself for its great movements to date.  What we have had so far in this House is disparagement of the workforce, a disregard for their views and for industrial democracy. From analysis of the financial circumstances in TEAM Aer Lingus, I see a serious problem, as do the workforce. One would want to be blind not to see there is a very real problem there.</P>
    <P>The management, in whom the Government seems to have great confidence, is the management that presided over not only the TEAM Aer Lingus fiasco but the Aer Lingus Holidays fiasco and the catering cost fiasco.  When has any member of that management been disciplined or called to account?  When has a Minister asked these people what is going on in Aer Lingus and its subsidiaries? It is time we had a parliamentary inquiry into the way Aer Lingus has been run and the way this crisis has been brought about.  For too long the finger has been pointed at the workforce in TEAM Aer Lingus who realise how serious the problem is and are prepared to contribute to its solution, including accepting new principles on which heretofore trade unionists would have dug in their heels.  I ask the Minister and Members of the House, particularly those in the Labour Party, to support this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is against this background <Col N="1445" /> that we must take immediate action to turn this company around.  This will be no easy task and it will take courage, immediate commitment and realistic co-operation from everybody sincerely interested in the survival of his company.</P>
      <P>TEAM Aer Lingus' market is dwindling rapidly because Aer Lingus' modern fleet requires less maintenance and it is now paying only open market rates for its maintenance; there is a downturn in world aviation and a substantial increase in the number of competitors; there has been a loss in market share due to uncompetitiveness.  As a result, TEAM's outside revenue, that is outside the Aer Lingus group, fell by 18 per cent, from £57 million to £47 million in 1993-94. These factors will be with us for some time.  It would be unwise to plan on a rising tide lifting a submerged TEAM Aer Lingus out of its troubled waters. TEAM Aer Lingus can survive and the jobs in it can be maintained only if the very acute problems which are besetting the company are addressed, both in the short and the medium-term context.</P>
      <P>Competitiveness is the key ingredient for survival and sustained viability. TEAM Aer Lingus has the quality and the skills.  What it does not have is a competitive product and it cannot survive without it.</P>
      <P>The Labour Relations Commission's proposals will not solve the problems of TEAM Aer Lingus.  They are a first step, but only a first step.  They are necessary, but not sufficient to ensure the survival of TEAM Aer Lingus.  They will be sufficient provided output can be increased very substantially.</P>

      <P>However, before TEAM can attract new business it has to ensure that its existing cost base matches those of its competitors.  It is because of this that the Government has asked both management and unions in TEAM Aer Lingus to accept the LRC settlement terms.  Again, let me emphasise that this is only a first step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> The second step is one into which all the stakeholders &mdash; and notably the workers in TEAM Aer Lingus &mdash; must make both an input and a commitment. In this regard I want to reiterate what the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications said in this House.  Not alone do we welcome the proposals of trade unions in TEAM Aer Lingus, we also determine that they will receive the fullest and most professional assessment and if they can be shown to contribute to profitability in the company they will be implemented.  The successes of the Irish economy in recent years have been mainly due to the fact that at national level there has been consensus approach to the problems facing us as a nation.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael's motion, which I drafted personally having spoken to both sides, is designed to avoid that tragedy by getting the highest authority in this country &mdash; Dáil Éireann &mdash; to give all concerned a last opportunity, face to face, over a period of just three days, to clear away once and for all that dross of emotions, suspicions and conflicting versions of history that have prevented agreement up to now.</P>
      <P>I agree with much of what the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, said here last night.  I agree with him on the &ldquo;financial unsustainability of the <i>status quo</i>&rdquo;.  I agree with him that TEAM must &ldquo;adapt to survive&rdquo;.  I agree with him that TEAM has failed over the past two years.  I agree with him that TEAM's outside revenue has fallen dramatically since 1992-93, and that its market is dwindling.</P>
      <P>I agree with him also that the Labour Relations Commission was brought into play because, as he said, there was &ldquo;no common agenda, there was a stand-off position, with no possibility of a resolution of the problem and different analyses were taken by the two sides in the company&rdquo;.  But I ask him to agree with me that this is still the case.  There is still no common agenda, still no common analysis.  And no amount of shotgun tactics will change that.  That is the point that Minister Cowen in his tragic blindness, failed to see last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour Party backbenchers have asked that the union's document be put on the agenda along with the LRC document. The Minister has refused this, presumably because he feels the talks on the two documents would drag on forever.  I <Col N="1448" /> understand that the money is not there to keep talks going on indefinitely.  That is why I have drafted the Fine Gael motion in such a way as to set a limit of just three days on the round table forum I want the Minister to convene.  This proposal is probably less than what the unions want.  It is also less than what the Labour Party backbenchers say they want, but it is a reasonable compromise. All sides must climb down if the deadlock is to be broken.  And because it is the Dáil, not the Government, not the LRC and not the unions that is proposing this formula, it can be acccepted by all without a loss of face.</P>
    <P>I do not want TEAM to close.  I appeal to every Deputy in Dáil Éireann to look honestly at the Fine Gael proposal and accept it as the last available means to prevent the closure of the company.</P>
    <P>I listened this evening to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment make a last minute, apparently unscripted and concocted proposal, for open-ended discussions convened by the LRC.  This is designed to appear to be a radical change from what Minister Cowen was saying last night.  Of course, it involves no change in the Government amendment to the Fine Gael motion, an amendment which is profoundly objectionable to everyone working in TEAM.  Nothing that the Minister said this evening changes a single comma, sentence or semicolon of the Government's unacceptable amendment to the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <P>I see five difficulties with this last minute proposal put forward by Minister Quinn for motives that do not require much difficulty to divine.  First, the discussions proposed by the Minister are open-ended and will thus lack the urgency provided by the Fine Gael proposal. The open-ended nature of the Minister's proposal seems to take little account of the daily cost of maintaining TEAM while the talks go on.  This casts doubt on the sincerity of Minister Quinn's proposal.  Second, the Minister excludes himself and all other Ministers from the discussions to be convened by the LRC.  That is a mistake; the Minister should be involved, he is part of the problem <Col N="1449" /> and part of the solution.  He is, after all, the shareholder.  Third, the LRC is not a good convenor for these discussions because it is not a disinterested party.  Its own proposals are now the central bone of contention in the dispute.  Fourth, the Minister waited until tonight to make his proposal and this casts grave doubt on his willingness to accept the outcome of any discussion once the Dáil has gone into recess and the Deputies, about whom the Minister is so worried, have departed to their constituencies.</P>

      <P>Fifth, it is a clear that the Minister's proposal is based on a prior acceptance by the unions of the LRC proposal because, according to the Minister's statement, the purpose of the talks he is proposing is &ldquo;to discuss the implementation of the LRC proposals&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Clearly those discussions are predicated on accepting the LRC proposals and then discussing how to implement them.  That is the problem, Minister.  Those proposals are not accepted.  Perhaps the Minister is right <Col N="1450" /> and they should be accepted.  In an ideal world perhaps they should be accepted but they are not accepted.  That is a reality of industrial relations.  The Minister is producing a proposal at the last minute that is designed to appear to be something other than it is.  The fact that it was not produced last week or even last night but this evening, at the very moment the vote is about to take place, casts serious doubts on whether there is any real depth or sincerity in this proposal.  Not one of the famous &ldquo;Northside Six&rdquo; Labour Deputies is here in the House to listen to this debate and that is a commentary on their commitment.  They are not here to hear the actual words and meaning of the Minister's proposal.  They are absent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>For these reasons I would ask the Labour Deputies who are not in this House &mdash; if they have their monitors turned on in whatever corner of the House they are hiding &mdash; to accept that the Fine Gael proposal is better than this last minute idea to discuss the implementation of the LRC proposals with the LRC, which is like holding a court with the devil and having the devil as the principal judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The formula put forward by Fine Gael is the right formula to solve this dispute. It is not a Government proposal, therefore, it does not involve someone having to climb down and accept the Government line.  It is not a management proposal, therefore nobody has to climb down and accept management's line.  It is not a union proposal, therefore management is not losing face by accepting it.  It is a Dáil Éireann proposal, proposed by the supreme legislative body in this State and if it is accepted it will provide a formula upon which all can work.  It is also far more realistic than the Minister's proposal because there is a time limit on it.  The Minister was at pains to point out that it costs £500,000 a week to keep <Col N="1451" /> TEAM going.  If that is the case why is the Minister's proposal open-ended? Surely there is more seriousness in the Fine Gael proposal because it has a time limit on it.  It is a much more realistic proposal from the management's and the unions' point of view because it does not accept any side's preconditions but accepts a time limit for the discussions.</P>
    <P>I ask those Labour Deputies who are not here in this House to accept the Fine Gael proposal and vote for it.  They should follow the example of Deputies Killeen and de Valera who were willing, because their constituencies were involved, to show that they put the interests of their constituents before their party pressure.</P>

      <P>The late Deputy George Colley, as Tánaiste and Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil, spoke in the late 1970s about low standards in high places. How right he was and his comments are valid today because it is the failure to extend the laws and codes of behaviour applicable to ordinary citizens to people at the upper levels of society that is destroying the credibility of the political process.</P>
      <P>The recent election was a revelation as I saw for the first time the pent-up anger, frustration, antipathy and antagonism of people to politics.  The total national turn-out of 40 per cent speaks for itself. The fact that six out of every ten people decided not to bother voting should teach us a lesson.  It is not simply a case of indifference on the part of the electorate. There is antagonism, alienation and a sense of genuine anger towards politics and politians.</P>
      <P>Who can blame a jobless person for being bitter at the process that let him down?  Who can blame a jobless person caught doing a nixer to top up his £57 per week dole payment, who is hauled ignominiously before the courts when they see, on the other hand, unpunished miscreants at the very top level here?</P>
      <P>I was amused listening to Deputy Bell who said we are not so bad compared to Japan.  Certainly, Japan is bad but at least if you are caught there your head will roll. The same applies in the United States, we recall the impeachment of a President there in the not too distant past.  One of the things about Britain, despite all we might say about its lack of morality is that if people are caught committing a misdemeanour they do the decent thing and go.  Here, people are encouraged to brazen it out.</P>

Carysfort College was a scandal when approximately £2 million of taxpayers' money was handed on a plate to an individual friend of the Government against the advice of the Higher Education Authority and that of various expert valuation agencies, but again heads did not roll.  Telecom Éireann's Ballsbridge site episode was a scandal, another disedifying, expensive rip-off of the taxpayer and, apart from <Col N="1459" /> certain voluntary, and in some cases not so voluntary, steppings aside, again, heads did not roll.  In the Goodman saga, mountains were moved to facilitate the survival of one individual because of who he was and who he knew, while small industrialists or people with genuine business ideas, despite the multiplicity of Government agencies and schemes, are unable to obtain even meagre grants.  It is another example of abuse.  Tax amnesties irrespective of the once-off, net cumulative gain to the State, in spite of according respectability to people who have flagrantly flouted the rules &mdash; in effect are rewards for cheating the system and blatant provocation of the ordinary, hard-pressed, law-abiding taxpayer.</P>
    <P>There may be no direct financial gain to politicians from some of the instances I mention but Government is clearly involved.  There is a whole moral and political dimension here.  The fact that the Government presides over systems where major indiscretions can and do occur on a frequent basis with no punishment sends out the worst possible signal to people.  It destroys and corrodes people's respect for authority.  It eats into the system.  We as elected representatives of the people are the ultimate representation of authority here.  Ireland is most definitely on the slide.  I am not simply speaking about crime and unemployment, I am talking about the fact that we are at a stage where many people have lost faith in the system.  That in itself is dangerous.  We are at the stage when a growing number of people feel they have no stake whatever in society.  If ever there was a missed opportunity to come to terms with the needs for forced public imposition of standards, across the entire range of public performance of duty, this is it.</P>
    <P>I support the principle of a declaration of interests.  It is part and parcel of the normal process in most countries but this is only a tiny segment of a huge area that needs urgent tackling.  Imagine the signal Cabinet confidentiality sends out in order to protect some core information on the <Col N="1460" /> conduct of a multi-billion pounds beef tribunal.  Members have used the privilege of the House to make specific allegations in relation to the conduct and performance of Government Ministers. Yet, when it came to substantiating those allegations which will be a vital and core element to the efficacy of the beef tribunal such people were not alone found wanting but now find themselves in Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to commence by quoting from the Second Stage contribution by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  Deputy Fitzgerald, when introducing the Bill.  She said, &ldquo;It is important because it builds openness and trust in our democratic system&rdquo; She also said the Bill would &ldquo;strengthen our democratic structures and ensure that the public is served in the best possible manner by those they elect and by those chosen to serve them&rdquo;. Whom does the Minister think she is fooling?  Clearly, this Bill does not deal with ethics but with declaration of interests.  Is it ethical to call this Bill an ethics Bill?  It is obvious that the Bill is a charade, a fad of the Labour Party, to pretend they are challenging some of the unethical behaviour of their Fianna Fáil partners in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was obviously drafted by the relatively junior Minister of State and contains much rubbish.  If this Bill is to be taken seriously, who in the future would want to employ a person connected with a Dáil Deputy if their affairs have to be declared?  There is nothing in this Bill to ensure that the business of the family of a Minister or a Taoiseach <Col N="1461" /> cannot benefit by large amounts of money because somebody gets an Irish passport.  This Bill should be about regulating standards and ethics of officeholders and should not refer to backbenchers and what their brothers and sisters own or where they work.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is taking credit for this Bill.  The public will not be deceived by their apparent conversion to matters ethical.  There should be a section in the Bill dealing with the ethics of how a party presents itself to the electorate before an election, and what it does after the election following an increase in the number of its seats.  The Labour Party provides many classic examples of unethical behaviour in this regard.  Any student of politics has only to research a few quotations of the Labour Party, and particularly of its Leader, when it was seeking the support of the people and what they said about the Fianna Fáil Party and the Taoiseach and how it finished up in Government with Fianna Fáil after the election to discover this.  I am glad the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, is present as I wish to quote what he said on 5 November 1992 as reported in volume 424, columns 2312-14, 2317 and 2320 of the Official Report.  He said:</P>
    <P>This debate, like so much else about this Government, is a meaningless and empty charade.  In common with a clear majority of this House, the Labour Party have no confidence in this Government, and we will be hoping to see it swept out of office when the vote is called . . . But there is one thing that this Taoiseach is not. He is not a Taoiseach who has ever received a mandate from the people. He was elected Taoiseach following a typical Fianna Fáil power play.</P>
    <P>He went on to state:</P>
    <P>It must surely be considered amazing that any party would consider coalescing with them.</P>
    <P>Later he stated:</P>
    <P>I believe one political party in this <Col N="1462" /> House have gone so far down the road of blindness to standards, and of blindness to the people they are supposed to represent, that it is impossible to see how anyone could support them in the future without seeing them first undergo the most radical transformation.</P>
    <P>Those statements were made by the Labour Party Leader before the last general election.  It is highly unethical to give the electorate the impression that you will do something when seeking votes and do the opposite after an election.  It is obvious from the results in the recent elections that the electorate will take it out on the Labour Party at every opportunity. It is clear to any political observer that the huge swing to the Labour Party in the last general election represented an anti-Fianna Fáil vote.</P>

      <P>Was it ethical for the Labour Party to use its extra seats to keep Fianan Fáil in office?  Is it any wonder that the voters deserted Labour in large numbers in the recent elections?</P>
      <P>One cannot legislate for ethics.  It is clear that the Labour Party &mdash; credited with the introduction of this Bill &mdash; believes that its partners in Government is lacking when it comes to ethics.  If that is the case, it is unethical for the Labour Party to be in Government with Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>It was unethical for the Labour Party to claim during the last general election campaign that by voting for the Labour Party people were voting against Fianna Fáil and after the election to keep Fianna Fáil and Deputy Reynolds in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After deceiving the electorate the Labour Party entered Government and <Col N="1463" /> its Ministers conducted themselves in an unethical way in appointing managers, programme managers and advisers some of whom were members of their own families.  This applies from the Tánaiste down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>I have a file full of examples of unethical behaviour on the part of Ministers and their programme managers but responsibility must rest with the Minister. I will give examples of unethical behaviour.</P>
      <P>During a six months period in 1993 and 1994, like many others, I made representations concerning the retention of the seventh class at St. Patrick's national school in Galway city.  On 24 March 1994 I received a letter from the Minister for Education in which she outlined the reasons the seventh class could not be retained.  During the same week the Labour Party Minister in my constituency was able to announce on local radio that he had received confirmation from the Minister for Education that the seventh class would be retained.  It was highly unethical for the Minister for Education to tell me one thing in the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in the same week to give her party colleague the correct <Col N="1464" /> information so that he could be the first person to tell the people of Galway.</P>
      <P>When I raised another example of unethical behaviour on the part of a Labour Party Minister on the Adjournment on 28 February 1994 I was not given a satisfactory explanation.  I considered it to be unethical then and still do.  This matter relates to the practice of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to write to people who have not been in contact with him informing them:</P>
      <P>About your application for a grant under the Gaeltacht Housing Act, you will be glad to hear that a grant has been approved in your case.  My Department will be in touch with you shortly.</P>

      <P>What is most extraordinary is that the Minister sends this letter to people who have not been in contact with him.  It was drawn to my attention that during the European elections a slip was included with this letter in which the person concerned was asked to support the Labour Party candidate in the European elections.  The Minister apologised for this unethical behaviour but he did not apologise or explain why he considered it be ethical to write to people who had not been in contact with him informing them about a grant.  I consider this to be unethical behaviour particularly on the part of a Minister who often preached ethics while in Opposition and who wrote a booklet on clientelism and gombeenism in politics.  Let me give a short quotation:</P>
      <P>Clientelist politicians in the opinion of the author rarely objectively influence a decision.  It creates the illusion of assistance however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite my best efforts and advice to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht this practice is continuing.  The Minister receives the list each week from Roinn na Gaeltachta and writes to people <Col N="1465" /> pretending that he has obtained a grant for them.  If that is not unethical behaviour, what is?  That is the reason people are so cynical about politics and I blame the Labour Party solely.  It was anxious to go into the Government with its bedfellows in Fianna Fáil and we are now in a sorry state.</P>

      <P>The Ethics in Public Office Bill is an essential element of the Programme for Government commitment to openness, transparency and accountability in the way in which public business is conducted.  The objective of that strategy is to broaden our democracy by building and maintaining public trust in our institutions and in those who run them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key role of Government in the life of the economy and its impact on the lives and interests of those in private and public life are increasingly evident. Against this background, possible conflicts of interest can easily arise between the private interests of those in senior public office or employment and the public interest.  In such situations, it is vital to public trust and confidence that <Col N="1466" /> the public be assured that those working on their behalf put the public interest first.</P>
    <P>It is to deal with these realities that the Programme for Government committed us to the registration of the interests of Oireachtas Members, and to similar arrangements for senior civil servants and State body executives.  The programme also promised a legislative basis for the treatment of gifts made to office holders.</P>
    <P>The disclosure requirement set out in the Bill honours these commitments in full and in some instances goes beyond what we committed ourselves to in the Programme for Government.  Apart from requiring the disclosure of the interests of Oireachtas members and senior civil servants and senior executives of State bodies, the Bill sets out additional requirements in respect of office holders and special advisers.  The application of the Bill to every kind of public body is also provided for.</P>
    <P>We have built on the programme commitments, to construct a Bill which lays down ground rules for the identification and resolution of any conflicts between the personal interests of those in public life or employment and the broader public interest.</P>
    <P>The disclosure of interests, either through a public register where appropriate, or through confidential but independently monitored mechanisms, is designed to identify possible conflicts between the interests of those in public life or employment and the public interest.  Mechanisms are put in place which will address and resolve any such conflicts in a way which protects the public interest.  The result is greater openness, greater transparency, greater accountability and the promotion of the public interest.  Public trust in our institutions and in those who run them is thereby enhanced.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the role played by the Labour Party in promoting the principles behind this Bill in Opposition, and putting them into practice in Government.  I have not been unduly surprised by the reaction of some in Fine Gael to the Bill, as exemplified by Deputy Mitchell earlier <Col N="1467" /> today, for example.  Always being careful to accept the mechanisms in the Bill, he nevertheless devoted most of his speech to rubbishing the motiviation of those who prepared it and moved it.  If it is naive, as Deputy Mitchell suggests, to seek to provide a situation where the public can be reassured about conflicts of interests, then I am quite happy to be called naive.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Deputies who have spoken in this debate, particularly those who have argued that dealing with these issues somehow involves ignoring other issues, like unemployment for example, are the true cynics.  One can only begin to wonder what it is that some of them have to hide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell, on the other hand, appears to have nothing to hide.  He used the opportunity presented by this debate to put on display for the benefit of the House a virtual wagon load of spleen and bile.  I have to admit I was somewhat taken aback to read that I had been described as &ldquo;morally brain dead&rdquo; by Deputy McDowell, the member of a party which never managed to have the words &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; included in any programme for government they ever negotiated. Deputy McDowell is a constitutional lawyer whose respect for constitutional practice never prevents him from abusing the privilege of this House for vulgar personal abuse.  He is a seeker after truth who never hesitates to peddle untrue allegations to newspapers foolish enough to take him seriously.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell is a double-jobbing lawyer who augments his public and private sources of legal income by holding down a substantial salary as a public representative also.  Having read his diatribe in the House, and knowing him for what he is, I have to say that the day I am praised by Deputy McDowell, is the day I will start to examine my conscience.</P>
    <P>I am, apparently, morally brain dead because rather than accepting at face value the allegations made by the Deputy, I insisted on seeking out the truth.  On a previous occasion, when Deputy McDowell's former leader came <Col N="1468" /> to me with serious allegations, I reacted in exactly the same way, and was thanked by Deputy O'Malley at the time.  Deputy McDowell, it seems, regards anyone who doubts his word as being unfit for public office.  Personally I regard anyone who shares Deputy McDowell's views as being unfit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill, in providing for the disclosure of interests, we have applied the principle that, where disclosure is necessary, then the disclosure should be as comprehensive as is necessary to identify the possible conflict, while protecting so far as we can the legitimate privacy of those involved, particularly third parties.</P>
    <P>We have attached equal importance to the principle that the Act should have real teeth.  We have done this by the establishment of recognisably independent and powerful monitoring and enforcement bodies and machinery.  We are proposing the establishment of select committees to deal with contraventions by Oireachtas Members, and a top level independent commission to ensure that contraventions by officeholders and others can be investigated and reported.</P>
    <P>This will ensure that the requirements of the Act are met and that any contraventions will be adequately dealt with. Once a contravention is reported a range of sanctions can be brought into play. These could include disciplinary action which could extend to suspension or loss of office or dismissal in serious cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a comprehensive remit.  It applies to Deputies and Senators and to a broad range of officeholders, that is, Ministers and Ministers of State, the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  The Bill also applies to the holders of designated directorships and positions of employment throughout the public sector.</P>
    <P>Two broad kinds of disclosure will be required of each of the categories just mentioned, annual statements of interests and <i>ad hoc</i> declarations of statements where a direct conflict of interest arises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government on gifts to Ministers, the Bill provides that any gift worth in excess of £500 given to an officeholder or to his or her spouse becomes the property of the State. Detailed guidelines to give practical effect to this and related provisions will be drawn up under the Act.  The independent Commission will be involved in this process.  The Bill provides also for full openness and transparency in relation to personal appointments by Ministers of special advisers.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, an independent Commission comprised of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Ombudsman, the Ceann Comhairle and the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad, will oversee the Bill as respects officeholders, special advisers and the holders of designated directorships and positions of employment in public bodies.  A select committee on Members' interests, to be established in each House, will oversee the provisions of the Bill as these affect ordinary Oireachtas Members.</P>
    <P>The Commission and the select committees will have full investigative powers, including the requiring of the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents or other evidence.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1889 to 1916 to ensure that these apply to officeholders and to the wider public sector.  Penalties are also updated.</P>
    <P>Lest any impression be created that we need this Bill because of a general lack of integrity on the part of those in public office or employment, our democracy has been supremely well served by the integrity and commitment of elected representatives and public servants.</P>
    <P>This Bill will allow those in public life to demonstrate what most well-informed people rightly believe to be true: that public representatives and senior public servants act in the public interest, and that it is the public interest alone which motivates the conduct of public business.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming majority of people in public life have nothing to hide &mdash; quite the contrary.  Over time, the Bill <Col N="1470" /> will help to demonstrate that.  Hopefully, in so doing, the Bill will also serve to dispel the prevalent corrosive cynicism about public representation and service today.</P>

      <P>Ethics in Government is a topic which instinctively appeals to politicians and the public.  It is something that is expected of everybody in society, but particularly politicians and, more particularly, Ministers and their staff.  It is with great pleasure, therefore, that I support the concept of a Bill such as this.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer in a localised manner to something which is absolutely unethical in Government and affects ordinary people in urban areas.  I fought a lengthy by-election campaign and was no sooner re-elected to the Dáil when, to my amazement, I noticed an incredible increase in the number of people coming to my advice centres thinking that as I am now a Deputy I could get them a &ldquo;Government&rdquo; job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not understand the reason for this increase.  In my naivety, I assumed that everybody who registered with FÁS would have an equal chance of securing jobs in the public service as unskilled operatives.  That was my simplistic and ethical understanding of the way such vacancies were filled in the public service.  When I inquired why people were suddenly coming to me as an Opposition Deputy I was informed that FÁS officials had told those desperate for work that the only people who could secure work for them was their local Dáil Deputies.  I suggested that their prospects were hardly enhanced by an Opposition Deputy submitting a letter to a Fianna Fáil or Labour Party Minister <Col N="1471" /> and that the only people who could pull strings for them were those in power.  In the hope that those in power would not be as unethical as suggested.  I made inquiries from FÁS and discovered that there is a long waiting list of people on a panel for &ldquo;Government&rdquo; jobs and, to my horror, I also discovered that FÁS was able to secure work for only seven operatives from a list comprising several hundred.</P>
      <P>However, unless you have friends and contacts in high places at ministerial level and affiliated to a political party you do not necessarily get the job to which you are entitled.  The Minister should explain to the people on those panels why they are instructed by FÁS &mdash; whose officials are totally frustrated with the way the system is operating &mdash; to see their local TDs.  There should be transparency in this area.  We are dealing with hundreds of decent citizens who desperately want to work and who believe that if they register and go on a panel their turn will come, but sadly that will not be the case for many of them.  Does the Ethics in Government Bill extend transparency to this area?  I am not sure if the Bill covers it, if it does not, it is a damning condemnation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministerial prerogative and power come into play in bread and butter issues such as jobs.  Some of my constituents worked on SES schemes which ran for 12 months, under no circumstances could they be extended beyond that period.  As an innocent young TD I accepted the rules of the system laid down by the former Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern.  I understood from his Department that the rule governing the time period applying to those schemes was strict.  To my horror and disgust I discovered that the Minister was empowered, and used his power liberally, to extend the period on which workers were employed on those schemes from 12 to 24 months without interruption.  People may say this is political bitchery, that Ministers have such power, that everybody knows this happens and that I am silly to say there is something disgusting, unethical and wrong about this.  We are <Col N="1472" /> dealing with human beings who desperately want to work to put bread on the table to feed their families.  Who is to say that the family entitled to be rescued is the one known by the political forces in power on a given day?  The position is unethical, disgraceful and disgusting. FÁS will send constituents to me because the only way they will get Government jobs is by canvassing their TDs.  I want the Minister to reassure me that there is a proper system in place and that the Ethics in Government Bill will bring about transparency so that people who get employment will get it on merit.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain how vocational education committees work and why the composition of the interview boards comprise, in the main, representatives of political parties?  How does this Bill address the ethical question of why law abiding, tax paying teachers, of no political persuasion who are excellent in their role as teachers must be interviewed by a political panel?  They are often thrown on the scrap heap, not because of their inability to do the job for which they apply, but, sadly, because they are not members of the political party in power.  If the Minister can convince me that simple ethical questions like those are addressed in the Bill, that there will be transparency, that we will know how people get jobs, that they will be able to hold their head high and that we can look them in the eye in the knowledge they got jobs on merit and not by political interference, I will fully support the Bill.  However, I must await the Minister's response on whether those issues are covered.  Having unburdened myself of frustrations because of unethical procedures and unethical use of power by Ministers and people in influential positions, I defer to my colleague in the Green Party.</P>

They may be forgiven for imagining <Col N="1473" /> something of which they do not have first hand experience and wondering if their political representatives take on their jobs for more than altruistic reasons. That is a sad reflection on the centralised system which we have not merely allowed to develop but encouraged.  The Bill provides safeguards and touches on the ethics issue.  However, other areas spring to mind, especially following a heated series of radio interviews with successful town commissioners and urban district councils after the local and European elections.  Some representatives find it difficult to believe what is happening in their representative boards.  They may have topped the poll and been given a democratic mandate, but when they take up office in their local council, often as independents, they face a coalition arrangement quickly cobbled together, similar to that in the House.  That arrangement is not motivated by ideology or a common view of the world but by the desire to grab power and carve up whatever positions are available, often on vocational education committee bodies or other committees associated with the urban district council.  These matters about which people feel strongly are not dealt with in the Bill, but they give rise to suspicions about the system. The ethics Bill will not reassure people about the level of self interest they detect in politics.  How will the register be made available?</P>
    <P>With freedom of information on environmental matters, the prospect of a freedom for information Bill may be closer.  However, if the present level of availability of information on environmental matters is an example of what that means, there are many problems still to be solved as information on environmental matters is still withheld by many local authorities on various pretexts, such as, that it has not been officially presented or published or that not enough copies are available.  Local authorities have certainly not shown a good example on the question of freedom of information to date compared with countries, such as Sweden, which are progressive in many areas including the <Col N="1474" /> making available of information which is of public interest.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the question of the limit of £500 on the value of gifts given to public figures.  Gifts given to political figures are usually not put on the market but are gifts of a sentimental nature which may have been part of the donor country's heritage.  One only has to go a couple of yards down the corridor to see the banner presented by the late President John Fitzgerald Kennedy of the USA which one certainly would not put a value on.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl go mbeidh mé ag súil le foirmeacha dátheangacha i leith an Bhille seo.  Níl mé ag rá go mbeidh foirmeacha Gaeilge ar fáil ach iad a lorg mar go minic bíonn sé an-deacair iad a aimsiú.  Ach má táimid chun sampla dátheangach a thabhairt don phobal ba cheart dúinn tosnú anseo le Gaeilge agus Béarla i dteannta a chéile ar aon leathanach amháin.</P>
      <P>I note the inclusion of special advisers in the Bill.  I note also that civil democracy as we know it is beginning to give way to a form of monarchy.  A collection of people around an elected representative or a Minister gives one the feeling that they are in blessed company. It points to a trend towards centralisation where some people get elected and others, who will have power, are appointed at their discretion.  We must turn that around and move towards a decentralised organisation of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the inclusion of income from another trade include expenses incurred as a member of a local authority?  Often elected representatives are able to earn considerable extra income as members of other elected bodies and that needs to be borne in mind.  The Green Party does not like to see, and looks for the abolition of, the dual or treble mandate.  However, we have it and we must deal with it.  On <Col N="1475" /> the question of the inclusion of travel facilities.  I wonder if the World Cup comes to people's minds when they look at that.</P>
    <P>In many ways this Bill has been forced upon us by the news media.  There have been many examples in the media of public figures earning large sums of money with no explanation of how they earned that money.  Because of lack of co-operation on the part of elected representatives, particularly those in Government, the Garda Síochána have been unable to get to the bottom of many allegations of bribery which may or may not involve local representatives.  It is an indication of failure that people are left wondering if there is substance to such allegations.  The Minister will recall the many allegations that circulated in Dublin County Council.  To some extent this highlights the pitfalls in a system that encourages careerism in politics as opposed to the involvement of a democratic process for everybody rather than the select few, a very centralised system which is reflected now in the debate about the EU President, one person who is so powerful and so political.  We need to look at the long term message that a decentralised system ought to take ethics into account and move to a position where people are more in touch with democracy rather than having it so centralised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Shatter. I should like first to compliment the two parties in Government on having the hardest necks that I can recall in my time in public life to come into the House with this legislation which is laudable in itself and certainly desirable and which will be helpful to politicians and people in public life generally.  However, I presume the inspiration for this legislation came from the last 15 or 16 months of the two parties' sojourn in Government where the Labour Party not only emulated but excelled the worst excesses of Fianna Fáil in terms of jobbery, fixing and looking after their friends.  I can only conclude <Col N="1476" /> that, having wrestled with their respective consciences for a while, they decided it was time to occupy the high moral ground once again.</P>
      <P>I give both parties credit for having the gall, in the last week before the summer recess when their credibility is at its lowest ebb, to introduce the Bill.  It looks more like an ethics for the Opposition Bill because it cannot and does not apply to the Government.  They may protest about what was said by all parties on this side of the House in the past few days, but the criticisms were well deserved.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a clear indication to the public that there will be no chicanery in public office.  What is public office? Who has power in a public office?  It is not Deputies or Senators, because they are not in public office.  The only people who have access to the trappings of power are Government Ministers and their advisers, senior and junior, and the other people in their entourage who have access to the public office.  It is certainly not Opposition Members or Government backbench Deputies, unless they have the assistance of a Government Minister, who has the power.  It is they who are at the centre of power.  Could any Government backbencher or any Opposition Deputy of whatever hue influence one Government contract?  The answer is no.  Not one Government contract can be influenced by any Deputy on this side of the House or by any Government backbencher without the assistance of a Minister.  The presumption is that this legislation will cater for the consciences of those who might fall by the wayside and, perhaps, help the democratic process in some way.  However, I doubt if one can legislate to make people honest if they do not intend to.  That is a flaw in the legislation.  I recognise the need to ensure that the public can have trust in the people they elect to public office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bell, a decent and honest man, said he would have no difficulty about disclosing his assets, of which he has none, but I was amazed at what he went on to say.  I, and other Members, have no difficulty disclosing our assets, of which we have little or none &mdash; the few <Col N="1477" /> we had before we arrived in this House are fast diminishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not tempt me.  Her Leader almost tempted me a few minutes ago.  Deputy Bell, in his innocence, said that the Labour Party had never been involved in any chicanery about zoning land and other unsavoury activities, but that parties such as Fine Gael had.  However, there was no mention of Fianna Fáil.  For some reason the Opposition was identified as the culprits in a power game.</P>
      <P>There is no question that one of the reasons this legislation has come before us is that somebody on that side of the House concluded there was a need to put forward a logical argument that would stand up before all credibility has been eroded.  It irritated me intensely to hear Deputy Bell &mdash; I like the Deputy who is a decent Member &mdash; suggest that the Labour Party has never been involved in zoning of property or other activity that is generally regarded as dangerous or dubious.</P>
      <P>At a time when public confidence in the political system has been eroded I would have thought that an Ethics in Public Office Bill, which would dispel people's doubts about those elected to public office, should be applied retrospetively. Is this Bill being introduced in the manner of St. Augustine, after all the friends and relations have been appointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A former Taoiseach, a decent man who is well able to speak for himself, was castigated in his House for being of a dubious character.  It was implied on more than one occasion that his friends benefited from the fact that he was in public office.  If he was condemned for that, what happened to those who came after him?  Not only did the friends benefit, the relations also benefited.  There is no indication in this legislation that changes will be made in that area.  It has been said that very close members of families will be scrutinised by a declaration <Col N="1478" /> of interest, but that does no necesarily mean that things will change, that everything will come up smelling of roses from now on.  It means nothing.  We have no difficulty with a declaration of interest.  We would welcome it if we thought it would be of benefit.  I hope it will benefit the Government who is in dire straits in that area at present and needs all the help it can get.</P>
    <P>I had much more to say on this legislation but it cannot be said in ten minutes and I wish to give my good friend and colleague, Deputy Shatter, time to contribute. I hope that after the passing of this legislation we wll see the turning over of a new leaf, with pristine, clean operations from the Government side that will be an example to all of us and that it will not be simply an application of standards for the opposition that the Government has no intention of living up to.</P>

      <P>The Ethics in Public Office Bill was conceived by the Labour Party to deflect public criticism from its post-general election machinations.  It is the hope of the Labour Party that this Bill will ensure that its political dangerous liaison with Fianna Fáil does not prove an electoral fatal attraction.  An important comment was made by the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, when delivering her speech on this measure last week.  She stated that an objective of this Bill is &ldquo;to strengthen democracy and let in the light&rdquo;.  As other speakers already stated, this Bill has little to do with ethics, it is in reality a declaration of interest Bill &mdash; no more and no less.  Moreover, in its substantive provisions it is seriously flawed as ably demonstrated by other speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exaggerated claims for this measure should not be made.  While its general objectives are not unreasonable, it does not to any extent strengthen democracy or let in the light.  While its contents are lengthy it is a mere pinprick on the body politic.  Its enactment will not make the procedures of this House any more relevant to the everyday problems of ordinary people.  It will not restore the faith of <Col N="1479" /> our alienated generations in our political institutions and it will not result in an upsurge of new applicants to join the major political parties, nor will it bring a new transparency to our decision making processes.</P>
    <P>The fact that this Bill is misnamed the Ethics in Public Office Bill starkly illustrates the extent to which Government and some Members are divorced from reality.  Generations of our people have scant regard for the Members from all parties.  The making of false promises; the raising of unrealisable expectations; character assassination of political opponents; political patronage and nepotism; the politics of nudge and wink; personally politically advantageous U-turns; the betrayal of much vaunted commitment to principles; phoney public relations campaigns; self-serving announcements of exaggerated achievements; lack of competence shown by many who have held Government office in various administrations &mdash; these and other phenomena combine to produce a pot-pourri of disillusionment and public political cynicism.</P>
    <P>If we are to strengthen democracy we must truly modernise the procedures of this House so that Members can, on a daily basis, force the Government of the day to fully account for its actions without the Ceann Comhairle being forced by rules of this House to intervene.  We should distinguish between those fundamental issues of economic and social policy which require political parties to impose a whip and other issues to which the tyranny of the whip should not be applied so that those elected to this House can apply a degree of personal judgment when voting on a variety of issues that are not central to the functions of or survival of government.</P>
    <P>If committees are to truly add to democracy, powers should be extended to them to subpoena witnesses to attend before them and to fully and properly cross-examine Ministers and civil servants responsible for decisions that determine the fate of this country.  We should truly let in the light and provide for <Col N="1480" /> greater transparency over a broad spectrum of Government and administrative decisions which affect the lives of so many who live outside this House.  We have talked of the need for a freedom of information Bill for too long.  Such a measure should be enacted as a priority.</P>
    <P>We must also, as Members, behave differently.  We must reflect the aspirations and ethos of the new generations of Irish men and women who still hope for politicians in this State to whom they can look for inspiration and in whom they can have confidence.  On occasion, it is too easy when measures such as this come before this House to engage in caricature politics and use this type of debate as a platform to gratuitously attack the Government of the day and those parties who form part of that Government for their alleged hypocrisy and dishonesty. The behaviour of the Labour Party in the past 18 months renders such an approach for all those on the Opposition benches almost irresistible.</P>
    <P>There is something too comforting about maintaining the pretence that those on the opposite side of the House are the incarnation of evil and those on this side of saintly disposition.  It is not only comforting but also politically self-serving to believe that when you are not in Government, those in Government are constantly conspiring to benefit themselves and to do down the State.  I confess that in the past, like others, I have indulged in this type of politics.  Upon reflection, rather than ensuring the accountability of Government for its actions, such an approach, too frequently adopted from the Opposition benches merely adds to growing public cynicism and, of its nature, poses long term dangers to democracy.</P>
    <P>Most times, charges made against the Government of the day and individual Ministers are of an exaggerated nature. I have become in recent years more a devotee of the cock-up principle of politics than of the conspiracy theory to which too many of us in this House are devoted.  I believe this is the view held by the majority of the general public.  When things go wrong, Members on the Opposition <Col N="1481" /> benches should be wary of engaging in excessive political fulminations against the parties who form the Government of the day in a democracy in which continuing coalition Governments are inevitable and in a Parliament in which most, if not all, parties have in the past or will be in the future in bed with each other.  Those who excessively fulminate, having climbed out of the coalition bed, or those who fulminate and then climb into it, not only undermine their own personal credibility but also increase public cynicism.</P>
    <P>Those outside this House want a competent Government which they truly believe is doing its best to advance the interests of this country and those who live in it.  When things go wrong, whether it be due to cock-up or conspiracy, the procedures of this House must work better to ensure that Government can be made to perform competently and held truly accountable for its actions.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is appropriate that this debate coincides with the Government today publishing its Refugee Bill.  The manner in which we have treated over the years those seeking political asylum in this country has been little short of a scandal and a disgrace.  I have no doubt that if some of the members of the heroic Irish World Cup team had originated from somewhere different and had arrived at Shannon Airport seeking political asylum, instead of being received with a welcome greeting they would be unceremoniously bundled back on board a plane.  I have no doubt the Government Bill would not have been published if I had not republished my own Bill two weeks ago that was voted down in this House just over a year ago.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that in the future all those who seek political asylum are treated decently and that there is true transparency and accountability in the decision making process.  This also applies to those who seek naturalisation and to those who seek visas for relations to visit this country where it seems that for reasons of colour alone, such visas are refused.  Prejudice and exclusivity rather <Col N="1482" /> than decency and humanity seem on the surface too frequently to be the determinant in the decision making process. The unpublished secretive procedures that currently apply and the lack of rationale for many of the decisions reflect a world that is starkly described in Franz Kafka's book <i>The Trial.</i> The upholding of ethics and morality in politics demands that we adopt a different approach to all of these areas.</P>
    <P>The publishing of the Refugee Bill is, I believe, not sufficient.  We should also examine our history in this area so as to ensure that the manner in which we behaved in the past is not repeated in the future.</P>
    <P>It is almost 50 years since the end of World War II and as papers in the State archives are now public material, is it not time that a committee of this House examine the manner in which we treated those of the Jewish faith and others who sought political asylum in Ireland not only before and during but also after the war years and who found the door closed?  Is it not time for us to come to terms with the behaviour during those years of both Governments and civil servants and ask why, with a few exceptions, we kept our doors firmly closed to those who sought to come here having escaped the gas ovens of Europe?  Or are we to be the only State in Europe who refuses to examine the morality of our actions and ask the hard questions?</P>
    <P>This is not only an issue of history but a signpost as to how we should conduct our public affairs in the future.  It is also a litmus test of our ability to accept responsibility for past actions.  It is an issue of political ethics and morality which should be confronted also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is on the principles of the Ethics in Public Office Bill, which forms part of the Programme for Government and which has had an abnormally long gestation period since it was first published.  Its publication is almost a year late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might have imagined that, in that context, the Bill would be one which was comprehensive, well-drafted and capable <Col N="1483" /> of dealing with real situations which have come into existence in the meantime.  On the contrary, we find that the Bill has few of these characteristics.  It does not deal with the most elementary situation involving ethics in public office, whereby one Minister can, by exercise of his ministerial powers, confer a very significant advantage on another Minister.  Issues of accountability, conflict of interest and the public's right to know thereby come into question.  That is possibly the most elementary instance of ethics in public office.</P>
    <P>We find, unfortunately, that section 14 of this Bill does not even cover such a situation.  The only conflict of interest that a Minister is required to disclose is a conflict of interest in which he or a person connected to him stands to gain.  How that simple elementary error was allowed to stand in this Bill, notwithstanding the executive scrutiny it received, beggars belief.</P>
    <P>We are now told that that particular loophole will be closed by Committee Stage amendments.  Perhaps it will, but the crucial point at this stage is that the Bill tendered by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, was wholly inadequate and that any Minister who was so minded could run a coach and four through its provisions.  But the inadequacies of the Bill do not stop there.  The Bill also goes on to prove that the only disclosure of a possible conflict of interest on the part of a Minister that is required is a private letter from that Minister to the Taoiseach. As long as the Minister acknowledges in writing that he has a conflict of interest to the Taoiseach of the day, the provisions of the Bill have no further effect and the matter may not be investigated further.  The commission established under the Bill cannot investigate further once it has been informed that the Taoiseach was duly notified in writing by the Minister concerned of his conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>So, even if the Committee Stage amendment to cover the activities of one Minister which benefit another Minister <Col N="1484" /> is made, the Bill is flawed by reason of the complete absence of safeguards in respect of any abuse by a Minister of his ministerial powers, apart from the obligation to notify the Taoiseach of the day.</P>
    <P>All of this might appear academic if we were dealing with a perfect world.  It might be thought that a Minister who reported a conflict of interest to the Taoiseach would be required by the Taoiseach to explain the conflict of interest and to demonstrate publicly that he or she had not abused his or her office.  Unfortunately, no such remedy is envisaged in the Bill and it is not to be assumed, on recent experience, that any such procedure will, in fact, be put in place.</P>
    <P>In the course of her Second Stage speech, the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, drew particular attention to the &ldquo;citizenship for sale&rdquo; controversy.  I feel, therefore, that I am entitled to pursue that matter somewhat further tonight.  Some commentators have suggested that, unless we find out some &ldquo;new&rdquo; information, the matter cannot be further investigated.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  All the facts we know about this matter speak for themselves. They suggest very strongly that members of the present Government and one member of a previous Government abused their office and that the result of that abuse of public office was a very significant financial advantage to the Taoiseach personally.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is worth reminding ourselves of the sequence of events which gave rise to this recent controversy.  According to a radio interview given by the financial director of C&amp;D Foods Ltd. on 30 May 1994, that company was approached in September 1991, when the present Taoiseach was then Minister for Finance, by someone acting on behalf of the Masris' inquiring about a possible investment in the company.  Agreement was reached on an investment of £1.1 million in March 1992, when Deputy Reynolds was Taoiseach. He was out of office in late 1991 and early 1992 and it seems inconceivable that he would not have learned of the <Col N="1485" /> Masris' proposals during the period when he was out of office.</P>
    <P>I use the term &ldquo;investment&rdquo; loosely because it would appear that we are dealing here with a loan and not with any purchase of equity in the company.  The people involved, an Arab family, were not resident in Ireland and have never been resident in Ireland.  They used an intermediary to approach C &amp; D Foods Ltd.  This intermediary had frequently acted for persons seeking Irish citizenship on foot of what are called &ldquo;investments&rdquo;. Subsequently, that intermediary introduced one of the members of the family, who was not an investor in the company, to the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith.  He, in turn sponsored the application for the wife and son of the man whom he met on foot of their &ldquo;investment&rdquo; in Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy Smith denies that he was ever aware that the investment in question was in the Taoiseach's firm.  I will return to that later.  The Minister for the Environment appears not to have met the two people whom he sponsored and who got citizenship on his recommendation.</P>
    <P>In December 1992, the then Minister for Justice, and now the European Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, made a decision to grant citizenship to the wife and son of the man who had been met by the Minister for the Environment.  The then Minister, Deputy Flynn, must have been aware, from records in his Department, that the investment was in the Taoiseach's family firm and yet, it is suggested that neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister, Deputy Smith, was ever contacted by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, on the matter.  We are supposed to accept that it was never mentioned to either of them.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;investment&rdquo;, which appears to have been a soft loan, was first broached when the present Taoiseach was Minister for Finance and was put in place when he was Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach denies all knowledge of this transaction, even though he was out of office for several months during this period.</P>
    <P>Is this denial credible?  At all material times, the Taoiseach has been owner of <Col N="1486" /> the single largest shareholding in the company, about 41 per cent of its ordinary shares.  Doubtless he has, when in office, resigned his directorship of the company.  His wife and son remain as directors and are also shareholders of considerable significance.  The Taoiseach, and his immediate family, own over 90 per cent of the company.  The company records show that, at the time the £1.1. million investment was made, C &amp; D Foods was indebted to the extent of £1.4 million.  A soft loan or a credit facility of £1.1 million to the company in those circumstances must have been a matter of huge significance to all of the shareholders in the company.  It defies belief, and I do not accept, that the Taoiseach was unaware of the fact that the company of which he was the largest single personal shareholder was receiving a large financial facility from an Arabian mother and son.</P>
    <P>I reject completely the plausibility of the scenario that has been trotted out to the media by spin doctors and public relations consultants to the effect that the Taoiseach was personally unaware of this transaction.  The directors of the company, including close members of his family, must have been aware of the arrangement.  They too must have known that the only reason the Masris selected their company for an investment was to procure citizenship.  If the Masris were not primarily interested in getting citizenship, they could have more profitably invested the £1.1 million elsewhere.  In those circumstances, it is simply preposterous to ask the country to believe that his close family directors deliberately kept the Taoiseach in the dark.  Unless he was kept in the dark, he knew about the matter, if he knew about the matter, he has not been truthful with the public.</P>
    <P>We are further asked to believe, however, that the two Ministers who were personally close to the Taoiseach and who dealt with the application also kept the Taoiseach in the dark.  Again, that is such a preposterous suggestion as not to merit serious consideration, but, again, it is trotted out for public acceptance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> If the matter ended there, there would be scandal enough, but the matter goes much further and much more deeply than that.  This decision to naturalise two members of the Masri family was taken under what is termed a &ldquo;business migration scheme&rdquo;.  The purpose of that scheme is to confer Irish citizenship on people who have a connection with Ireland, who are resident here, who propose to reside here in the future and who have made a genuine investment in Ireland of a durable kind.</P>
    <P>In the case of the soft loan to the Taoiseach's company, none of these criteria were satisfied.  First, there was no Irish connection of any kind.  Second, there was not and has not since been any bona fide residence by the people concerned in Ireland and, third, there has been no real investment.  Instead, we have a temporary financial facility given to an Irish company.  All of these elements show that the criteria laid down by the Department of Justice for the conferring of citizenship were breached.</P>
    <P>Moreover, we know that no effort of any kind was made to evaluate the direct impact on employment of the proposed investment.  The matter was not referred to the Industrial Development Authority or to the Department of Industry and Commerce for their evaluation, and little or no checks were carried out to ascertain whether the Masris had any Irish connections, or whether they had in fact any bona fide residence here or any bona fide intention to reside here.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, the granting of citizenship to these people was wrong, was in contravention of both the spirit and the letter of the business migration scheme and mounted, without exaggeration, to a simple sale of Irish and European Union citizenship in exchange for a soft loan to an Irish company.</P>
    <P>Combining these circumstances with the fact that this was an approach made to the then Minister for Finance's company and the fact that the soft loan was put in place when he was Taoiseach, and to the fact that this application for citizenship, sponsored by one Minister, was approved <Col N="1488" /> by a second and was, in effect, for the benefit of a third Minister, the Head of the Government, in so far as he benefited more than anybody else from the financial advantage accruing from the &ldquo;investment&rdquo;, the whole affair was and is a major scandal and an appalling departure from any reasonable standards of public behaviour in Irish life.</P>
    <P>Compounding all of this is the claim by the Taoiseach that this is an effort to involve his family unfairly in the controversy. It is no such thing.  He was the Taoiseach when the loan was put in place in the company of which he was 41 per cent shareholder; he is the person who claims now to have been kept in the dark about the loan; he is the person whom his fellow directors and fellow Cabinet members might reasonably be expected to have informed of these matters. Nobody is impugning his family's role in this matter.  The questions that must be answered are questions of the Taoiseach himself.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has postured as being offended.  He has suggested in this House that all questions concerning this matter should be addressed to this family firm. They, of course, refuse to answer any such questions The public are being kept in the dark on a matter of grave public importance.  Some people in the media seem content to let the matter lie at that.</P>
    <P>If any of the Taoiseach's predecessors had behaved in the way that he has done in this matter, both he and the other Ministers involved, would all have resigned or would have been hounded into resigning.  It is a mark of our times that this has happened now.</P>

      <P>I wish to make some general comments on the debate.  The Fine Gael Party appears to believe that anything that does not involve our going into government with them is inherently unethical.  While the Progressive Democrats Party, during its term of office in Government, constantly jumped up and down on issues of principle, it never brought forward legislation in this area.  It now appears to find many difficulties in the ethical area but I ask <Col N="1490" /> Deputy O'Malley in particular, who occupied a senior position in the last Government, what legislation he brought forward to close the loopholes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we will not be relying, as a result of this legislation, on Deputy O'Malley's blocking tactics within a Government.  The legislation which will be adopted by this House will stand the test of time.  Deputy O'Malley's party, while expressing a great deal of ethical concern, did not see fit to bring forward any legislation in this area.  It is more satisfactory to record the need for legislation on the record of this House than to rely on the conscience of Deputy O'Malley in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies took issue with the title of the Bill saying that it is more about the disclosure of interests than <Col N="1491" /> ethics.  These criticisms of the Bill overlook not only a number of its key provisions but they also fail to appreciate the cultural impetus which the Bill will impart.  This is a landmark Bill and time will bear that out.</P>
    <P>A disclosure process is fundamental to the identification and separation of public and private interests.  The positive impact which this process will have on behaviour in public life should not be underestimated. Those making statements of interests, they are also making a statement about the supremacy of the public interest and the need for and acceptance of the highest ethical standards in their conduct of public business.  The conduct of public business is made more transparent, those in public life become more accountable and we foster and safeguard an ethos of genuine public service.</P>
    <P>I would refer Deputies also to the extension of the prevention of corruption legislation which goes back to 1916 and which contains loopholes.  We are extending this to officeholders and to all those holding positions in the public sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>The independent commission is a cornerstone of the Bill. The commission is entitled to request any declarations made under the Bill in any of the cases where it is not directly supplied with the information.  This powerful access to information breaks the circle of secrecy.  Where an independent and powerful investigative third party has access to all information the culture of the golden circle becomes much less probable.  Deputies raised the issues of Greencore, Telecom, Aer Lingus Holidays and other problems of lapses of the highest ethical standard in the public sector.  In the wake of those disclosures the public service drew up guidelines on the operation of State companies which we are extending and putting on a statutory footing.  We have learned from what <Col N="1492" /> happened in those cases, and this Bill will ensure that the golden circle will not exist in the semi-State sector because information on interests will be available to the supervisory authorities and the independent commission.  This will ensure that the type of problems which arose will not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about information in relation to influence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We envisage a developmental role for the Commission in the general area of ethics in public office, particularly through the promulgation of guidelines and advice and through the annual and special report mechanisms provided for under section 26.  We see this role as central to promoting the highest standards in public life.</P>
      <P>The Bill, like any legal instrument, can only go so far.  We cannot legislate for the Ten Commandments.  The Bill addresses the key issues which are proper to legislation and our legislation bears comparison with the best international practice.  To the extent that the Bill cannot cover the wider ethical dimension we need to focus on extra statutory procedures and codes of practice, not just at Government level but throughout the public sector.  The Bill, through the Commission, will give a powerful impetus to the development and promulgation of such practices and codes.  Public sector employers will have a particular responsibility in this regard.  The net result will be the creation of a corpus of law and practice which addresses the ethical dimension in the broadest sense.</P>
      <P>The requirements in the Bill not only honour the commitments in the Programme for Government but go beyond them in some instances.  In addition to requiring the disclosure of interests of Oireachtas members, senior civil servants and senior executives of State bodies the Bill makes provisions for office holders, special advisers and public servants generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the points about legislation for disclosure of political donations, ceilings on election spending and State funding of <Col N="1493" /> political parties, the electoral Bill, now at final drafting stage, will give effect to the Programme for Government commitments in this regard.  If Deputies can suggest practical ways in which this Bill might better achieve the stated objectives they will have every opportunity of doing so on Committee Stage.  As I said last week.  I will be as positive as possible in responding to these.  We want the Bill to be as comprehensive as possible and any improvements we can make to it will be made.  I will bring forward an important amendment to deal with the public concern raised by the passport controversy.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the points made about the section 7 requirement for disclosure of interests in Oireachtas proceedings. While Deputies accept the principle of what is proposed some have misgivings about the mechanism in the section.  It is simple enough to declare one's interests when speaking on a debate but practical difficulties arise when a Deputy is summoned to vote.  I will be happy to look at alternative mechanisms which meet the same principle.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of imposing controls on those leaving the public service and taking up positions in the private sector, the so-called gamekeeper turned poacher scenario.  I examined this issue when preparing the Bill but there were complicated legal and practical difficulties which would make it difficult to frame and implement legislation. Deputy Currie asked whether the Second Schedule provisions on land encompass second homes or property held outside the jurisdiction.  Disclosure is not necessary in respect of the private homes of Members.  Apart from that and the general exception that land valued under £10,000 is exempt under the Second Schedule, the Bill requires disclosure of property held inside and outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie also asked how Members would value gifts and Deputy Sargent asked how Ministers' gifts would be valued.  Under the Bill the Secretary to the Government values gifts to Ministers. The majority of gifts given to people in public life are modest tokens of appreciation <Col N="1494" />&mdash; a bunch of flowers is the one I appreciate most and is the most frequent gift I am given, a pen, a piece of inscribed glass and so on.  Clearly the market value of such gifts is well below the threshold value specified in the Bill.  Deputies will agree that people should not seek to influence Members of the House or the Government by giving them valuable gifts.  Such cases are likely to be rare in practice.</P>
    <P>The select committee set up under the Bill can draw up guidelines for the guidance of Members and those who may be given a gift of borderline value can seek the advice of the committee who will arrange for appropriate valuation if this is necessary.</P>

      <P>Ministers and other officeholders will be required to surrender to the State gifts worth over £500 while Oireachtas Members are required to disclose such gifts but not surrender them.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies stated that the Bill is less onerous on Ministers than on backbenchers. This is not so.  Ministers are fully covered by the provisions in Part II of the Bill and are required to make the same declarations under section 7 as any other Deputy.  In answering questions in the House as well as when speaking in debate Ministers will be obliged to make public declarations of any conflict of interest.  In addition, Ministers must meet the requirements of Part III.  They are obliged to make formal written annual statements of the interests of spouses and children which could pose a potential conflict of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 14 Ministers are obliged to inform the Taoiseach in writing if they propose to exercise any function which could confer a material benefit on themselves, their family or their business partners. As head of the Government, a Taoiseach must be informed of any contemplated actions which suggest a conflict of interest.  This declaration will be available to the Commission which in turn is <Col N="1495" /> entitled to carry out any investigations it wishes on its own initiative, report on them and have the report laid before the House.  These procedures will ensure that Ministers pause and reflect, as they do at present, before contemplating any action which would appear to involve a conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the arguments made on both sides of the House for streamlining the reporting mechanisms under section 14.  I am examining how the procedure might be improved. Deputy Kenny asked why we were putting the declaration requirements on a statutory basis.  Over a year ago the House adopted a resolution to draw up a voluntary register of interests and that was referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Nothing further has been done since but as promised in the Programme for Government, we are putting that on a statutory basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are also putting on a statutory basis the disclosure of interests already required of people serving as board members and senior executives of State companies.  It is not right that we should rely in such matters on the conscience of a Desmond O'Malley in Government.  Deputy Kenny said that the people in charge should deal with lapses.  The mechanisms in the Bill provide that it is the supervisory authority, in the first instance, which is responsible for overseeing State bodies or public servants under its control.  The commission is available as a back up to the normal supervision which should be exercised over any State body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the declaration of qualifications of special advisers, Deputy Kenny said we should include commonsense as well as paper qualifications. We envisage people putting their <i>curriculum vitae</i> on the record.  Deputy Fitzgerald made a compelling case for freedom of information legislation.  She <Col N="1496" /> put it even better than I put it.  We are working on this legislation.  It is important work complementary to what we are doing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny mentioned the case of civil servants working in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry whose families may own a farm and asked if they would have to declare that at every hand's turn.  It is clear from the definition of material interest that would not be required where the interest is of such a general character.</P>
    <P>I commend to the House this important landmark Bill, which compares favourably with best international practice.</P>

      <P>As I was quick to comment on the absence of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and Forestry, I must now welcome him to the House.  His Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, was very helpful and courteous on Committee Stage and some of the amendments reflect his willingness to take on board points made by us.  I am delighted the senior Minister, whose interest in the Bill is paramount, has joined us in the House.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 indicates that the Minister is taking my amendment on board and making an amendment to the definition of &ldquo;meat&rdquo;.  If I am correct in my interpretation.  I welcome the amendment. Since Committee Stage I have received much correspondence on this point.  I was aware that if I was not clear on the point I was making I could be considered provocative or emotive.  I am seriously concerned about the huge number of unwanted, neglected and unsaleable horses clogging up the system. If people cannot get rid of unproductive animals they will not be able to replace them with productive animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> Only one abattoir specialises in the slaughter of horses.  A second abattoir of this type is essential if the industry is to be viable.  Irish people will not provide a market for horsemeat.  It is not part of our culture, it is certainly not part of mine.  Be that as it may, it is part of the culture of many continental countries and if there is a demand for chilled or frozen horsemeat, the animals having been humanely slaughtered and properly certified by abattoirs, the food board must provide the proper facilities and extend its remit to include this.</P>
    <P>Since I made this point on Committee Stage I have received three letters and one card from the welfare sector and producers who cannot get rid of animals for whatever reason, commending me on raising this matter.  While it is not likely that our culture will make any demands on this food product there are markets for it and I would like An Bord Bia to be in a position to develop those markets; it should be able to help the producers of horses in securing outlets so that the unproductive animals are humanely disposed of and not abandoned or neglected. I welcome the Minister's amendment No. 3.</P>

      <P>Following the debate on Committee Stage I gave a good deal of thought to the points raised and decided to put down amendment No. 3.  I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 2 as the amendment would confer functions on the board in relation to live horses.  I spoke about the possibility of an image problem in that horses would come within the definition of &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; and a levy for instance could be applied. We want to project an image of an Irish product as a premium product with the emphasis on a green, clean and unpolluted environment.  The inclusion of the word &ldquo;horses&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; would not be helpful, but I am prepared to include it in the definition of &ldquo;meat&rdquo;.  This covers the welfare problems <Col N="1500" /> about which Deputy Doyle spoke on Committee Stage and again tonight. In other words, it provides for the board to be involved in the marketing of the meat.  I ask Deputy Doyle to accept my amendment No. 3 as meeting the substantial problems and concerns she expressed on Committee Stage and again this evening.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 28, after &ldquo;food&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and livestock&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we discussed the point in these amendments at length. Section 7 (1) deals with the general functions of the board and reads:</P>
      <P>The functions of the Board shall be to promote, assist and develop in any manner which the Board considers necessary or desirable the marketing of Irish food and livestock.</P>
      <P>Section 8 goes on to deal with the particular functions of the board and, all of a sudden, there is no particular function in relation to the promotion, assisting and developing or the marketing of Irish livestock.  It is a general function in section 7 (1) but disappears from the particular functions enunciated in section 8.  Quite frankly, it makes no sense unless it is an omission by the Minister.  I ask that the substance of my amendment be accepted if the Minister feels he can word it better.  However, section 8, dealing with the particular functions, should read:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of section 7 the functions of the Board shall be to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  survey, investigate and develop markets and potential markets for food and livestock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the general function in the preceding section is to promote, assist and develop in any manner which the board considers necessary or desirable the marketing of Irish food and livestock, surely the particular function in section 8 (a) should be to survey, investigate and develop markets and potential markets for food and livestock if there is any logical sense or relationship between the provisions of sections 7 and 8.  Given that this Bill abolishes CBF, the Irish Meat and Livestock <Col N="1502" /> Marketing Body, and that a subsidiary board will be set up to take over most of those functions, the functions of the board should include reference to livestock all through and not just a once-off general reference in section 7.  I feel it has been stuck into section 7 almost under duress, judging by the Minister's attitude on Committee Stage.  My amendments are logical.  I am merely asking the Minister to ensure that the particular functions of the board, as outlined in section 8 (a) right through to (i), in relation to food should also extend to livestock if the Bill is to be logical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I undertook on Committee Stage to again look at this.  I am prepared to make one amendment.  I think I had better explain the whole context in relation to this.  Amendments Nos. 4 to 12, inclusive, and No. 17 propose the insertion of the words &ldquo;and livestock&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;food&rdquo; wherever it occurs in section 8 and after the words &ldquo;food products&rdquo; in section 11.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 proposes the deletion of the word &ldquo;products&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;food&rdquo; in section 11.  The problem I discovered, when I examined this, was that section 11 relates to the exercise of the functions of the board in that it reads:</P>
      <P>The Board shall, in respect of the promotion, assistance or development by the Board of the marketing of any food products. . . .</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Food products&rdquo; there I believe could not include livestock, so I propose to delete the word &ldquo;products&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If we revert to the interpretation in section (2) one finds that &ldquo;food&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;edible products, including drink whether in an unprocessed, processed or composed state . . . &rdquo;.  Since slaughtering constitutes processing, livestock are inedible products in an unprocessed state; in other words, within the definition of &ldquo;food&rdquo;, we have covered &ldquo;livestock&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is true but it was felt that, in the omnibus definition of functions, it was important to include it.  Quite frankly, I do not see how it would affect the livestock trade in any way if we included &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; throughout those sections &mdash; I do not think it would make any difference &mdash; and the interpretations section already covers the point the Deputy made.  I detected one weakness in respect of which I am proposing an amendment to address.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputy Doyle to accept that we have covered the difficulty she pointed out on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's amendment the deletion of the word &ldquo;products&rdquo; in page 7, line 40, helps to bring a little consistency to sections 7, 8 and 11 inasmuch as they interrelate in describing the functions of the board.  However, it does not solve the problem of inconsistency, particularly by way of the Minister's explanation for not accepting my amendments.  If the general function of the board is to deal with the marketing of Irish foods and livestock and it is deemed necessary to include &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; specifically in defining the general function, I do not understand how the Minister can contend that the reference to &ldquo;food&rdquo; in section 8 &mdash; the particular functions of the board &mdash; can be deemed to include &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; without expressly stating &ldquo;and livestock&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;food&rdquo; right through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I feel the livestock industry might be helped if there was express reference to livestock throughout section 8 (a) to (i), inclusive, is that, for example, if the board decided to survey, investigate <Col N="1504" /> and develop markets and potential markets for food, but excluding livestock, they would have little comeback.  It strengthens their claim if they feel sufficient attention and importance is not given to the livestock sector by An Bord Bia; that is the point.  I want to put beyond doubt that the functions of CBF will be taken over not just by the subsidiary committee but by the board itself. Given that the addition of &ldquo;and livestock&rdquo; is, at most &mdash; according to the Minister's statement &mdash; superfluous, it would not change the meaning if the Minister would accede to my request.  I cannot understand why he cannot do that to copperfasten the interests of the livestock sector alongside the food sector.</P>
    <P>The present interrelation of sections 7, 8 and 11 is inconsistent, even though the Minister has improved the consistency by his amendment to section 11.  The Minister should either delete the reference to &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; in section 7 &mdash; given that the definition of &ldquo;food&rdquo; includes livestock on the Minister's own admission &mdash; or else, wherever &ldquo;food&rdquo; is mentioned in terms of a function of the board, it should be accompanied by the words &ldquo;and livestock&rdquo;.  I am disappointed the Minister will not take my amendment on board, even if he could accept the first of that group of amendments, amendment No. 4 dealing with section 8 (a), so that at least the concept of the particular functions dealing with food and livestock could be introduced into one subsection. It would put many minds at ease.  I do not think it changes any substance of that subsection.  It just brings the concept of the board dealing with food and livestock through from the general functions to the particular function.  Even one reference in section 8 (a) would make a huge difference. I ask the Minister to accede to that small request given that it will not change substantially the meaning of the section so far as the Minister is concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 21, to delete &ldquo;export&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the word &ldquo;export&rdquo; in subsection (1) of section 9 where it relates to the functions of An Board Glas be removed.  Subsection (1) would then read:</P>
      <P>On the establishment day, those functions of An Board Glas which relate to the marketing of edible horticulture produce shall stand transferred to the Board.</P>
      <P>It seems to make no sense whatever that one rather obscure little board, called An Board Glas, should promote the marketing of horticultural produce in the State and that another of these interminable boards, An Bord Bia, should promote the marketing of the same product outside the State.  In other words, if you are trying to sell asparagus in Dundalk you get An Bord Glas to sell it but if you are trying to sell the same asparagus in Newry you have to get An Bord Bia.  What sense does that make?  Clearly it makes none, it is a joke.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that An Bord Glas should never have been started.  It was started for what might be called local reasons, for the purpose of compensation to satisfy persons at a particular time by a man who was great for satisfying those who were dissatisfied.  I do not think it has any greater genesis than that.  It was never taken seriously.  It makes a joke of the recommendations of Culliton that we should rationalise all these boards.  It must be remembered that Culliton reported only two years ago.  Here we are with 35 county enterprise boards, the separate retention of An Bord Tráchtála&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;three IDAs, as opposed to one, plus a whole range of <Col N="1507" /> others which Culliton said should go or be amalgamated.  We now have an extra board here.  Instead of amalgamating An Bord Glas, which has served whatever temporary little purpose it had, with An Bord Bia we are retaining it in respect of some functions and not in respect of others.  It does not make any sense whatever. The only purpose of section 9 (1) is to retain in their jobs whatever number of people work in An Bord Glas.  It is not good enough and this matter should be approached more seriously.</P>
      <P>Under European Union laws and rules we discovered some years ago that we could no longer distinguish between the home market and the export market.  I had to amalgamate the Irish Goods Council with the then Córas Tráchtála because home and export agencies, particularly if they were operating within the European Union, were not permitted. If it was not permitted in that case how can one justify retaining it in this case?  Therefore, I ask the Minister to agree to this amendment, which is a simple one, and transfer the marketing functions of An Bord Glas to An Bord Bia.  It does not make sense not to do it. That was made abundantly clear with the establishment of An Bord Tráchtála. This is a very narrow field.  If it was appropriate to do it in respect of all home marketing and export marketing how much more appropriate is it in respect of the marketing of a narrow file of products such as edible horticultural produce.  For that reason I ask the Minister or Minister of State to agree to this amendment in order to make sense of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the remarks by Deputy O'Malley on this point. Indeed, we had a long debate on Committee Stage on this issue.  It would appear that instead of abolishing An Bord Glas and transferring all its functions to An Bord Bia that for some inexplicable reason the Minister wants An Bord Glas to continue and is transferring <Col N="1508" /> from that board, perhaps its most successful end &mdash; even though a limited end &mdash; its export marketing functions.  One of the great horticultural success stories of the past few years has been our mushroom industry which is 95 per cent export oriented.  The big money in mushrooms has come from sourcing and developing markets, particularly in the UK, by the various growers and producers in that industry.  Apparently that successful end is to be hived into An Bord Glas.  I am not sure what they will be left with.</P>
      <P>As one speaker said on Committee Stage in regard to bacon and cabbage, the export aspect of bacon will be An Bord Bia and the cabbage, depending on where it comes from, may be an Bord Glas or An Bord Bia.  What is it all about? Who is the Minister trying to satisfy? Why does he not rationalise, put both boards together call them An Bord Bia and disestablish An Bord Glas?  What is left when the export marketing functions are taken from An Bord Glas and transferred to An Bord Bia is probably not worth keeping?  Literally, I am tempted to use the vernacular.  The Minister has done such damage to An Bord Glas that what is left is not worth keeping.  There are excellent people with expertise in An Bord Glas and these should be part of An Bord Bia, as should BIM.</P>
      <P>The food marketing functions that An Bord Bia is taking on should cover all aspects of the food industry.  The Bill is severely weakened because the marketing and promotion functions of An Bord Bia will be extremely limited in terms of the areas of food production for which it will have responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little interest and no excitement in the industry about the advent of this board, which speaks volumes.  It really does not care and does not believe that this board, proposed by the Minister of State, is the answer to what we need in a promising food industry, in terms of the development of consumer food products.  This board will not do it; it is only a souped up sales team to try to <Col N="1509" /> justify the existence of the section concerned in the Department which believes it is doing something and, with respect to the Minister of State who is an agreeable man and who has done his best to meet us somewhere along the road, to justify his existence.  It is a case of jobs for the boys and spreading it around.  Deputy O'Malley referred to the original idea behind the establishment of An Bord Glas.  This is more of the same and it is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The functions of a national board should encompass all aspects of the food industry including food quality, hygiene and research &mdash; so many areas have been omitted.  If that was the case we would be doing something worthwhile for an industry which has huge potential to develop markets and create jobs in the future but the Bill does not get it right. It is a farce in that while its export marketing functions have been transferred, An Bord Glas will retain its home marketing functions.  The Minister has done so much damage to An Bord Glas he will not do it justice if he does not include it as he has done with CBF.  If he wishes, he could establish another subsidiary committee of An Bord Bia which would encompass the home and export marketing functions, which would make sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better go back to the beginning.  The sub-programme for the food industry being submitted to Brussels is divided into four parts, one of which covers research and development. A committee has been established which is dominated by the industry to select appropriate projects.  A sum of £7 million will be disbursed this year.  Forbairt, which has a role in the development of companies, will provide funds for research and development, be it in-house or commissioned.</P>
      <P>The committee to which I referred, that announced yesterday, is high powered and dominated by the industry.  Its function will be to advise Forbairt on policy matters in the area of prepared consumer foods.  The expert group recommended it should be our objective to increase the volume of prepared consumer foods by £250 million by 1997. Because of the quota system &mdash; we discussed this matter many times during the debate &mdash; our production is limited. Therefore, we must extract the maximum value from our products.  It was an important step to establish a high powered committee which is dominated by the industry to advise Forbairt on policy matters in the area of prepared consumer foods, which are of vital importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Bia and An Bord Glas do not sell &mdash; under Community rules State agencies cannot do so &mdash; they are promotional <Col N="1511" /> and marketing agencies.  The mandate of An Bord Glas covers far more than edible horticultural products. It also covers nursery stock, flowers, shrubs and so on.  What is important is that there is a production function.  An Bord Glas has done a very good job. There was a very good return in terms of job creation, full and part time employment, during the period of the last strategic plan.  A new plan is nearing competition.  We are looking for a product comparable to mushroom production and we must restructure the horticultural sector as many of our producers are too small and are spread out. An important function of An Bord Glas, which is also a function of the Department, is to encourage the establishment of producer groups, the adoption of better practices and regulate supplies so that producers can capture and hold markets.</P>
    <P>There are sound reasons for agreeing to what has been proposed.  This is in keeping with the proposal of the expert group on the food industry which provided a blueprint for the industry.  I am not in a position to accept this amendment as it runs counter to the strategy put forward unanimously by those who served on the expert group.  It is our intention to ensure that boards co-operate with each other as provided for in the legislation.  As Minister of State with responsibility for food, I intend to ensure that this happens.</P>
    <P>Neither An Bord Glas nor An Bord Bia will be involved in selling, but in food promotion and gathering market intelligence. They will assist Irish companies in selling in a very competitive European <Col N="1512" /> market.  I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister of State cannot accept the amendment. It is only in the last minute or so he came to the point.  He gave us a long lecture about two groups of people in whom he places enormous confidence &mdash; high powered committees and expert groups. I have never heard of a committee which was not high powered and of a group of advisers which were not experts.  The Minister of State has not addressed the point.</P>
      <P>In a wider and more important sphere, why was it necessary to amalgamate the Irish Goods Council, with responsibility for the domestic marketing of Irish goods, with Córas Tráchtála with responsibility for export marketing? They were amalgamated because it made no sense to have them separate.  If it does not make sense to have them separate in respect of the virtual totality of Irish exports, how does it make sense to have them separate in respect of a narrow group of edible horticultural produce?  It makes no sense to have them separate and nothing the Minister said suggests that they should be separate.</P>
      <P>Talking about high powered committees and boasting about setting up more and more committees, boards and sub-boards will not solve any problem. The Government or the Minister of State, who is relatively new in the job, may think it is great to set up all these bodies but in reality we need fewer of them.  We should be heading in the opposite direction.  To have the same product marketed in Dundalk by one board and in Newry by another is laughable.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) On the establishment day, those functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara which relate to the export marketing of fish and fish products shall stand transferred to the Board.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially some of the arguments that <Col N="1515" /> applied to the last amendment apply to this amendment which proposes to transfer the functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara on the marketing of fish and fish products to An Bord Bia.  It does not make sense to exclude fish from the remit of a food board established to promote all Irish food.  Was fish excluded for a reason similar to the reason horticulture was excluded, simply to retain An Bord Iascaigh Mhara?  Why could such boards not be amalgamated with An Bord Bia? The board is not a food board if it excludes important food products such as vegetables and fish.  The board seems to be a meat board under another name, as everything else seems to be excluded. Surely vegetables and fish are the two most important other consumer items? Why is fish excluded other than to keep yet another quango in existence?  While other countries are getting rid of them, amalgamating and rationalising them as Culliton strongly recommended, the Government is creating more quangos. The Minister of State should read the Culliton report about the damage caused by overlapping quangos.  If he creates more of them duplicating functions, as is done here, he is in danger of being christened the quango king.  We are persecuting ourselves with more and more of those wretched bodies which do not solve any problems.  If they did we would not have any problems because we have so many quangos.  It does not make sense to continue in this fashion.  The Minister of State will probably tell me that some obscure expert group from a high powered committee recommended this and, therefore, we must proceed with it.</P>

      <P>An Bord Bia does not exclude vegetables from its remit.  I wish to clarify a peculiar inconsistency in the Deputy's two amendments.  His first amendment seeks to transfer the home market and export functions of An Bord Glas to An Bord Bia while his second seeks only to transfer the export functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to An Bord Bia and does not refer to the home market.  That inconsistency which we had also on Committee Stage is somewhat puzzling.  I would prefer if fish could be included within the remit of An Bord Bia, as recommended by the expert group.  The expert group's report has been endorsed by the Government and is part of the national plan; it was not some little committee &mdash; disparaging remarks do nothing to alter the status of committees of which I would have thought the Deputy would have considerable knowledge.  I have no difficulty with the thrust of this amendment but it is not possible to accept it.  A major review of the functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is taking place but the report will not be available until the end of the year.  It is not possible, therefore, to include An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The legislation provides that that can happen with the agreement of the two Ministers concerned.</P>

      <P>If the Minister of State has difficulty with the reference to &ldquo;export&rdquo; marketing of fish.  I will drop the word &ldquo;export&rdquo; and relate the amendment to the marketing of fish.  I am not <Col N="1517" /> conscious of any great effort to market fish at home.  I suppose there is some but the sales of fish here are disappointing, for historical and other reasons.  The Minister said that under the existing subsection (2) it would be possible to amalgamate these two boards at some time in the future when a committee, which will be large, high-powered and expert, has reported on it.  However, it has to be with the consent with the other relevant Minister.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Whenever the Minister proposes to make an order under this section, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arose out of a commitment I gave to Deputy Doyle to look at a number of her amendments.  An amendment to section 3 was tabled by <Col N="1518" /> Deputy Dukes to make the section read: &ldquo;The Minister may, by order, revoke or amend an order made by the Minister under any provision of this Act other than sections 5, 9 and 10&rdquo;.  The effect of that amendment, had I agreed to it, would have been to prevent the Minister, by order, from revoking an order made by him under the Act so that what was being sought in the other amendments would be excluded by that.</P>
    <P>What I propose to do is to include an extra subsection to section 9 and this is in the context of the positive resolution by the Dáil which the Deputy was anxious to include.  I am conceding that in the context of section 9.  Section 10 provides that the Minister may by order assign to the board such additional functions as the Minister considers to be incidental to or consequential on the functions assigned to it by this Act.  It is not envisaged that any order arising under section 10 would be other than a tidying up operation in relation to an order made under section 9.  The procedure of having to go before the Dáil for positive endorsement or approval would be an overkill in that situation.  I am sympathetic to the line promoted by the Deputy and, in this context, I have gone as far as I can possibly go to meet the concerns expressed on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Board shall by order made with the consent of the Minister establish a subsidiary board to be known as The Veterinary Advisory Committee and shall authorise it to exercise any functions on behalf of the Board, relating to quality assurance of meat products and livestock, including animal health and welfare, production systems and distribution and dairy hygiene regulations.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I spoke at length on Committee Stage of my concerns about quality assurance and quality control.  Without firm procedures in place on assurance and control procedures, we will not abe able to inspire the confidence we must in Irish food products among consumers both at home and abroad.  I would specifically like a veterinary advisory committee to be part of the sub-committee system of the board.  I will not reiterate the case I made on Committee Stage but I feel strongly that our veterinary team, including those in the local authority, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and private veterinary surgeons, should be involved in quality control and quality assurance, animal health and welfare production systems and distribution generally and the dairy and hygiene regulations. These must all be catered for, monitored and enforced by a sub-committee of An Bord Bia.  I am suggesting a veterinary advisory committee for meat and livestock products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>By international standards our products have a very high health status and I know that Deputy Doyle and I are not in conflict on that. This amendment seeks to insert a new subsection in section 13 to require the <Col N="1520" /> board to set up a special subsidiary board to be known as The Veterinary Advisory Committee to exercise functions in relation to quality assurance, including animal health and welfare, production systems and distribution and dairy hygiene regulations.  The amendment was discussed at some length on Committee Stage when I gave an undertaking to convey the Deputy's concerns to the interim board when set up with a view to it coming up with recommendations. My undertaking was given openly and the Deputy's concerns will be conveyed to the interim board without comment from me and dealt with objectively.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty with the regulatory functions in terms of food being part of the promotional and marketing board. Last week we discussed at great length our attitude to consumers.  Deputy Doyle &mdash; and others who expressed concern &mdash; will see that I have gone a good part of the road in meeting them in this regard.</P>
      <P>The expert group report, about which Deputy O'Malley spoke disparagingly, refers to a consumer-led industry.  In the market economy we must produce quality goods at a price which consumers are prepared to pay.  They are becoming more and more demanding and setting higher standards all the time.  I am supportive of the best possible regulatory system, but it should be seen to be independent of the marketing sector that promotes Irish products overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CBF's quality assurance schemes have worked well.  Section 8 will empower the new board to operate similar schemes. As I pointed out to the Deputy during last week's debate, there is provision under the Bill for the board or a subsidiary board to set up committees to assist in its work.  Deputy O'Malley may not see great merit in that, but this amendment seeks to provide for setting up another tier.  I can give an assurance that, as was the position previously in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, there will be strong emphasis <Col N="1521" /> on quality, hygiene and related matters. As technology develops and new methods come on stream, they will become part of the overall thrust of this system.</P>
    <P>I have given a commitment that when the interim board is set up in mid-July &mdash; assuming that we successfully complete all Stages tonight and that the Bill is passed in the Seanad before the summer recess &mdash; I will submit to it for its comment and proposal the concerns expressed by the Deputy in this area and the framework she suggests as appropriate. I assure the Deputy I will make no comment on the matter and that her views and concerns will be objectively presented.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 19 in the name of Deputy Avril Doyle.  Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 are related and I suggest that we take the three amendments together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 14, to delete &ldquo;levy, on behalf of the Board&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;determination, collection and expenditure of levy relating to meat and livestock&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be brief and as I can nearly write the script for the Minister's reply, I would appreciate if he would be equally brief in his response.  I will waive my right to reply unless he says something provocative. This is a very important amendment. One of the functions of this Bill is to abolish CBF and it will be reconstitued as a subsidiary board of An Bord Bia.  At present CBF has functions in the determination, <Col N="1522" /> collection and expenditure of the levy relating to meat and livestock generally.  I want all those functions to be transferred to the new meat and livestock subsidiary board that will replace CBF. Rather than simply having a levy collection duty.  I ask that all the functions be transferred to the board, including the determination, collection and expenditure of levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given much consideration to the Deputy's amendment and noted her concerns in this area. Amendment No. 19 seeks to specify, in section 13 (1) which deals with the setting up of the meat and livestock subsidiary board, that the subsidiary board shall have the function of determining, collecting and expending the meat and livestock levies.  Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 seek to specify, in section 38 which deals with levies due and payable, that levy returns should be submitted to the board, or subsidiary board, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>As I recall, amendment No. 19 was defeated on Committee Stage and I gave an undertaking to consider amendments Nos. 33 and 34.  The Deputy's concern about section 13 seems to stem from the fact that subsection (1) contains the word &ldquo;function&rdquo;.  I accept that because of time constraints it was not possible for her to develop that argument in a more comprehensive way.  The Deputy was concerned that because the singular was used it implied that there was only one function in regard to the levy, that the collection could be delegated.  The Attorney General's office was asked to amend the subsection to make it clear that this is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Doyle and Crawford expressed concern about the future of CBF and I indicated that I wanted to meet those concerns as far as I could. The fact that the word &ldquo;function&rdquo; is used does not limit what can be transferred or delegated from the main board to the sub-board to a single function.  We were <Col N="1523" /> advised that there is no need for this amendment because the Interpretation Act, 1937, covers that matter.  In effect, the word &ldquo;function&rdquo; does not simply refer to one function but also covers the plural.  I hope that not alone will that cover the fears and concerns expressed by the Deputy but also the fears and concerns expressed by the people who made representations to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 32 and 33, to delete &ldquo;be appointed by the Minister, one of whom shall be an officer of the Minister.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;comprise&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  three persons appointed by the Minister, one of whom shall be an officer of the Minister,</P>
      <P>(b)  three persons who shall represent the producers of livestock who shall be appointed by the Board with the consent of the Minister on the nomination of such organisations as the Minister considers to be representative of such producers,</P>
      <P>(c)  two persons who shall represent the export trade who shall be appointed by the Board with the consent of the Minister on the nomination of such organisations as the Minister considers to be representative of such export trade, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  one person who shall represent meat traders who sell meat by wholesale or retail for consumption in the State who shall be appointed by the Board with the consent of the Minister on the nomination of such organisations <Col N="1525" /> as the Minister considers to be representative of such traders.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These amendments deal with the appointment of the membership of the board and the term of office of the members.  I will not waste time commenting on the term of office.  The Minister makes Tammany Hall activities of a bygone era pale into insignificance with what he is taking on board here.  Every one of the nine or 11 board members is a political appointee.  There is no guarantee to any producer or processing group or to consumer interests that their nomination will be accepted by this Minister. He has gone a step further than he did in the Irish Horseracing Authority where 12 of the 16 board members were political appointees.  The Minister invited the Northern Ireland authority, the Department of Agriculture at Stormont, to nominate a member to represent Northern Ireland racing interests on the Horseracing Authority.  A review group was set up to canvass all the interests in the North and it came up with a unanimous choice as to who the representative should be and conveyed it by letter to the Minister last January.  The Minister then ignored the view of the Department of Agriculture at Stormont.  That is the way this Minister behaves, making political appointments.  That is why I totally oppose this section.  I am not so sure we would be any better off if we had nominating bodies or interest groups because apparently the Minister can ignore them when he chooses.  Whatever about ignoring the views of our groups which is indefensible, it is even more indefensible given the sensitivity of the all Ireland position and the 32 county basis on which racing has been conducted for over 200 years, that the Minister contemptuously ignored the nomination of the Northern Ireland authority.  It begs the question whether this Minister supports his Government's policy on Northern Ireland.  It is one of the most appalling examples, metaphorically speaking, of <Col N="1526" /> giving the two fingers signal to the North of Ireland.  I will not stand over it.  I accuse the Minister of being political to the nth degree and of packing boards with his cronies, protecting old pals whom he appoints as chairpersons to make sure of having majorities on the board.  I challenge this Minister before or after this debate to take me up on this.  His actions with regard to the Northern Ireland nomination to the Irish Horseracing Authority are despicable and I certainly apologise to everybody across the spectrum in Northern Ireland with racing and breeding interests for what our Minister has done and for the insult he has meted out to those who nominated a representative. The Minister turned his back in contempt and nominated somebody who was never heard of in racing circles and does not attend race meetings but who is probably an excellent person in her own right.  It is appalling and I invite other Opposition Deputies to interest themselves in what has gone on with this new racing authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister expects us to accept that every single appointment to An Bord Bia will be political.  He appointed a cumann member from Kildare to represent the Racing Club of Ireland on the racing authority board.  The Minister was so brazen that he did not even pretend.  Will these appointees all be cumann members?  Will the Minister scrutinise the IFA and the ICMSA representatives to see if they have a cumann card in their back pocket before they are nominated to An Bord Bia?  It is an insult to a board which should represent the interests of food producers and processors.  It is an insult to a flagship industry to present this as a way forward.  It is a huge missed opportunity.  I oppose the section.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Incidents in Athlone (Westmeath) Estate.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this important matter. It gives me no joy as a public representative for County Westmeath to relate to the House a series of vicious attacks which occurred in College Park, Athlone, over the past 15 months and the resulting terror and fear that has gripped the residents of this estate.  Some of these attacks would be more appropriate to a gangster film than a residential estate. They tarnised the image of Athlone and terrorised its people.</P>
      <P>In a series of incidents in May 1993 weapons such as pickaxe handles, slash hooks and iron bars were used.  People were severely cut and injured and many vehicles were badly damaged.  Some time later a convoy of 30 vans converged on College Park, sealed it off and the passengers sought a man who lived in the estate.  On failing to find him they proceeded to wreck his house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speculation about a further attack on this man in September last brought a <Col N="1531" /> convoy of his friends to the area and they proceeded to occupy the estate for a considerable time, leaving the terrified householders hiding indoors.  On Thursday last week guns were brandished by masked gunmen who kicked in the front door of 23 College Park, Athlone.  Luckily this house was unoccupied at the time of the attack.  The attackers, realising they were in the wrong house, beat a hasty retreat to the adjoining house which was their intended target.</P>
    <P>The <i>Westmeath Independent</i> outlined what happened next: &ldquo;One shot was fired upstairs with the bullet ricocheting from the landing area into an upstairs bedroom before the gunmen fled.&rdquo; Thankfully nobody was killed or injured in this attack.  The residents of the area were terrified.  They live in daily fear of similar attacks and fear for their safety and that of their children.  No longer can children feel safe playing in their own garden. Their freedom and enjoyment must be curtailed.</P>
    <P>In an interview with the <i>Westmeath Independent</i> the man at the centre of these attacks stated: &ldquo;I hold nothing against this other family who hired someone to do this job.  They are supposed to be terrified of me but why I do not know&rdquo;.  The reference to hired gunmen points to the involvement of subversives in this attack and it is speculated that they are members of the INLA who came from Dundalk.  Will this man co-operate with the gardaí to bring the attackers to justice?  If he knows those who initiated the attack why does he not sort out his difficulties with them in a civilised manner? Scenes such as these are intolerable.</P>
    <P>The residents in College Park are entitled to live in peace without fear of being innocently caught up in dangerous situations like this.  They deserve and must be afforded all the protection the State can give them.  The Minister for Justice must intervene immediately and give the Garda the resources necessary to protect the innocent and, more important, bring the guilty to justice.  I call on the Minister of State to act before further <Col N="1532" /> escalation of this violence has fatal consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to deal with the potentially more serious aspect of this Adjournment debate which relates to the discharge of firearms at College Park, Athlone last Thursday.  The Minister for Justice has been informed by the Garda Authorities that shots were discharged and that the matter is now the subject of a Garda investigation.  The Deputy will appreciate that because of the ongoing Garda investigation, I am constrained in what I can say, because it could affect not only the Garda inquiries but also prejudice the outcome of any future court proceedings.  I will, therefore, confine my comments to the other aspect of this debate which relates generally to violent incidents in College Park, Athlone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that crime is, unfortunately, an unpleasant reality of modern life throughout most countries in the world.  It is a complex issue and the Government's response to the problem must be a considered and comprehensive one.  It would be misleading to suggest that the solution to crime is simply a matter of pouring more and more resources into the law and order system. Extra resources on their own will not provide the answers.  That said, the House will be aware of the law and order package which the Minister for Justice announced last December and which amounts to a major initiative by a Government against crime.  I do not propose going into all the details of the package but one aspect in particular is worth reflecting on in the context of this debate. I refer to the operational strength of the Garda Síochána and the number of gardaí engaged in policing duties.  The law and order package provides for the recruitment of an additional 407 Garda trainees during 1994 while further recruitment of over 1,000 gardaí during the period 1995-97 is also planned.  In <Col N="1533" /> tandem with this recruitment drive will be the recruitment of 200 civilian staff for the Garda Síochána between 1994 and 1997 to undertake clerical and administrative work.  This will release an equivalent number of gardaí from administrative duties to outdoor police duties, thus increasing the operational strength of the force by 200.  These additional resources must be welcomed and emphasise in a practical way the commitment and urgency which the Government attaches to the crime problem.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the question of crime in Athlone.  The Garda Authorities have informed the Minister that following an escalation in crime in the town during 1991-92 a series of new initiatives were put in place.  These include the formation of a team of experienced gardaí to deal with the investigation of crime, while extra foot and mobile patrols were assigned to housing estates and business areas which had been badly hit.  Members were also detailed to patrol the river front and thereby reduce the commission of crime against boat hirers.</P>
    <P>There are 18 neighbourhood watch schemes operating in Athlone and two uniformed gardaí are employed full-time as community gardaí.  Old people residing alone have been identified and are visited by the community gardaí who advise them on ways of improving their personal safety and the security of their homes.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the seriousness of the shooting referred to by the Deputy which none of us underestimates, the Minister is satisfied that the gardaí are responding very effectively to crime in Athlone.  The Minister is also confident that the recent downward trend in crime in the area, which has been brought about by a careful and strategic targetting by Garda resources, will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I <Col N="1534" /> want to highlight the lack of concern shown by the Department of Health for a person in Carlow who has had both legs amputated below the knee.  This man applied for a motorised transport grant to the South-Eastern Health Board which found, under the conditions laid down by the Department, that he cannot qualify for a grant because he does not need his car to earn a living and lives only a short distance from the main shopping area in Carlow.  These are absurd reasons for refusing him a grant as most people who have had both their legs amputated do not earn a living and travelling half a mile to a shopping centre on crutches is not a short distance.  How is this person supposed to travel to church or a social event?  Should he become a recluse?  If he has to be hospitalised or put in a home costs will have to be met.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board wrote to the Department of Health asking it to review the regulations governing the motorised transport grant.  I was informed by officials in the Minister's office that the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, were carrying out an ongoing review of these aspects of the regulations.  When I sent the reply I received from the Department of Health on 16 June to the person involved he told me another TD had been given the same reply on 9 March, three months previously, even though the health board had been in contact with the Department in the meantime asking it to review the regulations.  I was in contact with the Department to see what progress was being made in this matter and instead of outlining the present position someone in the Department thought it was easier to press a button on a computer and send me a letter which had previously been sent to another Deputy, which was of no benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people who have had both legs amputated must be very small while the number of those who wish to drive a car, having successfully passed their driving test, must be extremely <Col N="1535" /> small.  Amending the regulations to enable this person to benefit from the motorised transport grant scheme will not break the Government or create a precedent.  The Department of Health should show concern for people with this handicap who have the initiative to get up and go.</P>
    <P>This man is now experiencing problems with his arms as a result of using crutches.  I am not asking the Minister to set a precedent in this case which will cause havoc later.  All I am doing is asking him to ensure that a person who has had both legs amputated below the knee and who uses artificial limbs to get around is given a grant towards the cost of adapting his car.  This is a reasonable and realistic request.  Without anticipating the points which will be made later by my colleague about the disabled people protesting outside the Dáil, we have a duty to help disabled people who are trying to help themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I understand that the person referred to applied to the South-Eastern Health Board for a motorised transport grant towards the cost of adapting his car.  His application was refused by the health board on the grounds that he did not come within the scope of the motorised transport grant scheme as he did not require a car for employment and did not live in a very isolated area, the conditions specified in the regulations.  The health board informed the applicant's doctor of the reason for refusal of the grant and advised that he might be eligible for a refund of VAT, exemption from road tax and registration tax and a refund of excise duty on fuel under the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989.  I understand that the person concerned has availed of these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that the motorised transport scheme is availed of to the <Col N="1536" /> maximum extent and that all deserving applicants are accommodated.  The regulations governing the scheme have been in place for some considerable time and, bearing in mind the specifics of this case, I have asked my officials to carry out a comprehensive review of the operation of the scheme to see if it is achieving the purposes for which it was intended.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is also reviewing the operation of the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989, with a view to improving the operation of the scheme and allowing greater participation of disabled drivers in it.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities established in December 1993 is also to report to Government in the next two years on how people with disabilities can exercise their right to participate to the fullest extent possible in the economic, social and cultural life of the country.  One of the issues which the commission is considering is income support for people with disabilities.  I look forward to receiving its report on the matter.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Speech Therapy Waiting List.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Speech therapy, part of the health care service, does not receive much political attention, particularly in this House.  It is only when one has direct experience of a communication disorder, whether as the parent of a child with such a disorder or the relative of a victim of a stroke, that one requires the vast level of expertise in this area.  The reality is that if one can pay for these services there is no problem in receiving them.  This issue relates to equality of access to vital treatment in the medical health services.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board area, the greater Dublin area, approximately 2,170 people are awaiting speech therapy.  The average waiting time over all of the community care area is nine months but many of these people have been waiting for over a year, and some two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> Speech and language therapy encompasses the assessment, diagnosis, management and prevention of disorders of communication.  Speech therapists, the majority of them female, work with a range of clients, from babies with swallowing or feeding difficulties to elderly stroke patients who have lost the power of speech.  They are also very much involved in the counselling of relatives and parents of children with difficulties, working in play schools, hospitals and in the community.  It is very much an interdisciplinary profession.</P>
    <P>These are highly trained people who have been undervalued in the service. Intervention in speech disorders requires early expert intervention and can transform the quality of life of patients when appropriately administered.  There are various speech therapy client groups &mdash; people with developmental speech disorders, language delay or impairment. For example, there can be people with learning difficulties related to communication, with a mental handicap, with sensory impairment or children and adults with autism.  On the matter of autism I want to raise the question of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown which has been operating for the past two years without any speech therapy services.  The Minister should investigate that matter.</P>
    <P>On the matter of waiting lists, the schedule attached to the parliamentary reply given me yesterday showed that in Dublin South, area 3, my constituency, there were 149 people awaiting speech therapy services for 12 months and that in Dublin South Central area 4,521 people have been awaiting speech therapy services for 12 months.  This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Speech and language therapists work with people with fluency disorders, with stammers and with cleft palates.  The work is undertaken from infancy, involves a huge amount of counselling and is interdisciplinary.  Developmental work with children forms a large <Col N="1538" /> caseload of community care speech and language therapists, and delays of up to two years in some areas causes irreparable damage in children.  This can compound parents' anxiety.  As such treatment is related to the development of children it cannot be delayed because treatment postponed is treatment denied.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to staffing levels dealt with by the Minister in his reply. The present number of speech and language therapists in Ireland is 214 while the recommended number, based on British research relating to the Irish population, is 808.  It will clearly be seen that we have a serious shortage of speech therapists and that those we have are underpaid.  We also have a brain drain in that, because of the low pay and status of these women in the service, many are going overseas.  This means that therapists, trained at great expenses to our taxpayers, are leaving the public service because they will be paid more in other jobs here and abroad.  Comparable professions in the health services earn up to 48 per cent more than speech and language therapists.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to examine the waiting lists and equality of access to this valuable service, so vital where needed. The second is the gender issue, the fact that most of the women who work in this service feel under-valued, like nurses. On the day when An Bord Altranais has presented the Minister with a report suggesting a total re-evaluation and reassessment of the role of the nursing profession, the Minister should examine the status and salary levels of speech and language therapists.</P>
    <P>I await the Minister's response, particularly to the second issue.  The issue of waiting lists is vital in equality of access.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy and the House will be aware, health boards and hospitals have discretion to prioritise service demands and the related staffing <Col N="1539" /> composition within their overall established staffing complement and financial allocation in relation to the provision of a given service.  Therefore, it is a matter for each health board to decide on the priority it affords the various services in the light of available resources.  Accordingly, the provision of the speech therapy service in the Eastern Health Board region is a matter for that board.</P>
      <P>As I stated yesterday in a reply to a written parliamentary question tabled by Deputy O'Donnell, there are 2,170 persons awaiting speech therapy services in the Eastern Health Board region at present and the average waiting time is nine months.  While in some community care areas, people have been waiting over a year for speech therapy services nevertheless it should be noted that in other areas waiting times are of three to four months.</P>
      <P>This variation in the waiting times is due to the staffing levels in particular community care areas as well as the priority afforded to different categories of clients, for example, priority has been given to children with speech and language disorders.</P>
      <P>I understand that interviews to recruit additional speech therapists have been held by the Eastern Health Board and, when the additional staff become available, the waiting period for speech therapy services will be considerably reduced.  Since 1991 the Eastern Health Board has increased the number of speech therapists posts from 26 to 51 in 1994.</P>
      <P>With reference to speech therapy services generally, I would like to remind the Deputy that I expressed my concern in this House on a number of occasions at the level of speech therapy services in certain areas of the country and that I regard the expansion of such services as a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of an interim report by the Review Group on Services for People with a Physical or Sensory Disability, an <Col N="1540" /> additional £1.5 million was made available for service developments, including the provision of speech therapy services. This additional funding is being maintained in the annual budget, and a further £1.5 million has been made available this year.  Last year, £200,000 of this additional funding was devoted to this service.  I expect that a proportion of this year's allocation will be devoted again to improving and expanding community-based therapy services, including speech therapy.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in relation to the provision of speech therapy services is the lack of sufficient numbers of trained speech therapists graduating each year. My Department has taken steps to remedy the situation by arranging for six extra training places to be provided at the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies, Trinity College, Dublin commencing in the 1992-93 academic year. The total student body will increase in phases from 80 students in 1992 to 104 students in 1995-96.  The increased level of graduate output resulting from this important development should make a significant improvement in the provision of speech therapy services.</P>
    <P>I might add that the review group on physical and sensory disabilities has been examining a range of services for people with physical disabilities, including speech therapy.  I am expecting that the group will submit its final report to me within the next few months.  The report's recommendations will receive urgent consideration by my Department.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Irish Centre for Independent Living.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment.  I should also like to compliment the people from INCARE who made their way to Leinster House and who have been at the gates of our national Parliament all day.  I should also like to compliment the staff of Leinster <Col N="1541" /> House who assisted in making space available for them in the Public Gallery.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the best way to describe the need involved is simply to say that £150,000 is required to run the services provided by INCARE for people with disabilities to the end of the year.  In order to describe the services that have been made available it is best for me to quote the following from the hand-out prepared by the organisation:</P>
      <P>The first Irish Center for Independent Living (CIL) has become a powerful voice in the community.  CIL addresses the issues of independent living, self-determination and options in everything from personal assistance to housing, access to public transportation, education and employment. The guiding philosophy can be summed up in the words &ldquo;Nothing about us without us&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister who met the group this evening, and those of us who met them during the day, cannot but have been impressed by the degree of enthusiasm, determination and commitment on the part of the Center for Independent Living, those who give the personal assistance, those who provide the care and those who facilitate the disabled in achieving the ultimate in their own development, their goals, in the achievement of equality of living standards and access to employment and educational opportunities to ensure they can be treated equally, which is in accordance with Government policy.  I am sure the Minister for Equality and Law Reform likewise would laud their efforts in this area.  Essentially, the personal assistants ensure that those who would otherwise be confined to their homes and could not gain access to work or education are enabled to do so by virtue of the availability of the assistants who have done a wonderful job.  The pilot programme, set up in 1992 with assistance from the EU Horizon programme, expires this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that the Minister takes on board the work being done by INCARE by giving those who are disabled <Col N="1542" /> or physically handicapped, who would otherwise be unable to achieve the ultimate in fulfilment, a new lease of life. It has enabled them to become involved in the economy and in contributing to the gross national product, thereby ensuring that they have helped themselves.  The adage is that self help is one's best preparation.</P>
    <P>There are people in the public gallery who have clearly illustrated that they are prepared to help themselves.  All they require from society is a helping hand. They set up the INCARE programme and proved by their training programme for assistants that it can work.  They have also shown they can achieve results.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that nothing impedes the development of the INCARE programme. It would be a tragedy if at a time when there is a general awareness &mdash; the Minister has shown this since he has became Minister and indeed when he was on the Opposition benches &mdash; he was not prepared to continue to give the support to those people at a vital time. While I acknowledge the assistance from FÁS and the Departments of Social Welfare and Health, all have culminated in meeting a need and allowing the people concerned to take their honourable place in society.  I ask the Minister to provide the necessary funds to allow them to continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Durkan in complimenting the Center for Independent Living and its group, particularly on the persuasive lobbying today and for being here at this early hour of the morning. For me it was a worthwhile interaction and underscores the fact that we learn from speaking to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the funding difficulties at the Center for Independent Living. The centre runs two programmes: INCARE, which is a two-year action-research programme based on promoting independent living for people with disabilities through the use of personal assistants and Operation Get Out which is a one year action-research programme <Col N="1543" /> aimed at giving people with significant disabilities in institutional care the opportunity to live in the community with proper back-up support.</P>
    <P>Funding of £235,000 for these programmes was received under the EU Horizon Programme as a two-year pilot project.  In addition, a further £100,000 was provided by the Minister for Social Welfare in 1993 to support the INCARE Programme and £38,000 was provided by the Eastern Health Board in June 1994 to support the Operation Get Out programme. Funding is also received from FÁS on an ongoing basis for the training of personal assistants.</P>
    <P>When officials met representatives of the centre this morning, they were advised that expenditure projections to the end of 1994 indicate a shortfall in funding of £120,000.  This, it appears, arises from the fact that the centre took on commitments which it was not in a position to finance.  I am concerned at the implications of this financial crisis for the 30 people with disabilities in receipt of services from personal assistants under the centre's programmes.  There are also serious implications for the 55 <Col N="1544" /> employees.  I stress that I fully support the principle of independent living for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Following urgent telephone calls this week, I arranged a meeting between an officer of my Department, the Eastern Health Board and the centre.  On foot of this meeting, further detailed financial information is being requested, particularly in relation to the management and administration expenses incurred by the centre.  In view of the considerable funding already approved by the Minister for Social Welfare, I am consulting him to see if a solution can be found to the current problem.  In the meantime, I am pleased to state that Rehab Lotteries will be providing a once-off grant of £30,000 and this will ensure that services can be maintained in the immediate future.  I hope in the short term to finalise a financial package.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset this is a two-year pilot project largely funded by Horizon under EU guidelines and will be the subject of review and evaluation, including an investment-benefit analysis.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.50 a.m. on Thursday, 30 June 1994 until 10.30 a.m.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> The ICC Bank small business expansion loan scheme is intended to assist job creation by providing guaranteed, long duration, low cost, finance for small business.</P>
    <P>To participate in the scheme, firms must be in the following sectors: manufacturing companies paying, or eligible to pay, 10 per cent corporation profits tax; internationally traded service companies, as defined by Forbairt &mdash; IDA Ireland, that is, companies &mdash; individuals who are trading internationally, primarily exporting and engaged in specified activities &mdash; consideration will also be given to other potentially internationally traded services; specific Bord Fáilte registered accommodation and Bord Fáilte-SFADCo approved tourism projects and services.  Confining eligibility to the sectors mentioned is intended to maximise the employment impact of the limited funds available under the scheme.</P>
    <P>We are keeping the operation of the scheme, including eligibility and size of loan, under review.  The scheme has, however, only been in operation for four months and it would be premature to make any changes at this stage.</P>

      <P>While the intake of apprentices varies from year to year there has been a trend of reducing numbers over the last few years.  This downward trend is of concern as it could lead to shortages of skilled workers as the predicted growth in the economy is realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of meetings have taken place with the CIF to impress on them the need for its members to be conscious of their future requirements in so far as apprentices are concerned.  I have asked the CIF and FÁS to examine ways of dealing with the problem and I am consulting with all of the semi-State bodies <Col N="1254" /> regarding the possibility of increasing the number of apprenticeships in these areas.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> commits the Government, in consultation with relevant interests, to examine ways of making it a condition of public sector construction contracts that an agreed number of apprentices be employed on such contracts.  I have also taken this matter up with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The new standards-based apprenticeship training system will take time to establish itself and FÁS is actively promoting the scheme through its regional offices at present.  In view of the lead-time for training apprentices I would urge employers to focus not just on their immediate needs but take account of likely future needs in deciding on their apprenticeship recruitment levels.</P>

      <P>The European Social Fund Programme Evaluation Unit reviews the effectiveness of all training and employment measures supported through the European Union.  These measures are delivered by Government Departments, State agencies and other organisations in receipt of European Social Fund aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, FÁS's specific training courses, enterprise programmes and its training support scheme for the employed have been evaluated.  Many of the recommendations made have already been implemented.  In addition, thematic evaluations, which address issues of particular importance across all programmes and agencies, have relevance for FÁS provision.  I am currently considering recommendations in the important areas of training of trainers and women's training provision.  Surveys of employers which have been carried out by the evaluation <Col N="1256" /> unit also provide information which can help ensure that the training programmes supported are closely linked to the needs of the labour market.</P>
    <P>As Minister responsible for European Social Fund expenditures in Ireland, I want to ensure their impact and relevance to labour market needs.  If programmes are not achieving their objectives, funds will be redirected towards areas where the effectiveness of spending is greater. At my initiative, this sentiment is reflected in the EU Community Support Framework to apply in the period to 1999.  It is vital that, with 38 per cent of Structural Fund aid being directed towards the development of human resources, this investment is well spent.</P>
    <P>The ESF evaluation unit is a centrally important mechanism in this regard.  It will continue in place with support from the European Commission until the end of 1999.  Over the period it will provide detailed information on how all programmes are achieving their objectives. Necessary adaptations will be introduced to ensure that the needs of individual trainees and of the labour market are efficiently catered for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the establishment of Forbairt on 1 January, 1994 brought together the functions of the former Eolas and the indigenous industry division of the former IDA.  In so far as 1994 is concerned the primary targets relate to jobs, generation of fee income and rationalisation of services and programmes arising from the amalgamation of the two entities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-99 the aim is to achieve 11,000 gross jobs per annum on average in <Col N="1257" /> indigenous manufacturing and internationally traded services companies. Forbairt will be expected to contribute substantially to the achievement of this target in 1994, the other contributors being SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>In relation to fee income, a prominent feature of the work of the former Eolas, the target for 1994 is £8 million.  Forbairt will also be expected to make considerable progress in relation to rationalisation of services and programmes, the objective being to provide more cohesive and integrated supports to Irish industry reflecting fully its real needs.</P>
    <P>I understand that Forbairt are at present looking at every single one of their services and every single activity within the organisation in a hard-nosed commercial fashion.  They are asking which services are most likely to yield positive results in terms of generating long term, sustainable enterprise and employment growth, and how best future services and programmes can be designed to provide substantive support for a dynamic enterprise response, in a manner which represents good value for taxpayer's money and responds to the needs of companies at their various stages of development.</P>
    <P>In addition to the short term targets referred to, medium to long term targets for Forbairt are also being considered in the context of the development of its future operational strategy.  These will, <i>inter alia,</i> reflect the priorities identified in the national plan for the development of indigenous industry.  In this connection the plan states that the primary focus of strategy will be on improving the competitiveness of Irish owned industry with a view to achieving an increased share of international and domestic markets, thereby providing a platform for sustainable employment growth.  This will involve capability building in the various functional areas of individual companies and Forbairt will have a key role to play in this.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's point about providing an opportunity for scrutiny by the Oireachtas of bodies such as Forbairt, <Col N="1258" /> I would point out that under the Industrial Development Act, 1993.  I am required to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas Forbairt's annual report not later than six months after the end of the previous financial year.  In addition I am required to appear before the Dáil Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy annually in relation to the overall Estimate for my Department.  Furthermore the 1993 Act referred to also requires me to prepare a review of national industrial policy every three years from the passing of the 1993 Act and to have the review and conclusions arising thereform laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Finally the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts, if it so wishes, can pursue issues relating to the activities of State bodies and Departments generally.  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General has recently been given new powers to inquire into value for money aspects of State expenditure generally.</P>

    <P>The pay increases provided for in the draft Agreement on Pay, Conditions of Employment and Co-operation at the Level of the Enterprise, appended to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and <Col N="1259" /> Work,</i> are moderate and are in line with projected inflation levels over the next three years.  While the pay increases were negotiated centrally, the draft agreement provides that their application shall be negotiated through the normal industrial relations machinery, due regard being had to the economic and commercial circumstances of particular firms, employments or industries.  Local negotiations about pay can, therefore, be sensitive to the needs of businesses, whatever sector of the economy is involved.</P>

      <P>The Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977-93 are a fundamental part of our labour legislation and any changes in this area need to be carefully assessed and debated.  This is precisely what was done in the most recent review of the legislation which was initiated with the publication of a discussion document in 1987.  Following extensive consultation, that review culminated with the enactment <Col N="1260" /> of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993 which came into operation only last October.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that the Task Force on Small Business, in its report in March, 1994, recommended that where an employer has fewer than 20 employees, the burden of proof under the unfair dismissals legislation should be neutral as between the employer and employee.  The task force also recommended that the qualifying service period for eligibility under that legislation should be two years for employees employed in enterprises with fewer than 20 employees.</P>
      <P>The issues of burden of proof and length of service for eligibility under the legislation were debated at length during the recent consideration of the legislation and, on balance, it was decided that the provisions of the 1977 Act in relation to those issues should not be changed.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the question, it is not clear which EU Directives the Deputy has in mind.  The Task Force on Small Business recommended that the Irish legislation implementing the EU Directive on the organisation of working time should take maximum advantage of the derogations and exemptions permitted therein.  It further recommended that, for businesses with fewer than 20 employees, the annual leave provisions of the Directive should not come into effect until the latest possible implementation date, which is November, 1999.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Question No. 7 by Deputy McManus on 10 March, 1994 (Official Report, Vol. 440, cols. 639-643) I stated that, in accordance with a commitment given in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> I intend to consult fully with all interested parties on the implementation of this Directive.

      <P>Payments on foot of county enterprise fund grants are made on the basis of expenditure by the grantees on the project, vouched as paid. It is primarily a matter for the relevant county enterprise officer to satisfy himself that the invoices are in order, and that all conditions relating to the grant have been met.  In the vast majority of cases, where a satisfactory application for payment of grant is submitted to my Department by the county enterprise officer, no significant delay occurs at that stage.  I am advised that allowing for the necessary administration of a claim, one week to ten days would be a typical period for the issue of a payment cheque from my Department to the county enterprise officer in favour of the granttee.</P>
      <P>Deputies should note that while I am satisfied that my Department is taking all possible steps to facilitate the payment of county enterprise fund grants under current arrangements, these arrangements are of an interim nature, pending the establishment of the county enterprise boards as independent bodies, which it is my intention to achieve in the very near future.  As independent bodies, it is intended that the boards take full responsibility for such matters as the administration of individual county enterprise fund grant payments.</P>

      <P>I propose to deal with this question in the context of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, and the EU company law directives which apply to directors of companies.</P>
      <P>One of the essential objectives of company law is to ensure that company affairs are conducted in an honest and responsible manner.  The obligations imposed on directors are designed to achieve this end.  Company law does not distinguish between those who act as executive and non-executive directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the legislation provides that whatever penalties may be imposed on directors who fail to comply with their obligations, whether it be a fine, or <Col N="1263" /> imprisonment, or personal liability for the debts of their company, or restriction or disqualification from acting as a director, can only be imposed by the court, which has to take account of the particular circumstances of each case and, where provided, the specific defences that may be availed of.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, by and large, the obligations imposed on directors are no more than is desirable, having regard to the objective that I have just mentioned and the safeguards which also exist to protect those accused of breaches who have acted honestly and responsibly.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should add that I have set up a company law review group to examine specific aspects of company law including issues relevant to the areas referred to by the Deputy.  The review group's work has begun and it is scheduled to report back to me before the end of the year.</P>

    <P>Newspapers became subject to that rate in the 1993 budget as part of a general realignment of the VAT rate structure whereby a single reduced rate was introduced.</P>
    <P>The 1993 Finance Act provided an important concession to the newspaper sector, in the form of an extension of the 10 per cent manufacturing tax rate to newspaper advertising revenue, which should be of major benefit to the industry. RTE and the independent radio stations are liable for the 40 per cent tax rate on revenue from advertising sales.</P>
    <P>The Competition Act, 1991 prohibits anti-competitive arrangements which prevent, restrict or distort competition and the abuse of a dominant position.  An abuse of a dominant position could take the guise of predatory pricing which was designed to eliminate competition.  I am not aware, however, that any British newspaper has a dominant position in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>On 23 June last I met representatives of the Irish newspaper industry and we had a discussion on the problems in relation to the industry.  I am examining whether there are ways in which the industry's problems can be addressed.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Employment Act, 1977, is the legislation <Col N="1265" /> under which my Department is notified of collective redundancies.  The main purpose of the Act, which is based on a 1975 EC Directive on collective redundancies, is to give greater protection to groups of workers faced by redundancy.  The Act is to be amended shortly to implement Council Directive 92/56/EEC which amends the 1975 Directive.</P>
      <P>I was notified of a total of 118 collective redundancies during 1993 under the terms of section 12 of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977.

      <P>It is not appropriate to compare the jobs created in 1993 with the public funds received by IDA in that year.  While some of the jobs created in 1993 were, of course, a consequence of investment made by firms in that year, most would have arisen because of investment in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> A second point is that, while it is important to track net jobs, this does not, in itself, give a sufficient basis to evaluate whether a satisfactory return is being obtained from State support for industrial development &mdash; for example, it does not take into account replacement jobs lost, jobs protected or maintained, indirect employment and income effects, tax receipts and social welfare savings.  In this connection, a recent ESRI report showed that manufacturing firms expenditure on Irish services is directly responsible for supporting an additional nine jobs in the services sector for every ten jobs in manufacturing.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of natural market dynamics and competition faced by Irish based firms on domestic and international markets, there will always be some companies who become uncompetitive, lose business and reduce employment, either on a temporary or on a permanent basis.  Clearly, jobs lost must be replaced before a net increase can be shown.</P>
    <P>Based on the final results of their 1993 employment survey, I understand from the IDA that 15,642 gross jobs in the manufacturing and internationally traded service sectors were created in 1993. This gross jobs outturn is in line with IDA's contribution in 1991 and 1992 to the annual 20,000 gross jobs target in the outgoing PESP.</P>
    <P>The net jobs outturn of 500 approximately in 1993 compares with an overall net loss in 1992 and effectively is the result of gross job losses being down significantly in 1993 compared with 1992. Taking account of the fact that manufacturing industry was faced with having to recover from the effects of the currency crisis and given the continuing recession in most of our main markets abroad, I think the net jobs outturn achieved by IDA in 1993 represented a creditable performance.</P>
    <P>Clearly, a key element to improving the net jobs position in the future is reducing the job losses figure.  In this connection, the Deputy will be aware that, arising from a commitment in the Programme for Government, I have <Col N="1267" /> established a competitiveness and employment protection unit within my Department to assist in this task.  The Deputy will also be aware that, subject to a substantial improvement in the economic situation in our main markets abroad and levels of productivity and output in Ireland, similar to those which prevailed in the period 1988-1990 being achieved, the <i>National Plan 1994-1999</i> sets an overall target of 5,000 net jobs in the manufacturing and internationally traded service sectors for each year, on average, of the plan.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's query on con tract jobs, I am informed by the IDA that, based on their employment survey results, such jobs are not included in the 15,642 gross jobs referred to.  I am advised by IDA that they survey separately jobs other than permanent jobs. This &ldquo;other&rdquo; category covers temporary, part-time and short-term contract jobs.  I understand these are not disaggregated to yield separate data for each category. This is to avoid increasing the complexity of the survey and the need to complete it within a very tight time span.  IDA's employment surveys show that in the period 1988 to 1993, the &ldquo;other&rdquo; category increased from 5.6 per cent to 8.3 per cent of overall employment in the manufacturing and internationally traded services areas.  This reflects the pattern of recruitment by some companies, to allow them to respond flexibly to changing market circumstances.</P>

      <P>Since the matter is rather complex, I would like to go into some detail on the NET/IFI situation.  In 1987 NET's fertiliser operations and the <Col N="1268" /> compound fertiliser operations of Richardsons in Belfast, owned by ICI, were brought together to form IFI.  IFI is owned 51 per cent by NET and 49 per cent by ICI.</P>
      <P>The old accumulated NET debt, which was £164.6 million on 30 September 1987, remained with NET with the intention that NET would service its borrowings from its income on profits on the sale of gas to IFI and dividends from that company.  Because the legislative limit in operation in September 1987 on borrowings by NET which could be State guaranteed was £150 million, legislation was enacted in November 1987 to increase this limit to £180 million.  It was necessary to enact further legislation, NET Act, 1993, to provide for a further increase in the £180 million limit to £200 million because NET's combined income from IFI was insufficient to fully cover the interest payable on NET's borrowings and the resulting shortfall in interest had to be converted into new State guaranteed borrowings.</P>
      <P>The NET Act, 1993 also provided for an increase in the authorised share capital of the company from £77.5 million to £100 million.  To date there has been no increase in NET's guaranteed borrowings under the 1993 Act.  However, because NET's income from IFI continues to be insufficient to allow it cover its interest payments the Minister for Finance has taken up £18.5 million in equity in NET to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time now the NET board has been examining the options for its future. In an interim report submitted to me last year it was stated that, even in the most benign of scenarios, income from IFI to NET will be insufficient to avert a further significant increase in the level of NET's debt.  I expect that the final report, which I understand I will have within the next day or so, will confirm that NET's cash flow position is such that it can meet only a relatively small proportion of its interest obligations and has no capacity to reduce its debts.  In such a scenario one option for the State would be to absorb NET's debts into the national debt.  This and other options will be considered <Col N="1269" /> in the context of a thorough and expeditious examination of the NET report.</P>
    <P>It is NET's debts we are talking about here and these are all State guaranteed. We are not talking about IFI's debts which are IFI's responsibility to manage.</P>

      <P>In 1993 and 1994, a total of 265 companies received research and development grant-aid under the old IDA R &amp; D scheme and the industry R &amp; D Initiative.</P>
      <P>The criteria used in assessing applications for funding include the technical content; value for money and commercial viability of individual R &amp; D projects. The question of whether the project fits in with the company's overall business strategy (i.e. whether the company can afford the cost of the project) is a major factor in deciding whether or not to grant-aid.</P>
      <P>As such, the question of whether companies themselves have formal R &amp; D departments, would not be a criteria as companies may contract-out some of the work involved.  However, a survey carried out by Forfás S &amp; T Unit in 1992 shows that approx 8 per cent of manufacturing companies have formal R &amp; D departments.</P>

      <P>My Department allocates assistance to voluntary organisations in Britain which provide advisory and welfare services for Irish emigrants there.  The allocation of this assistance is based on the recommendations of DÍON &mdash; the advisory committee on the welfare of Irish emigrants in Britain.</P>
      <P>The DÍON Committee was set up, by the then Minister for Labour in 1984 to advise and report on emigrant welfare services in Britain.  It makes recommendations on the provision of financial assistance to organizations to employ professional workers to assist with the welfare problems of Irish emigrants there.  In 1993 an amount of £500,000 was provided.</P>
      <P>For some years now, the grants made on the advice of DÍON have been confined to British-based organisations.  I have accepted the recommendation of the DÍON Committee that the moneys available were more pressingly needed by the voluntary agencies in Britain and I do not propose providing further grant aid for voluntary agencies operating in Ireland.</P>
      <P>FÁS has the statutory duty to provide pre-departure advice to persons intending to live and work abroad.  FÁS, through its national network of offices, is in the best position to provide such advice and to outline the options which are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS operates these services under guidelines which my Department issued. <Col N="1272" /> Those guidelines are aimed towards discouraging unplanned and unprepared emigration.  I would urge persons intending to live and work abroad to contact FÁS well in advance of their departure to ensure they obtain the best possible advice and assistance.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any particular difficulties being experienced by small businesses in obtaining training assistance.  In fact the training support scheme operated by FÁS which is available to firms engaged in manufacturing industry, internationally traded services, physical distribution, wholesale, retail and the motor sectors is specifically geared towards the small business and grants are targeted on a sliding scale with owners-managers of firms employing 12 or less eligible for 80 per cent grant aid.  It is of course the case that for all businesses, large or small, not all demands can be met all the time because of limited budgets.</P>
      <P>In relation to the employment of graduates, the Techstart programme which is administered by Forbairt, on behalf of my Department, facilitates the employment by small and medium sized enterprises of science or engineering graduates for up to one year.  The aim of the programme is to improve company performance through the effective use of technology and it is targeted at companies with limited technical resources. In practice 60 per cent of participating companies have less than 30 employees. About 160 graduates will be placed with companies under the programme this year.</P>

      <P>I have noted the contents of the article published in <i>Industrial Relations News</i> on 21 April, 1994 concerning employee relations in greenfield sites.  I understand that the article was based on research findings from a survey of greenfield operations conducted by the University of Limerick.  Further analysis of the survey data forms the basis of one component of a major research project, commissioned by my Department and being carried out by the University of Limerick, on employer-employee relations practices in Ireland.  I expect to have the first phase of this project published at an early date.</P>
      <P>Of the 53 greenfield companies surveyed, 25 companies, or 47 per cent, recongised trade unions, whereas 28 companies, or 53 per cent, did not.  The majority of Irish, European and Japanese companies recognised trade unions, while only a minority of US-owned enterprises did so.  I consider that it is important to point out that the survey did not differentiate between those firms which might have actively refused recognition and those which did not have union recognition.  Care, therefore, needs to be exercised in interpreting the research findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other research carried out by the University of Limerick for my Department, on the basis of the Price Waterhouse <Col N="1275" /> Cranfield Survey of leading companies in the State, demonstrates that 77 per cent of respondents recognised trade unions. This research also shows that country of origin has no significant impact on union recognition.  Thus, while some US companies do not have unions, the impact is not significant overall.  The research findings indicate that, in general, trade union recognition, density and influence in Irish organisations remains quite robust with high levels of union recognition and density permeating most organisations.</P>
    <P>The general position in the State concerning trade union membership is positive. Total trade union membership is estimated at 488,000 members or over 47 per cent of the employee labour force at the end of 1993.  This represents a steady increase in membership compared with the 1980s when it was in decline.  By the end of that decade trade union density was as low as some 43 per cent of the employee labour force.</P>
    <P>The question of whether or not an organisation recognises a trade union is something which must be worked out between both sides of industry in accordance with the voluntarist nature of our free collective bargaining system.

      <P>The employment incentive scheme has operated as a social scheme since the end of 1989 with the objective of encouraging employers to recruit persons who are long term unemployed, early school leavers and other categories of disadvantaged persons.  As such, I propose to answer the question in respect of the scheme as it operated since the end of 1989.  During the period 1990 to end May 1994, 8.590 persons were recruited under the scheme but information is not available on the number of these persons still in employment as the scheme does not require employers to provide such information.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the scheme during the period 1990 to end May, 1994, amounted to £17.231 million of which £10.250 million approximately is Exchequer funding and the balance is EU funding.  EU funding is only received in respect of actual expenditure.</P>
      <P>The level of payment to an employer depends on the category of person recruited but the average payment in respect of each recruit would be £2,000 approximately.</P>

      <P>The collation of statistics on the rate of unemployment is a matter for the Central Statistics Office. According to information supplied to me, the Labour Force Survey shows that the unemployment rate in the Dublin region in April, 1992 was 16 per cent compared to the national average of 15.3 per cent. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed expressed as a percentage of the total labour force and is based on standard criteria laid down by the International Labour Office for the classification of persons as employed, unemployed or outside of the labour force.  1992 is the most recent year for which information on this basis is currently available from the Labour Force Survey.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will see, on the basis of the available information, the difference in the rate of unemployment between Dublin and the rest of the country is not significant.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the causes of unemployment are many and varied and the Government is addressing the problem across a broad range of fronts.  The primary goal of my Department in this area is to assist business to become more competitive, to grow and to thus generate increased employment, either directly or in related business.  In addition to the efforts which are being made to improve the commercial and regulatory environment for business, the activities of the enterprise development agencies under my Department's aegis are also crucial to the achievement of this goal.</P>
      <P>However, in the context of overall policy, the developmental activities of the agencies in respect of any particular region are the sole responsibility of those agencies and are matters in which I have no direct function.</P>

This strategy seeks to promote the development of a strong internationally competitive enterprise sector in Ireland through a variety of measures designed to improve the capabilities and capacity of Irish industry as well as to attract new inward investment.

      <P>The recent decisions taken by the European Commission on Structural Funds assistance for training and employment measures are very welcome.

      <P>The National Development Plan envisaged approximately 38 per cent of the EU Structural Funds being allocated to the development of human resources. This percentage allocation has been endorsed in the draft Community Support Framework recently agreed by the Commission.</P>

      <P>The total amount of EU Structural Fund aid received by Ireland under the last round of EU Structural Funds was IR£3,305 million.  Of this approximately IR£747 million, being 22.59 per cent of the total, was attributable to expenditure in the Dublin region.  These figures are based on the actual expenditure for 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 and the forecast for 1993.</P>
      <P>The Community Support Framework element of the Structural Funds 1994-1999 for Ireland has been negotiated on the basis of 5.62 billion ECU or IR£4.54 billion in 1994 prices.  This is an indicative amount and may be subject to adjustment during the implementation period. As regards the Community initiatives element of the Structural Funds 1994-1999, no allocations to member states have yet been made.  The overall allocation for the Dublin region is not available at this time.</P>
      <P>However, it should be noted that in drawing up the National Development Plan, the Government was determined to ensure that the development strategy adopted should promote balanced regional development.  An indicative breakdown of expenditure by sub-region over the plan period 1994-1999, would give Dublin some 26 per cent of total structural expenditure including Cohesion Fund resources and Community Initiatives.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme, which I introduced for the first time last year proved to be a major success. The scheme was a very positive development, of benefit to both students and to the local communities.</P>
      <P>The 1994 scheme is proving to be even more successful.  At the week ending 24 June 1994, 10,200 jobs have been offered by about 1,940 sponsors who are directly involved in community and voluntary work and over 9,300 claims have already been received from third level college students.  This represents a very considerable increase on the number of student claims which had been received at the same point last year and I am confident that additional applications will continue to be submitted in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Third level students are not entitled to claim unemployment assistance during their summer holidays.  This scheme was introduced for students as an alternative to unemployment assistance and allows them to gain valuable work experience while at the same time making a worthwhile contribution to their local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation in the scheme is subject to the same means test as applies to those claiming unemployment assistance.  The extension of the scheme to all third level students, irrespective of their financial circumstances is not envisaged since it would require significant additional Exchequer resources.  Of the first 6,000 students who have so far qualified to participate <Col N="1295" /> in the scheme 75 per cent are from families who are working and who are not getting a social welfare payment themselves.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the divisional drugs unit for the DMA Eastern Division operates from Dún Laoghaire Garda station.  This unit operates throughout the division and in recent months has been concentrating its efforts in the Bray-Shankill-Enniskerry <Col N="1297" /> areas, with special emphasis on the investigation of suspected drug dealers in the area.  Numerous searches have been carried out and six drug dealers from the area have been brought before the courts for breaches of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.</P>
      <P>Back-up support is provided to the divisional drugs unit when required by the district detective unit and the local uniformed force.  The unit also undertakes joint operations with the central drugs unit based at Harcourt Square.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities consider that the current arrangements in relation to drug law enforcement in the Bray-Shankill-Enniskerry areas are adequate. However, they are keeping these arrangements under continuing review and any changes considered necessary will be made.</P>

In the case of such schedules, the property is deemed to be registered as of date of vesting by the Land Commission.  Registration of these schedules is thus, of necessity, afforded a lower priority than the registration of dealings.  Where a specific need arises which requires that registration of a schedule be completed, for example where a further transaction affecting the property in question arises, then the Land Registry will, as far as possible, expedite such cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104, 105, 106 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>In regard to the backlog, the Authority has, at my request, drawn up a work programme designed to make significant inroads into the number of cases on hand by the end of this year, with a progressive reduction in the backlog in coming years. Progress in this regard is being monitored closely.</P>
      <P>At 31 May 1994, the Authority had received a total of 1,249 notifications and had made 332 decisions covering 656 notifications, leaving a balance of 593 notifications to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Authority has played an important role in guiding and defining pro-competitive business behaviour and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
      <P>Under the recently published Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, which I introduced in this House yesterday, it is proposed to provide for public independent enforcement of competition rules.  The existing system of whereby the principal means of enforcement was through private actions in the civil courts has proved, in the period of operation, to be less than fully effective.  To strengthen the application of the law I am proposing to appoint a member of the Competition Authority with specific responsibility for enforcement matters, the new member to be the Director of Competition Enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second major change to the law proposes to remove all mergers from the scope of section 4 of the Competition Act.  Section 4 of the 1991 Act created a dual jeopardy difficulty with mergers <Col N="1300" /> being subject to two sets of regulatory instruments.</P>
    <P>The Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, is largely confined to making these two major changes.  I will look at the overall position of the law in a couple of years time when we will have the benefit of seeing how the latest arrangements have worked in practice.</P>

      <P>The control of absenteeism is a key element in managing an organisation and is, therefore, the responsibility of management at the work-place. Experience has indicated that those enterprises which have adopted specific absence control policies and measures, including the maintenance of relevant records, have been successful in reducing absenteeism.</P>
      <P>It is, accordingly, clearly in the interest of enterprises to adopt suitable absenteeism control strategies.  While my Department does not provide any direct support in this area, assistance is available to member companies of such representative bodies as the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation (IBEC). A report on absenteeism in Irish industry, entitled &ldquo;Ireland's Missing Workforce&rdquo;, published by IBEC in 1993, is relevant in this regard.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to five particular incidents which occurred at factories in counties Cork, Kilkenny and Dublin in the second half of 1993.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that, in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 11 on 8 February last (Official Report, Volume 438, Columns 840-842), I stated that, in the case of three of these incidents, files had been prepared by the Health and Safety Authority and submitted to the Chief State Solicitor's Office with a view to prosecution.  Since then a further file has been prepared for the Chief State Solicitors in respect of the incident at a canning factory in Waterford.  One of the cases submitted to the Chief State Solicitor was heard in Waterford District Court on 29 April 1994 and a fine of £1,500 was imposed on the company. Three cases are still awaiting court proceedings while the Authority is satisfied that no further action would be appropriate in the remaining case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of the explosion at Hickson Pharmachem, Ringaskiddy, County Cork, which is one of the cases subject to proceedings, that Authority does not consider that the publication of a report on the incidents referred to is warranted.  The Authority comments from time to time on industrial accidents by way of its newsletter, its annual report and/or general press releases and both those cases where action has been finalised have been dealt with in this manner. I have, however, asked the Authority to <Col N="1304" /> report the findings of a comprehensive survey which they are undertaking at my request on the safety of the chemical and allied industries in Ireland.

      <P>The Government considered the report of the task force set up to advise on the recommendations contained in the document <i>A Crusade for Survival.</i> On 28 April 1994, the Government issued a statement, detailing the action which would be taken in response.  The Government noted that the implementation process in respect of the vast majority of the sectoral recommendations contained in the task force report was ongoing as part of existing sectoral policies or was planned as part of the measures to be undertaken under the next round of EU Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific remit of my Department and its agencies, the statement noted that both Forbairt and the county enterprise boards would direct their efforts towards the continued development of indigenous industry in the west and would place particular emphasis on the role of small business-industry in that development.  The statement also noted that IDA Ireland would continue to promote the west as a location for mobile international investment and would also assist the expansion of existing overseas companies in the region and the development of linkages between those firms and indigenous industry.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Ireland's number of research and technology development personnel has been identified as 2.6 per 1,000 employees in businesses as against an EU average of six; the comparable figures ten years ago; and his target figures for achievement during the current EU Community Support Framework for Ireland.</Quest>

      <P>I assume that the question refers to &ldquo;Business R &amp; D personnel per thousand of the labour force&rdquo;, which is the only internationally comparable data available in this area.  The term &ldquo;labour force&rdquo; includes both those employed and those not at work but seeking employment.</P>
      <P>The most recent figures available are for 1990 and show that in Ireland the number of business R &amp; D personnel per 1,000 of the labour force was 2.31, compared to the European average of 5.4.</P>
      <P>The 1991 figure for Ireland had increased to three business R &amp; D personnel per 1,000 of the labour force, but no comparable EU figure is available as yet. The earliest available figure is in respect of 1983: 1.19 per 1,000 of the labour force, although unfortunately no EU average figure is available for that year.</P>
      <P>The fact that the most recent comparison shows that Ireland lags behind European average is, I believe, a reflection of the relatively low Irish spend on R &amp; D compared to our European competitors. The most recent OECD figures available &mdash; for 1992 &mdash; show that Ireland's gross expenditure on R &amp; D amounted to 1.1 per cent of GDP, while the EU average was 1.89 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This trend is changing however, and Ireland's gross expenditure on R &amp; D has been rising steadily in recent years: from £239 million in 1990, to £280 million in <Col N="1307" /> 1991 and an estimated £318 million in 1992.  The Government's target under the next round of Structural Funds is to encourage further increases in this level of expenditure, to bring Ireland's gross spending closer to the European average and to improve industrial competitiveness.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of this overall increase in R &amp; D spending, the numbers of R &amp; D personnel should also increase, bringing us closer to the European average.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government outlines a range of measures for the strengthening and development of local government.  Significant progress has been made in implementing these, including re-organisation of local government in Dublin, establishment of regional authorities, designation of additional reserved functions for local authority members, arrangements for reform of local government at sub-county level, as well as the measures to increase the functions and discretion of local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is the policy in framing new legislation that appropriate functions should be devolved to local authorities and unnecessary controls removed.  Recent roads, road traffic and local government legislation provides accordingly in areas such as extinguishment of public rights of way, abandonment of public roads, speed limits, traffic management, parking controls, by-laws, libraries, provision of amenities and general competence of local authorities, as does legislation currently before the Oireachtas in relation to casual trading.  Local authorities were given full responsibility for the various new schemes in the plan for social housing. In 1993 I made an order removing a wide range of existing central controls on local authorities.  Future legislation affecting local authorities will continue these trends, wherever possible.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the question refers to bovine semen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Importation into the State of bovine semen generally, including, of course, from Scotland through Northern Ireland, is governed by S.I. No. 259 of 1993 entitled &ldquo;European Communities (Trade in Bovine Breeding Animals their Semen, Ova and Embryos) Regulations 1993&rdquo;.  These regulations transpose into <Col N="1320" /> national law the EU directives dealing with trade in bovine semen.  Under these regulations any individual or company who wishes to import semen into the State may do so but in so doing must comply fully with the provisions of the regulations.  The conditions applicable to importation of semen include a requirement that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry must be given two working days advance notice and all such imports must be consigned to an approved semen collection centre in the State.  In addition, all semen being imported from another member state must be accompanied by the EU veterinary and zootechnical certification prescribed in the regulations.  EU law does not allow member states to impose any further restrictions on the importation of semen.  I am satisfied that any importation of bovine semen straws which complies with these regulations does not represent a threat to our animal health status.  The private sector has been involved to a considerable extent in the AI business for many years.  There is no reason why this should not be the case; in fact, the private sector has made a significant contribution in this area.</P>

      <P>Investment in <Col N="1323" /> the potato sector under the operational programme for rural development 1991-93 was mainly in the form of assistance towards the provision of insulated and temperature controlled storage.  The purpose of this investment was to encourage the more orderly marketing of the potato crop principally by extending the marketing season.</P>
      <P>However, unfavourable weather conditions in the summer of 1993 resulted in a considerable reduction in yields and a consequent scarcity of potatoes towards the end of the current marketing season.</P>
      <P>I consider that further investment in the sector is desirable and that an assessment of the benefits of the investment which has already taken place can only be measured over a number of years.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus has informed me that the numbers of crews based in Shannon are 15 pilots, including the fleet captain, and 62 cabin crew.  Due to the heavy training programme of B747/A330 crew conversion and the significant amount of extra flying associated with the World Cup airlift, it will be some time before the full complement of the Shannon crew base is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus has further informed me <Col N="1329" /> that the figure of 200 has been reduced for the following reasons: (a) Originally all New York flights were to be crewed from the Shannon crew base and the year round servce was to operate Shannon-Dublin&mdash;New York&mdash;Dublin&mdash;Shannon. With the introduction of daily year round direct services operated by the new A330 aircraft from both Dublin and Shannon, the company state that it would be illogical and inefficent to crew the Dublin direct services from the Shannon crew base and (b) The new A330 aircraft requires less crew per aircraft.</P>

      <P>I understand that DC underground transmission is certainly used for long underwater interconnections.  The ESB has informed me that the cost of putting transmission cables underground would be approximately 15 to 20 times more expensive than equivalent overhead lines.  In addition, ESB's transmission network is based on AC current and the cost of conversion to DC would be extremely high.  Therefore, for any application that the ESB may consider, the cost of underground DC transmission would be enormous and not economical.</P>
      <P>Extensive research is being carried out worldwide in an attempt to establish if there is a link between adverse health effects on humans and the electromagnetic fields, EMF, emitted when electric current flows through objects such as power lines.  Based on the research undertaken to date, there is not enough evidence to indicate that electromagnetic fields constitute a hazard to health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department keeps the matter under constant review and the ESB has assured me that it is committed to designing and operating its networks in accordance with the most up-to-date recommendations and guidelines of the various expert and independent international <Col N="1331" /> bodies in this area, such as the World Health Organisation.</P>

      <P>I do not for a moment accept that transmitter masts are possibly harmful.  Indeed <Col N="1332" /> extensive research on the issue has indicated that if such masts are operated within the guidelines agreed by the world's leading authorities in the area, for example, the Independent Radiological Protection Commission.  IRPC, they do not pose a threat.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, aware of the availability of fibre optic cable and its possible applications.  I do not agree with the Deputy's assumptions however.  The laying of cable is not cheap, and it cannot compete economically with broadcasting transmission over large areas.  This is due to the prohibitive cost of cabling every household, especially in rural areas, with any form of cable including fibre optic cable and the complex switching necessary to deliver a range of services.  In addition, cable can service fixed installations only and cannot take account of the need for mobile radio and television and telecommunications service.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have given full consideration to the recommendations in the report to which he refers, in particular to those which come within the areas for which I have responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the valuable contribution that the existing railway network makes to balance regional development. In keeping with the Government's strong commitment to the railway network, the National Development Plan includes provision for an EU assisted investment programme of £185 million on the upgrading of the existing railway network including lines to the West.  This will cover expenditure on track renewal, new signalling systems and modern rolling stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, the Government approved a proposal which I put to them that an Irish &ldquo;Essential Air Services&rdquo; programme, costing £1.5 million per annum, be introduced to guarantee a minimum level of service to the six Irish regional airports.  This programme must comply with the procedures applying to access for Community carriers to intra-Community air routes and the next step in the procedure is to seek tenders, through the Official Journal, for the operation of the designated routes by any air carrier entitled to operate scheduled air services within Ireland.  The &ldquo;Call for Tenders&rdquo; document has just been finalised with the Commission and I expect that tenders <Col N="1334" /> for the operation of the services will be invited shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to electricity supply the West will benefit from a cost and competitiveness review of the ESB which I have commissioned.  This review will examine how the ESB's operations compare with best international practice, and the appropriateness of their proposed capital investment programme.</P>
    <P>As witnessed by the success of Ireland's first wind farm at Bellacorrick, County Mayo, the West is one of the best regions in Europe with potential for wind power development.  Accordingly, the region will be in a position to benefit from the alternative energy requirement scheme recently announced by my Department to achieve supplies of up to an additional 75 Megawatts of installed electricity from alternative energy sources before 1977.</P>
    <P>My Department is also currently involved in a study part-funded by the European Union, to examine the potential for using natural renewable local resources such as wind, hydro and biomass to provide development in the western region and to create sustainable employment.  The study is being undertaken by Údarás na Gaeltachta, Forbairt and Galway County Council, and the first stage, an energy audit of the region, is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out that Telecom Éireann has a universal service obligation which obliges that company to provide the West with access to the full range of modern telecommunications services available in our cities and towns.  In addition, local call areas in Ireland are among the largest in Europe, and new connections are now available much faster than a few years ago.</P>

      <P>The need for such a charge arises only where Telecom Éireann's ability to meet the public service obligation envisaged in section 87 of the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, is adversely affected by competition.  It was not felt that a &ldquo;public service&rdquo; related charge was appropriate when the existing value added service licences were issued.</P>

The total student body will increase in phases from 80 students in 1992 to 104 students in 1995-1996.  The increased level of graduate output resulting from this important development should ease difficulties in the area of speech and language therapy.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment in the Southern Health Board area is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>As I recently announced in the national health strategy the deficiencies in the public dental service, including orthodontic services, will be tackled over the next four years in the context of an integrated dental development plan based on the principles of equity, quality of service and accountability.</P>
      <P>At present my Department is addressing the detailed resource requirements for the phased implementation of the dental plan in conjunction with the health boards.  My Department is in consultation with the Southern Health Board regarding their requirements with a view to commencing the development plan for their area this year and over the period of the Programme for a Partnership Government as resources allow.</P>

      <P>This patient is on the orthopaedic out-patient waiting list for Merlin Park Hospital but it is not possible for the hospital to give an appointment date at this stage.  The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of hospital appointments is a matter for the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always given priority. Should the patient's parents/guardians feel concerned that her condition has deteriorated they should return to their general practitioner who would be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of her case to the consultant directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be pleased to know that an additional £850,000 has been allocated to the Western Health Board from the 1994 waiting list initiative fund. Orthopaedics is one of the areas which has been targeted under this initiative. <Col N="1341" /> The additional procedures to be undertaken this year will enable the board to further reduce the waiting time in this specialty.</P>

      <P>The drugs refund scheme covers expenditure by a family on prescribed medication. Under the scheme where an individual or a family's expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines for use in a calendar quarter exceeds £90, they are eligible to claim a refund of the balance of their expenditure in excess of that amount from the relevant health board.  This scheme is intended to assist individuals with occasional requirements for prescribed medication.  I understand from the health boards that the average length of time to process a claim is five weeks.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme when they are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed drugs and medicines at the pharmacy counter.  The General Medical Services (Payments) Board arranges for payment of the balance of the cost to the community pharmacist, thus eliminating the question of a waiting period by patients for refunds.</P>

All significant research and studies in this area are monitored on an ongoing basis by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  However, the general body of research to date has not established electromagnetic radiation emissions as a cause of ill-health.  The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has also pointed out that power line voltages in Ireland and concentrations of power lines which emit this radiation are well below those in most industrialised countries.  The guidelines laid down by the International Radiation Protection Association are based on the most expert knowledge available.</P>

      <P>Claims for the grading of posts of school secretaries are matters appropriate for negotiations between my Department, school management and the relevant trade union.  The trade union recognised by my Department as representing school secretaries is IMPACT. It was in response to a claim by IMPACT for the regrading of school secretaries in national and secondary schools that evaluation of posts was conducted.  The evaluation exercise was carried out in two phases, the first completed in December <Col N="1348" /> 1992 in response to the original claim and the second in October 1993 on foot of an appeal from the union to have additional posts evaluated.  The evaluation resulted in the regrading of 40 posts.  As part of the settlement of the claim IMPACT agreed that the upgradings were on an exceptional basis and would not be quoted in furtherance of any other claims.  In these circumstances I have no proposals in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Council of Education Ministers at a meeting on 21 June 1994 in Luxembourg considered a proposal for the Commission of the European Communities establishing the Community Action Programme SOCRATES.  The SOCRATES proposal, which is expected <Col N="1350" /> to be formally adopted later in 1994, is an effective consolidation, deepening and extension of existing community programmes such as ERASMUS and LINGUA.</P>
      <P>This proposal involves, principally, a number of actions in the area of school and higher education and in the promotion of language learning.  In addition it provides for exchanges of in formation and experiences through the EURYDICE Unit and ARION Study Visits.</P>
      <P>It is not possible, at this stage, to quantify the level of resources which will become available to the Irish Education Sector for actions under SOCRATES. The Community actions in the area of education and training are catalytic.  I believe that the proposals in SOCRATES when implemented will serve to enhance this effect and serve to inform and develop national systems in Ireland and the other Member States.</P>

      <P>The proposal to establish a Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute has to be considered in the context of the future development of the higher education sector in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have asked a steering committee, established under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority, to advise me on this.  The steering committee will prepare projections to the year 2015 of the total potential enrolments in higher education and the corresponding needs required by the sector to facilitate these enrolments.</P>
      <P>The committee will carry out a comprehensive needs analysis of higher education requirements.  Its remit includes the overall needs of society and the economy as well as regional, socio-economic and equality considerations together with the needs of students and the world of work.  It will also focus on the appropriate provision for mature students as well as the need to provide access to third level education for disadvantaged students.</P>
      <P>As previously indicated to me in the Dáil, the work of the committee will have to be informed by, and take account of, budgetary and financial considerations. In this context the distribution of the £9.5 million included in the European Regional Development Fund programme will have regard <i>inter alia</i> to the recommendations of the steering committee on the future development of higher education.  The provision for special projects remains as outlined in my statement of 13 January.</P>
      <P>The possibility of funding from other Government Departments will also be dependent on decisions to be taken in relation to the future development of higher education.  The steering committee is due to complete its deliberations in December and submit its recommendations to me.  When I receive their recommendations I will give them my urgent attention.</P>

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to the introduction of intermediate education structures.  In line with a commitment I gave at the close of the National Education Convention last October, I issued a position paper on regional education Councils (RECs) on 11 March 1994, as an input to the consultative process.  As I indicated at the time, the proposals in the position paper are neither final ministerial nor Government proposals.</P>
      <P>I subsequently invited the organisations which participated in the analysis of issues group on intermediate education structures at the convention to take part in a series of Roundtable Discussions on the proposals in the position paper.  I have recently received a report on the round table discussions, prepared by Professor John Coolahan and Dr. Séamus McGuinness.  A copy has been circulated to all Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I will now give careful consideration to the outcome of the consultative process in preparing detailed proposals on intermediate education structures.</P>

      <P>In the period 1989-93 the European Union provided £0.1574 million aid in respect of technical assistance in the operational programme for vocational <Col N="1357" /> training infrastructure which is co-ordinated by my Department.  The funds were provided to assist in the review, monitoring and evaluation of capital measures aided by the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
      <P>No specific technical assistance funds were provided to my Department for ESF-aided activity in the education sector in the period 1989-93.  However, the technical assistance activity co-ordinated by the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Finance included evaluation and review of programmes in the education sector carried out both by external consultants and by the European Social Fund Programme Evaluation Unit.</P>
