      <P>The person referred to has been made available through the good offices of the New Zealand Government to provide advice to the Steering Group overseeing the current review of the Defence Forces. No fee or other remuneration is being charged for his services but travel and accommodation expenses are recouped. I would like to take this opportunity to express the Government's appreciation of the ready co-operation afforded by the New Zealand authorities in making such expert assistance available.</P>

      <P>I asked for the terms of reference of the review. Can the Minister of State tell the House something about the parameters of this review?  Will he address the question of whether this country's possible entry into the Western European Union forms any part of its terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My question asked the Taoiseach the terms of reference and so on. I am merely asking the Minister of State whether he will expand on the terms of reference of this appointment; whether this country's potential membership of the Western European Union is being examined within the terms of that review, and are there any other considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Why are we engaging in this review at this time then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asked the Taoiseach the terms of reference of the appointment of a person, details supplied, who is from New Zealand. The terms of reference to which Deputy Rabbitte refers &mdash; the terms of reference of the Steering Group on the overhaul of the Defence Forces which were published previously &mdash; are well known at this stage. The reason the person concerned came forward and was used by the Steering Group is that the Steering Group felt it was necessary for them to have an independent military adviser on the matters which the group and their consultants were addressing. There is no question of policy matters being addressed by the Efficiency Audit Group. It is addressing the efficiency of the military and has nothing to do with foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the concern at certain levels within the Defence Forces regarding the implications of this review? Will the Select Committee on Legislation and Security be afforded an opportunity to consider the findings of that review in due course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="932" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The military and civilian side of the Department of Defence, in addition to the other Departments involved in this process, are working very closely and harmoniously. A number of newspaper articles about levels of anxiety bear no relationship to what is occurring within the review group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State indicated that the review would have nothing to do with policy.  How can this review group operate effectively without addressing how the Defence Forces are to be deployed from a policy point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>That may be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Last September the Government reviewed the roles of the Defence Forces, which review was made public and discussed.  Within policy decisions taken by the Government, we are now endeavouring to establish the most efficient and effective way of fulfilling those roles, which is a separate issue altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State inform the House whether people from countries other than New Zealand are assisting this review group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultants have a person from Canada.  That person is the only other foreigner I am aware of who is assisting in the review group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify whether the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, the Foreign Affairs Committee or any other committee of the House will have an opportunity to consider in detail the thrust of the findings at the end of the day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter will be <Col N="933" /> decided when the report is finalised.  I imagine that once the report is finalised there will be areas of interest to Deputies and the general thrust of the report will be discussed, but I cannot say definitely until such time as the report is finalised. Some aspects of the report will obviously have security implications and I will have to reserve a position on those until the report is published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, can you give any advice to the House, Sir, on whether there is any precedent for refusing a question to the Taoiseach on the grounds that the subject matter is being considered by a committee of the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 56, 58 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that, as a result of representations by the Government and by myself, the German authorities have decided not to include Ireland on the list of countries affected by the proposed restrictions on the import of beef.  Consequently, there is no need to raise the matter at the next EU Summit.  Neither would it be appropriate to take legal action against the German Government. I am now satisfied, that Irish beef will continue to have unimpeded access to the German market.  In order to offset the effects of any adverse publicity on the reputation of Irish beef in Germany, I have asked CBF to intensify their promotional activities there and I am satisfied that CBF have adequate financial resources for this purpose.  CBF have already met with leading German importers and distributors of Irish beef to reassure them of the high health status and quality of Irish beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I am glad Deputy John Bruton, the Leader of Fine Gael, and I gave the Minister and the Government all the support they needed in making the case very clear to Germany in relation to the safety and health status of Irish beef.  Does the Minister agree that significant damage was done to the quality image of our beef, in association with Irish food generally, by the innuendo and the scare by the German Health Minister in relation to Irish beef and the implied health risks associated with it?  Does he agree that damage was done and that there is consumer resistance, at least <i>pro tem,</i> in Germany as a result of that totally unwarranted scare and profoundly unfriendly act by the Germans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the understanding of Deputy Doyle, Deputy Bruton and the House in this matter, on which we had a useful and positive debate.  Our unanimity was extremely helpful.  The proposed draft was not helpful <Col N="936" /> but I believe that is short term.  CBF has assured me that in previous situations in other countries where there was short term adverse publicity they quickly got over it and I believe that will happen in this instance also, with the help of an additional promotional campaign which they are already undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister's reply reaffirms that damage, albeit short term, was done to the image of Irish beef on the supermarket shelves in Europe. Am I right in assuming that that was the thrust of the Minister's reply?  I feel strongly, and I ask the Minister to take this on board, that the attempt by the German Health Minister to couple the BSE problem in the UK with the situation in Ireland was extremely damaging. We need to show our strength of feeling on what was done to all our food markets by pursuing, through the courts, an action for damages to the good name not only of Irish beef production but quality Irish food generally.  Food production in Ireland is of enormous importance to our GNP.  It was our <i>raison d'être</i> for being part of the European Union in its infancy, way back in the EEC days.  If we do not take a stand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not for this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on this act of potential commercial sabotage it could be tried again during elections in other European countries where they are trying to protect the domestic producer in certain areas.  I ask the Minister to consider legal action, not just to protect Irish beef but as a mark of our strength to show we are prepared to protect the quality image of Irish food products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My information from both CBF and the industry is that no orders were lost as a result of adverse publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless, the publicity <Col N="937" /> was unhelpful and sales of red meat declined during that period.  This was a draft proposal and the German authorities listened to reasoned argument and accepted that we have stringent controls here, that we take the production of quality food seriously and that we assure customers in relation to the safety of Irish food.  I believe legal action would be unhelpful and would further highlight the situation and would be seen by the German authorities as ungrateful and unfriendly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 7, 11, 15, 25, 27, 29, 32, 42, 47, 52, 57, 60, 64, 68 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>EU regulations preclude any payment under the suckler cow premium and special beef premium schemes before November and even then limit the payments to 60 per cent advances.  Payment of the balances under both of these schemes is covered by EU requirements relating to the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density.  Member states are in fact obliged to process all applications received from a particular applicant during the course of 1993 before paying out the 40 per cent balances.  The applications made in November 1993 are therefore a factor in the payment of these balances.  However, payment on foot of November 1993 applications commenced at the beginning of April.  This in turn has allowed for the commencement of payment of the balances for all 1993 schemes which commenced in mid April. To date 41,847 suckler cow applicants have been paid their final instalments and over 110,000 final payments have been made under the special beef premium schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> Exept in duly justified exceptional; cases, EU regulations require payments of 1993 suckler cow and special beef premia to be made not later than 30 June of this year.  I expect that all but the most difficult problem cases will be paid within this time-frame.  Payment of extensification premium is automatic &mdash; there is no application procedure.  This payment too is linked to stocking density regulations and extensification payments have now commenced.  Disadvantaged areas' headage payments other than for sheep are normally on the basis of advances.</P>
    <P>The ewe premium scheme is payable in accordance with EU regulations.  Normally payments are made by way of three instalments.  Payment of any of the instalments cannot be made until the EU Commission fixes the amount to be paid and until up to seven days have elapsed from the date of publication of that decision in the Official Journal.  In 1993 it was decided that the first and second instalments could be paid together following publication of the second instalment decision in the Official Journal on 2 June 1993.  In Ireland's case payment of the first and second instalment commenced on 27 July 1993.  The EU Commission's decision fixing the third instalment was published on 7 March 1994 facilitating payment by 15 March.  In Ireland's case well over 90 per cent of farmers were paid their final instalment before the end of March.</P>
    <P>Our performance in delivery of all payments compares more than favourably with that of other member states.  No advance payments of either special beef or suckler cow premia were made in several member states in 1993.  Our time-frame for paying the 40 per cent balances and extensification is also in line with that in other member states.  In so far as the ewe premium is concerned, Ireland is consistently among the first to make payment.</P>
    <P>I believe that farmers are entitled to the earliest possible payment of their headage and premium grants and since becoming Minister I believe that the record shows that considerable progress <Col N="942" /> has been made in getting payments to farmers.  In the year ended 31 December 1993 over 500,000 payments totalling £377 million were made to farmers under the various premium and headage schemes.  This figure exceeded by £28 million the previous record level of payments achieved in 1992.  Since the beginning of this year a further 350,000 payments totalling over £145 million have been made.  During the month of April alone, close to 180,000 payments amounting to over £50 million issued to farmers under the various headage and premium schemes.  The current position is that close to £385 million has been paid out to farmers under the 1993 schemes.  With the exception of the extensification premium and the November 1993 applications where payments are ongoing in general all non problem cases have now received either an advance payment or full entitlement.  Where farmers make the effort to complete forms accurately there is no inordinate delay in making payments.</P>
    <P>In regard to problem cases I expect that many of these will eventually get payment but farmers who are careless with their applications or who fail to supply all necessary details will at best suffer delay in receiving payment and at worst no payment and exclusion from a scheme for up to two years.  In the light of the problem cases, it is not possible to be precise on the value of 1993 payments which will ultimately be made.</P>
    <P>My objective and that of my Department is to resolve problem cases as quickly as possible but we cannot do this if farmers ignore requests for necessary material.  For example, the area aid application form is the cornerstone for ensuring entitlement to all payments.  To date 129,479 1993 area aid applications from livestock farmers have been processed. The error rate in completion of these forms was in the region of 30 per cent &mdash; in other words over 38,000 applications were incorrect and delayed payments under all other schemes.  The June 1993 special beef premum scheme also proved particularly problematic.  My Department had to write to up to 40,000 farmers <Col N="943" />&mdash; almost 50 per cent of applicants &mdash; concerning problems with their applications. The problems here ranged from failure to submit cattle identity cards quoting invalid tags to omitting age of animals and submitting female cards. There has been a considerable delay by farmers in responding to these queries despite several written reminders in many cases and newspaper advertisements advising farmers that payments cannot be processed in the absence of replies.  Up to 20,000 farmers have not yet responded and consequently their applications cannot be processed.</P>
    <P>The more recent evidence, however, suggests that farmers are indeed coming to terms with the difficulties.  The November 1993 tranche of applications has shown a marked improvement and is proving much less problematic.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise that as a result of CAP reform a considerable administrative burden fell on farmers and on administrators during 1993.  The schemes are quite complex and farmers have found it necessary to devote much time and effort to the completion of the necessary backup documentation which is an essential part of the new regime.  My Department in conjunction with Teagasc have made great efforts to give the necessary information and help to all farmers.  Given that the schemes involve considerable amounts of money &mdash; as much as £640 million per annum &mdash; it is not unreasonable that the European Commission lays down very strict conditions for the filling of forms and the meeting of other requirements.</P>
    <P>I have put considerable additional resources in place in my Department to deal with the headage and premium schemes.  Last year a new unit with up to 100 staff was set up in Portlaoise to deal with the special beef premium scheme. Earlier this year I announced a £4.8 million investment to develop and upgrade computer facilities and other resources particularly in local offices of my Department with the objective of achieving the optimum delivery of services to farmers and with special emphasis on the timely <Col N="944" /> payment of headage and premia grants. Given the very substantial increase in the volume of applications in 1993 and the new integrated control system introduced under EU regulations, I believe that the record level of payments achieved speaks for itself.  The additional resources which I have obtained from the Government will result in an even higher level of payment being achieved in 1994 and should enable the payment of all eligible premium claims within three months of application next year.  This objective is in line with the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>My objective is to secure a streamlined system for the delivery of all direct payments to farmers, one which is as simple as possible while remaining consistent with EU regulations and at the same time enabling payments to be made as early as possible.  I am satisfied that considerable progress has already been achieved and I am determined that my objective will be fully realised.</P>

      <P>The length of the Minister's reply is indicative of the extent of the problem that exists among the farming community due to non or partial payment of headage and premia payments. Is the Minister aware that west of the Shannon 80 per cent of farmers' income derives from compensation payments under the CAP reform and east of the Shannon up to 50 per cent of farmers' income derives from such payments?  I would hate to ask the PAYE sector to wait up to 15 months for 50 per cent or more of their salary.  They would not do it.  Will the Minister explain how, to use his own words, he intends to provide a &ldquo;streamlined system for the delivery of all direct payments to farmers&rdquo; so that farmers are not waiting up to 15 months for the cheques?  John from County Wexford has not yet received £1 of his 1993 ewe premium.  He has been told nothing is wrong and his is not a problem case. Will the Minister explain to John the reason for the delay?  He is depending on his ewe premium.</P>

      <P>Compensatory payments were made by the European Union, on foot of CAP reform, in anticipation of a fall in prices but this did not occur last year or this year, thankfully. Farmers have been paid £385 million in supplementary payments; this year alone they have been paid £145 million.  This compares more than favourably with the figures for all other member states.  All eligible applicants, except in cases where there is a problem or difficulty, have been paid.  All other eligible applicants will be paid before 30 June this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that compensatory payments were made, not only because of the threat of a reduction in prices but also because of cutbacks in production? Will he also agree that farmers cut back production in a range of agricultural enterprises, as they were required to do under the Common Agricultural Policy, at great cost to themselves? That is why they are entitled to the compensatory payments.  I am surprised that the Minister tries to make the case that farmers were not entitled to receive these extra millions.  That is what he implied.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The use of set-aside land for any agricultural purpose, other than production of specified products which are not intended for human or animal consumption, is not permitted under EU regulations except during the period from 1 September to 14 January.  Set-aside land attracts a payment of £136.94 per acre, and to allow grazing or forage production on such land would discriminate against farmers who are dependent on unsubsidised land for livestock production. In the circumstances, it is not my intention to seek a derogation from the EU Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's response.  Does he agree that this would be the single, most effective way of compensating farmers given the <Col N="948" /> atrocious weather conditions during the past six months; that it would not cost the Irish or European taxpayer anything; that it would allow fields which have been destroyed because of early grazing to recover and allow us to build up reserves of hay and silage which have been depleted due to the bad weather?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers are paid £136 per acre to set-aside land.  Those who possess land which has not been set aside made the case to the European Commission that it would be extremely unfair if farmers in receipt of a subsidy of £136 per acre could use the land in the same way as themselves.  Farmers can use set-aside land for grazing or silage production from 1 September onwards.  It may also be used for the production of cereals, oil seeds, protein crops and a range of other crops.  In practice farmers are behaving sensibly in relation to set-aside land.</P>

Will the Minister re-examine the matter and think seriously about helping these farmers who are suffering enormously because of adverse weather conditions?  There are many precedents.  When horticultural farmers were affected by bad weather they were assisted by the State.  We have an opportunity, at no cost to the taxpayer, to help a large number of farmers who have been badly affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>Last November the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced that he had established a fund to assist horticulture and patato growers who suffered major or total crop loss due to abnormal weather conditions in 1993. Assistance will be granted to growers with a crop area of less than ten hectares who lost more than 25 per cent of the crop and those with a crop area of ten hectares or more who lost more than 40 per cent of the crop.  Applications are being processed and verified at present and payments will be made in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Many growers, particularly in north County Dublin, are in a serious position. Will the Minister of State clarify that 200 claims have been submitted to the Departments seeking payments as a matter of urgency given that suppliers and the banks are at the point of withholding credit facilities?  I have been told that £1 in the spring is worth £4 in the autumn.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that these payments, which will be made by his staff in Cavan and which need to be made as a matter of <Col N="950" /> urgency, will not be delayed because of the need to pay, important though they may be, milk or ewe premia or make other payments?</P>

      <P>The scheme was advertised on 7 February 1994 inviting applications by 25 February.  Over 600 applications were received.  Following examination of these applications in consultation with the Department of Finance it was proposed that growers with holdings of between two and ten hectares who lost more than 25 per cent of the crop and growers with holdings in excess of ten hectares who lost more than 40 per cent of the crop would be assisted.  These figures were revised later and 180 applications were received from growers in north County Dublin.  While considerable damage was done we are not aware that any grower has gone out of business as implied in the Deputy's question.  Applications are being verified and have been referred to Teagasc.  When they are returned they will be processed for payment.  Payments will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Galway has not been paid his ten month special beef premium on all cattle entered on his February 1993 application; if he will make a statement on the information given by his Department that some of the animals in question were too old for this particular premium by one month; his views on whether these conditions make it difficult for farmers to become eligible for such grants.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no application period for ten month special beef premium in January-February 1993. There was, however, an application period for 22 month special beef premium <Col N="953" /> at that time and the person named applied for this premium on 35 animals on 5 January 1993.  He was paid the first instalment of £1,063.03 on foot of this application on 15 December 1993 and the final instalment of £782.52 on 25 April 1994.  These amounts represent the full premium due on all 35 animals listed on his application.  There was no question of any of the animals listed on his January 1993 application having been too old for payment of this premium.</P>
      <P>I understand that six of the 13 animals in respect of which the person named applied for ten month special beef premium in February 1994 are over age. These cattle can, however, be considered for payment of the 22 month premium. With up to three application periods during which farmers can apply for special beef premium in 1994, I do not accept that the age requirements make it difficult for farmers to obtain the premium.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The money expended by my Department in monitoring hare coursing during the last season were largely those incurred by officials in respect of travel and related expenses for attendance at coursing meetings.</P>
      <P>The monitoring of coursing meetings was, by and large, carried out by veterinary officers from the district veterinary offices.  The expense incurred was met from the fixed total budget for each district veterinary office.  Separate accounting for the costs incurred for attendance at coursing meetings would not normally be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question except to say that a cost was incurred, which is obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> As he asked us to consider the financial implications of the many decisions he has been asked to take, would it not have made economic sense to increase monitoring? Does the Minister intend to continue &mdash; or to increase &mdash; monitoring in the next season or was it simply to ascertain if muzzling is successful in his terms?  If he intends to carry out monitoring on as ongoing basis will he ensure that its results are published so that the officials of his Department and the public can judge if it was wise to go down that road?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a number of questions.  The reports received in my Department following the monitoring of last year's coursing season are being correlated and I await a report which I will consider on a number of bases, including the necessity to introduce regulations following the enactment of the greyhound industry legislation which was passed here before Christmas. I will consider the type of monitoring necessary and whether it should be increased or decreased.  Until I have had an opportunity to study last year's report in full I cannot make a decision in that regard.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, last August I put in place a monitoring committee comprising members of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Board na gCon and the office of Public Works. Additional costs were not incurred by the Department, but Bord na aCon and the Office of Public Works did incur additional costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the costs of continuing coursing will be borne by the taxpayer.  Will the Minister make the report available to Members of this House and the public or will it simply be for his consumption?  I am sure many people would be interested to know how that monitoring was carried out and its results.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister have the figure for travelling expenses paid to those carrying out the monitoring?  What does he mean by &ldquo;all relevant information&rdquo;? Surely all information in respect of monitoring should be made available.  The Programme for Government promised openness and transparency and, therefore, none of the information should be withheld from the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I do not intend withholding information from the public.  I stated in reply to the earlier question that a veterinary officer would have been present at those meetings. Their attendance was funded from the budget allocation to district veterinary officers which must priortise their business within the parameters of their budget.  Such itemisation would not be the normal practice.  I explained to Deputy Sargent the manner in which the expenses incurred by the attendance of the monitoring committee were handled. Regarding whether taxpayers' money should have been used for such provision, if people want independent monitoring on behalf of the State, officers of the State must be present at such meetings.</P>

      <P>I understand we are operating the new EU dairy hygiene regulations somewhat differently from the British authorities.  I accept the need for the stricts hugiene regulations and fully support the Minister's effort in that regard.  Given the need for a level playing field, particularly in respect of competitiveness, will the Minister explain why the EU directive is being interpreted differently here?  It is understood there will be farm level testing here while in the UK it will be at processing level. What is the thinking behind our different interpretation of the EU directive and will it put our farmers at a competitive disadvantage compared with UK dairy farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying the UK has a different interpretation of the EU directive.  In the UK samples are taken from bulk tanks when they arrive at processing plants.  At that stage the sample is diluted and farmers have a better chance of passing the required test.  Our interpretation of the directive is that the milk supply of individual farmers should be tested.  We <Col N="957" /> understand the European Commission requires all members states to have individual farmers' milk supply tested.  It is extremely important we maintain our high standard because we cannot market dairy products to the highest standard unless we meet the exacting requirements at farm level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the change the Minister suggested the EU is likely to adopt, I understand it is only considering an amendment to the directive at present and that it will be some time before it will come into effect.  Our interpretation of the directive is at variance with that in other countries.  That must be the case if the EU intends to introduce an amendment to change the directive to meet the requirement of individual farmer testing at farm level.  Is there a danger that testing this year will have no statutory effect, that there will be no mandatory EU legal basis for individual sampling and that farmers could reject arrangements adopted and implemented because of a different interpretation in advance of an amendment to the directive?</P>

We have made a formal request to the Commission to make an allowance for the seasonality of our milk supply and we understand we will be allowed a concession in that regard, which will be helpful.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 13, 18, 20, 28, 33, 34, 37, 40, 44, 48, 51, 59, 63, 65 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>In deference to Deputy Carey, I will be economical with my reply on this occasion.  The amount of milk quota necessary for viability depends on the circumstances of a particular farm enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amazingly. I had expected such an answer.  When a farmer applies to the Milk Quota Review Group for quota from the national reserve, the Minister does not ask the number of beef heifers on the land, the number of acres under tillage and details of enterprises other than the dairy enterprise.  Consideration of the application for extra quota is based on the viability of that dairy enterprise alone.  There is an official figure stating that a farmer has a viable or a non-viable quota.  A milk operation is a stand alone business.  Would the Minister agree that no farmer can be expected to continue in milk production if he is to subsidise it from tillage, beef or any other enterprise?  What is the figure the Minister, the Department and the industry considers to be viable in terms of a dairy enterprise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is straightforward. If a farmer has other enterprises, the size of his quota will be a factor in maintaining a reasonable family farm income.  The size of the farm, other enterprises, whether the farmer has a sheep quota, or suckler cow quota, the cost efficiency of his operation and the extent of borrowing will be taken into account.  Since the quota system came into effect in 1983, we have geared restructuring and redistribution schemes towards the smaller farmer.  For example, in the most recent scheme in the order of six million gallons were redistributed and the cut-off point was 15,000 gallons. Viability depends on the type of farming carried on by a farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister considering a permanent regional milk quota restructuring scheme for small farmers, aided <Col N="962" /> by EU funding, to allow small milk producers, to expand within each region? Applications have been made through the Leader programme to rewrite some of the EU rules on restructing.  Would the Minister agree there is a case to be made for protecting quotas in certain areas to ensure the viability, particularly of smaller producers?  I thank the Minister for achieving 15,000 gallons.  If a farmer had no operation other than milk production, what quota would be considered viable?  Is it 25,000 gallons or 40,000 gallons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the question, I put a proposal to the European Commission to facilitate regionalisation of quotas, or at least the containment of the current level of production within regions.  I am criticised in the southern part of the country for seeking to ensure that farmers in disadvantaged areas are allowed to continue in milk production.  A number of co-operatives, particularly in the north-west, have set a headline by supporting smaller farmers who wish to acquire additional quota.  I hope European Union approval will be forthcoming for this scheme.  I expect that in the prices proposals in the next five or six weeks we will be able to achieve that.</P>
      <P>On the question of quota, some people can produce milk of 35p a gallon while for others it costs 75p a gallon.  The cost of production and other enterprises on a farm are taken into account when deciding on a quota.  It would be very much in the interests of all dairy farmers to get into the commercial sector in dairying which is as good as any sector in any country.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Minister spoke about his proposal to the EU on the regional allocation of milk quotas.  Will he confirm that the EU is considering the Leader application from my constituency for milk quotas?  Is he favourably considering this application?  In July 1993 the Minister <Col N="963" /> gave his imprimatur to the Fr. Harry Bohan proposal before a big audience in the West County Hotel in Ennis.  Will he confirm that he still interested in that proposal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I always seek to speak favourably about reports I am about to launch.  In the case of Fr. Harry Bohan's report, a very worthwhile study showed that not alone were the people in west Clare under pressure but were losing milk production capacity.  I recently launched a study in the Duhallow region of north-west Cork, where the experience in Clare was used, and it showed that if worthwhile measures are not taken in this area we are looking at the last generation of milk producers.  I asked the milk section in the Department to take that study into account in reviewing the redistribution and reallocation of quotas and particularly to financially help those who wish to seek additional quota.  I expect new measures to be implemented later this year.  Experience from the past ten or 12 years shows that there is a concentration of milk production rather than giving at least another generation of dairy farmers an opportunity to stay in business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy who represents a co-operative that has led the way in helping small farmers to buy quota, I believe the Minister should urgently seek EU agreement to subsidise the purchase of quota for smaller farmers. Will the Minister guarantee that he will put an end to the practice of transferring milk quotas through the sale of land and other quota transactions?  The <Col N="964" /> practice of allowing milk to go from the north and north-west through bogus means cannot continue.  The smaller farmer in the north and north-west cannot compete with the cheque book farmer in the south.  The Minister must give an assurance that smaller farmers in disadvantaged areas will be defended.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 67 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of farmers expected to avail of the farm retirement scheme over the next five years is estimated at 7,000. In co-operation with Teagasc, my Department held a series of nationwide information meetings, all of which were well attended.  A substantial number of inquires about the scheme were made at those meetings and by phone, written or personal contact to the Department's offices.  To date, first payments for pensions have been made to 30 applicants <Col N="965" /> While the processing for payment of a further 77 is at an advanced stage.  I expect the 1994 allocation of £7.5 million will be sufficient to meet expenditure under the scheme in the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In which areas are problems arising?  Are the conditions of eligibility of vendors for the farm retirement scheme the same as originally announced?  By what date must the purchaser have acquired at least 12 acres to farm in his own right to ensure that the vendor is eligible under the farm retirement scheme?  What are the rules relating to the 12 acre requirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The apparent slowness in take-up of the scheme is due to the legal considerations involved in transferring land.  In addition people may be waiting to avail of stamp duty relief announced in the budget.  I will communicate with Deputy Doyle on the questions she asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this scheme is to effect the transfer of land to younger farmers and I am disappointed that only 30 applications have been approved with 77 pending.  Is the Minister satisfied with the progress being made under this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to see things moving quickly.  However, in the circumstances, we are achieving the expected level of progress.  When all the conditions have been met payment will be made.  Stamp duty relief has a bearing on this.  There is also a long tradition of holding onto land here and we must get over that psychological hurdle.  I am confident of reaching the expected target of 1,500 applicants this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a substantial number of applications in Cavan-Monaghan where there is greater interest in this scheme than in other countries. However, information must be sought from Letterkenny, County Donegal.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy Leonard about the sufficiency of information.  An outline of the scheme was given at meetings held around the country.  There is a good amount of information available and I assure the Deputy that this will be kept up to date. However, the transfer of land is a legal matter and it was stongly emphasised that any such transfers should only be made following advice from the applicants legal adviser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised and disappointed at the small number of applications being processed.  While many people attended the public meetings mentioned by the Minister, it appears many more were interested.  Will the Minister accept that organisations like Teagasc are not prepared to give advice, that solicitors are not prepared to accept responsibility and that farmers are left in a difficulty and have to telephone Dublin or Letterkenny to get information?  They would prefer to talk with their Teagasc adviser on what they are entitled to and how to go about applying.  There is a lack of information.  Most of the farmers who have applied must have spoken to either Deputy Leonard or myself and we are under pressure.  This information should be supplied by experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>To date, 339 applications have been received.  For an application to be valid, the necessary legal documentation must accompany it.  Payment starts on receipt of a valid application which takes about six weeks to process. I opened one of the public meetings in my area and heard questions about many unusual situations.  Indeed, a type of &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; was held after the meeting which went on for some time.  However, in a transaction involving property or assets legal advice is most important.  The information <Col N="967" /> required by applicants is best obtained from a legal adviser.</P>

      <P>About 37,800 farmers, or 90 per cent of all annuitants benefited from the land annuities scheme either by buying out their annuities at a discount of 50 per cent, having their annuities written-off where they were less than £20 or having their annuities reduced to a 10 per cent rate where they exceeded this figure.</P>

      <Quest>if he will examine the case of a person (details supplied) in County Waterford who was unable to apply for sheep quota in 1992 because of illness; and if he will allow this person's family the quota which he was allocated in 1991.</Quest>

      <P>The EU regulations provide for ewe premium quotas to be based on the number of ewes on which a producer was paid premium in 1991 provided that the producer also applied for premium in 1992.</P>
      <P>The late person named had no quota entitlement because no application for ewe premium was made in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU regulations also provide for the establishment of a national reserve for allocation to certain categories of producers. The spouse of the late person named applied for an allocation of quota from the reserve and was granted 14 premium rights based on the number of ewes on which she applied for premium in 1993.  Successful applicants for reserve quota were limited to the number of ewes on which they applied for premium in 1993 because, under EU regulations, a <Col N="968" /> producer who obtained premium rights free of charge from the national reserve is required to use all of his or her premium rights during the three following marketing years.  My Department has no record of having received an application for ewe premium in 1994 from the spouse of the late person named.</P>

      <P>This is a classic case of red tape going berserk.  Is the Minister aware that the man in question had a terminal illness and was extremely ill throughout 1992 until his death in May of that year? How can the Minister expect a man who was so ill to apply for this sheep quota? He applied for and was allocated a quota in 1991, when his health was reasonably good.  The family are not asking for the 1992 quota or any major concessions; they are requesting the granting of the 1991 quota on compassionate grounds and I cannot understand why this cannot be allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently announced the following measures to help alleviate the difficulties which pig producers have been experiencing due to oversupply of pigs in the EU: Teagasc will be given additional staff to launch an enhanced programme of advice for pig producers to assist them in achieving significant cost reductions within a short time frame; CBF has been given additional resources to intensify its pigmeat promotion programme; the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is studying how competitive disadvantages in feed costs between Irish pig producers and pig producers in other member states can be overcome, and pig processors have been requested to pursue every possible means of assisting pig producers in the interests of protecting past investment in the industry and of ensuring adequate supplies of pigs in the future.  The processors have undertaken to give this request sympathetic consideration.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, I will continue to monitor the market closely and I will, as in the past, raise at EU level the need for further action.  I have done this at each Council meeting for the past seven or eight months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister's list, the one of most concern to the pig producers is the possibility of feed equalisation grants.  Will the Minister expand on his view of introducing feed equalisation grants given that on mainland Europe they have a £21 per tonne advantage on compound costs for the pig industry which translates into a £6 per pig disadvantage here for our pig producers operating at very high efficiency levels? All we are asking for is a level playing field within the EU and I ask the Minister to indicate immediately when he will introduce feed equalisation grants and how they will be structured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that feed equalisation costs is the single most important matter and the measures which I <Col N="970" /> announced are short term to assist in the marketing and promotion of pigmeat.  I am studying this matter in conjunction with the farming organisation and in particular the pigmeat representatives.  We need EU approval for the scheme and I am putting intense pressure on the Council of Ministers to get that because in the longer term the Irish pig industry cannot complete at that disadvantage with countries in mainland Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reply but on 24 March last he assured me that he would be taking steps in the early days of the following week to reach an agreement with the farming organisations on the introduction of a package to save the pig industry.  There has been much discussion since that time but pig producers are anxious to know the Minister's intentions.  They have been waiting almost two years and cannot wait forever.  They are not making a profit and swift action is required.  Putting the blame on the EU will not keep these producers in business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Farming organisations and the Department have agreed a package of measures to promote and help in the marketing of pigmeat which will be of some assistance to the industry.  We must get EU approval for feed equalisation, otherwise it would be contrary to its regulations.  I raised this matter at every single Council meeting for the past number of months and present indications are that it will be treated sympathetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

It is difficult to understand how there can be such a variation between transportation costs here and in England. Many reasons have been put forward for this variation which do not stand up.

      <P>I can confirm that we have studied this matter in depth.  It was expected that feed prices and cereal prices in particular would come down with the introduction of CAP reform and the substantial area aid payments but they have remained relatively high. Cereal farmers want to retain their level of income and it is not easy to satisfy the requirements of cereal farmers and pig producers at the same time.</P>

      <P>The rural environment protection scheme (REPS), which was formally approved by the European Commission on 29 April, will commence shortly. Details of the scheme, including application forms and a list of planning agencies approved to draw up the required agri-environment plans for farmers under the scheme, will be available from the Department's farm development service offices at that time.</P>
      <P>The value of the scheme up to 1997 is estimated to be nearly £230 million with further expenditure after that date.  It is estimated that about 40,000 farmers will participate in the scheme over the next five years.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme a number of supplementary measures allow for payments additional to the basic REPS premium to be made to farmers for the protection of natural heritage areas, rejuvenating degraded areas or allowing public access for leisure activities.</P>
      <P>Sheep farmers could also recieve payment to allow mountain grazing land to be used as game bird sanctuaries under one or other of these supplementary measures.</P>

I do not know if the Minister is aware that in the last century some mountainous areas were alive with wildlife and game birds but these areas are now denuded of any form of wildlife.  A major incentive needs to be given to sheep farmers so that pheasants, grouse, woodcocks, partridges, peacocks and snipe will return.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister undertake a major programme, in conjunction with the Minister for Tourism, to ensure that mountain ranges are a sanctuary for wildlife?  We have been overzealous in the production of sheep to the detriment of wildlife and the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important scheme and is an accompanying measure in the CAP reform.  There has been a serious decline in the numbers of wildlife and I am concerned about overgrazing. It is a feature of the scheme that grant assistance will be made available to farmers to ensure adequate housing for livestock, including sheep, and stop mountain grazing at certain times.  Overall £230 million will be provided for rural areas and the protection and enhancement of scenic areas.  Farmers will be encouraged financially.  I expect great things from the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's policy?  It is one thing to have an EU scheme in place and another for the Department to have a clear policy with well defined targets.  Will he set targets to reduce overgrazing over a certain period of time?  It is not good enough to hope there will be a response from farmers.  We know how difficult it is for schemes, such as the farm retirement scheme, to produce the required benefit. Who determines sheep grazing policy in mountain ranges which are national parks?  Is it the Department of Agriculture or the Office of Public Works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantial sum, £230 million, will be provided over the next few years.  It will be a matter for farmers to apply for grant aid under the scheme. In many areas farmers will not have to do anything more than at present.  It will encourage farming practices which will allow wildlife and rural life continue without scarring the countryside or overgrazing. The Minister of State, Deputy Hyland, will announce details of the scheme shortly.</P>

I agree that we must keep our lands as open as possible so that people can use and enjoy our beautiful country side.  One problem is occupier's liability.  How can, any application under the programme be considered without changing the law on occupier's liability if one of the conditions is public access for leisure?

      <P>It would not be practical to recite here the details of every project supported under the Leader programme.  As the central feature of the programme is that the decisions on projects to be aided are taken by the Leader groups themselves, complete information on such projects lies with the groups.</P>
      <P>The groups have stated that they expect that up to 2,200 jobs in all will be generated by Leader I.  The final report of the independent consultants evaluating the programme is due shortly in which I expect the issue of the job-creating impact of Leader will be addressed.</P>
      <P>The European Commission published the draft guidelines for Leader II in March but the programme is not expected to be adopted formally until about mid June.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to figures compiled by CBF which show that beef factory export steer kills for the first ten weeks of 1994 were down 32 per cent on the same period in 1993; in view of comments from the Chief Executives of Kerry Co-op that some plants may have to import British beef to fill Irish contracts, the steps, if any, he intends to take to ensure a guaranteed supply of beef for the plants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that steer slaughterings in the first ten weeks of this year were substantially lower than in the corresponding period in 1993.  However, steer slaughterings have recovered well and were 5 per cent higher in April this year than in the same months in 1993. Slaughterings of cows and heifers have been at slightly higher levels so far this year than in 1993 and total cattle slaughterings for the first four months of the year were less than 6 per cent below the corresponding figure for 1993.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that EU law does not permit me to adopt any measures to ensure a guaranteed supply of cattle to beef plants.  However, the recent reduction in export refunds on live cattle should enable the meat plants to compete more effectively for the available cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the managing director of the Kerry Group that European Union and Government policy on live exports is destroying the Irish beef industry?  Will he also agree that doubling live exports &mdash; a major problem which has not been resolved &mdash; has been disastrous in terms of the provision of cattle for meat processing plants?  Having regard to its effect and the risk it poses to the jobs of workers in meat plants, will the Minister pursue this matter at European Union level? The increase in live exports has been identified as a major factor in undermining <Col N="979" /> the meat processing industry, at a time when the Minister is proposing to set up An Bord Bia.  Will the Minister address this problem instead of pursuing the open-ended arrangement that somehow it will be all right on the night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the phrase &ldquo;it will be all right on the night&rdquo; means in this instance.  A total of 370,000 head of live cattle approximately 1,000 per day were exported last year which caused some difficulty for meat plants. I believe this difficulty has been resolved by the levelling of the playing pitch in terms of export refunds and the ending of the slaughter premium arrangement. It is clear Government policy that there should be competition in the cattle trade. There should be some live exports and the processing industry in particular should be given an opportunity to increase added value, thus supporting jobs and ensuring a return for the major investment in modernising the processing industry during the past four or five years. The processing industry is state of the art and I intend to ensure that there is an adequate level of supply to meat plants.</P>
      <P>Live shippers have been able to get better prices in some markets than the meat trade, and it would, therefore, be equally unfair to penalise good marketers in an effort to help companies or organisations which are not as good at getting export markets.  I am seriously considering this matter to ensure that we have a viable and dynamic processing industry in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that the present retention period rules contribute to the problem of marketing cattle and our meat factories obtaining adequate supplies, in addition to the fact that the payment last year of the winter beef slaughter premium was so delayed many farmers opted for disposal of their cattle this year?  Those are two additional factors on which I would like the Minister to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The two-month retention <Col N="980" /> period was a problem in ensuring continuity of supply to meat plants.  This year we intend to have more regular application periods to overcome that problem.  Last year the problem was caused in the main by buoyant markets for the live trade when live shippers sought and obtained very good markets, with very good returns to farmers.  We are insisting on jobs within the processing industry, along with added value.  The good work being done by CBF in getting major markets on the European mainland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these four Private Notice Questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to offer most sincere sympathies on my behalf and on behalf of the Government to the family of Ms Riney on the tragic loss of Imelda and her son Liam, and to the family, fellow priests and to the Bishop of Clonfert, Dr. Kirby, on the tragic death of Fr. Joe Walsh following the extraordinary and horrific events of the past week in Clare and South Galway.  It is a loss that has touched everyone in the country, as we were drawn together in a communal spirit of hope and prayer that they would be found alive, despite the growing fears.  Sadly, it was not to be.  Instead we are left with the deep shock and immense difficulty of <Col N="982" /> making sense out of an awful and bizarre tragedy.</P>
    <P>In the course of my statement I will be giving the House an account of the facts in my possession concerning the deaths which are the subject of these Private Notice Questions.  Before I do this, I want to say something concerning the manner in which these events are portrayed publicly &mdash; by the media, in various statements that have been made by members of the public and so on.</P>
    <P>I have already called for restraint all round in relation to the presentation of these events.  For the avoidance of any doubt on the matter, I want to make it absolutely clear that, in calling for restraint, neither I nor the Government is suggesting that the media or anybody else must somehow be muzzled.  It is a fact, as I witnessed for myself last night when the remains of Father Joe Walsh were brought to the church in Eyrecourt, that the public at large have been shocked by these appalling events, that people are grieving on a scale rarely seen and that there is a sense of helplessness, a feeling of inability to comprehend or cope with the awfulness of what happened in Clare over the past week or so.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly understandable that commentators and the media should reflect this.  However, there is the very real danger that in the midst of all that is said, comments will emerge and opinions will be publicly expressed which could have a result that would be the exact opposite to what everybody here and all good people outside this House would want, and that is that a person would be made amenable for these crimes.</P>
    <P>Our courts, very rightly, set a high standard when it comes to deciding what does or does not constitute fair procedures. We have ample evidence that the courts here &mdash; and indeed in other Jurisdictions also &mdash; will attach considerable weight to a defence based on the proposition that the prospect of a fair trial has been jeopardised by publicity occuring at the time of the events leading to a prosecution.  It is on this ground alone that I considered it my responsibility to call for restraint.  I do so again <Col N="983" /> so that Deputies will be aware of my concern and of my precise reason for concern on that score.</P>
    <P>The point I have just made is highly relevant when it comes to providing the House with a chronology of events. Deputy Gay Mitchell has requested that I make a statement on the events leading up to the murders.  I am sure he and everybody else in this House will understand that if I, as Minister for Justice, mention certain events of which I am aware and of which others are no doubt aware also, which have to do with the movement or behaviour of any identifiable person, there is the grave risk that this would be seen as coming very close to authoritative confirmation that that person's guilt or involvement in the deaths is already an established fact.  No such fact is established at this time, no charges have been brought against any person but, as everybody knows, a full Garda investigation is under way.</P>
    <P>Turning to the chronology of the events themselves, what I have at this time is a preliminary report from the Garda Commissioner, whom I have also met to discuss the matter.  The information I am now giving the House is based on the Commissioner's report.</P>
    <P>At about 12.30 p.m. on Friday, 29 April the late Ms Imelda Riney was seen driving her car approximately one mile from her home at Whitegate, along the Whitegate-Woodford Road.  She had a passenger in the car.  This sighting by a witness was reported to the Garda some four days later on Tuesday, 3 May.</P>
    <P>At about 4.24 p.m. on Saturday, 30 April a report was received at Loughrea Garda Station that a car was on fire some miles into a forest.  The Garda discovered the car that same day.  It was completely destroyed and had no number plates.  The chassis number was, in the words of the Garda report, &ldquo;very difficult to bring up&rdquo; which delayed identification of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>On the same Saturday a person near Eyrecourt found a front number plate and bumper of a car in a gateway leading to a field.  The number plate was from Ms <Col N="984" /> Riney's missing car.  This discovery was reported to the Garda some six days later on the afternoon of the following Friday, this is 6 May.</P>
    <P>At about 11.00 a.m. on Sunday, I may the late Ms Riney's husband, Val Ballance, reported his wife's absence to the Garda in Scarriff.  He agreed, following discussion with the Garda, to contact friends and associates in the hope that she had stayed with them.</P>
    <P>At 3.00 p.m. on Monday, 2 May Mr. Ballance reported at Mountshannon Garda Station that he had not succeeded, since his previous visit to the Garda, in locating his wife and three-year-old son. He also reported that his wife's car was missing.</P>
    <P>Shortly after 10.00 p.m. on the same day details of the missing persons and car were circulated to all stations from the communications room at Ennis Garda Station.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 4 May the car which had been found burnt near Loughrea on 30 April was formally identified as that of Ms Riney.</P>
    <P>At about 7.30 p.m. on Thursday, 5 May the late Fr. Joe Walsh was reported missing to the Garda by Fr. Glynn P.P., at Eyrecourt.  The information was that he was last seen at about 11.55 p.m. on 3 May.</P>
    <P>At about 11.14 p.m. on Thursday night, a report to the effect that Fr. Walsh was missing circulated to all stations from Galway Garda communications room.</P>
    <P>At about 1.00 a.m. on Friday morning, 6 May, Fr. Walsh's car was found burning at Williamstown Harbour, Whitegate, by a local person.  The Garda were called and identified the car.</P>
    <P>At about 7.45 p.m. on Saturday, 7 May a body was discovered by a forester in the woods at Cregg Wood, Whitegate. The gardaí were notified and the body was later identified as that of Fr. Walsh.</P>
    <P>Finally, and very sadly, at about 12.05 p.m. on Sunday, 8 May the bodies of a woman and child were found in Cregg Wood, Whitegate, by a team of searchers headed by a garda, in the vicinity of the area where Fr. Walsh's body had been found.  The bodies were later identified <Col N="985" /> as those of Imelda Riney and her son Liam.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that various aspects of the Garda handling of this case have been the subject of unfavourable comment and I have already indicated publicly that the fact that criticisms have been made is the subject of concern to me.</P>
    <P>On this issue there is need for care and for fair procedures.  It is standard practice for the Garda, following major events of this kind, to investigate the procedures followed and the handling of the case and, where lessons are learned, to take the appropriate action.  This will happen on this occasion also and I will receive a full report on the outcome.  At that time I will make an assessment as to what further action may be required and I will make my conclusions on that issue known to this House.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should of course explain that the investigation of the general handling of the case by the gardaí will not commence immediately.  The immediate task of the gardaí at this point is to complete their investigation of the case in hand and endeavour to bring a person to justice. Nothing can be allowed to get in the way of that task and I am sure everybody here will wish to see the task successfully concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to put questions on this important matter without your assistance.  Will the Minister say if any suspect in these matters was interviewed by the gardaí before the abductions and murders and was that suspect arrested?  Was a report compiled by three Assistant Garda Commissioners following the O'Grady kidnapping?  If so, did they make recommendations to be implemented in the event of future abductions and were those recommendations swiftly put into action in this case?  Why do rural communities have to depend on speaking into green boxes while the Garda force is 500 persons under strength?  Will she agree that gardaí on the beat are far better for intelligence gathering and would, in cases like this, be of inestimable value?  Will the Garda reply to the criticism which has been levelled at them, particularly by the local community?  Will any person be charged as an accessory in these cases and what other investigations has the Minister in mind in relation to these murders?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the final part of the Deputy's supplementary asking whether any person will be charged as an accessory, obviously Deputy Mitchell will appreciate that, as the investigation is ongoing, it is not possible for me or any member of the Garda Síochána to indicate either a positive or a negative answer.  The question as to <Col N="987" /> whether the Garda will reply to criticism, is a matter for the Garda themselves. When there are tragic and horrific events, as we witnessed during the past week, there is normally an immediate investigation by the Garda Commissioner.  I have a preliminary report on the events relating to the last number of days.  The Commissioner is compiling his final report and until that is available I will not be in a position to give further information.</P>
      <P>The rural community policing policy was introduced in September 1991 the basis of which was to get gardaí out of Garda stations where they answered the telephone and so on into the community, mixing with members of the community and getting to know them.  Since the scheme was set up two reviews have taken place and my understanding from the Garda authorities is that both were positive.</P>
      <P>A false impression was given inadvertently by a broadcaster on a television programme last night.  It was indicated that when a person calls to a Garda station involved in rural policing, after closing hours, and speaks to the green man, their message is being recorded. That is not the case, they are speaking to headquarters and to a garda at the other end of the line.</P>
      <P>An investigation was carried out on the procedures following the O'Grady kidnapping.  The recommendations, following that investigation, were made by a Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and my information is that they were implemented.</P>
      <P>I did not quite understand the Deputy's first supplementary in which he asked whether any suspect was interviewed before the murders were committed.  Is the Deputy taking about somebody who may be a suspect now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Mitchell in expressing my concern about that because this is a very serious matter and one of major public concern.  It is inappropriate to restrict Members of the House to one round of supplementaries on this important matter and I ask you to review your opinion on that.  Can the Minister give any explanation, given the sophisticated modern telecommunications technology now available, as to why there were delays between the location of a car near Loughrea, a report of a missing person in Eyrecourt, the discovery of a mudguard elsewhere and putting this information together?  Has she made specific inquiries to the Garda authorities concerning the delays? Second, since the Minister said she would be reporting to the House following completion of her investigations, is it her intention to publish any report which is made available to her arising from those investigations?  Third, what reassurance can the Minister give to people living in isolated rural areas, many of whom are now terrified &mdash; and feel vulnerable &mdash; as a result of the events of the past week because of lack of policing?  Does she accept there is no substitute for having police in local areas who are visible, familiar with what is happening, know the movements of various people and who can anticipate and, perhaps, prevent this type of crime from occurring in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is no substitute for visibility of police. Since I became Minister for Justice I have been saying that and it applies to rural as well as urban areas.  The basis for introducing the community policing policy in 1991 was to make the police more visible within the communities than they had been heretofore.  At that time <Col N="989" /> the Garda authorities felt that too much Garda time was spent manning a Garda station when his or her time could be better spent, on behalf of the community, out among the community, involving themselves in local community activities, getting to know the people, gathering information and getting to know the movements of people, locals or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I am not ruling out the publication of any report which I may get.  I would have to consider whether information in it would prejudice any ongoing investigation at the time.  I have made a commitment to report to this House as soon as I have a full report in relation to all these matters.  I cannot explain the delays between finding the burnt out car and the number plates and bumper of the car by a local person.  It would appear that local person was not aware that a car with that number plate was missing.  If the person had been aware I am sure the number plates would have been taken immediately to the local Garda station where the incident room had been set up.</P>
      <P>I think all aspects of the Garda handling of the case are matters that the Garda Commissioner has to investigate in the first instance.  Based on the results of his investigation I have to make a decision on where we go from there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her response and for her briefing earlier of the Members who tabled questions on the matter.  Would she agree that we should all focus on the prospect of a successful prosecution and that the wider policy issues already mentioned today can wait at least two or three weeks until there is further progress in the pre-trial stage?  Does she further agree that adverse prejudicial pre-trial publicity is a very real danger and that she was correct when she emphasised the need for caution? Bearing that in mind, I will confine my question to a technical point of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will she confirm whether a person charged and remanded in custody in respect of one incident can be arrested and detained for further questioning under section 30 of the Offences Against <Col N="990" /> the State Act, 1939, in respect of another incident, or whether being on remand in custody on one charge under the Offences Against The State Act, 1939, makes one immune from interrogation in respect of any other suspected crime?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My priority, and I am sure that of everybody in this House and outside, is that the Garda make a successful prosecution.  Any other investigation which the Garda Commissioner needs to conduct will have to await the successful prosecution.  I welcome the support of Deputies Mitchell, Gilmore and O'Donnell for that procedure.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether a person on remand in custody can be charged with another offence, my information is that &mdash; and please do not ask me to put my hand on the Bible and say it is correct &mdash; this could be done; obviously I will check the matter further and come back to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I may have misled Deputy Mitchell when I responded to his question on whether any suspect had been interviewed before the murders.  Neither I nor the Garda could say whether any suspect was interviewed because we do not know who the suspect might be or if somebody were to be charged we do not know at this stage who that person might be.  I could not, therefore, put my hand on my heart and say that somebody who might well be charged might not have been interviewed by the Garda some time in the past.</P>

      <P>We all look on this as a national tragedy.  I come from Golden, the home of Fr. Joseph Walsh, and as a relative I have experienced the family's devastation and the grief and sadness of the local community.  The question we ask is whether one, if not all, the tragedies could have been avoided. Having listened to the Minister's report, a crucial element was the delay by the public in reporting matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was no public appeal made on radio or television alerting the people to inform the Garda of sightings or unusual <Col N="991" /> activities immediately the Garda were informed of Ms Riney and her son's absence?  Who co-ordinated the immediate investigation after Ms Riney and her son's absence was reported to the Garda? There is an urgent need for a report on the tragedies which may offer some consolation to the members of the families concerned.</P>

      <P>As of now I cannot give a definitive answer for the delay in reporting the incidents and the reasons for the Garda not making a public appeal as I am awaiting, as is the Commissioner, a report from the local divisional officers concerned.</P>
      <P>Rev. Fr. Glynn, the parish priest at Eyrecourt, notified the Garda on Thursday evening that Fr. Joseph Walsh, his curate, was missing and until that time the investigation was being handled by the Garda divisional headquarters in County Clare.  As Eyrecourt is in the Galway west divisional headquarters area, the Galway west divisional officer became involved and because there were two divisions then involved in the investigation, Chief Superindendent Jim McHugh was drafted in from Tipperary to oversee all the investigations and direct inquiries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>May I on behalf of the Fine Gael Party join with the Minister in extending the sympathy of all Members of the House <Col N="992" /> to both families and colleagues of all concerned. The Minister did not respond when I asked what other investigations or inquiries will be made in this matter. I understand the report of the Garda Commissioner was discussed at Cabinet this morning.  Would she indicate if she has given the House all the facts?  Why did it take five days to identify Miss Riney's car?  Was any effort made on local radio, for example, to alert people to the fact that the car was missing and to ask for information and assistance?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend reconstituting the murder squad, would the involvement of such a squad in an investigation of this type have been more efficient?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last question first.  To reconstitute the murder squad would primarily be an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  In advance of his full investigation into the facts surrounding this case, it would be too early to give a commitment on structural changes.  On the question of the delay in identifying Ms Riney's car, I said that when the car was found in a completely burned out state it was very hard &mdash; to use the words of the Garda report &mdash;&ldquo;to bring up the chassis number&rdquo; and the person who had found the registration number did not think it urgent enough, because of the lack of publicity surrounding it, to bring it to the attention of the Garda.  If that had been done perhaps things might have moved more quickly.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I received a preliminary report from the Commissioner and it was discussed at Cabinet this morning.  I have not given the House all the facts, as Deputy Mitchell knows; I have given information to the Cabinet and to Deputies Gay Mitchell, O'Donnell, Theresa Ahearn and Gilmore which I am not in a position, because of the ongoing inquiries into this case, to make public because, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said, and I agree with him, they could be prejudicial to a successful prosecution.  I regret very much that I cannot give some of the report which I gave to the Deputies.</P>

      <P>My question refers to the co-operation, or lack of it, between the Garda and local people.  Will the Minister comment on reports that the efforts of local people to get involved in the search for the missing people, in particular their attempts to identify, as it turns out correctly, the location where the missing persons might be found, were repudiated by the Garda?

      <P>In my discussions with the Garda Commissioner today I raised all aspects of concern to Members and particularly to people living in the Eyrecourt, Mountshannon, Scarriff and Whitegate areas of County Clare.  I would be concerned if it is proved that there was a lack of co-operation in relation to any aspect of this case between the Garda and local people given that the Garda depend to a large extent on and need the support of the local community. It has in the past and will continue in the future to look for the support of the community in carrying out investigations into crime.  I raised this aspect with the Garda Commissioner and it will form part of his report to me.</P>

Would such a person be immune from interrogation in respect of another crime?  Will the Minister give us a guarantee that when the time is right a full inquiry will be carried out into the procedures <Col N="994" /> followed in the investigation from the earliest to the final stages?</P>

The primary objective is to secure a successful prosecution and to ensure that the Garda Commissioner will complete his investigation as quickly as is feasible.  Following receipt of his report I will make a decision as to what further action I need to take.</P>

At the beginning there was some doubt as to whether the late Imelda Riney was missing or had gone to visit relatives or friends.  It was some days before her husband, Val Balance, reported that she and his son were missing.  This, however, does not answer the questions that the Deputy, all other Members and the public are asking and for which the Garda Commissioner will have answers for me.</P>

In the Taoiseach's predecessor's programme agreed with the Progressive Democrats in 1989 the Government promised to introduce legislation to clarify <Col N="1085" /> the law on criminal insanity and fitness to plead.  This was also promised by the previous Minister for Justice on 7 May 1992 and 14 October 1992 and by the present Minister for Justice on 11 March 1993 and 8 February 1994.  The Government has been criticised by judges of the Supreme Court for its failure to produce this legislation to modernise and clarify the law in this important area.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Protection of Animals Act, 1911 (Section 1) (Variation of Fines) Regulations, 1994, <Col N="1088" /> copies of which Regulations in draft were laid before Dáil Éireann on 6th April, 1994.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of publicity in recent times about cruelty to animals and I find it perturbing.  In recent months particularly, I have been extremely concerned about reports of serious abuse and ill-treatment of animals.  Such practices as badger baiting, or the &ldquo;blooding&rdquo; of greyhounds with hares, rabbits or any other such defenceless animals, have no place in civilised society.  As I have previously made clear, I totally condemn such activities and would encourage anyone with any evidence of such practices to report the matter to the Garda.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the Garda Síochána is responsible for the enforcement of the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, which govern the welfare of all animals, domestic or wild.  This legislation makes provision for fines and prison sentences on conviction of cruelty. The court is also empowered to deprive an owner who has been convicted of cruelty of any animal in relation to which the offence was committed.  My Department works and will continue to work with the Garda authorities in dealing with offences of this nature.  There is a good working relationship between the Garda and the Department staff involved.</P>
    <P>The subject of hare coursing has generated considerable debate in the past year or so.  This arose from the ineluctable fact that certain elements of coursing were unacceptable and that reforms were needed.  Following detailed consideration of the issues the Government decided that coursing should not be banned but that much tighter controls should be introduced to eliminate the &ldquo;kill&rdquo; which was seen as the most unacceptable aspect of the sport.  Last December the Greyhound Industry (Amendment) Act, 1993 was passed into law.  This includes a provision enabling the Minister to make regulations requiring the muzzling of greyhounds at coursing and the veterinary supervision of hares.  The monitoring committee which I established last year is in the process of <Col N="1089" /> reviewing developments to date and I will consider whether regulations are needed when the review is completed.  The measures I referred to have already been implemented by the Irish Coursing Club on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>It is an offence under the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, to cause cruelty, or for the owner to permit cruelty to be caused to any animal, domestic or wild.  Persons guilty of an offence of cruelty within the meaning of the Acts are liable on summary conviction in respect of a first or second offence to a fine not exceeding £500, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or both, and in respect of a third or subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding £500, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986 empowers the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to vary by regulations the maximum amount of the fine referred to above.  Where such regulations are proposed to be made, a draft of the regulations must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations must not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>In view of the recent serious incidents to which I have already referred, I am proposing to double the fine for the offence of cruelty to animals from £500 to £1,000.  The fine of £1,000 is the normal maximum for summary conviction and therefore is the highest figure that can be stipulated under this legislation.  The increase is deemed necessary in the light of recent media reports of serious abuse and ill-treatment of animals, including the &ldquo;blooding&rdquo; of greyhounds with live rabbits and other small animals, badger baiting etc.  These highly-publicised incidents have been widely condemned and have led to numerous calls for tougher measures against offenders.  The increase in the fine will act as a greater deterrent against this type of cruel activity.</P>
    <P>Following the highly publicised incidents early this year I acted swiftly and promised immediate changes in the fines for the offence of cruelty to animals. <Col N="1090" /> Today I am fulfilling that promise and it shows that I am prepared to make the maximum use of the powers available to me.  I emphasised at that time also that my position on blooding was clear &mdash; I condemned that activity and said that it had no place in the greyhound industry. I wish to reiterate this position now.  I know that it is shared on all sides of the House and that this motion will be welcomed and supported by all sides.</P>
    <P>The Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 was amended last year and more comprehensive amendments are planned. In this process it is my intention to examine the possibility of strengthening the powers of Bord na gCon to deal with anyone in the industry who is found to have carried out the practice of blooding.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this juncture to focus briefly on animal welfare in general. In recent years animal welfare has assumed a higher profile, not alone in this country but also at EU level where new rules on various aspects of animal protection have been introduced.  The increasing public concern about cruelty to animals is part of a general recognition of the need to adopt a sensitive and caring attitude to and treatment of the animal world.  There is a strong commitment to animal welfare in this country.  This is eloquently borne out by the fact that, in the design of schemes under the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-99</i> as mentioned in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> priority will be given to assisting farmers, particularly those in the lower income and resource categories, in complying with the new EU Directives on, <i>inter alia,</i> animal welfare.</P>
    <P>It also merits mention that Ireland along with other EU member states is party to Council of Europe Conventions on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes, on the slaughter of animals and on the transport of animals. Arising from the conventions, the EU Commission has produced a number of proposals some of which are now the subject of EU Directives on animal welfare. Additionally, there are two further Council of Europe Conventions which my Department is examining with a view <Col N="1091" /> to Ireland's accession to them, namely, the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Pet Animals and the Protocol of Amendment to the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes. It is hoped to take decisions on their signature and ratification after full consideration of all the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Recent incidents have shown that animal cruelty can occur and it is essential that appropriate penalties for acts of cruelty be in place.  I believe the majority of people agree with this approach and am confident that the House will be of like mind and will approve the draft regulations now before it.</P>

      <P>It is normal practice for Ministers to circulate their scripts.  The Minister assured us he would circulate it but it is regrettable that I had not seen it before I made my contribution.  I support the purpose for which we are here this afternoon, namely, to increase the fines under the regulations procedure of the 1911 Act as amended by the 1965 Act.  I am delighted that a higher profile is being given to animal welfare in many arenas, not least to domestic animals.  I welcome the increased consideration for farmed animals to bring the position into line with the general concern for domestic and wild animals in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to five different groups and to express my concern about a relatively new development, the increasing cruelty perceived on the farm because of overstocking, perhaps encouraged by EU premiums and subsidies.  I am particularly concerned about cruelty cases concerning sheep and cattle because of the adverse weather conditions during the winter.  Apart from those which were out-wintered dying from natural causes because of the bad weather, thousands have died because of lack of fodder and proper welfare consideration.  There is concern about the encouragement to keep more stock than perhaps a farmer can handle in terms of good husbandry because of the establishment of quotas and the need to keep quota numbers up <Col N="1092" /> to draw down premiums for X number of animals.  That has contributed to a serious deterioration in the welfare of animals in some areas.  The Minister should indicate what plans the Government has to ensure that benefit or compensatory payments from Europe will not be paid to farmers at the expense of a decline in the standard of animal welfare.  That has been a serious problem in certain counties.</P>
    <P>In regard to many of the cases publicised, many of the farmers were not mentally or physically able to look after the animals properly.  Many were aged and not able to cope with the bad winter, herd their animals properly and bring sufficient fodder to them and others, for different reasons, were not able to cope with the problems they faced.  The public and natural justice demand that people who have a responsibility to look after domestic, farmyard or exotic animals should be licensed to do so, including those who intend to farm livestock.  The issuing of a herd or flock number should indicate that a farmer is mentally and physically suitable to farm livestock.  The licensing system in terms of farmyard animals could be made through the system of allocating herd or flock numbers.  Many farmers who, through no fault of their own because of mental or physical deterioration, cannot look after animals should not have them.  We must be strict about this and I would like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>There have been ongoing difficulties for many years in different areas in respect of horses.  Live export of horses was a contentious matter in the 1950s and 1960s and legislation was introduced to curb and control the position.  It was never fully implemented as it was legal to export horses to the UK, but live exports to the Continent were curbed. Given the EU Directive on equidae in transit, there are at least the structures of a system and regulations under which animals can be exported.  We should do everything to encourage the humane slaughter of animals at the point nearest production.  There should be facilities and commercial rewards should be available to those who must humanely <Col N="1093" /> slaughter animals.  All animals, including ourselves, come to the end of their useful life.  Instead of letting them starve in a field and die a slow death through neglect or old age and in pain, their humane slaughter, particularly those which have given an excellent service should be encouraged.  We should reconsider the financial viability of those who provide an abattoir or slaughter service and ensure it is commercially advantageous for those who wish to dispose of animals humanely in this country to do so and to ensure the issue of exporting does not arise.  Much work was done in this area by the former committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Economic Community who compiled report No. 5 on the inter-Community trade in equidae and the general protection of animals during transport.  I commend the committee on its detailed investigation and the submissions it took from a broad variety of views in compiling that report.</P>
    <P>The urban horse is a particular problem and has been referred to several times.  The DSPCA produced a Bill, introduced by Deputy De Rossa, before a general election.  I do not agree fully with the detail of the Bill but I support its broad statement that urgent action is needed to deal with the problem of the urban horse and its abuse.  This problem is not confined to Dublin, some of the other big cities have similar difficulties. It is not acceptable that ten year olds can purchase a two year old, unbroken horse for which they have neither adequate housing nor feed at Smithfield market &mdash; held monthly &mdash; and ride off into the night.  The best chance that horse has will be the long mile if there is a good grass lawn in the middle of a housing estate. Those horses are kept in back gardens and kitchens.  Last week a donkey, purchased in Smithfield, brought in the lift up a high rise flat in Dublin and deposited on the balcony was rescued.  We know the dimensions of such a balcony but a donkey was expected to survive.  Immediate regulation is required to deal with the mistreatment, downright cruelty and neglect of the urban horse, particularly the indiscriminate sale of horses to <Col N="1094" /> people who are patently not qualified to care for them.  The Minister should indicate what plans the Government has to introduce some law and order in this area for the sake of the animals and of the human population in urban areas.  It has gone on for far too long, yet no effort is made to regulate it.  It could be controlled by way of a general licensing provision on the ownership of animals. Such a measure should be considered. Dogs must be licensed and there are strict regulations on owning dogs.  These regulations are not enforced very well, but in theory the State has made an effort to put some structure on the ownership of dogs.  However, people in high rise flats and estates around the city can do what they like with a horse or donkey and apparently the Garda are powerless to do much about this problem.  There are no structures under which it can be controlled.</P>
    <P>Since the demise of Bord na gCapall riding establishments have not been subject to any licensing structure.  Will the Minister outline his plans to resolve that matter?  Most riding establishments are extremely reputable and have very high standards of husbandry for the horses in their care.  They will not get custom unless their animals are properly cared for.  The public will not accept abuse of animals generally.  However, there are some riding establishments &mdash; the names may be provided to the Minister &mdash; where animals are in a poor state of health, are not fed or worm dosed and are not properly shod.  Those availing of the facilities in these establishments are allowed, without wearing a hard helmet, to take an animal onto the public road. Difficulties arise with public liability, occupier's liability and insurance generally. It amazes me that establishments are allowed to operate without regulation. Those who run reputable establishments would welcome a proper licensing system to deal with the few who are abusing animals and not looking after their welfare.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the question of what are called exotics.  Recent radio reports informed us of animals and a reptile <Col N="1095" /> being kept in a back garden in County Limerick.  These are bears, tigers and a cobra.  There are more restrictions on dogs in this country than on elephants, cheetahs and tigers.  In theory, I can bring an elephant home and put it in my garage, without requiring a licence, but if I do not muzzle my hound I can be prosecuted by the State.  It makes no sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>You would not know what the elephant would do.  There is much concern among the general public about this matter.  State regulation of this area is chaotic.  The Minister referred briefly to the three EU directives, but as I did not have his speech I could not note the directives to which he was referring.  I think one dealt with what I call exotics, for want of another name.  Will the Minister further explain what he plans to do to regulate exotic pets?  I am not saying they should be barred.  Many people are qualified to look after them, feed them and generally handle them, but the vast majority of the public are not so qualified. Exotic pets become a craze for a while, but when people become tired or afraid of them they release them.  Usually that means the misfortunate animals die because they were not bred to survive in our climate.  Apart from the abuse of the animal, this could result in a dangerous accident.</P>
      <P>A recent case in Dublin was brought to my attention where on the ground floor of a rather attractive pet shop all looked well, but when an electrician or plumber was called to a difficulty on the second and third floors he found rooms of dead and dying exotic birds.  Obviously they contracted a disease, the pet shop owner could not manage them and any bird that was not likely to survive was thrown into one of these rooms.  That matter is being investigated by the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  There is no law to allow access by inspectors to such a building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> The recent successful prosecutions for badger baiting are welcome.  We were all extremely disturbed by the portrayal in the media here and abroad of such barbarous behaviour, which still occurs.  The same applies to the blooding of greyhounds. I do not think that matter has taken its course through law, but I assume it will.  This area is a minefield. While the increase in fines is welcome, there are only a few Acts dealing with this area, the two Protection of Animals Acts, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1926, and the Control of Dogs Act.  Huge areas of animal welfare are not controlled by the State.  I would like to know the Minister's intentions in this regard and whether, by increasing fines, he believes he has done enough to protect animals from human beings who, through ignorance or malice, abuse them.</P>
    <P>I make a plea to the Minister on behalf of animal welfare societies who, through their own funds and voluntary fund raising, are carrying out what is the State's responsibility.  We welcome voluntary support of State activities, but when the State depends entirely on the voluntary sector we must question its negligence. The Irish Horse Protection League has done excellent work, as has the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and all other SPCAs.  I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in the financial crisis of the DSPCA &mdash; the details will be available through the Department.  In 1993 the income of that society was £79,000 and expenditure was £232,000, an operating loss of £153,000. This voluntary body, which looks after animal welfare on behalf of the 1.1 million citizens of Dublin city and county, receives no State aid.</P>
    <P>Section 33 of the Control of Dogs Act empowers the Minister for the Environment to make grants towards the expense of a local authority or any person concerned with the provision of homes or shelters for stray or unwanted dogs or with the welfare of dogs.  That is a specific area, but the society's brief extends far beyond dogs.  It was recently involved in a court case about excessive cruelty to mares and foals found starving during the <Col N="1097" /> winter.  We can all give examples of such incidents.  I ask the Minister to put pressure on the Minister for Finance and the Government to provide a once-off grant of £50,000 for the DSPCA to enable it to replace its ambulance, horse box and pick-up van for stray dogs and cats &mdash; there is a huge problem with feral cats and unwanted dogs in our big cities.  The Minister should provide £50,000 to replace the society's vehicles and to ensure the continuation of this voluntary organisation which does for our animals what the State should at least be helping it to do, if not doing so itself.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to provide for an annual subvention towards current running costs of the DSPCA in order to ensure its existence beyond the next two years.  If the society continues to incur operating costs of the level it incurred last year, it will last only two more years. We cannot do without the DSPCA and the societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the country.  Certainly the animals whose welfare they protect cannot do without them.  The provision of a once-off sum of £50,000 to replace worn out vehicles would ensure the DSPCA does not have to liquidate further assets, thereby jeopardising its long term existence.  It should receive an annual subvention to do the work for which many of us in this House would like the State to take some responsibility.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of a case we should all be ashamed of, an example of lack of regulation in this area.  In recent weeks a pick-up truck with a small trailer was discovered on board the ferry from Rosslare to Le Havre which contained 12 donkeys packed head to tail and in the truck itself there were three more donkeys. Ostensibly these animals were being exported as pets for children in Switzerland.  However, according to the welfare organisations who pursued them through France and into Germany, they ended up being slaughtered, and not humanely.  If we allow such animal abuse and lack control over what happens, we must seriously examine our structures. Raising the fines from £500 to £1,000 is not enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> All this short debate allows us to do is give the Minister an indication of how concerned some of us are about the lack of controls in our animal welfare legislation. I touched on a few areas but we could all give more examples.  Could we have a more comprehensive debate about this soon?  Will the Minister, when concluding, indicate the Government's plans to right the many wrongs and put in place the necessary legislation so that we can be proud of our statutory legislation on animal welfare?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my thanks to and admiration of the Minister for producing these regulations.  However, as the previous speaker said, there is a bigger problem facing us.  I too would like to see this matter addressed in a more organised fashion in the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a number of points of a general nature which, I hope, will put these regulations in context.  We cannot look on the entire sporting industry in isolation; we must view our traditional sports with a certain tolerance and understanding. We have a rich history of achievement in sport whether it be in the horse racing or greyhound racing arena and our reputation as a sporting nation is recognised worldwide.  Any new legislation or regulations which affect the horse and greyhound industries therefore, must be debated fully, openly and with honesty.  As legislators we must be conscious of different views and, although there are arguments both for and against change, we have the final say on the form of any future legislation.  In that context we must explore the wide range of regulations being advanced and take account of how any changes will affect the future prospects of our horse racing and dog racing industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of horse racing and greyhound racing is linked with the social development of our country.  Horse racing has often been described as the sport of kings, but Ireland is unique in that a love of the race track cuts right across a wide social spectrum resulting in a unique social cohesion which is beneficial for society as a whole.  On the other <Col N="1099" /> hand, greyhound racing has always been fully supported by the ordinary working man who saw it as both a sport and a social occasion where commerce and chance stood side by side in an atmosphere of excitement and drama.  The breeding of greyhounds and horses has become a highly profitable exercise with record sums being earned from the export of promising dogs and horses to countries where the reputation of Ireland as a sporting land is acknowledged.</P>
    <P>As with all other areas of human endeavour, there are traditions and accepted ways of doing things.  There is the natural law of the hunter and the hunted which has stood the test of time and is as much a part of the natural world as are the trees, the plants and the air we breathe.  Animal and man are close; their story is one of interdependence and mutual trust where horses shared the workload in years gone by and the dog was man's best friend.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot legislate for the dark side of human behaviour.  In these more enlightened days we seem to be regressing to a fearsome and frightening savagery, seemingly born out of the frustration inherent in modern living.  The more our society advances in terms of prosperity and technology the more we as humans seek to hark back to a medieval and barbaric cruelty.  We only have to look around us to see the signs of this frightening and disturbing social phenomenon &mdash; the distressing cases of child abuse, the rise in violent crime, the attacks on the elderly and the ill, the upsurge in crimes against women, the new threat of AIDS and the depressing acceptance of a drugs culture in some of our major urban centres.</P>
    <P>We can all point to causes and cures but there is no easy solution.  The same dilemma applies to our treatment of animals because, to an even greater degree, our dogs and horses suffer more, they are defenceless because of the lack of a social or moral code to rein in their abusers.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves why men display an appalling cruelty to animals.  It is no secret that in some urban areas animals <Col N="1100" /> are used as a means of making money through organised dog fights.  In any major town on a Sunday morning there is a dog fight going on at a secret location.  In rural areas it is no different; badger baiting events are organised. These fights are tightly organised with the utmost security to prevent the Garda or concerned citizens taking action.  The organisers of these barbaric exhibitions are men who have no morals and a history of being involved in what I will call shady activities.  Dog fighting or badger baiting are not easy to stamp out.  In other cultures animal fighting is accepted but here, with our concern for the welfare of animals, it is a cruel and demeaning activity arranged for profit and the perverted pleasure of twisted people.  I welcome tough legislation which will tackle such activities.</P>
    <P>There are other instances of abuse of innocent animals.  Every day horses and donkeys are terrified by a range of cruel activities, from competitive street racing to sulky driving in isolated areas.  We all know of cases of unfortunate animals being abused nearly to death so that the only option is for staff from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to put the abused animal down and end its misery and suffering.  That such dreadful abuse can exist alongside our concern and care for animals is astonishing.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the ISPCA whose officials and staff have done a magnificent job of education and promotion over the past few years to bring home the extent of animal abuse in our society.  However, I wish to outline the distinction between the dreadful and shocking abuse of animals which is planned and arranged by people for private gain and sporting activity which is one of our traditional cultural milestones.  As a sporting nation we have a natural understanding of the rules of nature.  We must differentiate between the rules of nature and the exploitation of nature.  Not for a minute would I tolerate cruel or savage treatment of defenceless animals.</P>
    <P>However, I acknowledge that in the greyhound industry there are times when the rules of the natural world take over. <Col N="1101" /> It should be noted that recent legislation passed by this House has improved hare coursing.  We must take on board the views of people in the industry and balance their deep concerns with the enlightened approach now demanded of legislators by the public.  No one in this House will stand over cruel treatment of animals.  However, we must remember that the greyhound industry is an important element of many local economies and rigid regulations imposed on the industry because of recent bad publicity may be an over-reaction on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is easy to highlight the negative aspects of an industry; the media are always anxious to make their so-called <i>exposés</i> as sensational as possible.  We must bear that in mind and not rush into making impossible demands on an industry with considerable potential.  Now is the time for rational debate, not headline grabbing.  We must debate these proposed regulations in a considered and serious manner to ensure that the rights of animals and the industry are protected.</P>
    <P>I have touched on the areas in which new legislation is sadly lacking, such as, arranged dog fights for private gain and the abuse of animals in street racing by gangs of youths.  The Minister knows that the law is lacking but he cannot act solely in the interests of one section; he must have an over-view of the whole.  That is what I have tried to provide.  I urge him to take account in his proposals of the views of the greyhound owners and breeders and acknowledge their deep concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>From what has been said so far in the debate &mdash; and there would appear to be agreement on this side of the House &mdash; it seem clear that what is required are not the minor regulations before us today but a complete updating of legislation for the protection of animals, <Col N="1102" /> much of which is totally outdated. Many instances have already been referred to, I do not intend to repeat them but I join Deputy Doyle in asking the Minister if he has any plans to update the legislation for the protection of animals and the timescale for this.  I intend to refer later to one specific case where this type of legislation is clearly required.  I support also Deputy Doyle's call for a grant of £50,000 for the DSPCA to provide for the necessary equipment to which she referred.  Perhaps the Minister could refer to this also in his reply.</P>
      <P>I also support Deputy Doyle's concern for exported live animals, horses or cattle, which travel long distances in horrific conditions.  If we do not take action on these issues, Europe will force and embarrass us into taking action.  I believe that is already happening.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to what the Minister said earlier about the sensitive and caring attitude which he is seeking.  A Government that legislates to terrorise a timid animal, the hare, for so-called sport cannot consider itself to be caring simply because it enacts legislation to eliminate the result of that sport, the kill, while allowing the extreme cruelty involved in terrorising an animal.  We cannot terrorise animals, under our legislation, unless we exempt specific instances.  The Dáil has exempted coursing.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that there is a strong commitment to animal welfare among the vast majority of people here. There is not, however, a strong commitment on the part of the Government to the welfare of animals and, unfortunately, a small minority of people, both urban and rural, treat animals with extreme cruelty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 12 January a programme was transmitted by the BBC depicting horrific scenes involving the use of live rabbits in the blooding of greyhounds.  On 18 January a programme on Channel 4 depicted sadistic scenes involving badgers which shocked most people here.  The Minister was perturbed by the publicity surrounding this programme; I am sure he meant to say that he was perturbed by <Col N="1103" /> the cruelty depicted in the programme, not the publicity.  On 19 January regulations were issued increasing the fines for such offences from £500 to £1,000. That is derisory, inadequate and pathetic in view of the cruelty involved and the highly organised manner in which such cruelty was carried out.  In one instance, huge profits were involved and in the other there was an example of what has become known as &ldquo;cruelty tourism&rdquo;, where people were invited here to engage in this activity.  Our good name was disgraced by the transmission of these television programmes.  Where was RTE when these activities were taking place?</P>
    <P>Those people involved in the blooding of greyhounds have not yet come before the courts, although I understand that seven people will be brought before the court in Cashel next week.  I trust that case will proceed more speedily than a similar case last year against one of our premier greyhound trainers which has not yet concluded.  For obvious reasons I do not intend to comment on either of the cases that have not yet come before the courts.  The blooding of greyhounds is widespread and I hope that those found guilty will be subjected to the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the badger baiting case because those involved have already been convicted.  The fines and penalties imposed were completely inadequate, and I refer specifically to the legislation before us today.  Having been convicted of a whole litany of crimes against badgers and a fox, a fine of £1,000, a suspended sentence and £939 in costs was the sum total of the penalties in that case.  Some of the people involved were English and it is instructive to consider what might have been the fate of those people under British law.  Under the UK Protection of Badgers Act, 1992, the maximum fine is £5,000 and-or six months imprisonment for each offence.  Digging for a badger, damaging a sett, causing a dog to enter a sett, disturbing a badger in its sett and injuring or killing a badger all carry a maximum fine of £5,000.</P>
    <P>The recent case involving Mr. Thomas <Col N="1104" /> Parr related to four separate badger baiting digs.  If the time was available to me I would quote from <i>The Leinster Express</i>, which gave a detailed account of each of the expeditions to the sets where horrific cruelty and sadistic brutality was inflicted on defenceless animals, including a fox, which has little or no protection here. Reading that article one could count a minimum of 12 separate offences committed in the digging of four separate badger sets of which this individual was convicted.  If he had come before a British court, a total fine of approximately £50,000 might have been imposed for all the offences in which he was involved, in addition to six months imprisonment.  I am grateful to the British League Against Cruel Sports for that information and analysis of the legislation enforced in Britain, which is having an effect there.</P>
    <P>This case involved a highly organised badger baiting operation which involved the destruction of four setts, the inflicting of severe injuries on several badgers, the killing of at least one badger and the torture and killing of a fox, in addition to injuries to one of the dogs.  This cruelty resulted in the imposition of a fine of £1,000.  The dogs involved in this case were left with the defendant.  The article in <i>The Leinster Express</i> stated: &ldquo;Judge Smithwick said he wouldn't make an order prohibiting the defendant from keeping dogs as it appeared the defendant's dogs were well cared for and in view of his undertaking that he would not take part in any similar activities in the future&rdquo;.  It is disheartening for the many organisations who work on a voluntary basis for animal welfare to see that outcome to such a major case.</P>
    <P>The offence of the blooding of greyhounds carries a maximum fine of £5,000 for each offence, in addition to six months imprisonment.  Will the Minister say if he intends to update legislation on animal welfare and look at similar legislation in other countries because we can learn from them?  I regret I do not have more time but, as Deputy Doyle suggested, hopefully we will be given an opportunity to have a comprehensive debate on this important subject.</P>
    <Col N="1105" />
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that a slightly more serious view is being taken of crimes against animals.  The Declaration on Human Rights was drawn up in Europe 200 years ago.  It is about time we considered broadening that circle of ethics as the rights of animals and humans are part of the same continuum.  Today we saw moving reports from South Africa where the white people took a leap forward in recognising all people as equal. Those involved in the anti-apartheid movement, which I supported, are concerned about abuses against people and animals.  Concern for common justice makes people speak out against injustice whether perpetrated against humans or animals.  Spurious claims are made that people who are concerned about animals are less concerned about humans.  That is nonsense.  To strive for the rights of animals is to strive for an egalitarian, stable and healthier world.</P>
      <P>The debate on the rights of animals has allowed legislators to engage in double speak and rhetoric.  Coursing springs to mind.  We have laws which forbid us to be cruel to animals.  The Protection of Animals Act forbids people being cruel by beating, kicking, overdriving, torturing, infuriating or terrifying any animal.  When this Act was passed a fine of £25 would have been a few months' salary; it would have been a larger sum than the £1,000 fine proposed by the Minister today.  Yet the exemption is clear.  Nothing in this section shall render illegal coursing or hunting of any captive animal unless such animal is liberated in an injured, mutilated or exhausted condition. Since 1911 we have considered that is the way to behave.  That is hypocritical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister denounced blooding, and rightly so.  I am sure he realises that many people involved in coursing consider blooding as fundamental to their brand of coursing, contending that, as they are instrinsically linked, it would be logical to ban coursing too.  The EU regulations, which the Minister applauded, allow enormous suffering through the live export trade.  We still do not have a time limit, although many animal organisations <Col N="1106" /> recommended a limit of eight hours.  Factory farming continues at an enormous rate.  We still have battery hens and overstocking.</P>
    <P>We must deal with badger baiting.  The Department has attributed an inordinate amount of blame to what the Minister would call in terms of coursing, a defenceless animal.  There is less of a problem with bovine tuberculosis in Northern Ireland; yet they did not persecute the badger and they have blamed it for all their ills.  They looked at farming practices and the transportation of the animals.  We must not encourage badger baiting.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left introduced a Bill on horses which has not been debated.  Why was this matter not debated?  Why did the Government not take a position on it? The provision of the Treaty of Rome on sentient animals has been disregarded. We must examine the export area to ensure abuses do not occur.  The industry of battery hens must be phased out.  Will animal welfare be included in the revised condition for organic farming?</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Chair's latitude.  Two issues need to be raised.  The Minister thought it appropriate to bring forward a regulation to increase the fines for cruelty.  I do not criticise him for doing so but it should have been done in the context of dealing with the wider aspects of cruelty to animals. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was concerned about exotic pets over which there are no controls. It is reported that there is a man in <Col N="1107" /> Limerick who has in his garden three Siberian tigers, one black bear and two baboons.  It is extraordinary that local authorities and gardaí can do nothing about this problem.  It is also extraordinary that a person can order such animals in a pet shop.  There is no restriction on a pet shop selling such animals or on anyone buying them.  The Minister should address urgently the sale of potentially dangerous creatures such as pythons, tarantulus, etc, by pet shops. We should not wait until there is a tragedy of some kind either for the animals or some unfortunate child or elderly person who may be terrorised or hurt.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the Control of Horses Bill I introduced in 1989. I do not claim any credit for the declaration next day by the then Taoiseach that a general election would be held.  I do not think it was my Bill which convinced him to do this.  I subsequently reintroduced that Bill in 1990.  It has not proved possible to have the Bill debated in the House, and I propose to reintroduce it. It deals with a very serious issue in urban areas, that is, the hundreds, if not thousands, of non-thoroughbred horses which are bought and sold every week.  The horse market in Smithfield is held every second Sunday and approximately 50 donkeys and 200 horses were on sale last time.  There does not seem to be any restriction on the people who can buy horses in terms of their age or capacity to look after the animal, feed it and provide sufficient space in which it can exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that my Bill was perfect but it sought to address these issues.  The Minister might be able to produce a better Bill and I would be happy if he introduced a Bill based on the ideas I put forward.  Such a Bill would have to address the following issues: the setting up of a scheme for the identification and registration of non-thoroughbred horses, the putting in place of a procedure under which the owner of any premises on which a horse is found would be made responsible for that animal and the establishment of procedures for the transfer of <Col N="1108" /> horses to another and making the owner responsible for ensuring that a horse does not wander.  When I refer to horses I am also referring to donkeys.  Wandering horses pose a serious problem for motorists and pedestrians, particularly in urban areas.  In parts of my constituency people are afraid to leave their houses because of the large number of horses wandering around the open green spaces in their estates.</P>
    <P>Any Bill must also provide greatly increased power and resources for the Garda and local authorities to deal with this problem.  Not every Garda station has available to it a horse box or a sufficiently large vehicle in which it can remove the half dozen horses which may be found wandering around housing estates.  Obviously the keeping of animals in domestic gardens or houses, as has happened in some cases, needs to be outlawed.  I am not arguing for the outlawing of the Smithfield horse market, but that market must be properly controlled. For example, vets should be present to ensure that horses are properly treated and cannot be sold if they are not in fit condition.  Local authorities should also be given power to make by-laws on these matters.  I proposed in my Bill a fine of £1,000 for the ill-treatment of horses and donkeys.  I am pleased that the Minister's regulation will increase the fine of £500 in the 1911 Act to £1,000. While I welcome this progress, it is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>On the question of wandering horses and the sale of horses to young people, I have long argued that control of non-thoroughbred horses and donkeys should not be done in such a way as to preclude young people from having access to horses, riding them, caring for them and learning how to handle them.  Some years ago, as a member of Dublin Corporation, I proposed a scheme for the Finglas area under which stables would be provided on corporation ground where young people could keep their horses and vets would be hired to train young people on the care of horses etc.  That scheme did not get anywhere because the corporation said it did not have adequate <Col N="1109" /> land or money to buy extra land, hire vets, build the stables, etc.  The setting up of such a scheme, even on an experimental basis, would be very valuable. Horses, whether they are thoroughbred or non-thoroughbred, do nothing for me.</P>

      <P>Unlike the Deputy's colleague from Wexford who not only seems to have a penchant for horses but also seems to have a penchant for elephants, I have always been afraid of horses.  Nevertheless, most young children like horses and they should not be deprived of the pleasure of looking after them simply because their parents do not have the money to send them to riding school.  A project along the lines I suggested would give children the pleasure of looking after non-thoroughbreds and donkeys and would go a long way towards helping young people avoid the many other pitfalls in society.</P>
      <P>We need legislation urgently to deal with exotic animals and non-thoroughbred, wandering horses, particularly in urban areas.  There should also be adequate funding for projects in working class areas so that children can be given access to horses and learn how to care for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The horse is a most noble animal but I could not attribute that quality to some of the people who ride them.  I agree with Deputy De Rossa that the Smithfield market and the conditions <Col N="1110" /> in which horses are traded there is a reflection on this city and indication of the low priority we give to animals, perhaps the fact that we are an agricultural country has led to that attitude.</P>
      <P>My particular concern is the obnoxious &ldquo;sport&rdquo; of hare coursing and, even more contemptible, fox hunting, to which I referred in a recent debate in this House. I know the Minister expressed outrage and horror at the revelations of a recent BBC programme which lifted the very thin veil off the disgusting sport of hare blooding, not so much of coursing. Despite denials to the contrary, anybody who knows anything about dog racing will be aware of the practice of blooding. That programme showed horrendous images which I think the Minister acknowledged.  Thousands of people, including gardaí in different areas have known about that practice but turned a blind eye to it over many years.  They, the clergy and politicians all knew it was taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hares are killed at every coursing meeting &mdash; that does not constitute the real problem &mdash; hundreds of hares are killed at private trials and at trials in general, when hares and rabbits have their legs tied behind their backs to ensure that the dog gets the taste of blood.  I know what I am talking about as I confessed here that in my youth, for a short period, I also engaged in coursing activities.  I was so sickened by the sights I turned away from that activity and have not engaged in it for the past 30 years. The problem is not comprised so much of the numbers of hares killed at public meetings but those killed in fields and back yards, sometimes cats being resorted to if a hare is not available.  In every county haremen earn their living from netting hares and providing them for trainers.  I hope that anyone charged with involvement in the awful scenes we witnessed in that television programme will feel the full rigour of the law.  I hope that, within the lifetime of this Dáil, the Minister will introduce meaningful legislation to ensure that that activity is curtailed. However, as long as dog racing continues, it will never be stamped out. <Col N="1111" /> It is an obnoxious sport, one that does this country no credit in the eyes of civilised people.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also examine the equally odious sport of fox hunting when a pack of 40 or 50 hounds tear a fox, no bigger than a small dog, limb by limb, leading to an even more horrific death than that experienced by the hare.  In a civilised society there should be no room for hare coursing.  Other sports equally unacceptable are badger baiting, cock fighting, dog fighting to the death, which occurs in certain Borders areas, and otter hunting, all savage and extremely cruel practices.  Certainly it is no &ldquo;sport&rdquo; for the unfortunate victims.</P>
    <P>We must raise the nation's consciousness to the ill treatment of animals and alert the Department to the turning of the blind eye to the ill treatment and suffering of many of these helpless little creatures.  That will not be easily done and will not take place within the Minister's term of office.  Nonetheless, the Minister should spearhead a revolt against unacceptable practices perpetrated in the course of those so-called sports.  In addition the Garda should be mobilised and involved in this exercise. We pass more legislation in this Chamber than in most other National Assemblies in Europe but we are not so good at monitoring its provisions.  The Garda should be deployed in stamping out these awful practices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy De Rossa said there is no legislation to protect these animals.  He referred to the mini zoo which is located three miles from my home about which I know there has been much concern locally because, over a period, tigers, baboons and more recently a black bear have been accommodated there.  Local people do not want to complain to neighbours but have done so to me as their public representative.  It is only when you engage in research into this matter that you fully realise the inadequacy of legislation.  Dog licences are a very effective mechanism for raising revenue and exercising control in that <Col N="1112" /> area yet Government Departments in general are helpless when it comes to other animals in that one can import a tiger, lion or other such dangerous animal for a circus, zoo or other purpose.  Local authorities can only examine such practices from the planning point of view.</P>
      <P>Wandering horses also cause problems. There was a recent fatality in my area when an unfortunate motorist crashed into a horse wandering in the darkness, resulting in the deaths of both. It is virtually impossible to trace the owner of such a horse.</P>
      <P>Although I encourage the integration and rehabilitation of travellers, it makes me very despondent that, having being integrated, they sometimes fail to realise that they also have obligations to that community.  Often they tend to bring horses into housing estates creating quite a nuisance.  Travellers must acknowledge their obligations to society, just as society must acknowledge their obligations to the travelling community.  Some control must be exerted over this practice because in many small towns now these horses are used by children and adults for what is called &ldquo;sulky&rdquo; racing or even riding through the town's main streets. There is need for tightening up such practices as in the case of dogs.</P>

      <P>This debate was most constructive, reflecting many people's concerns for animal welfare.  It covered a wider area than that meant to be dealt with by the particular statutory instruments before the House.  When practices came to light earlier this year which were totally and utterly unacceptable I examined the statutory provisions available and this was the only means by which I could do something quickly.  I embarked on this statutory instrument immediately.</P>
      <P>A distinction has to be made between coursing and blooding.  Blooding has always been a crime, while coursing is a legal activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the statutory instruments before the House come into force it will mean that on the first or second offence someone who is convicted can be fined up to £1,000 or sentenced to three months imprisonment or both.  In my view those are stiff penalties.  The important word is conviction.  We can have all the sentences and penalties we wish but if it is not possible to bring people before the courts and convict them they serve no purpose.  I appeal to any Member of this House or the public at large who knows of any cases of transgression of the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, to make the information available to the Garda.  We all accept that random acts of cruelty are difficult to detect.  We now have some evidence of organised cruel and brutal activities.  People of goodwill, particularly those who hold responsible positions in society, have an obligation to come forward and assist in convictions being obtained.</P>
      <P>This general debate has been useful and I wish to deal with some of the points which arose.  Both Deputy Doyle and Deputy De Rossa referred to the problem of urban horses.  That was a matter that concerned me before coming into this office and I have spent some time researching and seeking a way of dealing with it.  There are two aspects to this problem, one is the animal welfare aspect and the other is the danger these horses can cause in urban areas.  They appear to congregate in the less well-off areas of our cities and towns.  Deputy De Rossa referred to the need for some form of registration.  It is particularly difficult to put an identification mark on a horse which cannot be removed by some means.  People can be ingenious when it comes to removing such marks.  I am optimistic that there may be a method, by means of an electronic device, which would make for a permanent mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do we deal with a large number of loose horses in an area?  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has no involvement as such; it is a matter <Col N="1114" /> for the local authorities and the Garda. However, I accept it is a matter that needs to be addressed and I am trying to arrive at a proposal that will allow for this unacceptable position to be properly regulated.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to the difficulty of not having sufficient horse boxes.  With a co-ordinated type swoop that difficulty can be dealt with.  There is also the difficulty of the pound.  Individuals can be intimidated when people come to reclaim their animals.  Some local authorities take horses from their own functional area to another functional area because they consider this a more effective way of regulating the scene.  There could be some merit in examining the question of a secure national pound where animals would be released only when the fines and costs were paid to a local authority and the relevant documentation presented.  This is not an easy matter to deal with.</P>
    <P>Wild animals come under the Wildlife Act, involving another Department.  The matter of exotic animals was raised by a number of Deputies.  We do not have legislation in relation to dangerous animals. If animals are mistreated the regulations being discussed can be implemented.  I can assure Deputies that the problem is under active scrutiny in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred to the overstocking of sheep.  There have been recent successful prosecutions for acts of cruelty to sheep and adequate statutory powers are already available under existing legislation to deal with cruelty to all species, domestic and wild animals. Anyone aware of acts of cruelty has an obligation to come forward with information to enable successful prosecutions. The penalties provided for in existing legislation are adequate and are a sufficient deterrent.  Our problem is with actual conviction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred to the trailer donkeys.  I assure Deputies it is not the policy of the Department to issue export documentation for horses which are being exported for slaughter.  The <Col N="1115" /> creation of the Single Market has resulted in the free movement of animals and goods throughout the EU.  I am aware of the donkeys to which Deputy Doyle referred.  The manner of their leaving this country is not countenanced by my Department.  In this issue there are constraints against involvement by the Irish authorities for jurisdictional reasons.  The problem came to light when the animals, which were in the possession of a non-national, were outside the country.  This incident is the subject of examination in my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory referred to the need to update the Protection of Animals Act. As I have already said, the existing Acts, provide for a wide range of offences of cruelty against animals.  If these are operated we have the mechanism to regulate the situation.  The role of the Legislature is to determine the maximum and minimum penalties but it is the judge who imposes the penalty on the day.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to training programmes for children, particularly in less well off areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As a former teacher I am very supportive of that suggestion but the body that should develop it is another question.  When I was young I had a pet; it is a marvellous education for young people to have to look after a pet, it is part of rural life.  One of the calumnies on rural people in the context of coursing is that they are cruel.  I do not accept that. Greyhound owners and those involved in coursing take great care of their greyhounds.</P>

      <P>I will come back to that point.  I can give instances: in an urban area I know a person in receipt of social welfare keeps greyhounds and the animals are better fed than he.  As Deputy <Col N="1116" /> Clohessy said, rural sports are an important part of our culture.</P>
      <P>It is easy to be blasé about coursing but a great deal was achieved in the last coursing season in terms of eliminating the kill and reducing the level of suffering to animals.  It runs in the face of the facts to say differently.  There were 4,936 muzzled courses last year; 45 hares were killed, 220 hares were struck, of which 25 had to be put down due to injuries. That is amazing progress on the position heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great pleasure in introducing to the House the Bill setting up An Bord <Col N="1117" /> Bia, the Irish Food Board.  The origins of this go back to the Culliton report and the report of the Expert Group on the Food Industry which made detailed recommendations on the subject.</P>
    <P>I have always been of the view that a greater degree of unity is needed in the activities of State agencies as regards promotion and market development of food products, particularly overseas.  A number of our fellow member states of the European Union have single agencies for food promotion which operate with considerable success.  I expect that our new single agency will be able to make important progress in maintaining and improving the buyer and consumer demand for Irish food abroad.  Once the new agency is set up, I will be asking it to draw up a multi-annual plan for promotion and market development of Irish food.  As the Expert Group on the Food Industry suggested, I would expect that plan to develop synergies between the different food promotion activities and to develop also &ldquo;an overall promotion strategy which, making full use of the Irish image, would have a major impact on markets abroad&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In brief, the Bill proposes in the first instance to combine CBF and the food unit of ABT and to include also certain export promotion functions of An Bord Glas.  I have also made provision for the possible inclusion of other relevant agencies' food functions as and when appropriate.</P>
    <P>In the drafting of this legislation, I have been particularly careful to maintain the structures, mechanisms and market information systems that have worked well in CBF.  Deputies will note that a subsidiary board for meat and livestock is specifically provided for.  It is my belief that the activities of both CBF and ABT, as well as An Bord Glas have proved useful and successful in the food promotion area.  My aim is to build further on that success.  I do not envisage additional Exchequer expenditure arising from this legislation.</P>
    <P>Part I contains fairly standard provisions relating to the short title, interpretation of the main terms used, the <Col N="1118" /> making of ministerial orders and provision for expenses incurred in administering the legislation to be made from voted moneys.  Deputies will notice that &ldquo;fish&rdquo; is included in the definition of &ldquo;agricultural products&rdquo; in section 2 (1). The main purpose of this is to allow for future assimilation of Bord Iascaigh Mhara's fish promotion functions to the functions of An Bord Bia.  A review of the functions of BIM is at present taking place under the auspices of the Minister for the Marine.  When that review is complete I will be discussing with the Minister for the Marine whether any transfer of functions in the fish sector would be appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;An Bord Bia will be responsible for promotion and market development of the whole range of Irish food and drink products.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill deals with a range of matters relating to the establishment, organisation, procedures and functions of the new agency.  Section 6 provides for the establishment of the agency and for the dissolution of CBF on the establishment day to be fixed.  I would like to stress here that the dissolution of CBF does not mean that any of that organisation's current functions will be abandoned or lost sight of.  As I indicated a few moments ago my purpose is to strengthen those functions.  Section 6 (1) provides for an English language name, in addition to the Irish language name An Bord Bia, for the new agency.  Experience has shown that an English language title is, not too surprisingly, often desirable in overseas markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the general functions of the agency.  Deputies will have noted <Col N="1119" /> that the definition of &ldquo;food&rdquo; in Part I includes drink.  Thus section 7 will enable An Bord Bia to include beverages in its promotional activities as appropriate. Livestock is included here also with a view, once again, to retaining the current functions of CBF and the equity of its levy system; I recognise, of course, that promotion in the livestock area is at present a relatively minor activity of CBF.  Given that products closer to the consumer end of the market have greater promotion requirements, I would not envisage that relative emphasis changing significantly under An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>More specific functions for An Bord Bia are set out in section 8.  These cover, among other functions, promotion, market intelligence, market development, symposia, publications, quality assurance and, in brief the whole range of activities appropriate to such an agency. I should mention at this point that the development of markets and the promotion of products is basically the job of those who sell them.  The job of An Bord Bia, as in the case of the present agencies, will be to assist and support those efforts in various ways, including strengthening the overall image of Irish food, not to replace them.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the transfer of certain functions of An Bord Glas to the new agency.  An Bord Glas itself will remain in place; only those of its functions that relate to the export marketing of edible horticultural products are being transferred.  As Deputies may be aware, the bulk of An Bord Glas activities relate to the home market and it has substantial work in regard to non-edible horticultural products such as nursery stock; those activities will not be affected.</P>
    <P>In the same section, there is provision for assignment to An Bord Bia, at a later stage of other functions related to food marketing.  This would cover, for instance, the case where it might be decided to transfer to An Bord Bia responsibility for fish as a food.  This power could be exercised only with the consent of other Ministers responsible <Col N="1120" /> for bodies from which the transfer of functions might be proposed.</P>
    <P>Section 10 allows for assignment of additional functions to the new agency where these are incidental to or consequential on the functions assigned by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11 requires An Bord Bia to act in co-operation with other bodies that share functions relevant to its own.  What I have in mind in particular is that close and effective co-operation will need to be maintained between An Bord Bia and An Bord Tráchtála, especially with regard to the use of facilities abroad.  I intend to ensure that such co-operation takes place.</P>
    <P>In section 12 the new agency is empowered to charge for its services.  I expect that a base level of services would be provided without supplementary fees for sectors where levies will be collectible by An Bord Bia, though some charge could be involved for special or exceptional services.  On the other hand, services to sectors which do not subscribe by levy should be largely on a fee-paying basis. The levels of such fees would be drawn up by An Bord Bia but would, under section 12, be subject to ministerial approval.  While I would not wish to see the levels of fees being a deterrent or exorbitant, I would expect them to make a substantial contribution to An Bord Bia's budget.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with subsidiary boards.  I have already referred to the setting up of a subsidiary board for meat and livestock which would maintain and continue the current functions and focus of CBF.  This is provided for in subsection (1) of the section which, taken in conjunction with the definition of &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; and &ldquo;meat&rdquo; in section 2 (1), extends the coverage, beyond that at present in force in CBF, to include deer, poultry, rabbits, goats and the meat of those species.  Also, subsection (2) provides for An Bord Bia to set up, with ministerial consent or on ministerial direction, subsidiary boards for other sectors.  I am particularly conscious of the recommendation of the Expert Group on the Food Industry that there should be a subsidiary board for <Col N="1121" /> prepared consumer food products and this will be among the first of the matters on which I expect An Bord Bia to take action when set up.  It is my intention that levies collected from particular sectors, for instance meat and livestock, should be used for the benefit of those sectors. Subsections (1) and (5) together with the right of the Minister to specify conditions under subsection (3) will allow that procedure to be observed.</P>
    <P>Section 14 makes the type of provision usual in such cases regarding the composition and terms of office of the board. Deputies will note that a nominee of the Minister for Tourism and Trade is to be included as that Minister is responsible for ABT which will continue to have responsibility for the promotion of nonfood products.  The linkage will be in the interests of both agencies.</P>

      <P>I intend to set up the board shortly on an interim basis pending the final passage of the Bill.  That will enable a good deal of the preliminary work to be done in advance of final establishment and will help to achieve my aim of getting An Bord Bia down to work as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are keeping the show going.  Section 15 deals with the meat and livestock subsidiary board in more detail.  It follows closely the present arrangements for CBF.  That is part of my policy to preserve in the meat sector the focus and the producer linkages that have worked successfully in CBF.  It also takes account of the important CBF levy arrangements that will be carried over into An Bord Bia and the representational pattern which that implies.</P>
      <P>Section 16 also deals with subsidiary boards, this time with those that will be set up in sectors other than meat and livestock.  Section 16 (2), like the corresponding provision in the previous section, states that the chairman of a subsidiary board shall be a member of the main board.  The purpose of this is to ensure effective linkage between the main board and the subsidiary ones.  It also reflects a practice which has worked well in CBF, where committees are chaired by board members.</P>
      <P>The chairman and members of all the subsidiary boards are to be appointed by the main board, but with the consent of the Minister, under sections 15 (3) and 16 (2).  This will enable the Minister to satisfy himself that the persons appointed correspond with the requirement of being &ldquo;engaged in or having knowledge of&rdquo; the relevant sector, though it would not be my intention to apply that condition in an over-restrictive way.  Ministerial consent will also serve to avoid any danger of an undue proliferation of subsidiary boards.</P>
      <P>Sections 17 to 20, inclusive, deal with a number of matters common to the board and the subsidiary boards, such as eligibility of outgoing members for reappointment, conditions of office, casual vacancies and remuneration.  Remuneration and allowances for expenses will require the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 cover accounts, audits and annual reports as well as the supply of any information about performance of the functions of the board <Col N="1123" /> and of the subsidiary boards that the Minister may require.  In accordance with the usual procedure, auditing will be by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the accounts and annual report will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 23 allows the board to borrow money, but only with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Section 24 lays down some framework provisions as regards meetings and procedure within which the board, or a subsidiary board, will be free to determine its more detailed procedures. Section 25 contains stringent provisions to guard against conflicts of interest on the part of members of the board or a subsidiary board or the staff of the agency.  Section 26 will prevent incorrect disclosure of information by any of those persons.  Section 27 allows investment of funds by the board in the manner of a trustee.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for the setting up of committees to assist and advise the board or a subsidiary board.  This is similar to the existing committee system employed currently by CBF and which has proved useful and effective in practice.</P>
    <P>Under section 29 the board and the subsidiary boards are required to comply with any ministerial policy directives. This is a standard provision for bodies of this kind but it would not be my intention to exercise this power in an oppressive way or to interfere in the day to day operations of An Bord Bia.  The proper approach when setting up a board is to provide it with a clear framework, as is being done in this Bill, and then to let it get on with the job.  Thus, the power under this section would be used only for necessary policy directives.</P>
    <P>Section 30 empowers the board to accept gifts, but only if any trusts or conditions attached would not be inconsistent with the board's functions.  Section 31 applies to the board, the subsidiary board and the staff of the new agency the standard provisions to cover the situation where a member becomes a Member of <Col N="1124" /> either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Sections 32 and 33 enable the board to appoint a full-time chief executive and other staff members with remuneration, allowances, terms and conditions subject to national or governmental guidelines and ministerial directives.  Section 34 enables the board, or a subsidiary board, to perform its functions through authorised staff members.  Staff matters are dealt with further under section 46 and I will advert to them again at that point.</P>
    <P>Under section 35 the board is required to draw up for its staff a superannuation scheme or schemes which will be submitted to the Minister and, after approval, laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Deputies will note that the pre-existing superannuation entitlements of staff transferred to An Bord Bia are safeguarded under section 35 (7).</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides for grants-in-aid to An Bord Bia from Exchequer funds, as is already the practice for CBF and ABT. I expect that the greater part of the new agency's resources would come from levies, fees for services and EU Structural Funds, but there will also be an annual grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, dealing with levies on livestock and agricultural products, is largely based on existing legislation relating to CBF, legislation that will become inoperative once An Bord Bia is established and CBF dissolved.  As regards section 37 (1), it is necessary to continue the practice of levying both livestock slaughtered and livestock exported in order to observe EU requirements of non-discrimination between these two sectors.  The specific amounts of levy per animal shown in section 37 (2) are the present statutory amounts operated by CBF and the present practice whereby those amounts are charged to the vendor of livestock for slaughter is taken up under section 38 (7) of the Bill.  It is also present CBF practice, however, to collect a &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;, i.e. non-statutory, levy from slaughters and that latter charge is not intended to be passed back to the vendor.</P>
    <P>Section 38 (7) and (8) taken together <Col N="1125" /> enable the Minister to put the latter non-statutory levy on a statutory basis.  It is the intention that this would be done in the event of the voluntary arrangement being discontinued or not working satisfactorily; however, any order varying the current statutory levy amounts would, in accordance with section 37 (4), be subject to a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas as also would any order on recoverability under section 38 (8).</P>
    <P>The other provisions of sections 37 to 44, inclusive, relate to what I might call the mechanics of the levy on livestock, such as records, offences and penalties, powers of authorised officers, estimation of levy where necessary and evidence in proceedings.  These are similar to existing provisions governing current CBF levy collection except that under section 38 (10) (c) cancellation of the stamps by means of which levies on exported livestock are paid will be effected by staff of my Department instead of Customs and Excise staff as is the case under the existing CBF legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides for a levy on agricultural products.  This is to cover the situation where it might prove more convenient or desirable in sectors other than the livestock-meat sector to introduce levy arrangements for promotional purposes rather than to charge fees.  An order under this section would require prior consultation with the producer, processor or trade interests concerned, as well as a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I come now to the transitional provisions in Part IV of the Bill.  Section 46 means that the initial staff of An Bord Bia would be the existing staff of CBF together with An Bord Tráchtála staff members designated by ABT itself.  As regards the latter, the intention would be that the current food unit of ABT would be transferred to An Bord Bia on the establishment day.  As I indicated earlier when speaking about section 35, transferred staff will not run a risk of losing out on superannuation rights.  Neither will they be at risk as regards their remuneration and conditions of service; section 47 provides that they will not be <Col N="1126" /> less favourably treated than before in those respects.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an impression among the public that An Bord Bia is to be an enormous organisation; that is not the intention.  I see it as a medium-sized tightly-run agency with no more staff than it needs to carry out its responsibilities cost-effectively.  I do not anticipate that the transfer of functions from An Bord Glas would necessitate any transfer of staff from that organisation.</P>
    <P>In section 48, the central provision is contained in 48 (1) which transfers CBF property to An Bord Bia.  The effect of the reference in section 48 (3) to the Finance Act, 1895 is to exempt An Bord Bia from liability for stamp duty in respect of any transferred property.</P>
    <P>Section 49 transfers the rights and liabilities of CBF, as well as any pending legal proceedings it might have, to An Bord Bia.  As regards the rights and liabilities of ABT in relation to its current food promotion and market development activities, the situation is a little more complex, given that ABT is not being dissolved and that any transfer of rights and liabilities from that agency would therefore be only partial and would have to be apportioned.  My Department will be discussing this point further with the Attorney General's Office and I may be putting down an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.  Section 50 provides for the final audited accounts of CBF, after its dissolution on the establishment day, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill, relating to levy on livestock exported live, deals with the forms of adhesive stamp to show that levy has been paid, as well as the document to which they would be affixed. Deputies may find the colour description &ldquo;cyan&rdquo; for 20p stamp rather obscure; it signifies a shade of blue.  The schedule is modelled on existing CBF arrangements, as also is the pictorial logo shown; the intention would be to replace the CBF logo by a Bord Bia logo as soon as the latter agency chooses one, and that can be done by regulations under section 38 (11).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> Before concluding, I would like to make a further general remark.  A rough estimate of the funding available to An Bord Bia over the first few years of its existence would be about £14 million annually, a substantial increase on the present level of funding for food and beverage promotion abroad.  This would include an appropriate transfer of funding from ABT, to be carried through administratively.  It also takes account of grant-in-aid, livestock levies, and fees charged for services, as well as an element of EU Structural Funds for promotion and market development in the food sector.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have gathered from what I have already said, this Bill aims simply at unifying and making more effective the services provided to the food sector by existing agencies.  In that context, the Bill represents a very considerable step forward.  Given the challenges that face our food industry following CAP reform and GATT and the need for our food products to compete successfully on the EU market, we must now streamline the back-up given by our State agencies.  The Bill has that effect.  From my experience of overseas promotions and food fairs &mdash; some of which have been well highlighted &mdash; a number of Irish agencies locate upstairs, others downstairs and some are not represented at all.  Of those who are represented, some promote Irish products under the harp logo and others under the shamrock, leprechaun or other logo.  In other words, there is fragmentation.  We are a relatively small country with a very strong image.  We are perceived as a green island producing quality food, but we have not built on that image sufficiently. The Germans, French and others have central agencies dealing with the export of food who are successful in their work because they have a clear focus on what they want to achieve and use a clear logo to promote foods produced in their countries.</P>
    <P>Food produced in Ireland can be given a significant shot in the arm by unifying and streamlining the agencies concerned <Col N="1128" /> in a tightly knit operation by allocating substantially increased funding to them. The functional responsibility of An Bord Bia will rest with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, who has been dedicated to supporting the development and promotion of Irish food since his appointment. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is wheeling into the House a Trojan horse whose functions, apart from organising trade fairs and getting the leprechaun, shamrock and harp on the one stand, are far from clear.  The Bill is disappointing, not because I disagree with the Minister that a greater degree of unity is needed in the activities of State agencies for the promotion and marketing of food products, but because apart from promotion I fail to see what this conglomeration will do.  The view of various sections of the food and drinks industry is that the role in respect of marketing will have to be limited because of the necessity to comply with EU measures.  For example, under the Bill the marketing of branded products is unlikely to come within the ambit of this board.  The support for generic products is acceptable in a European Union context, but to choose between one branded product and another would mean that the chief executive officer, or whoever on the subsidiary committees about which we have heard so much makes the decision, would need to have the wisdom of Solomon.  He or she will have to decide in favour of a branded product from one meat processor as against another, a difficult decision.  I take it the days of the grace and favour basis of marketing are over.  Successful marketing and selection of branded products at various trade fairs over the years has been questionable and I suspect the Minister would not like that to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is abolishing CBF even though he made numerous references during Question Time today to its merits. I would question whether making it a subsidiary livestock committee is doing justice to its work over the years.  Many of its activities and the manner in which it spent moneys could be criticised, but <Col N="1129" /> in general it has done an excellent job. Those who have served on the board of CBF have given excellent service to the meat and livestock trade.  I am not convinced the Bill is doing right by that trade &mdash; a crucial area of agricultural and agri-food production here &mdash; by abolishing CBF and making it a subsidiary committee. The Minister has given all sorts of assurances and bought peace with the IFA on this issue.  I ask those who believe the Minister is doing right to carefully analyse the Bill.  The subsidiary committee for livestock, the former CBF, will be enabled to collect levies, but it will not have a say in how they are spent.  The final say in that regard will rest with the chief executive officer, the boss of the main board.  As members of the CBF, the IFA and others appear to believe that the livestock committee will have complete say in regard to the spending of the levies it collects, will the Minister give that assurance to the House?  That is not what the Bill says.  If the Minister does not amend that section, he will have effectively pulled the wool over the eyes of many intelligent people.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann requests the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out a value for money audit of the cost to the State of professional fees and to report its findings to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion requests the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out a value for money audit of fees paid by the State <Col N="1130" /> to various consultants and lawyers, agents and other such people.  I note an amendment has been tabled to the motion.  It alleges there is an attempt to undermine the independence and override the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts.  That committee has no right to direct the Comptroller and Auditor General in his activities.  No one is more authoritative than I on the subject and no one should tell me that I do not know what I am talking about.  I was the longest serving chairman of that committee since the foundation of the State.  I have studied the technical aspects of this matter and I wrote a thesis on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is up to this House if it so chooses to legally confer those powers set out in the motion on the Comptroller and Auditor General. I am absolutely aghast at the Government's attempts to prevent this House from requesting its auditor, not the Government's one, from carrying out a value for money audit of an area which is the subject of public scandal.</P>
    <P>Every lawyer, accountant, public relations consultant, design consultant, business consultant and fee receiving agent of the Government during the past ten years or so should be asked to sign a declaration that he or she did not subsequently donate some of his or her income or other resources to a political party or candidate.  An unhealthy relationship has developed between the State and private individuals, firms and companies carrying out public services. Often, without a tendering procedure, millions of pounds of taxpayers' money are handed out to such firms, individuals and companies.  Properties have been disposed of and acquired in the past in a loose and suspicious manner without adequate controls or explanations.  The ease with which those financial transactions take place, while bypassing reasonable controls, is now a source of public concern, scandal and growing disbelief.</P>
    <P>I will give some examples, by no means <Col N="1131" /> an exhaustive list, of fees paid which could not be considered value for money. In the early 1980s, fees totalling £9 million were incurred on the design of four new prisons which were never built.  As it transpired, much of the expenditure turned out to be nugatory and the Comptroller and Auditor General brought it to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is reported on pages 29 and 30 of his 1982 report. As a result of the 1982-83 report of the Committee of Public Accounts the Department of Finance issued new instructions regarding the engagement of consultants on public construction contracts and the settlement of fees.  In his 1982 report the Comptroller and Auditor General stated: &ldquo;In view of the necessity to redesign all four projects, I felt that commitments to incur such professional fees may have been unnecessarily entered into because of the extent of the design work carried out before firm decisions were made as to the scope of the work to be undertaken&rdquo;.  One must congratulate the Comptroller and Auditor General for his restrained and diplomatic language.</P>
    <P>I chaired the Committee of Public Accounts for almost six years and it pioneered many of the changes that have taken place in the control of public expenditure.  That committee, with the co-operation of the Secretary of the Department of Finance, his Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General, has brought about a positive and new way of auditing State spending.</P>
    <P>I recall how pressure from the Committee of Public Accounts prompted the Office of Public Works to revise its procedures with regard to the payment of fees in accordance with standard percentages laid down by the governing professional bodies.  The traditional approach did not take account of the volume of business farmed out by the State and the change resulted in significant savings by the State.  It should be noted that the percentage basis for the calculation of professional fees works in such a way that an escalation in the cost <Col N="1132" /> of a project will inevitably result in a corresponding increase in the fees of those whose job it is to control costs.</P>
    <P>Those misgivings have again come to the surface in recent years.  One only has to refer to the 1991 and 1992 reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General for such evidence.  In paragraphs 31 and 41 of his 1991 report, he draws attention to the costs of inspections under sections 8 and 14 of the Companies Act, 1990 which escalated far beyond what might reasonably have been envisaged.  Those costs showed up the inadequacies of the procedures for appointing such inspectors.  I will return to this topic later.</P>
    <P>In his 1992 report, the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed to the fees and expenses associated with the Beef Tribunal at paragraph 35 and, on a different scale, the legal fees arising from the Ballycotton Inquiry at paragraph 32.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s £661,885 was paid to a consultant by the Department of Energy for a report on the sale of Tara Mines. That report was never made public.  It never saw the light of day, despite that asset which was sold being a State one. The Committee of Public Accounts was not able to obtain that report to ensure the sale of Tara Mines represented good and fair value for the taxpayer.  No tendering procedure applied in respect of that report, the cost of which in today's figures may amount to £1.2 million.  I do not know whether that report was one inch thick or only consisted of two sheets of paper.  The manner in which that matter was dealt with is a scandalous way in which to do business.</P>
    <P>In the 1987 report of the Committee of Public Accounts reference was made to the payment of £74,149 incurred by the State in appealing the High Court decision in Crotty <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, which tested the constitutionality of the Single European Act. The Comptroller and Auditor General had noted the Department of Finance was hesitant initially in authorising payment of these fees to counsel on the grounds they were excessive, but he pointed out that they were paid in full in January 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> The committee had reservations about the excessive costs being claimed in cases simply because the Exchequer is paying. It said it was concerned with the high level of payments to counsel and whether they are consistent with good financial control by the State.  The committee pointed out that it had addressed this matter on a number of occasions and had never found its misgivings fully unfounded.  It urged that a fresh look be taken at other options to provide the State with a more cost effective method of prosecuting or defending cases in the courts.</P>
    <P>On the application of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, the High Court, on 16 September 1991 appointed two inspectors, nominated by the then Minister.  In 1991 the Comptroller and Auditor General reported that £1.24 million was paid from the Courts Vote to the inspectors investigating the affairs of Siúicre Éireann cpt, of which £678,507 related to inspectors' remuneration. In September 1991 the same Minister appointed an inspector to investigate the membership of the related companies of Siúicre Éireann cpt and in October 1991 he appointed an inspector to investigate the membership of companies connected with the purchase of a site by Bord Telecom.</P>
    <P>The rates of remuneration and other conditions attached to the inspectors' appointments had not been agreed by the Minister beforehand, but the fees later claimed, totalling £491,041, of which inspectors' direct fees totalled £180,524, were paid.  The question this House must address and quite properly ask the Comptroller and Auditor General, on its behalf and on behalf of the people, is why these rates of remuneration were not agreed in advance.  None of us here would spend our own money in that way and taxpayers' money should not be spent in that way.</P>
    <P>The cost to the State of the tribunal of inquiry into the beef processing industry to the end of June 1993 was £6.28 million, of which £3.998 million was for legal fees. A further £246,938 was spent on consultants' <Col N="1134" /> fees and the bills continued to roll in after that date.  Some lawyers received more for a week at the tribunal than an unemployed person would receive in unemployment assistance for three years.  There were enough teams of lawyers, consultants and others to play an 11-a-side tournament for 18 months.</P>
    <P>The tribunal was appointed by the then Minister for Agriculture and Food on 31 May 1991 and its cost to date is tragic, the tragedy being that those who practise law and some of those delegated to uphold it seem to think this is a perfectly normal way to spend taxpayers' money. The view of people from certain quarters is that the trustees of the taxpayer, TDs, should keep their mouths shut and their noses out of this scandalous use of taxpayers' money.  The only way for us to come to terms with this matter is to request the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is beyond reproach, who, since the foundation of the State, has been completely independent and has served this Parliament and country well, to report independently on it.  We should compare expenditure on the beef tribunal and the number of people involved in it with, for example, the Scott inquiry in Britain.</P>
    <P>When the overdue legislation to publicly compel the attendance of witnesses at Parliamentary committees is published, I bet that the Committee of Public Accounts will not be included in those which can compel the attendance of witnesses. This House must ensure that the Committee of Public Accounts is fully empowered to call witnesses.  Perhaps some of the lawyers and consultants involved in the beef tribunal should be called before the committee and asked how they can justify the level of fees they charged and if they will consider refunding some of this money to the State.  We are prepared to give power to inspectors appointed by the courts and by Ministers, tribunals chaired by judges and so on to inquire into matters, but we are not prepared to give that power to our own committees.  It is time committees were given that power.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons lawyers, particularly <Col N="1135" /> barristers, get away with charging high fees is that former lawyers are the ultimate adjudicators on what is a fair fee.  &ldquo;What the market will bear&rdquo; is the rule of the day as handed down by judges. A further example is the Ballycotton inquiry where, as outlined in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report of 1992, fees totalled £827,809, of which legal fees totalled £724,018.  The cost of the Kerry Babies Tribunal totalled £1.369 million.  People may say that if we set up tribunals we should not complain about the cost.  Whether we are talking about the purchase of a piece of furniture or stationary or the services of a professional, we are entitled to seek value for money on behalf of the taxpayer. Simply because we set up a tribunal of inquiry does not mean we sign a blank cheque, with nobody responsible for ensuring that tribunals operate economically, efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>One point that needs to be made is the continued association of judges with lawyers.  This matter was addressed by the Fair Trade Commission Report on the Legal Profession, 1990, which states:</P>
    <P>At this stage, it seems appropriate that the Commission should express its surprise at the involvement of the Judiciary with the barristers' profession through the institution of King's Inns.  Although all judges in the Circuit and Superior Courts must have previously been practising barristers, we consider that the Judiciary and the Bar are totally separate professions. There seems no sound reason for any aspect of the profession of barrister to be influenced by the direct participation of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>Barristers are subject to the authority of judges in their courts, judges can complain to the Bar Council about the behaviour of barristers, and no further involvement would appear to be warranted.  Nevertheless, 22 of the 53 Benchers of King's Inns are judicial Benchers, and there are nine judicial Benchers and a judge of the Circuit <Col N="1136" /> Court among the 43 members of the Council of King's Inns.</P>
    <P>This has implications for disciplining of barristers, but it also has implications where, for example, an individual or company, or the State, appeals to the High Court the level of fees charged by a barrister.  This happened in a case heard on 20 October 1993.  It would be interesting to read some of the banter exchanged between the learned friends on the decision of fees arrived at on that occasion.  I do not wish to single out any judge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is fair and proper that we in this House should ask whether this approach by the Judiciary in general is consistent with the public interest and the removal of restrictive practices.  It would be welcome if some other forum were found to appeal barrister's fees, one which would be less inclined towards a view of what is fair and reasonable.</P>

    <P>A sum of £2.25 million has been spent by the Government on public relations, media and communications consultants in the past 15 months.  This is the largest such expenditure by a Government in the history of the State.  It does not include programme managers and others recruited from outside the public service. At Question Time on 13 April the Taoiseach confirmed that Carr Communications was retained by his Department to provide assistance and that the annual value of the contract was £36,300, including VAT.  The Tánaiste has entered into contracts totalling £84,817 to produce a 28-minute video.  The Minister with the best image in Government, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for Health, awarded the most contracts to communication companies.  He spent £835,218 in total.  The Minister for the Environment spent £494,422 on advertising campaigns, some £218,013 to Saatchi and Saatchi for the &ldquo;Clean up Ireland&rdquo; campaign and £125,000 to Arks <Col N="1137" /> Limited.  The Minister for Finance awarded £98,949 in contracts.  He told the Dáil that Carr Communications was paid £26,000 a year to carry out a variety of assignments.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade has various media contracts totalling, to the end of March, £41,291.  The Minister for Justice has one contract with Carr Communications for £31,107 during the past 15 months for advice and assistance. The Minister for Education sanctioned two contracts for £23,800 in the same period.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment contracted Setanta Communication at a cost of £22,845.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications paid £20,108 to Drury Communications.  The Minister for Social Welfare paid £15,500 to Walsh Public Relations Limited to advise on communications relating to Department schemes and services.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Andrews, placed one contract with Brindley Advertising Limited for £11,410 and, wearing his other hat as Minister for the Marine, he awarded four contracts totalling £4,997 to the same company.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht paid a smaller amount, £1,398 &mdash; he is not so bad at communicating his own view without the help of these people.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry paid fees from March 1992 to July 1993 amounting to £385,000 and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform will soon be responsible for the expenditure of £500,000 in advertising.</P>
    <P>According to information provided in answer to a parliamentary question, that totals £2.25 million which has been spent on public relations, media and communications consultants in the past 18 months. That is unheard of in the history of the State.  Just imagine what could be done with that money for the people who are waiting for eye operations, for the people who are on housing lists or on waiting lists for orthodontic treatment, including young children whose faces are becoming disfigured because they cannot get treatment. Yet we see money being thown around in this way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> As far as I can ascertain in most of these cases there was no tendering procedure before any of the persons who were subsequently paid these fees were chosen.  There may have been tendering in one or two cases but, in most cases, no fees were agreed in advance and no independent person could claim that the fees charged could possibly represent value for money.  I have given random examples of millions of pounds of expenditure. This is only a representative group and the way the consultants were chosen and the absence of controls to ensure value for money for the taxpayer must be of the gravest concern.</P>
    <P>Contrast this with the amount of money spent in the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General each year, which amounts to a measly couple of million pounds, or the amount spent on running the Oireachtas for an entire year.  We are handing money to barristers, consultants and lawyers some of whom, incidentally, set out salaries and say that we are worth £30,000 for a whole year.  How many of us are not working 15 hours a day, weekends thrown in and with very few holidays, in the most insecure business in the State? That is what they say we are worth.  How do they arrive at what they themselves are worth?  How can the State have agreed to pay these figures?</P>
    <P>Why is the State now resisting a motion to ask the only honest broker in the game, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to look at these fees and report his findings to the House?  Why is that happening? Who is trying to block this House and the people from finding out?  It is things like this that get people's backs up.  A funny thing about Governments is that they can be very popular, but it takes very little to lose that popularity, to start going down in the opinion polls and for seats to be shed right, left and centre.  Deputies will come into this House at the request of the Government to speak against this motion, and they will do so in constructive ways.  It will be interesting to hear how the electorate who sent them here respond to what they say in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> For the future we must examine the possibility of allowing parliamentary committees to carry out these inquiries. Why should we empower all of these people, we who have the power to empower ourselves?  People may say that that cannot be done, but was there any report more controversial than the Carysfort report?  The Committee of Public Accounts agreed a report on that. I say that in justice to all members of that committee from all sides, and there were members on that committee who might have been considered to have been under political pressure for one reason or another. The committee agreed a controversial report and got to the point.  In all my time on the Committee of Public Accounts I do not remember the committee dividing because of politics.</P>

      <P>Put it in writing after 9 June and I might accept the invitation. I have been a member of that committee since 1983.  It went about its business and was capable of doing so.  It is every bit as capable of inquiring into matters as some of the people we are empowering at huge cost.  Our committees should have the right to compel the attendance of witnesses under pain of contempt of Parliament and with severe penalties attached.  This can be done.  It was done by the Committee of Public Accounts on the special inquiry in 1970, and its findings were only set aside by the High Court on a technicality; the legislation did not set down possible penalties and, therefore, a person being sentenced was potentially entitled to trial by jury because the sentence would have been over two years.  In the special report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the future of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the committee, we attached senior counsel's opinion on how that could legally be done simply by amending that brief Act of 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From here on and at a minimum, outside services should only be contracted for where persons and firms have been <Col N="1140" /> chosen at arm's length.  There should be a contract for fees in advance and value for money must be the essence of such an agreement.  There should be a prohibition on political contributions from those who receive fees from the State and a declaration to that effect should be signed in advance and after work has been completed by all of those involved. There should be rigid controls of Government spending in such areas and these controls should be overseen and regularly reviewed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>People outside this House are becoming increasingly scandalised by what they see as the &ldquo;Dynasty&rdquo; type unreality of the men in mohair suits and the women in expensive clothes who sport suntans and fly around the world thinking that somehow they own Ireland.  In the long traditions of this State, from W.T. Cosgrave down to recent Taoisigh, this House has always been accounted to for the actions of the Government.  It is a requirement of the Constitution that the Executive report and be accountable to Dáil Éireann.  Because it has such a large majority the Government may think those rules do not apply; they do, regardless of the size of the majority and probably because of the size of the majority, the Government should be sensitive to accounting to the House for its stewardship, particularly in the financial area.</P>
    <P>Fiscal rectitude is a philosophy which, over the years, has been accepted on both sides of the House, which has not always been the case.  It has contributed to most of our economic indicators coming on side, our inflation rate, our growth rate and our debt-GNP ratio in particular, because we have preached restraint.  How can we continue to preach restraint when people see money being thrown around in this way?  It is a scandal, the insensitivity of which people outside this House do not believe.  Any social worker operating on the ground will say that insensitivity is a source of hurt and shame.  How can they tell people who come to them with AIDS, are unemployed or have housing problems that no money is available, when day after day <Col N="1141" /> they see large amounts of money squandered by people in this way without adhering to the normal contractual procedures which would be expected in any business?</P>
    <P>This is particularly the case when the public see those people, who one might expect to uphold the law and to set standards in their knowledge and practice of the law, being the most greedy, getting away with their greed and thumbing their noses at the Members of this House.  It is time we thumbed our noses at them and the only way for this House to do that is to empower the Comptroller and Auditor General, the only officer of the Constitution who reports to this House.  It has never been known for the Comptroller and Auditor General to overstate, exaggerate or do anything other than serve in the true traditions of an independent public servant and to meet his remit in every way.  One of the great privileges of my time as a Member of this House has been my association with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Secretary of the Department of Finance, people who have an enormous regard for the traditions of public service. It is unfortunate that those traditions do not apply to the back door agents and the huge fees being paid to them and to others.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, even at this late hour, not to amend this motion.  What has he to fear?  It will take some time before the Comptroller and Auditor General produces his report and none of us will know its content until it is published.  I want him to carry out a value for money audit based on the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, introduced by the Minister for Finance.  Throughout my political career I campaigned for such legislation and had some hand in its introduction.  Under that Act the Comptroller and Auditor General is legislatively empowered to carry out value for money audits based on economy, efficiency and the effectiveness of the expenditure.  Let us ask him to do this job as we are legislatively entitled to do.  We are entitled to confer on the Comptroller and Auditor General <Col N="1142" /> additional powers and responsibilities and this is one which would certainly fall within that remit.</P>
    <P>If Members of the House were free to vote on this motion, the vast majority of them would vote in favour of it because I know, from speaking to Members privately, that they are as scandalised as the public by this behaviour.  Why should we allow ourselves to be whipped into the lobbies to prevent this motion being carried? I fail to understand why anybody would want to oppose or table an amendment to this motion.  On a free vote in this House the motion would be carried because what I am saying in it represents the views of the vast majority of Members, including a sizeable number in the Cabinet.  I do not know why we should seek to obstruct the House in pursuing the inquiry in this way.</P>
    <P>For expenditure on fees already made, we must now request the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out a value for money audit based on economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and to report to this House on his findings as soon as possible.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is the person appointed, under the Constitution, to report to Parliament on Government spending and the Dáil is empowered to request him to carry out such investigations.  He is a constitutional officer with no axe to grind and with a proven record of serving the public interest.</P>
    <P>Public money has been spent as if it were distributed by a drunken sailor. None of us would allow our own money to be spent in this way and we certainly should not allow vast amounts of taxpayers' money to be so spent.  I commend this motion to the House and request full cross-party support for its early implementation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann without in any way approving of, or agreeing with high levels of professional fees, reaffirms the independence conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to value for money audits by section 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, and rejects any attempts to undermine that independence or override the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts, having regard to section 9 (4) of the Act and paragraph (4) of Standing Order 130.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I regard the examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General of economy and efficiency in use of resources and the examination of effectiveness of certain management systems as one of the most important, if not the most important, new, discretionary power to be given to the Comptroller and Auditor General under the Comptroller and Auditor General legislation of last year.  In the context of my amendment to this motion, I stress the discretionary nature of this power &mdash; a discretion which does not appear to have received due consideration in the motion tabled by Deputies Mitchell and Yates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware, however, from the debates in the House during the passage of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, that the introduction of a statutory basis for value for money audit was welcomed by Deputies as a significant development.  The background to this development is, of course, fully set out in section 2 of the White Paper on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The range of bodies subject to economy and efficiency examinations is very wide &mdash; essentially all Departments, bodies and funds subject to statutory audit.  The only exceptions are bodies who are audited by agreement or are subject to inspection rather than audit.  The range of bodies which I have <Col N="1144" /> referred to are also subject to examination, at the Comptroller and Auditor General's discretion, of management effectiveness.  I do not think that there can be any dispute over the value of value for money audits as provided for in the Comptroller and Auditor General legislation.</P>
    <P>The reason I oppose this motion is that it is, in effect, an attack on both the statutory independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General and on the functions of the Committee of Public Accounts as laid down in the Standing Orders of this House.  Value for money audits may be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in accordance with the provisions of section 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  The first part of section 9 provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General may carry out such examinations for the purposes of ascertaining whether and to what extent the resources of a Department have been used economically and efficiently.  Deputies will note that the legislation leaves it entirely to the discretion of the Comptroller and Auditor General what examinations he should carry out in his value for money audits.</P>
    <P>Any attempt to direct or to request him to carry out specific examinations of the extent to which the resources of a Department have been used economically and efficiently is an attempt to dilute the statutory independence of this important constitutional office and flouts the intentions, clearly expressed in legislation, of both Houses of the Oireachtas. If some Deputies feel that what has already been legislated for should be changed &mdash; and they are entitled to that view &mdash; the proper course is to introduce an amendment to the Act in question, not to try to achieve the same result by way of motion, which is what we are faced with today.</P>
    <P>The independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General is assured by the fact that he holds a constitutional office, under Article 33 of the Constitution, which also sets down his basic responsibilities. The Constitution provides that <Col N="1145" /> the Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the President on the nomination of Dáil Éireann and shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by both the Dáil and Seanad.  The independence of this Office, enshrined in the Constitution, must be jealously guarded.</P>
    <P>The Constitution provides that the terms and conditions under which the Comptroller and Auditor General carries out his functions shall be determined by law.  The most recent and important statute governing the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General is the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, which came into law in 1993.  When that Act was at the Bill stage, the question of providing a channel of communication between this House and the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to value for money audits was carefully considered and the outcome of that consideration was to make the following statutory provision in the Act:</P>
    <P>Where the Comptroller and Auditor General proposes to make any examination under this section, [that is, to conduct a value for money audit] he may, at his discretion, seek the views of the committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts.</P>
    <P>The lines of communication between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Dáil, which are of long standing, have always been by way of the Committee of Public Accounts whose functions are laid down in Standing Orders.  Everyone agrees that this committee has functioned well over the years and given an excellent service to taxpayers in scrutinising the annual accounts of Government Departments and taking evidence from the accounting officers concerned.  Deputy Gay Mitchell's contribution to the committee, the White Paper and the Act are a tribute to his diligence and efficiency. The Department is grateful for his work, interest and commitment over several <Col N="1146" /> years.  Its terms of reference were amended by motion in this House earlier this year in order to take account of the broadening of the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General and one of the changes made was to include the following:</P>
    <P>The Committee may, without prejudice to the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General in determining the work to be carried out by his Office or the manner in which it is carried out, in private communication, make such suggestions to the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding that work as they see fit.</P>
    <P>Thus, the statutory provision in regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General seeking the views of the Dáil is mirrored by the provision in the committee's terms of reference authorising them to make suggestions to the Comptroller and Auditor General in private communication. The motion totally ignores these arrangements, which were the subject of extensive debate and agreement during the Committee Stage of the 1993 Comptroller and Auditor General legislation.</P>
    <P>This is not the first attempt by Deputies opposite to use the value for money provision as a mechanism for raising matters which should not be brought up in this way.  When the amended terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts were being debated, an amendment was tabled which would have had the effect of involving the Comptroller and Auditor General in an examination of Government plans and policies.  That attempt to draw the Comptroller and Auditor General into an area of policy and political controversy was totally unacceptable and ignored the fact that he is specifically excluded, under statute, from questioning or expressing an opinion on the merits of policies or policy objectives.  On that occasion, the Deputies concerned saw the light and withdrew their amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to make it clear that I will not be drawn into a debate, under the guise of this ill-judged motion, on the value for money represented by professional fees paid by Government Departments, either in general or in regard to a particular case or cases.  To do so would be to ignore the duties and independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the functions of the Committee of Public Accounts and this I will not do.</P>
      <P>This is a debate on a motion that the Dáil should take a certain line of action which I categorically reject.  I have given ample reasons for doing so and I am not prepared to participate in an extension of the debate into an area that does not arise once it is established that the main thrust of the motion is fundamentally flawed.  I ask the House to reject the motion as tabled by approving my amendment.</P>

      <P>Three aspiring MEPs are blatantly and openly using the Committee of Public Accounts to gain publicity; they are organising the agenda of the committee to do this.  One can only imagine what would happen if we directed the Comptroller and Auditor General to become involved in a process outside his present remit.  The Committee of Public Accounts could not operate if the Comptroller and Auditor General could be directed to become involved in a particular process outside his remit.  We are extremely lucky to have a Comptroller and Auditor General who is totally independent in his functions and can give stick when it is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that this motion was put down by two members of a party which I would call the national mishandlers. Deputy Mitchell should ask the amount of money spent by those buckos. We are still paying the price.  Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1987 have turned back the clock in this regard.  Deputies Mitchell and Yates are trying to bash the Government through the auspices of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is very unworthy of both these gentlemen. They are trying to discredit a Government which is responsible for growth in the economy &mdash; it is predicted to grow by 5 per cent &mdash; and for low interest and inflation rates.  This motion can be seen for what it is, a cheap gibe. How can Deputy Mitchell say that the Government is increasing the level of public expenditure?  We are very lucky to have at the top people who have the grit, determination and foresight to ensure <Col N="1150" /> that all sectors operate as efficiently and effectively as possible in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>I want to extol the virtues of the Committee of Public Accounts as it was set up and the wide remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is important to remind Deputy Mitchell, a former chairman who contributed to the expanding role of the committee, that it is possible for the members of the Committee of Public Accounts to suggest to the Comptroller and Auditor General what they want him to do.</P>
    <P>I would be the last person to say I am happy about the level of legal fees which have been paid out and have yet to be paid out to those who have to submit their bills.  Some of the witnesses at the tribunal are now acting as investigators through their membership of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is extraordinary that some of the people who gave evidence at the tribunal are not now willing to admit that they have submitted claims to the chairman of the tribunal, claims which will be paid out of State funds.  Despite documentary evidence that their counsel asked the chairman of the tribunal to ensure that the public defrayed all their costs, even today they denied that they had submitted claims. Some of these people stand by and uphold the dignity of the man in the street, yet they are unwilling to stand up and say what they will cost him.  Some of them made totally unfounded and flawed allegations and incurred massive costs for the State in having this matter investigated. Yet they are now telling us how we should do our business.  This motion is totally flawed, and I support the Government amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and Deputy O'Keeffe for sharing their time with me.  Deputy Mitchell must feel very strongly about this issue to have put down this motion.  He was an excellent chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; I served with him on the committee &mdash; and he played a major role in expanding the functions of the committee during his term as chairman. <Col N="1151" /> However, I cannot support his motion.  I support the amendment which proposes to delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>without in any way approving of, or agreeing with high levels of professional fees, reaffirms the independence conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to value for money audits by section 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, and rejects any attempt to undermine that independence or to override the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts, having regard to section 9 (4) of the Act and paragraph (4) of Standing Order 130.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we have learned many lessons from the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry in regard to fees.  No doubt when that report has been finalised the powers that be will examine the structure and methods by which such fees are struck should a similar circumstance arise in future, with terms of reference clearly laid down in the event of any future tribunals being established.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to some of the background to the role and power of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The office of the Comptroller and Auditor General was provided for originally under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866.  Article 33.1 of the Constitution stipulates:</P>
      <P>There shall be a Comptroller and Auditor General to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution requires the Comptroller and Auditor General to report to the Dáil at stated periods as determined by law.  As a constitutional officer the Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the President on the nomination of the Dáil and holds office until <Col N="1152" /> the retiring age of 70 prescribed by law. He may not be a Member of the Oireachtas, may not hold any other office or position of emolument and cannot be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, then only by the President on foot of resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for his removal.  Thus, under the Constitution the Comptroller and Auditor General enjoys a high degree of independence. The Constitution provides that otherwise the terms and conditions of the office of Comptroller and Auditor General are determined by law.  In this regard, the main statutes are the Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts, 1866 and 1921 and the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts of 1923 and 1964. The Comptroller and Auditor General has approximately 75 staff and the 1992 Estimate for his office amounted to approximately £1.9 million.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago, when Deputy Gay Mitchell was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, a very good submission was prepared with regard to staffing the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As a result of a visit to Canada arranged by Deputy Gay Mitchell, we returned with very good ideas in regard to value for money auditing.  It was recommended that the staff of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be increased substantially to deal with the changing terms of reference, resulting from the Canadian visit.</P>
    <P>The motion, as tabled by Deputies Gay Mitchell and Yates will be covered by the background and role of the Comptroller and Auditor General when he examines the various accounts and is obliged to report thereon over a period. If the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry is published this year it will mean that the Comptroller and Auditor General will be reporting on the 1994 accounts some time in 1995, when I have no doubt there will be reference to the points raised here in regard to fees &mdash; which Members certainly cannot accept &mdash; and that the <Col N="1153" /> Comptroller and Auditor General will deal with that matter in his own way.</P>
    <P>In the background to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General it is said that he audits the accounts of issues from the Central Fund, the Appropriation Accounts, and other accounts attached to the Appropriation Accounts; departmental stock and store accounts; the accounts of the receipts of revenue of the State and, lastly, the accounts of a number of departmental funds, State bodies and other agencies.  The Comptroller and Auditor General also has the right to examine the books and accounts of certain organisations in receipt of public moneys although that right is rarely exercised.  We can depend on the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is a very independent, efficient person, whose integrity is unquestionable with regard to accountability where the State is concerned.  I have no doubt that the point made by Deputy Gay Mitchell will be dealt with by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his own good time when he reports on the accounts for the year 1994.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals have already been made.  With regard to international developments over the past 15 years or so there has been changes in the roles of national auditors of a number of other countries.  There were recommendations a few years ago with a view to having some of those changes embodied in the terms of reference of our Comptroller and Auditor General.  While some changes have evolved over that period, many more remain to be implemented.  It is most important that the expansion of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is examined at this point, giving him any necessary powers he may require.  He is an independent officer, responsible to the Government, should be asked whether he has any recommendations with regard to value for money and, if so, they should be noted.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment and am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House <Col N="1154" /> this evening is timely, useful, and will have the support of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>I listened with considerable interest to the Minister and some of his colleagues. In the manner of his presentation there is certainly a formal, statutory foundation which neatly, even cutely, avoided the central question behind the motion. Indeed I would not be exercising too great a liberty if I interpreted, or implied from the motion, in the minds of its drafters, a view that this suggestion has been put to the House without prejudice to the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  My party will support the motion bearing that interpretation in mind, we will use it as an opportunity to publicly signal our grave discontent with the setting of State professional fees in a way which is designed to be without prejudice to the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Indeed we shall be doing what this House is fully entitled to do &mdash; and must do if it is fulfilling its mandate &mdash; in terms of its integrity, when there are issues of public policy at stake, to signal those issues of concern to those who may address them. Within that context, even if I take a modest liberty in interpreting the specific meaning of the motion, I am sure it is designed on a &ldquo;without prejudice basis&rdquo;, fully respectful, as I know Deputy Mitchell is, of the role and functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When listening to the Minister, a man for whose agility, in political terms, I have great admiration I was reminded, as he wound his way slowly through this text of a single thought, of a presentation by Professor John Kenneth Galbraith, the famous Harvard economist, hired by the BBC some ten to 15 years ago to produce a series called &ldquo;The Age of Uncertainty&rdquo; when he spoke about a former American Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles.  Galbraith said of him, which is apposite to the Minister's presentation here, that his speech was slow but more than kept pace with his thought.  I am not referring to the Minister's ability to prove himself &mdash; as he has done so often in this House &mdash; very agile <Col N="1155" /> on his feet.  His speech was based on a single and narrow thought that took a rather formalistic view of the motion before us and dodged the central political issue.  Because of that formalistic single thought approach he said he would not be drawn into this debate on the issue of substance.  As I see it, he did not even allow himself the liberty to be slightly drawn on the matter.  I commend him and those who advise him in the matter of scripting.  I wonder was it the erstwhile, excellent public service or was it one of those more expensive, hired guns on whom part of this debate is focused.</P>
    <P>The issue of the setting of professional fees by the State is one of grave and serious public disquiet.  It would be a great pity if, in respect of this scandalous situation which is shrouded in fog, indifference, obscurity and so formalistic an approach, with one bound, our hero, the Minister was free.  An issue of substance lies beneath all this.  It concerns the integrity and ability of the House to raise matters of genuine concern in relation to public policy, in this case aspects of public expenditure and to have the integrity of this House respected.</P>
    <P>You will be aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that as recently as this afternoon issues were raised in this House by one Member about his inability to put down certain questions in respect of State fees.  You will be aware also it has been stated more than once, in relation to the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry that it was the failure to answer questions properly in this House that led to the momentum which established that tribunal.  I say that because tonight the way the Minister has gone about his business has been treated blandly.  There is an issue here in respect not just of the integrity of the Comptroller and Auditor General but in terms of the integrity of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe asked how anyone on this side of the House could say that public expenditure has increased since Fianna Fáil came into Government when the contrary is the case.  If he cares to look at the figures for the past two years <Col N="1156" /> he will see that current public expenditure has increased by 17 percentage points in a period when inflation increased by less than 3 percentage points.  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts today he raised the terms of the tribunal and the question of defraying costs.  I thought it curious that the Deputy, after lecturing us on the integrity of the Comptroller and Auditor General, did not observe the same delicacy in commenting on decisions that may be before someone else whose integrity this House has done much to uphold recently.</P>
    <P>This is a timely motion.  The three Es &mdash; economy, efficiency and effectiveness &mdash; and the value for audit checks by the Comptroller must be put in perspective. The motion has in part been sparked off by the beef tribunal and matters surrounding it.  We do not yet know the ultimate fees but it is clear that by any common standard they will be staggeringly high and have become a matter of grave public concern to the point where their scale may well undermine much of the integrity of an exercise which proved necessary in respect of the beef industry.  It is an issue of serious concern that that whole aspect has been treated with such casual indifference by the Minister and other Government speakers. When the State set the fees there was a theory that they would set a fee the market would bear.  If you qualify as a barrister and you are called to the Bar, the Law Library is an open institution, anyone who meets the criteria can go there and practise.  Frankly I question whether the market would have borne something considerably more economic, efficient and effective, in value for money terms, if we had gone out of our way to try to do that.  Certainly lessons need to be learned.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is well placed, not just in terms of the tribunal but in respect of other professional fees determined by the State, to set out a due process which could be followed as a reference point for the setting of future fees.  The fees which will now be paid are, in the public mind, <Col N="1157" /> unsustainably high in terms of any sense of a reasonable rate of return for the job in hand.  For that reason it is right to expect an independent office of State, without prejudicing its independence, to examine this kind of issue of public concern.</P>
    <P>In respect of the three Es &mdash; economy, efficiency and effectiveness &mdash; we have added a few other Es in recent weeks in answer to parliamentary questions where we have moved on to exotic forms of public expenditure, since few were anxious to claim the credit for incurring it in the first instance.  It appears that when many Ministers assume office they are given two cars; one for transport and the other for communications.  In all cases, both prove to be relatively expensive investments.  I would like an opinion, from the Comptroller and Auditor General, so that I will not be accused of playing party politics, on the necessity and justification for this.  There should be an independent and professional opinion on whether we need this.  Do we need to overlap the Government Information Service with the whole panoply of the public service and its expertise or is the public purse reduced to private ministerial propaganda, for people who aggrandise themselves, their egos and their standing at public expense but who do so under the mantle of the public interest?  We have a public service, a Government Information Service and a substantial panoply of expertise and I cannot understand why it was necessary to pay £2.25 million to consultants.</P>
    <P>The programme managers appear to be suffering grave embarrassment at the thought of a premature mid-term review. I understood that they had been hired to iron out the creases but now the creases are so bad it is beyond their capacity and their expensive array of offices and backup to manage this process in a manner satisfactory to their political masters.  On top of the programme managers and the public service there is additional expenditure on consultancy, mostly for PR purposes, of £150,000 per month on average. It is indefensible and it is interesting to note that nobody on the Government <Col N="1158" /> side sought to address the matter.  They adopted a formalistic approach and accused the Opposition of trying to undermine the integrity of an office which we uphold.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise another issue in respect of public expenditure which I described earlier as expenditure which I thought did not fit the boundaries of economy, efficiency and effectiveness but was somewhat more exotic.  Other classes of expenditure associated with the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, which only recently came to light, are not fully accounted for and from which some people in this House who may have been beneficiaries of this expenditure have been anxious to distance themselves.  For example, one economic consultant, recruited for a mere ten days, to produce some economic consultancy for the State's legal team &mdash; and whose fees had not been set in advance &mdash; found that the contract was extended for twice or more the original period, but by the end of the tribunal it was discovered that the consultant had continued for some reason or another for 284 days.  From the public record it appears that Departments were not aware of the work being done by this consultancy.  Certainly some Ministers and politicians who gave evidence before the tribunal were not beneficiaries of the great fruits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not test the patience of the Chair but I am bound to say that the consultancy to which I referred but not named is widely known and is, perhaps, the most exotic of the creatures that have come out from under the stones that Members have tried to turn over in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel perfectly free to comment on a <Col N="1159" /> matter that was raised in this House. I was fascinated to see how adept the Taoiseach was under intense questioning some weeks ago at avoiding any personal responsibility or accountability in political terms for the existence of a consultancy which no-one else could rationally explain.  It is that kind of thing that lies behind the logic of the motion before the House.  It fascinated me how the Minister and his colleagues could adopt a ritualistic and formal approach to the law and accuse this side of the House of trying to undermine and impugn the integrity of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Each Minister gets two cars on assuming office, one of them to handle communications and spin the stories. Ministries are being treated more as fiefdoms than Departments that are directly accountable, a process that has grown up by custom and practice over the years. Very few matters of public substance are ever launched in this House, which is meant to be the form of our democracy. Ministers make announcements and surround themselves with all the pomp of expensive back drops.  They have auto-cues so that they do not fluff their lines for the six o'clock and nine o'clock news bulletins and by so doing avoiding their essential accountability to this House.</P>
    <P>The failure to keep this House as a core of the democratic process and instead surround Ministers with the panoply of spin doctors and so on is an assault on the integrity of this House.  The Minister's refusal tonight to be drawn on the issue of substance is an insult to the integrity of this House.  The House has got to make it clear that in the matter of State professional fees there is grave public disquiet which is undermining the authority and the standing of politics.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to answers.  In this motion we are flagging certain questions that demand serious independent answers and, without wishing to prejudice the independence of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, for which we have such respect, we are calling on him to look at these matters.</P>

      <P>The issue before us this evening is about openness, transparency and ethics in Government.  We heard a great deal about ethics in Government during the general election of November 1992.  We heard a great deal about ethics in Government after the election but agreement has not yet been reached on the publication of the ethics in Government Bill.  After the gestation period one would have thought that the partners in Government would have come to a conclusion on this important issue by this stage.  A cynicism has grown up among the general public about politics and politicians and about the apparent looseness of State expenditure programmes and the appointment of professionals commanding high fees without any accountability to this House.</P>
      <P>If we had proper disclosure of the information sought in this House the tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry and into Greencore would not have to be established and we would not have incurred such high professional fees. That is sad reflection on politics.  It is a sad reflection on this House that the power of the parliamentary question and the importance of this assembly was undermined to the extent that an expensive procedure had to be established outside this House in order to come to the truth on many issues that are now before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an indictment of the people responsible for sanctioning fees in the first instance that barristers and accountants were able to command fees of £1,750 per day.  It is not good enough that the Minister tables an amendment that neither agrees nor disagrees with the high level of professional fees sanctioned by the Government.  He does not mind whether we approve or disapprove of the <Col N="1161" /> high level of professional fees but talks in a spurious way about reaffirming the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is not in question. The question is whether the State should incur on behalf of the taxpayer the huge professional fees sanctioned by this and previous Governments in respect of expensive inquiries.</P>
    <P>I have a vested interest in the insurance industry.  The State pays enormous fees and does nothing to reduce the high legal costs incurred in settling claims in spite of many promises by the then Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan.  He asserted that insurance premia could be reduced overnight by lowering the commissions being paid to intermediaries and by introducing the one counsel rule. Nothing like that has happened.  Ireland is treated as a high risk location.  People are losing jobs and firms are unable to pay the insurance costs which are high because of the number of claims and the level of fees.  The State stands idly by and allows that to happen.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say he does not know whether he agrees with the level of fees, the Government sanctioned those fees.  The public is outraged at the fees charged for State work.  It is time a procedure was put in place to stop this.  The looseness surrounding the scrutiny of public expenditure programmes is distasteful.  The examinations of the Committee of Public Accounts are purely a historical record of moneys spent instead of scrutinising money about to be spent.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for enabling me to raise this important issue, the decision of the Higher Education Authority to limit the intake of students into all universities both last year and this year and the adverse impact this will inevitably have on education.  I appeal <Col N="1162" /> to the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, to enter into discussions with the Higher Education Authority with a view to having this decision reversed and the quota lifted to enable students to proceed with post-primary teacher training.</P>
      <P>This decision was both ill-advised and short-sighted.  It was also grossly unfair to the many students who had already undertaken arts degree courses with the clear intention of obtaining a professional teaching qualification and proceeding therefrom to pursue a career in education.</P>
      <P>In relation to UCC the quota for 1994 is 185 places.  This represents a reduction of almost 50 per cent on the intake for 1993.  As 546 people have applied for places it now emerges that 361 graduates have been turned away and their career ambitions have been dashed.  Today I spoke with the registrar in UCG where the position is equally critical.  Both colleges have the capacity, in terms of staff and other resources, to cater for a much larger number of students who wish to take the Higher Diploma in Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the Higher Education Authority can only be described as arbitrary given that the OECD review of Irish education policy published in 1991, the Green Paper on <i>Education for a Changing World</i> published in 1992 and the report of the National Convention on Education published in 1994 have explicitly recommended further investment in the teaching force.  Moreover the decision of the Higher Education Authority contradicts the existing commitment, as detailed in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government,</i> and makes a nonsense of the Government's stated commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, introduce new programmes at senior cycle, provide additional career guidance, remedial, home-school-community liaison teachers and additional teachers in certain subjects, <Col N="1163" /> specifically science and technology and modern European languages.</P>
    <P>This is the first time we have ever said that we will no longer train teachers who might wish to teach abroad.  On this historic day we should acknowledge the contribution which has been made by Irish missionary teachers, both male and female, to the development of education in South Africa and to the putting in place of a skilled workforce which will help to make a democratic South Africa a reality. Is the Higher Education Authority now saying that we will never again train a second level teacher who may wish to pursue a teaching career in the third world or to further education abroad? It was a bad decision for teachers and education, both at home and abroad.  I appeal strongly to the Minister to enter into discussions with the Higher Education Authority with a view to having the quota lifted and providing places in universities for graduates who wish to pursue a career in teaching and qualify as second level teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to set the record straight.  The Minister for Education is aware that in general applications for places on courses for the higher diploma in education exceed the number of places which are available under a quota system set by the Higher Education Authority.  This situation is not by any means unique.  It applies in medicine, for example, where over ten years ago a quota of places for each medical school was fixed in the light of the needs of the health service.  Deputy Quill will be no doubt aware that even taking account of the impact of the six year cycle, demographic trends indicate that student numbers at second level will have decreased by up to 24,000 by the end of the century and this decline will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of students taking <Col N="1164" /> the higher diploma in education course in the five university education departments decreased from 1,338 in the academic year 1980-81 to 601 in the academic year 1990-91.  This decrease paralleled and probably reflected a decline in teaching opportunities in second level schools.  A survey by the Higher Education Authority indicated that of 675 students conferred with the higher diploma in education in 1990 only 28 got permanent teaching posts in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the light of the fall in demand for the courses for the higher diploma in education, the declining employment prospects in second level teaching, the demographic trends and the fact that there are five university education departments, the then Minister asked the Higher Education Authority to look into the matter with a view to rationalisation. The Higher Education Authority came to the conclusion that a significant reduction was needed in the number of places being offered for the higher diploma in education. Accordingly, the Higher Education Authority set a quota of 500 for the academic year 1992-93.  This quota, however, was not implemented because of the late stage at which the decision was arrived at and pressure from the universities for adequate notice.  The introduction of a quota system was deferred for two years.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority set up a committee representative of the Committee of Heads of Irish Universities, the Higher Education Authority itself, and the Department.  This committee, having taken all relevant factors into consideration, prepared a report for the Higher Education Authority in which it recommended the introduction of a quota of 800 places for the higher diploma in education course for the 1994-95 academic year.  The Higher Education Authority accepted this recommendation and the quota was broken down over the five university education departments as follows: UCD, <Col N="1165" /> 170; UCC, 185; UCG, 185; TCD, 110; and Maynooth, 150.</P>
    <P>Other than to emphasise the need to secure a reasonable spread over the various disciplines relevant to second level teaching, neither the Higher Education Authority nor the Department was involved in determining the criteria for the selection of students for the available places.  The matter will be kept under review and the representative committee which I have already mentioned will come together in the autumn of 1994 to review the operation of the quota system in 1994 and to determine a quota for the 1995-96 academic year.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to raise this matter.  There are 102 pupils in Letterfrack national school which at present has four teachers and a remedial teacher who also serves five other schools in the area.  This is a three classroom school, with the fourth class being taught in the porch.  The school needs an extra classroom and a general purpose room for a resource teacher and other activities.  Unlike many other rural areas, the population of that part of west Connemara has been increasing since 1971 and enrolment to the school indicates that the present quota of four teachers will be retained.  Therefore, extra space is required in the school.</P>
      <P>There has been significant self-development in the area over the years and Connemara West Development, based in the old reformatory in Letterfrack, is a model project in that regard from which the forum development project, which is part of the Combat Poverty Agency, evolved.  The national park attracts a large number of tourists and has contributed to the development of the economy of that part of Connemara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extra classrooms should be provided for Letterfrack school so that the children attending the school have adequate accommodation.  Delays of up to five <Col N="1166" /> years in the provision of school accommodation can have adverse effects when the average primary school cycle is also eight years.  Will the Minister of State look favourably on the provision of extra accommodation in the school in question?</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for raising this issue.  I am glad of the opportunity afforded me by the Deputy of outlining to the House and through the Deputy to the people, teachers and board of management of Letterfrack the Department of Education's position in relation to this school.</P>
      <P>Letterfrack national school currently has four teachers and a shared remedial teacher.  Two of the appointments &mdash; the remedial teacher and the third assistant &mdash; were made in the first term of the current school year.  In anticipation of the increased demand which these appointments would have on the available classroom space in the school the board of management applied for grant aid for the provision of a further classroom.</P>
      <P>The Department's professional advisers were asked to report on the application and they recommended as an interim measure the adaptation of the existing facilities to accommodate the two extra teachers.  This recommendation was accepted by the Department and grant-aid was sanctioned accordingly.  I understand that this work is now satisfactorily completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the longer term provision, the Department decided to re-evaluate the needs of the school and sought reports from its local architectural adviser and from the local inspectorate. These reports are now to hand and are <Col N="1167" /> under consideration in the Department.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested in relation to cattle prices is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the development in cattle prices between 1992, which was the last year prior to the introduction of CAP reform, and 1994; prices for steers, heifers, cows and calves have increased by 8 per cent, 16 per cent, 21 per cent and 15 per cent respectively in the first quarter of 1994 compared to the corresponding period in 1992.</P>
      <P>The 1992 CAP reform package provided for substantial increases in premium payments to farmers.  The maximum payable on a steer at 1994 premium rates is £205.04 per head.  This consists of the special beef premium of £73.23 per head which is payable at 10 months and 22 months and the extensification premium, which amounts to £29.29 per head and which is also payable at both 10 months and 22 months on steers in holdings with a stocking density of less than 1.4 livestock units per hectare. In addition, steers slaughtered in the period 1 January &mdash; 30 April, 1994 can qualify for a deseasonalisation premium worth £58.58 per head.  This brings the maximum premium payable on steers at 1994 rates to £263.62 per head compared to £35.15 per head in 1992.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> In the meantime I reiterate the Government's commitment in the National Development Plan that, in drawing up Structural Funds programmes, there will be no direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of gender.  In the case of the operational programme prepared by my Department, data relating to participation by gender in each measure will be maintained and monitored to highlight, for example, possible instances of indirect discrimination in the eligibility criteria of schemes.  The final reports of the consultants evaluating the operational programme for rural development and Leader I, due shortly, are expected to consider the extent to which these programmes met the needs of rural women. Their findings will be taken account of in implementing the new programmes.</P>
    <P>Teagasc training programmes emphasise the importance of involving women in the decision making process relating to agriculture and rural development.  All their training courses are equally open to men and women and their promotional material refers specifically to the suitability of courses for women.  When we have available the results of a study under the EU initiative NOW &mdash; New Opportunities for Women &mdash; to determine the type of courses rural women most require and how participation by women in Teagasc courses could be improved, appropriate action will be taken to implement the findings.</P>
    <P>In January I established a rural training advisory committee to implement the report of the review group on rural development training produced last year. The committee, which includes representatives of the ICA and the Council for the Status of Women, is considering how best the courses recommended by the review group can be made equally accessible to women and men.</P>

I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome to this review by speculating on the measures which may or may not be considered desirable.

      <P>From Monday, 14 February 1994, my Department's local offices, the special beef premium unit in Portlaoise and the Castlebar office have been open to the public between the hours of 9.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m.  Previously, the local offices were open to the public between 10 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. and 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.  The special beef premium unit and the Castlebar office were previously open between the hours of 9.15 a.m. and 12.45 p.m. and 2 p.m. and 5.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure was taken specifically to <Col N="1004" /> facilitate final processing of the 1993 headage and premium schemes and to expedite payments of grants under the schemes.  Considerable progress has been made on this front.  The position in relation to opening hours is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of staffing, my Department has recently assigned 58 additional temporary staff to local offices and the special beef premium unit to assist in the processing of payments and a further 12 temporary staff are in the process of being recruited.  In addition, I have set up a special unit in this Department to deal with area aid applications. I believe that this level of staffing is adequate to deal with queries arising.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU regulations licences are required for the import of certain agricultural products from non-member states.  Licences are issued subject to the lodging of a security so as to guarantee that the undertaking to import is fulfilled. In the case of certain agricultural products, such as bananas, import licences are issued to importers within the framework of a quota.  Where a licence issued within this quota is lost, a relacement licence cannot be provided by the issuing authority.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances a duplicate licence may be issued but only for the purpose of seeking a refund for that part of the security pertaining to the quantity, if any, of the product which has already been imported under the licence.  Duplicate licences cannot, however, be used for import operations.</P>

      <P>Ireland's diplomatic network, both resident and nonresident, is small and must remain so for the foreseeable future, given our limited financial and personnel resources.  Possibilities for its extension are considered from time to time in the light of our national and international interests and the availability of the necessary resources.  It would be contrary to international practice to discuss publicly the establishment of diplomatic relations with any particular country, since any decision in this regard must first be made by agreement with the Government concerned.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case in question and of the concerns to which it has given rise.  My Department and our Embassy in London have followed developments in this case closely, including the individual's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction in 1988.  An official from our embassy in London recently visited the individual to discuss his current conditions and situation.  On foot of that meeting, the Embassy have taken up with the British authorities some issues of a consular nature raised by the individual, including his request for a transfer to a prison in Northern Ireland.  The embassy will continue to monitor closely developments in this case.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank supervises the building societies under the Building Societies Act, 1989.  That Act lays down the procedures to be followed by a building society which proposes to convert to a public limited company, including a requirement that a conversion scheme be confirmed by the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, the Central Bank is required to consider any objections or representations from the public in respect of a proposed conversion and is also required to allow the society to comment on these objections or representations.  I understand that, in the case of the Irish Permanent Building Society, this process is currently underway and that when the Bank has completed the process it will decide, in accordance with the Act, whether or not to confirm the conversion of that Society.  The Central Bank is independent in the exercise of its supervisory functions under the Act.  The Act also provides a means wherby members of a society who consider that their rights are not being vindicated in the conversion scheme can challenge the scheme in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at present aware of any issues arising from the above process which would require a revision in the legislation. <Col N="1013" /> Legislation in relation to building societies is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The C45 scheme for sub-contractors was introduced in 1970 to counter tax evasion in the building industry.  The sub-contract system has always been a feature of the building industry.  The 1970 legislation recognised this and sought to ensure that tax due from the sub-contracting section of the industry would be collected.  The mechanism for collection was a withholding tax deducted from payments made to sub-contractors unless those sub-contractors had received a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners authorising payments to be made gross.</P>
      <P>The C45 system should not be availed of in situations where the employer-employee rules should apply.  As part of their audit programmes the Revenue Commissioners seek to ensure that the C45 system is not used inappropriately. Since the trade union concerns came to light the Revenue Commissioners have been more vigilant to ensure that there is no abuse of the system.</P>
      <P>Allegations of abuse of the C45 scheme were raised with me at a meeting which I had with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In my discussions with Congress I explained that arising from the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> I have asked the Black Economy Monitoring Group &mdash; composed of employer, trade union, revenue and social welfare representatives &mdash; to carry out a thorough review of the operation of the C45 system and to make recommendations on action to curb any abuses and to improve the system generally.  The group is due to report in July this year.  Any legislative action should be based on full knowledge. The group's recommendations will provide this knowledge following an in-depth review of the entire system.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also been asked to take measures to ensure that the system is applied only to genuine sub-contract situations and are having discussions with the Department of Social Welfare to see if procedures can be strengthened further.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 97 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware Community Support Frameworks are broad statements of priorities and commitments and the indicative amounts of Community assistance contained in them may be subject to adjustment during the implementation period.  For Ireland, the CSF amount expressed in 1994 prices is 5.62 billion ECU or IR£4.54 billion, using the central rate for the IR£-ECU</P>
      <P>As regards the Cohesion Fund the position is in line with the National Development Plan.  Cohesion Fund resources over the period 1994-99 are expected to be over IR£1 billion in 1994 prices.  This is based on the expectations of a 9 per cent share of the Cohesion Fund for 1994-99 in line with the share which Ireland obtained in 1993.</P>
      <P>In relation to Community Initiatives it should be noted that the EU's amended Structural Fund regulations stipulate that 9 per cent of the commitment appropriations for the Structural Funds shall be devoted to funding Community Initiatives.  No allocations to member states have yet been made.  However, Ireland expects to get a share in line with its CSF share.</P>

      <P>Secretarial assistants are employed by political parties and by individual members of Dáil Éireann and no change in this position would arise from the Bill to which the Deputy refers.  That Bill, as explained when it was before this House, was drafted to ensure that such employment was on a constitutionally unimpeachable basis and to eliminate misunderstandings of the status of such staff which had come to light during High Court proceedings.  My understanding is that the union which represents many of the staff currently employed and the Whips are in discussion under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. It would be inappropriate for officials of my Department to involve themselves in that process.</P>
      <P>I indicated to Deputies last November that not proceeding with all stages of the Bill before the Christmas recess would make it difficult to enact it in the current Dail session.  That position still obtains.</P>

      <P>She is casually employed, working two days per week and being paid unemployment assistance for four days at the maximum daily rate appropriate in her case of £9.87.</P>
      <P>As part of the Department's strategy of improving its level of service for unemployed persons, a new system of payment for people engaged in casual employment is being introduced.  Under these new arrangements, customers are paid weekly by cheque and the requirement to attend their local Social Welfare Office each week to sign-on and collect a cash payment is removed.</P>
      <P>A cash payment in respect of unemployment assistance for the unemployment week ending 12 April 1994 was made to the person concerned by the local office on 12 April.</P>
      <P>A cheque payment for unemployment week ending 19 April issued on 22 April 1994, while a further cheque for payment due on week ending 26 April 1994 issued on 29 April.  When the person concerned called to the local office on 5 May and stated that the cheque had not arrived a cash payment was issued to her.  A cheque payment due in respect of unemployment week ending 3 May was issued on 6 May.  While it is accepted that there was a delay in the payment due during the change-over period, it was not considered necessary that claimants be paid a double week.  This is a once-off situation associated with the introduction of the new and improved procedures.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was advised of the new payment procedures before cheque payments were introduced.  She did not suffer a loss of payment in the change-over to the new system.</P>

      <P>Under section 54 of the Courts Officers Act, 1926 the powers, duties, authorities, rights and obligations of under-sheriffs are vested in county registrars. County registrars are appointed by and hold office at the pleasure of the Government in accordance with the provisions of section 35 (2) of the 1926 Act. A person who is a solicitor of not less than 8 years standing who is then actually practising or has previously practised or who has been a county registrar is qualified for appointment as a county registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1946 empowers me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to revoke the <Col N="1026" /> provisions of section 54 of the 1926 Act in respect of any county or county borough and for the Government to appoint a person to be sheriff of such county or county borough.  This has been done in the cases of Cork county and county borough and Dublin county and county borough. Sheriffs hold office at the will and pleasure of the Government.  A person who is a practising barrister or a solicitor for not less than five years or has acted for not less than five years as a managing clerk or principal assistant to a sheriff is qualified for appointment as a sheriff.</P>
    <P>The salary of county registrars is paid from public funds.  Sheriffs appointed to Cork county and county borough and Dublin county under the provisions of section 12 of the 1945 Act receive £400 per annum from public funds and the sheriff for Dublin county borough receives £600 per annum.  Sheriffs appointed under the 1945 Act have an additional income from statutory fees, poundage and from bank interest.</P>
    <P>With regard to the enforcement of court orders the sheriff is answerable only to the Court.  However, section 12 (6) (d) of the Court Officer's Act, 1945 requires each sheriff to furnish annual or other returns and such accounts as may be directed by me from time to time.  Section 12 (6) (e) of the above Act allows me to authorise visits to the offices of any sheriff to examine the accounts and the work carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Measures to prevent and combat juvenile crime are put in place by my Department on an ongoing basis.  In relation to the Garda Síochana, the juvenile liaison scheme was reformed in 1991 and significant improvements were introduced. A juvenile diversion programme was established, the main purpose of which is to ensure that, where possible, juveniles would be cautioned rather than prosecuted.</P>
      <P>I also announced funding recently, in the context of the crime fighting package, for a pilot scheme involving juvenile liaison officers and professional social workers to concentrate on the drug problems among juveniles at risk in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As recommended in the report of the Joint Committee and the report of the Interdepartmental Group on Urban Crime and Disorder, the Garda Síochána has become involved in community-based projects.  The GRAFT Project in Ronanstown and the KEY Project in Killinarden have been very successful in diverting young people away from crime. I have provided £100,000 in the crime fighting package in order to establish <Col N="1028" /> additional projects throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Programme for Government contains the commitment &ldquo;to introduce a modern Juvenile Justice Bill, as part of a comprehensive programme of criminal law reform&rdquo; and I want to assure the Deputy that that commitment will be honoured. Some of the recommendations of the report of the Select Committee on Crime entitled &ldquo;Juvenile Crime &mdash; its Causes and its Remedies&rdquo; have significance for legislation and in that context they are being borne in mind in the preparation of the juvenile justice legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards custodial measures for juveniles, it is my Department's policy to develop community-based options for the special needs of young persons coming into contact with the juvenile justice system.  Towards this end, a number of hostels, workshops and day attendance facilities have been established under the aegis of my Department's Probation and Welfare Service to direct youngsters in trouble from a life of crime.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a range of strategies are needed to cater for differing young persons who are &ldquo;at risk&rdquo;. These strategies cover the care and control needs of the child which are the responsibility of a number of agencies and the Departments of Health, Education and Justice.  My Department regards it as a priority to have effective arrangements in place between relevant agencies with a view to improving the community and residential options available to the courts.  My Department is pursuing this through meetings and contact with Departments of Education and Health.</P>

In fact the employment subsidy scheme which was introduced in February, 1992, for a period of one year only with EU agreement and financial assistance, closed for applications on 26 February, 1993.  All sectors including the Construction Industry were eligible for assistance under the scheme which subsidised employers who provided full-time employment opportunities for people on the Live Register for at least eight weeks. The subsidy was for 1 year provided those recruited were retained in employment for 78 weeks.  Payments are still on-going in respect of applications submitted prior to the closing date of 26 February, 1993. About 8,500 unemployed people were recruited under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Planning permission is required <Col N="1035" /> for initial afforestation where the area involved is greater than 200 hectares and developments of this nature are subject to environmental impact assessment through the planning process.  In addition, section 21 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act, 1990, empowers a local authority to make, with the approval of the Minister for the Environment, by-laws for preventing or eliminating the entry of polluting matter to waters from certain uses of land, including forestry.</P>
      <P>A review of the various controls which apply to forestry development is being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; the relevant planning and environmental controls will be considered in that context in consultation with my Department.</P>

Some 2,000 Atlantic salmon were vaccinated for the trial and held in a specially constructed isolation unit at the SRA facilities at Newport, County Mayo.  The outflow water from the unit was sterilised in accordance with the terms of an experimental licence issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  In accordance with the terms of the experimental <Col N="1038" /> licence, all fish were slaughtered on conclusion of the trial and hygienically disposed of on-land in an approved manner.

      <P>The Sea Trout Working Group, whose report of the 1993 sea trout research programme was published last February, has been continuing its evaluation of ongoing scientific work into the causes of the sea trout decline.</P>
      <P>The working group has reported to the Department on progress on some of the work undertaken so far this year, namely, further analysis of currently available data which, as noted in the Sea Trout Task Force report, provides a stronger statistical indication of a relationship between lice infestations on sea trout and distance from salmon farms.  Further analytical work is being carried out on this and other hypotheses about the role of sea lice in sea trout declines.  The most current research findings are being prepared for publication in the scientific literature and will be forwarded, in the first instance, for consideration by the successor body to the task force which is being put in place without delay.</P>
      <P>While the need for continued research on all aspects of the sea trout problem is acknowledged, the first and most immediate priority is the practical framework for action recommended by the task force, notably to ensure the effectiveness of measures to control sea lice levels.</P>

      <P>The person named has already been paid full grants under the 1993 cattle and equines headage and January-February 1993 special beef premium schemes.  He did not apply for grants under the special beef premium scheme in the June 1993 and November 1993 application periods. He did, however, apply for premium on five animals under the February 1994 special beef premium scheme.  Under EU regulations payments under this scheme cannot commence before 1 November 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions governing the allocation of ewe premium quotas from the national reserve provide for quotas to be granted to the following categories of producers in descending order of priority&mdash;</P>
      <P>Category 1</P>
      <P>(a)  flockowners whose application for the ewe premium in 1991, due to exceptional circumstances, did not correspond to the true situation of their holdings in previous years;</P>
      <P>(b)  flockowners who have regularly submitted an application for the ewe premium (including in 1992) but who have not done so in 1991;</P>
      <P>(c)  flockowners who were paid the ewe premium in 1991 but did not apply in 1992 due to exceptional circumstances;</P>
      <P>(d)  flockowners who submitted an application for the ewe premium for the first time in 1992 or subsequent years and who meet the following conditions:</P>
      <P>&mdash;are under 35 years of age,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" />&mdash;their total household income is less than £14,822 per annum,</P>
    <P>&mdash;at least 50 per cent of their total income is derived from farming,</P>
    <P>&mdash;and have the following educational qualifications</P>
    <P>(i)  if born after 1 January 1968, must have (a) obtained the Teagasc Certificate in farming or a higher qualification or (b) have 3 years practical experience in farming and have satisfactorily completed a course of training in farming of a minimum duration of 150 hours, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  if born before 1 January 1968, meet the requirements outlined in (i) or have 5 years practical experience in farming.</P>
    <P>Category 2</P>
    <P>Flockowners who can demonstrate that the operation of the quota limits will jeopardise the viability of their holdings and who have embarked on (i) a farm improvement plan involving sheep production drawn up by 1 January 1993 or (ii) a finance restructuring plan related to sheep production drawn up in conjunction with Teagasc by 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>Only those flockowners where the total household income is less than £14,822 per annum may qualify for an allocation of reserve quota under this category.</P>
    <P>Category 3</P>
    <P>Flockowners who have acquired land formerly used for sheep production by other producers.</P>
    <P>Flockowners who applied for the ewe premium for the first time in 1992 (Category 4) shall have priority access to quota which would have been allocated to flockowners who applied for the premium in 1991 but who, having ceased sheep farming, did not apply for the ewe premium in 1992 and whose holding was not taken over by another flockowner.</P>
    <P>The total number of applications for ewe premium reserve quota received from flockowners in County Tipperary South Riding was 241 of which 78 were successful.</P>
    <P>Applicants were unsuccessful because <Col N="1049" /> they did not qualify under any of the categories outlined above or because they already had sufficient quota to cover the number of ewes applied for in respect of the 1993 ewe premium scheme.</P>
    <P>The number of applications received from flockowners in County Tipperary South Riding as a percentage of the total number of applications received nationally for ewe premium reserve quota was 2.23 per cent and the total number of successful applications received from applicants in Tipperary South Riding as a percentage of the total number of successful applications nationally was 2 per cent.</P>

      <P>Adverse weather conditions must be regarded as a normal risk inherent in tillage production. Cereals yield in general were <Col N="1051" /> lower than normal in 1993 with losses of varying degrees being experienced. However, these losses were substantially offset by higher than expected prices and by area aid payments amounting to almost £46 million.</P>
      <P>The need for assistance for cereal producers has been further assessed by my Department.  I am satisfied that the overall scale of the problem is not sufficient to warrant financial assistance even if funding were available.  While there were some localised losses incurred in sugar beet the position does not warrant compensation because overall returns were satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Implementation of some of the recommendations in the report of the group (i.e. those relating to choices within the <Col N="1057" /> structure of the telephone bill) is a matter of day-to-day administration of the Board of Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>Provision of &ldquo; 1850 &rdquo; numbers</P>
      <P>Regarding the group's recommendation that &ldquo; 1850 &rdquo; numbers should be provided by Government Departments/Offices and the like, my understanding is that most, if not all, Departments have streamlined their handling of telephone contact with the general public in a way that is intended to keep costs for those calling in at a minimum.  However, the &ldquo;1850&rdquo; service provided by Telecom Éireann is a premium rate service in which the charge to the recipient of the call is substantially higher than the normal cost of an equivalent call.  It is essentially a matter for each Government Department to decide, as a customer of Telecom Éireann, whether or not it wishes to provide this service to the public and whether or not it can, within the confines of its administrative budget, bear the additional costs involved.  I understand that a number of Departments, including my own, have examined the possibility of introducing the 1850 service and concluded, on cost grounds, that they could not justify making it generally available.</P>
      <P>Payphones</P>
      <P>I have noted the issues raised by the group in relation to payphones and I will keep the matter under review.</P>
      <P>Telecommunications Regulatory Authority</P>
      <P>I have stated on a number of occasions that it is my intention to establish an independent regulatory authority for the telecommunications sector as soon as possible.  I welcome the group's suggestions in relation to the powers that might be conferred upon the authority and I will take them into consideration in framing its remit.</P>

The Minister placed the agreement on the record of the House on 17 December 1991 and informed the House that he had introduced an amendment to the Bill giving effect to the Government's commitments <Col N="1059" /> in the agreement with the trade union movement.</P>
      <P>While it would be inappropriate to me to comment on the operations of ICG or B &amp; I Line, which are both privately owned, I would point out that ICG has invested a total of £134 million since the purchase of B &amp; L Line.  Of this amount, £79 million has been invested in B &amp; I Line divisions to expand, refurbish and modernise its services.</P>

      <P>Counselling is available to those who have tested positive for hepatitis C under the national screening programme.  Many people are counselled by their own general practitioner, but may be referred by their general practitioners for counselling to a medical counsellor at the Blood Transfusion Service Board or may themselves elect to attend the medical counsellors at the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board is providing counselling at its headquarters in Dublin and at the regional centre in Cork.</P>
      <P>Counselling is offered at all stages of the screening.</P>
      <P>Treatment for those who test positive for hepatitis C antibodies is being provided at the following six hospitals: St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; Beaumont Hospital Dublin; Mater Hospital, Dublin; St. James's Hospital, Dublin; Cork Regional Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>The treatment initially involves an outpatient visit at a special consultant staffed clinic which may be followed by a short admission for clinical investigation and follow-up treatment, if required.  The treatment is being provided by the public hospital service free of charge.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176, 177, 179 and 180 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any European Union Directive on cardiac ambulances.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in November 1993, I launched a report of the review group on the ambulance service and announced a major programme to develop the country's ambulance service. The review group produced a very comprehensive list of recommendations covering all aspects of the service, including pre-hospital cardiac care.  These recommendations form the basis of Government policy for the development of the ambulance service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the launching of the report I stated that I would provide funding for the implementation of the recommendations of the report over the next five years.  As a first step, £500,000 was immediately made available to health boards for the development of ambulance services. <Col N="1063" /> The Southern Health Board was allocated £75,000 for improvements to equipment, communications and staff facilities.  Health boards will shortly be notified of their allocations for the further development of the ambulances service this year.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, the Southern Health Board has commenced implementation of a programme for the development of its cardiac ambulances service.  The programme commenced in November 1992 and was completed in March 1994.  A total of 25 ambulances have been equipped and 106 personnel members have been trained in defibrillation and emergency pre-hospital cardiac care.  The cost of the programme, including training, was approximately £305,000.</P>

The provision of a tracing service for adoptees must, of necessity, be afforded lesser priority than child abuse cases and can be undertaken at present only where <Col N="1065" /> information is readily available and where the circumstances are straightforward. Any proposal received from the Eastern Health Board for the provision of an enhanced social work support service to parties to legal adoptions arranged by that board will receive sympathetic consideration in the context of further service developments in the child care area over the next two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned. I have made inquiries from the Mater Hospital and I have been informed <Col N="1066" /> that this person has been on the waiting list for cardiac by-pass surgery since 15 February 1994.  The hospital is unable at this stage to give a precise admission date for his operation.  However, if the person feels that his condition has deteriorated he should contact his general practitioner who would be in the best position to highlight his case to his consultant.</P>
      <P>In 1993, I allocated a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund to enable the facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital.  In addition, in 1993, I provided capital funds which will facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200-400 patients each year.</P>
      <P>The major programme of refurbishment at the National Cardiac Surgical Centre is ongoing.  I allocated in excess of £2 million in 1994 to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.  The development which is nearing completion includes additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme, including heart transplantation.</P>
      <P>This development, together with the developments in progress for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital, will have the effect of increasing the number of open heart surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent.</P>

Waterford Regional Technical College also offers a third year add-on national diploma in construction studies, architectural technology, to those <Col N="1072" /> students who have acquired the national certificate with a merit grade, minimum 60 per cent which enables them to progress in Waterford to the higher qualification.</P>
      <P>The pass level for the award of the diploma in all colleges is 40 per cent. The only instance where the 60 per cent minimum is required is in the case of students progressing to the higher level diploma course from the national certificate course.

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous <Col N="1073" /> year.  In the case of St. Marnock's national school there were 672 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1992 which warrants a staff of principal plus 21 assistants for the 1993-94 school year.  The school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>There were 592 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1993 which warrants a staff of principal plus 18 assistants for the 1994-95 school year.  The school would have needed an enrolment of at least 595 pupils in order to retain the post of 19th assistant in 1994-95.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements are in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes are being breached.

      <P>The certificate examinations involve a number of assessment modes, including written examinations, oral and aural examinations and practical tests.  I assume that the question refers to assessments which are conducted and marked by examiners who meet the candidates in the course of the assessment.</P>
      <P>The assessments in question are the oral examinations for the leaving certificate, which are held in March-April, the leaving certificate practical examination in music, which is held in March, the junior certificate practical examination in local studies, which is held in June, and the new junior certificate practical examinations in home economics and music, which are scheduled to be held in the period between March and the end of May.  All of these examinations are held in school time but the examination in local studies, which is an option within the science syllabus, is held at a time when examination classes only are in attendance in schools.  Only about 1,200 students in 46 schools take the local studies option.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the increasing concern of parents and school authorities about the impact of examinations which are held prior to June on the instruction time available to students.  The arrangements introduced this year for the new junior certificate practicals in home economics and music followed extensive discussions with the managerial authorities and teacher unions and were intended to allow for significant flexibility in the scheduling of these tests with a view to minimum impact on instruction time. These were introduced on a pilot basis for 1994 only and will be reviewed and evaluated.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has recently published a consultative document on assessment and certification in the senior cycle.

    <P>It is not possible at this early stage to give any details in relation to the average cost of installing a phone, fax and modem for these schools.  My Department proposes to bulk purchase the equipment by inviting tenders in accordance with the standard procedures governing the public procurement of computer equipment.  I have provided for a maximum expenditure of £36,000 to cover the purchase of equipment and the cost of telephone installation where necessary.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the requirement for induction in the use of the equipment will vary from school to school and my officials will assess the requirements in consultation with the school authorities involved.  The provision being made relates to the initial installation costs.  I do not anticipate that the nature of the proposed equipment will give rise to any significant recurring costs which the schools will be unable to meet in the ordinary course.</P>
    <P>Pending the final arrangements for the installation of a phone, fax and modem on the island schools, it is not possible to give the estimated cost of installing such equipment in all of the 116 one teacher schools in the State.</P>

      <P>There are no statistics available at present on the number of schools visited by each post primary inspector in any particular year.  In the year 1992-93 the inspectors made a total of 769 schools visits.  This included schools which were visited by more than one inspector. About half of these visits involved subject inspection which included looking at the work of about 1,300 teachers.  In other cases the overall work of the schools was inspected and some visits were in response to requests for assistance.</P>
      <P>Oral, aural and practical examinations and projects accounted for 127 visits. Other visits related to educational research and development, gathering data for the Department and dealing with arrangements for pupils with special needs.  Because of their heavy and increasing involvement in examination work it was not possible for inspectors to spend as much time in schools as I would like.  However, new mechanisms were put in place during the current school year for streamlining the production of examination papers, which should have the effect of freeing the inspectors to spend more time in schools.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the number of teachers working in second level schools who have never had an inspection from any member of the inspectorate.  A different process exists between vocational education committee schools and other second-level schools.  In the vocational education committee sector the role of the inspectorate is governed by statute. Individual teachers are inspected with more or less regularity depending on the number of inspectors involved in the various subject specialisms and the other demands made on their time.  In other second-level schools, the emphasis is on inspection of the various subjects as in the school as a whole.  The work of individual teachers is looked at as part of this process.</P>
      <P>Post primary inspectors are very heavily involved at the various stages of preparing, monitoring and marking the annual State examinations of pupils and in many cases very little time is available for school inspection.  Inspectors frequently visit schools in connection with developmental projects and as part of the collection of data on various aspects of the implementation of the curriculum.</P>

      <P>The latest period for which data is available is the school year 1992-1993. <Col N="1081" /> During that school year 432 individual assessments of pupils in primary schools were carried out by psychologists employed by my Department.  These assessments were carried out in schools in two areas where a psychological service to primary schools is provided, West Tallaght-Clondalkin and South Tipperary.</P>
      <P>In the case of post-primary schools the number of individual assessments carried out in 1992-93 by psychologists employed by my Department, in post-primary schools throughout the country, was 1,279.  The total number of individual psychological assessments carried out by the psychological service of my Department during the school year 1992-93 was 1,711.</P>
      <P>Consultation with referring teachers took place both before and after the assessments.  It is usual for one or other, or both, parent(s) or a guardian to avail of the opportunity to consult with the psychologist after the assessment.  All individual assessments involve a follow-up on the assessment carried out and the ongoing contact between the psychologist and schools involves follow-up on students assessed.</P>
      <P>In the case of a small number of pupils there may be further review and assessment as time goes on, but accurate data covering both primary and post-primary levels is not available on this matter.  In the case of the service being developed at primary level a system of periodic full-scale review is being introduced and of the 432 assessed in 1992-93, 60 cases consisted of such a review of pupils assessed during the previous school year.  The number of such reviews is increasing continuously as the service develops at primary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the follow-up of cases referred to above, ongoing consultation, or counselling, of students is not a feature of the psychological service, but is provided by the school guidance teacher. At the primary level the ongoing group counselling by psychologists, in collaboration with teachers, of pupils presenting particular problems is being developed.  In 1992-1993, 30 pupils participated <Col N="1082" /> in such group counselling.  In the case of all pupils referred for psychological assessment some particular educational, personal or social problems were involved.</P>

      <P>The total number of students at both primary and post-primary levels, seen by psychologists employed by my Department, for individual psychological assessments, in the school year 1992-93, the latest for which data is available, was 1,711.  These assessments involved an element of counselling of individual students.  Ongoing counselling is not a feature of the service provided at the post-primary level by the psychological service of my Department.  Such counselling would be provided by the school guidance teacher.  At primary level group-counselling of pupils having particular problems is being developed by the psychologists, in collaboration with teachers, and 30 pupils participated in such counselling in 1992-93.</P>
      <P>The total cost involved to my Department is approximately £1.5 million in 1994.  There are five psychologists employed on a full-time basis by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and County Dublin Vocational Education Committee and their combined gross salary is approximately £153,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> Records are not readily available to indicate the number of students being counselled by these psychologists but my Department has been informed that the psychological service is available to approximately 21,000 students within these two vocational education committees.</P>
