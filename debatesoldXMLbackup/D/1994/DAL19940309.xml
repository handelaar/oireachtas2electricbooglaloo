      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the timetable of the legislation for the divorce referendum is being adhered to by the Government, if the legislation providing for the referendum and its terms will be brought before the House before the summer recess and if, before that issue is put to the people, the Government intends to fulfil the promise it made in the House on 11 March to place the civil legal aid scheme on a statutory basis? If the facilities to be provided in the referendum are not to be the preserve of the wealthy it is essential that we have an adequate and statutorily founded system of civil legal aid.  Will the Government fulfil its promise &mdash; if he requires, I can <Col N="251" /> refer the Taoiseach to the source &mdash; to place the civil legal aid scheme on a statutory basis in advance of the summer recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work on a civil legal aid Bill is well advanced.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform is taking steps to expand this scheme and additional funds have been provided for this purpose.  The timetable for the necessary legislation is being adhered to and we expect to introduce the legislation before the summer recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate a point I made yesterday by way of help to the Government.  As someone who is very committed to the Government's legislative programme for the divorce referendum, I am concerned about the timetable in this regard.  Originally it was the Government's intention to hold this referendum in June.  However, the referendum will not now be held for seven or eight months.  Will the Taoiseach have discussions with the other party leaders on this matter?  I am extremely concerned that we are running out of time and that much of the preparatory work has not been done.  Will the Taoiseach accept my request in the spirit it is being given, consider the matter and agree to meet with the leaders of the Opposition parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney's fear is that the legislative package might not be completed in time for the holding of a referendum in the autumn.  As of now the timetable for that legislation is on course.  If the need arises to have further discussions with the leaders of the Opposition parties, we will consider that in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications insisted the first they knew of this matter was at 9.30 the previous evening.

      <P>Sections: In page 5, paragraph (a), line 7, after &ldquo;Acts,&rdquo;&ldquo;and&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to go into detail at this stage but there were a number of significant changes made of which the major one was my amendment in relation to mandatory disqualification and the question of discretion for the court in first offence cases where special circumstances obtained.  An amendment was also proposed by Fine Gael in relation to the detention period when a driver was found to be intoxicated while in charge of a car, reducing that period from eight hours to six hours.</P>
      <P>There were also a number of technical amendments.  The one we are now taking provides for the deletion of paragraph (c) of the definition of &ldquo;reserved function&rdquo;. Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 are consequential changes to sections 35 and 36. These are purely technical, drafting amendments advised by the Attorney General to be put in place and do not effect any material change to the Bill.</P>
      <P>As we come to each amendment, in view of the fact that the House has agreed to take these amendments following their passage in the Seanad, I will endeavour to give a detailed outline of what each involves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This group of amendments deals with time limits for instituting summary proceedings. Summary proceedings normally must be instituted within six months from the date of the committal of the offence in accordance with section 10 (4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.  While six months is the standard time limit for taking prosecutions for summary offences, existing road traffic law provides for an extended period of 12 months in respect of offences involving fraud in obtaining a policy of insurance and for making false declarations.  The period of 12 months allowed in such cases is frequently insufficient particularly when the false declaration is not detected for some time.  Section 48 of the Bill was designed to allow a longer time for taking prosecutions in such cases, providing that <Col N="260" /> proceedings must be instituted either within six months of the committal of the offence or within three months from the date the necessary evidence of the offence was obtained, whichever is the later, but subject to a maximum of three years.</P>
    <P>At the closing Stages of the debate in the Dáil some concern was expressed that this provision could be used to take proceedings up to three years after committal of a standard motoring offence, which was certainly never the intention. That was why, to clarify the issue, I moved the amendments in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>This group of amendments state specifically that the only circumstances in which proceedings can be instituted after six months are offences committed under section 64 of the 1961 Act, involving fraud in obtaining an insurance policy, and offences under section 115 of the 1961 Act involving false declarations in obtaining a driving licence or insurance certificate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the overall matter of insurance and fraud, would the Minister agree that the problem is that the whole principle of insurance is based on the utmost good faith?  While it may be in order to extend the period within which a person may be brought before the courts, from the point of view of the public the reality is the absence of such good faith can mean that effectively an insurance policy is void from the outset. The proposition confronting us is that people who suffer damage consequential on no insurance being in place &mdash; if I read this provision correctly &mdash; because fraud was evident at the time of the negotiation of the insurance, it may be possible to bring the person before the courts but, on the overall reason for having insurance cover, the real loser could be an ordinary member of the public.  I fail to see what the benefit of this will be if people who obtain insurance cover in accordance with the provisions of the Road Traffic Act find subsequently that because of a fraudulent statement having been made at the outset no insurance cover was in force.  That is the real issue that must be <Col N="261" /> faced.  That is the issue that is of grave concern to many people.  If an accident occurs and people discover there is no insurance cover for the damages they have suffered it will be of little consolation to them to find subsequently that the person involved is brought before the courts.</P>
      <P>I should like to see some provision inserted in this Bill to deal with the type of circumstances I have just outlined. Perhaps the Minister would outline to the House the reasons he thinks it is necessary to insert this provision, bearing in mind what I have just said, and state the purpose behind it.  For example, is it too render it more convenient to bring people before the courts simply to procure a criminal charge or is it designed to assist in some way the public who will be the sufferers at the end of the day?</P>

      <P>With regard to noninsured drivers with no insurance or with inadequate insurance cover, Deputy Barrett will be aware that the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland was established for the precise purpose of endeavouring to deal with such cases.  However, I readily admit that the bureau is not able to cover all aspects of the damages involved.  Of course, our primary purpose is to clear off our roads people who drive uninsured vehicles, the present percentage of whom is estimated to be between six and eight per cent, which is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>There are other provisions in this Bill which, as the Deputy will know, increase the penalties for uninsured driving.  The purpose for the inclusion of this provision &mdash; which allows summary proceedings to be put in place up to a period of three years three months after production of the evidence &mdash; applies only in cases of fraud and false certification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advice from the legal and security services was that a number of prominent cases of fraud and false certifications took some time. It was admitted by members of the legal profession both in the Seanad and in the earlier debate here that these circumstances arise and it is a pity people can escape justice because of the time <Col N="262" /> limit, which was never intended to operate in that way.  Equally, it was not intended, as was construed, to have a summary proceeding for minor offences. That was why we specified that it could only involve fraud and false declarations. If the one year time limit had elapsed and the evidence was produced thereafter and there was an absolute certainty of conviction, in so far as one can be sure, under the law it was not possible to proceed, even though there was solid evidence. This amendment is designed to facilitate the discharge of justice in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>Section 13: In page 11, subsection (1), lines 2 to 19 deleted, and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Garda Síochána station, at his discretion, do either or both of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)  require the person to provide, by exhaling into an apparatus for determining the concentration of alcohol in the breath, 2 specimens of his breath and may indicate the manner in which he is to comply with the requirement,</P>
      <P>(b)  require the person either&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; to permit a designated doctor <Col N="263" /> to take from the person a specimen of his blood, or</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; at the option of the person, to provide for the designated doctor a specimen of his urine,</P>
    <P>and if the doctor states in writing that he is unwilling, on medical grounds, to take from the person or be provided by him with the specimen to which the requirement in either of the foregoing subparagraphs related, the member may make a requirement of the person under this paragraph in relation to the specimen other than that to which the first requirement related.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This group of amendments agreed by the Seanad has two purposes.  The amendments give the person the option as to whether to provide blood or urine and they also provide that where a designated doctor is unwilling, on medical grounds, to take a specimen this will be stated in writing.  Amendment No. 11, which amends section 21, provides evidential value to such a statement.  Perhaps I could give some of the background.  As Deputies will know, a number of high profile cases under the Road Traffic Act have been struck down on a technical point.  One of those involved a person who offered to give a urine sample but was unable to do so.  Because of his medical condition there was a problem in giving blood.  In the earlier debate I sought to give the choice to the Garda to decide whether it should be a urine or a blood sample in order to get over the difficulties that had arisen.  There were many arguments about it on Committee Stage as well as in the Seanad and I agreed to see whether I could return to the position of giving the right to the individual to decide whether the sample should be blood or urine.  Since that time there has been another major case which consolidated the original view of what the traffic law should be in this case.  That <Col N="264" /> enables me to return to giving the option to the individual to choose whether to give a blood or urine sample.</P>

The specimen can be sought from a person who attends in casualty as distinct from somebody who is admitted as an in-patient.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposed to reduce the maximum period of detention of an intoxicated driver for his own safety, or the safety of others, from eight hours to six hours.  There was a lengthy debate in the Seanad on this arising from an amendment put down by Fine Gael. Senator Enright and others were anxious to ensure that the person would be detained only in circumstances where the designated doctor agree this was necessary. The tradition has been that these matters are decided in the best judgment of the gardaí.  On Report Stage an amendment was put forward to reduce the <Col N="268" /> period of detention from eight hours to six hours in cases where a garda detained a driver who was obviously intoxicated and a possible danger to himself and others.  I was happy to accept that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says.  As the matter was discussed in the Seanad yesterday I have not had an opportunity to read the debate.  There is a difficulty with imposing limits and I am concerned that what is done is in the best interests of the person involved and not a form of punishment.  We are trying to strike a reasonable balance in favour of the person who, in the opinion of the garda, is under the influence of drink to such an extent that he could be a threat to his own safety.  Following a debate in the Seanad it would appear that those who felt strongly about the issue agreed a six hour detention period would be better then eight hours.</P>
      <P>I would have liked to have heard the debate because I have yet to grasp precisely what was intended.  I imagine that if someone were detained by a garda and it was felt that they might be a danger to themselves or others, in most cases the garda would either arrange for someone to collect them from the station or provide transport.  I am sure that, having taken a sample, a garda would not release such a person back on the street.</P>
      <P>However, I would not like this provision to be interpreted as a means of teaching someone a lesson.  I do not see it would make a great deal of difference if, having been picked up at 2 a.m., a person is released after six hours at 8 a.m. or eight hours at 10 a.m.  What has the experience been in cases where people were detained by the gardaí because it was felt they posed a threat to their own safety?  What is the purpose of having a time limit?  Is it to protect the individual from some form of detention for not more than eight hours or is it felt that a person would have sobered up sufficiently after six hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person complies with the law in terms of providing a sample their personal safety is then the issue.  The court <Col N="269" /> will ultimately decide if the person has broken the law and they will have to face the consequences.  I do not understand why any time limit is imposed because we are talking about the safety of the individual and no politician is qualified to say that, in the interests of the safety of the individual, the gardaí should be entitled to hold them for six or eight hours.  I do not know whether it should be six hours or eight hours because the circumstances in each case will vary.  It is &ldquo;in the opinion of the garda&rdquo; that the person is not in a fit state to be released. A person would need to be heavily intoxicated to warrant being detained for eight hours to avoid posing a danger to himself or others.</P>
    <P>As I have not been dealing with this Bill until now I may not understand the Minister.  I cannot understand the need for setting specific time limits.  Will the Minister elaborate on the arguments in favour of specifying a time limit of six or eight hours?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett hit the nail on the head: we have relied on the Garda Síochána to use their discretion in dealing with such matters in the past. The Garda will not be entitled under this section to detain anybody who is arrested for drink driving except in circumstances where he or she is satisfied that the person is a danger to themselves and to the public.  There are safeguards: where the person arrested is 18 years or more, a relative or other nominated person will be informed.  The arrested person can opt to have no other person notified of the detention.  When the relative or other nominated person arrives at the station, the arrested person will be released.  The relative or other nominated person arriving at the station must be 18 years or more.  The arrested person can opt not to be released into the custody of the person arriving at the station and the arrested person can still be detained if considered to be so intoxicated that he would constitute a threat to his own safety or the safety of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the arrested person is under 18 years of age, a relative or other nominated <Col N="270" /> person will be informed automatically. When the relative or other nominated person arrives at the station, the arrested person will be released.</P>
    <P>The normal practice is that the gardaí arrange for the person to be brought home safely, sometimes they may call a taxi or a garda will drive the person home.  In some instances it is not possible to make such arrangements and the person is detained.  An administrative practice has been established for dealing with such detentions for a period of hours.  Let us take the case of a person who has taken four pints of Guinness. We are told &mdash; I have to rely on scientific evidence &mdash; that the blood alcohol level will return to normal after a period of eight hours.  It would not be necessary for the blood alcohol level to return to zero before a person can drive safely.  It is difficult to be positive of the specific period required for the normalisation of the blood alcohol level and I recognise the points Deputy Barrett has made.</P>
    <P>The general practice is to operate in this way and we are giving it statutory effect, with the necessary safeguards, to ensure that the practices are carried out in a fair manner.  The safeguards I have outlined are quite secure.  It was thought that in certain circumstances a garda could go for the overkill &mdash; this was not referred to in the Seanad.  I agree with Deputy Barrett that we rely on the security forces to act in accordance with good practice that is fair and acceptable and has a statutory basis.  That has been our experience up to now. Tributes have been paid to the Garda Síochána for the way they have handled situations and we are giving a statutory basis to the administrative practices.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I suggest it is always more dangerous to specify hours.  I do not think we have any right to hint that members of the Garda Síochána would abuse the law.  I do not understand the thinking behind statements that it is more unlikely that an abuse would occur if six rather than eight hours was the maximum.  In my view it must be clearly understood <Col N="271" /> that the period of detention must be in the interests of the individual.  The courts will decide subsequently on the punishment for the offence committed.</P>
      <P>I am wary of specifying the length of detention.  If the person detained wants to dispute the length of the period of detention perhaps another officer of the rank of sergeant should be called upon to confirm the decision of the garda who believes it would be unwise to release him onto the street.  If it is in the interests of the individual to be left sleeping for seven hours I hope the garda would have enough cop on to leave him in the cell until he had slept if off if nobody can be contacted.  Under this section will a garda be breaking the law if he does not release the person the minute the specified period has elapsed in cases where the person is still sleeping, or is incoherent and a relative cannot be contacted to take him home?  That is the problem with specified time limits.  It is quite ridiculous to be arguing whether it should be six or eight hours.  A garda should be able, in the interests of the individual's safety, to determine how long to detain him.  If the arrested person disputes his detention and says he is fit to go home we are into a different ball game.  If that is the case a second opinion should be sought, a garda of the rank of sergeant should be called to decide the matter.  If a person is of the opinion that it is in their interests to leave after an hour or two and the garda disagrees we could end up walking a dangerous road.  It would be wrong for a garda to detain that person for the maximum period to put manners on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that 99.99 per cent of the members of the Garda Síochána do not think along those lines; they have enough problems without having to look after an intoxicated person but if there will be a dispute as to whether a person should be detained for six or eight hours we are not tackling the matter in the right way because people will complain they were detained despite the fact that they were of the opinion they were in a fit condition to leave the station.  If there is a dispute <Col N="272" /> somebody else should be called upon, a sergeant or inspector, to decide.</P>
    <P>We are moving from the original intention of the legislation, which was to give the Garda Síochána discretion to decide whether a person should be allowed to leave, in arguing over whether the figure should be four, six or eight hours.  If I table an amendment stating that the figure should be four hours none of us could argue with great conviction as to which of us is right.</P>
    <P>My Whip informed me it was agreed on the Order of Business that we would have an opportunity to extend the debate beyond one hour if it was felt that the time available was insufficient to tease out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We should call the referees to see if the Whips decided that the discussion should continue tomorrow. Will the Minister consider the points I made on this amendment? It would be dangerous to think in terms of a figure of six to eight hours.  If a person drinks four pints of Guinness and is brought to a Garda station he should not have to wait until it leaves his system before the Garda let him out.  While they may not be in a fit condition to drive a motor vehicle the vast majority of people would not be a danger to themselves in walking home when the sample has been taken.  It would be absurd to argue along the lines that it may take up to eight hours for four pints of Guinness to leave the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the intention is to protect the individual who may be a danger to himself it should be clearly stated that is the purpose of the section. There is a danger that the provisions will be abused to detain a person for up to eight hours which would not be in keeping with the spirit of the section.  I ask the Minister to think again and insert a provision under which a senior member of the Garda Síochána, for example a sergeant, will be called to confirm the opinion of the rank and file <Col N="273" /> member if there is a dispute over whether a person should be detained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One would need the wisdom of Solomon to find the right solution to these problems.  Since the legislation was introduced &mdash; it has been the subject of debate for many hours in both Houses &mdash; 130 amendments have been made which have improved the Bill considerably. Having reached agreement yesterday after a long debate on this issue additional matters are being introduced.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this provision is not to detain the person who has had three or four pints for six to eight hours, the member of the Garda Síochána in charge will have to be satisfied that the person concerned is so intoxicated that he is a danger to himself or to the public.  In those circumstances the person should be detained.  The normal practice is that arrangements are made to inform a relative or assist the individual to get home safely.  When people are detained for these reasons it would be extremely difficult, given the special safeguards in place, to require another member, as well as the member in charge, to assist in the decision making process.  We rely on each member of the Garda to make decisions under a host of legislative provisions based on their training and experience.</P>
      <P>If an individual complains or disagrees &mdash; this is likely to happen in certain circumstances &mdash; the decision of the member in charge will have to be accepted.  If the individual has a grievance they will have an opportunity to make their case in subsequent court proceedings. This provision will not apply to the individual who has had a few drinks, it will only apply when a member of the Garda Síochána is satisfied that an individual is a danger to himself and the public.  The safeguards are adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the views of Members of both Houses.  While I disagreed at times I am a democrat and this is the result of the distillation of the views expressed: it should be possible for an individual after a period of six hours to make his way home safely.  The fears expressed by Deputy Barrett are groundless. The <Col N="274" /> public have not expressed any fears about this provision which has been operated successfully by the Garda Síochána to date which is in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this matter has been the subject of a long debate and that the vast majority of the members of the Garda Síochána will not detain any person for fun.  I listened carefully to what the Minister said, and if one could be sure that the members of the Garda Síochána would always do as the Minister said, the time limit would be irrelevant and there would be no need to include the legislation.  All that would have to be provided for is that if a member of the Garda Síochána decides that it is not in the interest of the person to be released, that person could be detained until he is in a fit condition to protect himself. However, it was decided that if that were done a person could be detained for a week, to bring it to the ridiculous stage, or for 24 hours.  It seems that it was to avoid any dispute that it was decided to introduce a time limit of eight hours. That was thought to be too long and it was reduced to six hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the principle that is important.  The section deals with the detention of intoxicated drivers who are a danger to themselves or others.  I am afraid of what will happen in cases where it may not be possible to contact a relative, and the person disputes the opinion of a garda that he is a danger to himself or others.  Are we to have rows about this? Putting in a time limit makes it more likely that there will be disputes and more problems will be created than if there were no time limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda can hold a person for up to six hours with no right of appeal. It is not even necessary to call in a sergeant to give his opinion when at least there would be a witness.  I am suggesting that a provision be included that in the event of a person detained disputing the detention another member up to the rank of sergeant should be called upon to confirm <Col N="275" /> the opinion of the detaining garda.  That would be an adequate safeguard.  The provision could be dangerous if left unaltered. I am not disputing the merits of a time limit of six hours compared to a time limit of eight hours but imposing a limit could be dangerous.</P>

I accept that one cannot be certain when setting time limits, but that was the judgment of the House and I agreed to it.  It is the member in charge of the station who will decide. In the small number of cases where these provisions must be applied, Deputy Barrett can be secure in the knowledge that the discretion of the garda can be relied upon.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 16, lines 6 to 31, subsections (4) and (5) deleted.</P>
      <P>Section 19 sets out the procedures to be followed by the medical bureau of road safety in dealing with specimens of blood or urine.  Subsections (1) to (3) are restatements of the existing law as set out in section 22 of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978. Under the section the bureau is required to forward a copy of the certificate to the person who provided the specimen.  In recent years there have been a number of cases where persons tried to avoid receiving the copy of the certificate in the hope of avoiding a conviction on technical grounds.</P>
      <P>Subsections (4) and (5) were designed to remove the potential for such challenges by providing that proof of postage would be deemed to be proof of delivery. On further examination of these subsections I have been advised that the new provisions are not necessary and that they might actually create new avenues for legal challenges concerning proof of postage. In the circumstances the Seanad agreed to the deletion of subsections (4) and (5) and the effect of the amendments is to leave the law as it is at present.  This was another example of trying to close off a loophole. We are now satisfied that we would be best served by existing provisions.</P>

There have been circumstances where persons have sought to avoid being presented with that certificate and to use that as a technical reason to avoid prosecution and subsequent conviction. It was thought originally that it might be well to remove the potential for these challenges by providing that proof of postage of the certificate would be deemed to be proof of delivery.  In some circumstances individuals seek to avoid the presentation to them of the certificate from the bureau and claim in court they were not informed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to update existing legislation relating to the control and regulation of casual trading as contained in the Casual Trading Act, 1980.  That Act, as the House will be aware, applies to selling goods by retail on a street, road, market square, footpath, roadside and any other place to which the public have access as of right, and any place which a local authority sets aside as a casual trading area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be helpful to Deputies if, before dealing with the provisions of the new Bill, I outline some of the background considerations which led to the enactment of the existing legislation in 1980.  The 1980 Act came into being following <Col N="278" /> a report from the then Restrictive Practices Commission &mdash; which has been subsumed into the Competition Authority &mdash; which concluded at that time that outdoor trading was &ldquo;fair trading&rdquo; provided that it was subject to reasonable and, especially, effective control and made a more realistic contribution to public funds.</P>
    <P>The primary reasons for introducing the legislation were to ensure that roadside and street traders do not have an unfair advantage over established traders who operate from retail outlets, in so far as they do not incur the associated overheads. Another factor was that trade union interests complained at that time that employment prospects for their members were being jeopardised, not merely because of the higher overheads which have to be met by shopkeepers, but also because street traders do not observe the statutory and reasonably negotiated conditions of employment of shop assistants.  Additionally, there had been widespread concern about the traffic and other environmental problems created by some outdoor traders.  These were some of the arguments in support of better regulation of outdoor trading which led to the enactment of the 1980 Act.  The same considerations could be said to arise today.</P>
    <P>The object of the 1980 Act, therefore, was to deal with these types of concerns by providing a more effective system of licensing subject to certain conditions, linked to designated areas, with penalties as the deterrent against offences.  In this regard, the Act currently provides for a dual licensing system, one at national level involving a requirement on traders to obtain a national licence from the Department of Enterprise and Employment, and the other obtaining a permit from a local authority which has availed of its powers to designate casual trading areas.  The Act gives power to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and to the local authorities to appoint authorised officers, and to the Garda Síochána for the purpose of enforcing it. In practice, however, it is enforced by authorised officers appointed by the local <Col N="279" /> authorities and the gardaí who have wide powers to ask questions and to examine books and other records.  Any person who fails, refuses or neglects to comply with a requirement of an authorised officer or a garda commits an offence. In certain circumstances a garda may arrest without a warrant a person contravening the Act and seize any vehicle or goods connected with the illegal trading. Additionally, local authorities have powers to acquire market rights, some of which are in private ownership as a result of royal charters and letters patent granted centuries ago, and to extinguish such market rights on condition that they provide alternative facilities in the same vicinity as the market or fair to which the right relates and which reasonably correspond in all respects to that market or fair.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Act also provides that certain classes of trading, which were not then considered to give rise to any problems, are exempted from regulation under the Act.  These exemptions relate to the following types of selling: selling by a licensed auctioneer; a farmer or market gardener selling his own produce &mdash; livestock, vegetables, flowers, fruit or other crops; door to door selling; a person selling sweets, chocolate, confectionery, cooked foods, fruit, non-alcoholic drinks or favours from a tray, basket, trolley or other similar device at or immediately beside a place where a football match, race-meeting or any other event is taking place regardless of whether the public have to pay to attend; selling of ice cream, newspapers, periodicals, magazines or other printed matter or pious or religious objects; fishermen or members of the crew of a fishing boat selling their catch; selling in aid of a charity or for some purpose from which no private profit is made, for example, famine relief organisations, hospitals, organisations that help the poor, churches, mission societies, schools, sports clubs; and selling at a market or fair held with the authority of statute or a franchise.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Casual Trading Act, 1980, set out to regulate casual trading <Col N="280" /> by providing that, with a number of exceptions, anyone engaging in casual trading is required to have a national licence issued by the Department of Enterprise and Employment on payment of a fee, and separate permits from each local authority which has designated a casual trading areas.  The cornerstone of regulation under the 1980 Act was, therefore, the wide powers given to local authorities to designate the places in their functional area which would be set aside for outdoor trading, where this type of trading could be carried on in a disciplined way in the best interest of local consumers, established traders, casual traders and all other interested bodies.</P>
    <P>It was not then envisaged, and I am not now proposing, that central Government should decide where trading should be permitted and what detailed conditions should be attached to trading at local levels.  The 1980 Act was, therefore, designed to give local authorities all the powers they could reasonably need in order to properly regulate casual trading.</P>
    <P>During the period in which the Act has been in operation certain aspects, in particular exemptions and enforcement, have been the subject of criticism by traders, local authorities, public representatives and the courts.  In response to these criticisms a major review of the Act has been undertaken by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  As part of the review all local authorities were invited to make submissions.  Their views were concerned, in the main, with effecting improvements in the operation of the Act by suggesting amendments to particular provisions, rather than proposing overall policy changes.  Submissions were also obtained from other Government Departments and interested bodies representing traders, established and casual.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the exemption under the Act relating to the sale of agricultural or horticultural produce by the producer has posed particular problems for local authorities in enforcing the legislation because the burden of proof of the origin of the produce is placed on the local <Col N="281" /> authorities.  This is very difficult in the case of most items with the exception of fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, etc. In addition, efforts by local authorities to use their powers to acquire market rights can be defeated when people selling their own produce such as potatoes, shrubs, fish, etc., are not subject to any form of regulation.</P>
    <P>The absence of power of appeal by a local authority against a decision of the Circuit Court in relation to the designation of a casual trading area has also presented problems for some authorities in an area that is crucial to the effective operation of the Act.  Difficulties have also been experienced by local authorities in dealing with so-called &ldquo;prescriptive rights&rdquo; claimed by traders when the local authorities have attempted to use their powers to acquire market rights. As I have already indicated, one of the current exemptions from casual trading regulations relates to selling at a market or fair held with the authority of statute or a franchise.</P>
    <P>The difficulty arising here from the authorities' point of view is that where they have been successful in acquiring a market right, a continuing right appears to live on through the prescriptive rights route and the local authorities have no means of establishing the validity of such rights.  This has been invoked successfully by some traders and as a result the local authorities and the Garda, in some instances, have declared prosecutions under the Act on fair days to be a lost cause.</P>
    <P>These are the major concerns raised by the local authorities.  There are others of less significance which I do not think it necessary to detail here.  Suffice it to say that having received my Department's evaluation based on the various submissions received and close consultation with other Departments, in particular with the Department of the Environment in view of its responsibilities for policy for local government matters, I have decided to amend the 1980 Act to address perceived weaknesses and with a view to achieving more effective regulation of <Col N="282" /> casual trading.  I will now set out the principal reforms I am proposing to the House for consideration under the Casual Trading Bill, 1994.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the current system involves a dual licensing system which requires that national licences are issued by my Department and permits are issued by the local authorities. I do not consider there is any justification for the continued involvement of central Government in this function.  It is a function that can readily and should properly be carried out only by the local authorities.  This is fully consistent with Government policy on local government reform with regard to ensuring that local issues are settled wherever possible at local level.  As I have already indicated, the 1980 Act contains a number of trading activities which are exempted from the scope of the Act.  This means they are not subject to any specific regulation.  This has given rise to particular difficulties, especially in the case of home-grown produce.</P>
    <P>I consider that the exemptions from the scope of regulation should be as limited as possible and accordingly I am proposing under section 2 to limit the exemptions to just three activities, namely: (a) selling by a licensed auctioneer; (b) door-to-door selling and (c) charity sales.  I am proposing that the following five exempted activities under the 1980 Act be removed: (a) the selling of agricultural and horticultural produce by the producer; (b) the selling of sweets, chocolate, etc. at public events such as sports and concerts; (c) the selling of ice cream, newspapers, etc. and pious religious objects; (d) the selling of fish by the crew which catches them; and (e) selling at a market or fair held with the authority of statute or a franchise.  I want to emphasise that the removal of these exemptions will not make the activities in question unlawful, rather it will have the effect of making them subject to regulation.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions enable the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to amend the exemptions by making regulations, in other words, without the <Col N="283" /> need to introduce a Bill in the House. However, advice received from the Attorney General has indicated that this power is limited to adding to the exemptions. The removal of existing exemptions cannot be carried out under the 1980 Act by regulations and I am therefore proposing that such powers should be given to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in order to be able to react more flexibly to any changing circumstances. In addition, local authorities will be empowered to add to such exempted classes of trading as they may consider necessary as far as their own areas are concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case of the removal of the current exemption relating to the sale of agricultural and horticultural produce, I would point out that I am aware of the rural development dimension which such direct selling can have in terms of adding value at the local level, for example, farm produced cheese.  However, I consider that the provision which I am making under the Bill enabling local authorities to add such further exemptions as local circumstances dictate will cater adequately for this concern.  In other words, if a local authority has a view that relates to its specific locality or the nature of a particular activity in its area it will make the judgment in that regard.  The removal of the exemption relating to market rights, and the further provision contained in section 8 to the effect that any market right remaining unexercised for a period of not less than ten years will stand extinguished, will go some considerable way to resolving the problem posed by prescriptive rights.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Act provides that a casual trading licence cannot be issued to any person who has committed two or more offences under the Act, within five years of those offences having been committed. This provision has been criticised as being unduly harsh and has indeed been the subject of a case before the Supreme Court.  That court found the power to be constitutional and therefore I am proposing to retain this penalty.  However, I propose under section 4 to amend the <Col N="284" /> text to meet the court's criticism of the lack of clarity in the present text.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides that a local authority shall, subject to certain specified circumstances, grant a casual trading licence to an applicant who pays the fee fixed by the local authority under that section and who fulfils certain conditions, including tax clearance.  The latter issue will no doubt be of concern to some traders.  This was a specific requirement contained in the Government decision approving the general scheme of the Bill and is a reflection of the Government's determination that the tax burden should be as equitable as possible for all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>In this regard I have been advised by the Department of Finance that suitable arrangements to ensure that no casual trader, except for exceptional circumstances, will be refused a tax clearance certificate.  Therefore, this new requirement will not be an obstacle to new or existing casual trading applicants for licences.  In addition, section 6 provides for the application of the tax clearance requirements to the issue of casual trading licences in such a manner that it will not interfere with the casual trader's constitutional right to earn a livelihood. Under section 4, again in accordance with the Government's decision, there will be an obligation on the local authorities to inform the Minister for Social Welfare when a licence is issued.</P>
    <P>The licensing regime proposed under section 4 will enable a local authority to either issue a general licence without territorial limitation in its own jurisdiction, or else confine it to casual trading areas or special events.  Licensing of special events, such as sporting events, pop concerts and such gatherings, will make it possible for local authorities to deal more effectively with this type of trading.</P>
    <P>Another major change which the Bill will make, and which has been suggested by the Department of the Environment, is to provide broad ranging powers under section 7 to the local authorities for the use of by-laws relating to the control, regulation, supervision and administration <Col N="285" /> of casual trading in their functional areas.  I would like to emphasise that these powers are more extensive than the present powers of local authorities under the 1980 Act to make by-laws which are limited to casual trading in casual trading areas under their control. This is, in effect, the most significant reform in the Bill and I am confident that it will give the local authorities the kind of flexibility they require to regulate casual trading more efficiently.  They have sought those powers from successive Ministers.</P>
    <P>In connection with the power of the local authorities under section 7 to set fees under by-laws, I would point out that local authorities already have discretionary power under the Local Government Act, 1983, to charge fees in excess of the £20 fee set by the Casual Trading Act, 1980.  I am aware, however, that some local authorities do not consider that they currently have discretion to charge fees above the prescribed £20 limit because of decisions by the courts in favour of traders who objected to any increases in the fees for permits.</P>
    <P>While I consider reasonable that local authorities should have flexibility with regard to the fixing of fees to cover administration costs, I would be concerned that local authorities would keep the fee limits at modest levels commensurate with this requirement.  It is my intention in this regard to write to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, at the appropriate time with a view to ensuring that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>In making by-laws setting fees, local authorities will be able to provide for different circumstances and different classes of persons, including disabled and handicapped persons.  This section will also provide power of appeal to any party, including a local authority, to the Circuit Court from the District Court in connection with by-laws proposed by a local authority.</P>
    <P>In regard to enforcement, as the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will no longer have the function of issuing casual trading licences, I am proposing that he will have no role in enforcement. <Col N="286" /> This will be the responsibility of local authorities and the Garda Síochána, who in practice already enforce the Act. Section 11 of the Bill reflects the new approach.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would like to draw Deputies' attention to a small but important change which I intend to make to this section on Committee Stage, that local authorities will also be empowered to appoint persons other than officers of the local authorities.  This additional power to appoint persons who are not employed by the local authorities will give them greater flexibility in operating the legislation, for example, in the area of managing markets.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 the powers of the Garda Síochána to dispose of seized goods will be available to superintendents, where this function is currently reserved to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. This change was suggested by the Department of Justice on behalf of the Garda and reflects the Government's philosophy in terms of devolving to local government decisions that can be best made at local level.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill will have the effect of doubling the penalties for summary conviction and conviction on indictment to £1,000 and £10,000 respectively, and will bring these penalties in line with current levels in other legislation.  In addition the courts' jurisdiction in relation to offences will be streamlined in the sense that a defendant's current right to trial by jury for an offence which the court and the Director of Public Prosecutions may consider to be fit to be tried summarily will be removed, again in accordance with current trends.</P>
    <P>I will be proposing a small number of minor amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  I have already referred to the proposed amendment to section 11 relating to the power of local authorities to appoint authorised officers.  I intend also to propose a number of amendments to the Occasional Trading Act, 1979, in order that similar provisions of that Act will remain consistent with similar provisions in the Casual Trading Bill.</P>
    <P>Occasional trading as defined under <Col N="287" /> the 1979 Act means &ldquo;selling of goods by retail at a premises or place (not being a public road or other place to which the public have access as of right) of which the person so selling has been in occupation for a continuous period of less than three months ending on the date of such selling&rdquo;.  Persons who engaged in occasional trading are required to have an occasional trading permit which is granted by my Department on payment of the appropriate fee.  The act is enforced by authorised officers appointed by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  They have wide-ranging powers similar to those of authorised officers under the Casual Trading Act, 1980, to ask questions and to examine books and other records. Penalties under the Occasional Trading Act are identical to those in the Casual Trading Act.</P>
    <P>I will, therefore, be proposing the following amendments to the Occasional Trading Act, 1979, to keep it consistent with provisions contained in this Bill: first, in relation to the number of exempted activities under section 2 of the Occasional Trading Act which are broadly the same as those contained in the Casual Trading Act, I will be proposing that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment should also have power to enable him, by regulations, to amend the exemptions if circumstances warrant; second, I propose to amend section 9 of the 1979 Act to increase penalties and streamline the jurisdiction of the courts to make this section consistent with the Bill and third, I propose to make similar provisions in the 1979 Act relating to tax clearance and social welfare matters. These are necessary changes which I consider should be made to the Occasional Trading Act, 1979, so that similar legislative provisions should apply to casual and occasional traders, thus avoiding any potential for discrimination in terms of their treatment under the respective Acts.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures proposed in this Bill will bring about a considerable improvement in the regulation <Col N="288" /> and enforcement of casual trading, and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly welcome the thrust of the Bill.  There has been unnecessary confusion in that licences are issued from the Department and permits from local authorities.  This is not a sensible way of organising business.  It is surprising the Minister has not decided that occasional trading activity be devolved to local authorities.  I would have thought the arguments in favour of devolution would apply equally to occasional and casual trading.  Tax and social welfare clearance will be required in respect of legal casual traders, the Bill will bring them into the white economy and make enforcement against illegal traders easier.  It has been argued that a licence should contain a photograph of the person involved so that a correctly obtained permit would not be photocopied and widely used.  Some measure of that nature would be sensible.  I presume the Minister's reply will be that he will devolve this aspect of local authorities but perhaps he will make his views known on this matter.</P>
      <P>The pursuing of summary prosecutions by local authorities should be permitted without the option of seeking trial by jury.  My understanding is that the right to seek trial by jury has been abused in that it has been used as a tactic for evading prosecution where it is decided by the Director of Public Prosecutions that the cost of a trial by jury would be excessive.  This seems a sensible measure but we will have to tease out on Committee Stage how it balances with people's rights under the law to opt for a trial by their peers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed about the Bill and I take this opportunity to raise them.  There is concern among local authorities that under exemptions relating to casual trading the question of selling to a person at a place or adjacent to the place where he resides or carries on business, could be open to abuse.  It has been suggested under this provision exemption could be claimed in respect of hot dog stands.  I am not sufficiently <Col N="289" /> versed in legal terminology to know how the courts will interpret the word &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo;.  Will it mean that someone can rove around in a van, operate hot dog stands, etc?  That concern needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided to withdraw the right of a farmer or market gardner to sell his produce.  This decision will be greeted with dismay by people who have traditionally sold their produce&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not withdraw, regulate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to the cost of casual trading licences.  Clearly we would not wish to impose excessive burdens on farmers and horticulturists who have traditionally sold their produce.  It has been represented to me that a person can incur costs of several hundred pounds before finally establishing a legitimate right to continue their trade.  This could impose a significant burden on a person who has a seasonable trade, for example, a person who sells strawberries.  Further consideration should be given to this point.  Will the Minister confirm that local authorities will have discretion not to apply a flat rate fee in all cases but can apply a different fee for a person who, for example, sells strawberries, so that the fee is commensurate with the activity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the granting of casual trading licences by local authorities. Apart from a conviction during the past five years, the only reason a person can be refused a licence is if there is a shortage of places in which to conduct casual trading.  It has been represented to me that it might be desirable for the Garda to screen applicants so that people with criminal backgrounds do not have extensive access to casual trading licences.  Section 4 is very circumscribed in terms of the grounds upon which a local authority can refuse a licence: it has to grant a licence unless it can show that a person has a conviction or that insufficient places are available.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's response to the suggestion that some sort of suitability test should be carried out <Col N="290" /> on a regular basis.  Moneylending is very tightly regulated because of the nature of that business.  It seems that the local authorities will not be able to carry out any suitability test under this Bill.  Will the Minister say whether he believes local authorities should be permitted to carry out some sort of suitability test rather than deciding the suitability of an applicant on the basis of convictions?</P>
    <P>Section 7 seems to require local authorities to redesignate all their 1980 Act casual trading areas.  This will give rise to considerable difficulties for local authorities as a person who is aggrieved at a decision may make an appeal to the District Court and, in turn, to the Circuit Court.  There should be some transitional arrangement in this type of legislation which would give a person the right to challenge a decision but would also allow existing practice to continue without local authorities having to redesignate all the locations, have a motion passed by the city council and advertise the redesignated areas.  We should design transitional arrangements which would be equitable to all concerned and which would not put an obligation on the local authority to go back to the drawing board.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment No. 11 is a response to a concern of local authorities. I welcome his decision to replace the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; with the term &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo;.  Companies involved in franchising can provide a very good service in cleaning and running markets effectively and it is only right that local authorities should be able to give such companies the franchise to run these markets if they believe it is desirable to do so.  I am glad the Minister has recognised that point and will table an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the powers of the Garda to seize goods.  It has been argued that gardaí have little option but to return goods to persons from whom they were taken.  The Bill proposes that a person must satisfy a Garda superintendent that he is the owner of such goods.  This provision is rather loose in that there is no specification <Col N="291" /> as to what constitutes adequate proof of ownership.  In some cases a Garda superintendent might find it hard to refuse to return the goods.  It has been argued that we have a revolving door system of casual trading whereby people who have had their goods seized can continue to sell goods on the street because of the inability of the Garda to prevent this occurring.  I will tease out this matter further on Committee Stage.  It has been suggested that the powers of the Garda to deal with illegal traders are somewhat limited.  Perhaps the onus on traders to prove ownership should be strengthened and minimum requirements put in place.</P>
    <P>Section 14 makes provision for the setting up of a register.  However, it does not make it clear that the register will be open to public inspection.  I presume it is not intended that this should be a private register but rather that people who have licences will be able to inspect it.  Will the Minister say if it is unusual for applications for casual trading licences not to be advertised?  Unlike planning applications where a notice is put in the paper, there is no obligation on applicants for a casual trading licence to notify people that they have applied for a licence.  Withdrawal of the option to trial by jury should make enforcement of the law easier.</P>
    <P>There is a concern among casual traders that the number of licences issued exceeds the number of spaces available. Some traders who have paid a high fee do not have access to suitable places from which to conduct their business.  They have also made the legitimate case that enforcement against unlicensed casual trading has been lax and are anxious to have proper enforcement action taken by appointed officers.  They are correct in requiring this.</P>
    <P>If we want these people to comply with all their tax requirements and if we want to avoid social welfare abuses, there is an onus on us to provide them with an opportunity to conduct their licensed trade in a way that protects them from unlicensed traders who abuse that position. With the present 21 per cent PRSI, <Col N="292" /> the 21 per cent VAT and the addition of personal income tax, the tax returns that a casual trader would have to make would be substantial.  People in the black economy have a huge edge in terms of trading and could benefit from much lower margins.</P>
    <P>There is a need for proper enforcement and protection as part of the Minister's correct decision to have a requirement for tax and social welfare clearance.  This is a two-sided coin.  The Minister did not dwell on the adequacy of the enforcement aspect of the Bill but there is a feeling among those conducting their business legally that that aspect leaves much to be desired.  Will the Minister comment on that issue because insisting on tax clearance and so on is pointless if those who do not comply simply thumb their noses at the authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 7 imposes an obligation on local authorities to publish notices but states that objections would have to go directly to the courts.  That seems to impose unreasonable expense on people wishing to raise legitimate objections to the activities of the local authority.  While a final right of appeal to a court may be necessary, surely it would be preferable to have provisions similar to those for development plans where local authorities publish their proposals and a specific period is allowed for consideration of legitimate objections.  The council would then vote on the proposals and I presume there would be an entitlement to appeal to the District Court. In general we should try to keep such matters out of the courts if they can be dealt with more effectively elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Under the recent roads legislation, for example, in cases where objections were raised to local authorities closing lanes an independent person is appointed to conduct a hearing, and a report is sent to the local authority before it makes a final decision.  The Minister should examine that model.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Or they could publish draft by-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There would then be a <Col N="293" /> period within which to lodge an objection and an option to appoint someone to hold a hearing if there were contentious issues requiring arbitration independent of the local authority officials presenting the case.  A report would be sent to the local authority members who would then take a decision on the various issues.  That seems a more reasonable approach and would mean casual traders could not feel aggrieved about not getting a fair crack of the whip and would satisfy those who feel aggrieved by the extent of casual trading.  They could pursue their case without incurring excessive legal costs. Casual traders consider it unfair in that if they wish to defend their livelihood they must have recourse to the courts. They argue that other legitimately licensed traders are not required to go to court to pursue issues that should be pursued under the legislation in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister giving local authorities scope to exempt certain classes, where they see fit, and the right to make by-laws.  Given that the Minister rightly wants to keep fees down, will the administration of these regulations impose an additional burden on local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not entirely clear from the Minister's statement what they will be getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees referred to in the Bill are £20 but my understanding is that the fees being paid to the Minister's Department were ten times that sum. How will this be made consistent with the Minister's desire to keep fees at modest levels?  Local authorities should not be <Col N="294" /> left with responsibility for providing that casual traders do not have excessive charges imposed on them and the obligation of enforcement which, given the new regulations on tax clearance, will have to be more rigorous and will require additional resources.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, who find it difficult to carry out their principal activities, should not be required to dig deeper into their almost empty pockets to fund the enforcement of regulations that was traditionally, but wrongly, carried out by central Government.  The Minister is placing responsibility on local authorities for a significant loss-making activity. When appeals are lodged for excess fees, the Government will wash its hands and say that local authorities were given the power and they should deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must deal with the proper costings of good enforcement methods and whether that can be reasonably paid for by fees levied on casual traders.  There are not many circumstances in which we would expect enforcement to be borne by the legitimate trader.  We do not even expect the banks to carry the full cost of protecting their money.  If enforcement is to be expensive, casual traders should not be expected to carry all the cost and local authorities should not have to dip into their pockets.  In general I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill although there is scope for improvement in its provisions. I was pleased to hear the Minister indicate he will be tabling some amendments. Deputy Bruton and I will be tabling amendments.  The Bill, as drafted, represents a major improvement on the position obtaining in many of our towns and cities which is far from satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should aim within the context of any new law to provide proper protection for casual traders who want to trade legally.  This is a legitimate type of trade. We should endeavour to strike a proper <Col N="295" /> balance between casual traders and the major ratepayers, the shopkeepers who carry very large overheads, who are the mainstay and comprise the major part of trade in any village, town or city.  We must aim at all times to strike a proper balance of rights between those two sections of trade.</P>
    <P>Also within the context of any new legislation we should strive to recognise reality, to put in place the kind of law that will put out of business casual traders who persist in engaging within the black economy.  That must be the overall philosophy of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years in particular there has been a virtual explosion of casual trading here and in other countries. In those circumstances it is only right and proper that we should seek to regulate such trading in law, which is what we are endeavouring to do in this Bill.  This kind of trading has had adverse effects on traders whom I might describe as being the major ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in the Deputy's city they are referred to as the merchant princes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few of them left now but clearly the Minister knows what I am talking about.  There are market towns when on a fair day &mdash; the day on which the local shopkeeper and publican expect to have their major takings &mdash; casual traders with cars and vans move into the parking lot in the town square.  They will arrive before opening hours and take over all the available parking space.  They displace customers and trade for the remainder of that fair day, taking the pickings of what, in other circumstances, would go to the shopkeepers, the major ratepayers.  That is a major source of anger.  That is the kind of activity they want to see us legislators regulating and it will be dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told there are towns in the west where traders move in and remain for the whole of the tourist season, without licence or permit.  Local shopkeepers, <Col N="296" /> who pay their VAT, rates and PRSI in respect of their employees are placed at a major disadvantage because this kind of activity has been allowed to continue for too long.  This Bill is not before its time.</P>
    <P>Worst of all is the blatant selling of stolen goods on the outskirts of villages and towns.  There appears to have been no law enforcement to come to terms with that.  That latter activity must be killed off altogether within the context of a law that is well framed and rigorously enforced.  These were the major irritants mentioned to me in the context of inquiries I made when framing my Second Stage contribution.</P>
    <P>Also mentioned were the special events which have become the scourge of many towns and cities &mdash; the Síamsa Cois Laoí, the Féile in Thurles, events of that nature &mdash; when men from God knows where move in with their vans, trucks and lorries, cream off the spending power over the events of a weekend and then disappear.  They do not contribute a penny to the local authority for cleaning up after they have left.  All they leave in a town is the remains of their rubbish having exploited young people who will have parted with their pocket money.  It is vital that this type of activity be brought within the ambit of the law.  That is something that will tax all of us and will have to be addressed in detail on Committee Stage.  For example, is a fellow selling caps on O'Connell Street on an All-Ireland football or hurling day to be controlled or is he to be exempted?  Casual trade is a very disparate sort of thing.  It will be difficult to define the areas that must be held liable to licence and brought within the law.  On Committee Stage I will be tabling amendments with the assistance of people who have had experience of these activities.</P>
    <P>In general terms the great strength of this Bill is giving local authorities the licensing power.  Local authorities know the impact of granting a licence to trade in any given area.  They should be given discretion to include or exclude a certain kind of activity.</P>
    <P>I hope that the devolution of this power <Col N="297" /> will be taken on board by a number of other Ministers.  I know it forms part of the aspiration of the joint Programme for Government.  It is absurd to observe the manner in which local authorities are precluded from making their own by-laws in regard to a number of most ordinary functions within their areas.  They must rather refer to central Government for the making of by-laws and regulations. That is not the appropriate manner in which to operate local government.  One of the strengths of this Bill is that it represents a real effort to put local government in place.  The local authorities have the local knowledge and they are the people best placed to ensure that this kind of activity is regulated and controlled for the general good of people within their areas.</P>
    <P>If local authorities are to be given functions, where appropriate and necessary, they must also be given the requisite resources and pesonnel to ensure that the provisions of this Bill are fully implemented in all their elements and, whenever there is a breach of the law, it is dealt with in such a way as to ensure the provisions operate for the overall good.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that local authorities would have power to set their scale of fees.  This is important.  It may not be that in all cases the scale of fees would justify the cost; that is to be expected.  I do not think any sensible county or city manager would seek to offset the cost of putting this law in place and endeavour to recoup those costs from fees alone.  If the scale of fees is too high people will inevitably be forced to trade in the black economy. Certainly, we should not look to fees to make up for the cost of the implementation of this Bill.  If we are serious about making this Bill work central Government must be prepared to provide the additional resources.</P>
    <P>Garda powers must be strengthened to enable them to deal with breaches of the law, another issue more appropriate to Committee Stage.  My local authority said that fines imposed under the control of Dogs Act &mdash; which has given rise to more music hall jokes than anything else &mdash; go into the Exchequer like all money raised <Col N="298" /> from fines.  Local authorities have said there should be decentralisation of fines and perhaps we should start the process with this legislation.  Where there is a breach of the law and the fines provided for in the Bill are sizeable &mdash; otherwise they would not act as a deterrent &mdash; we should try to ensure that the money from fines can be retained by the licensing authority.  That makes sense and would provide an incentive to local authorities to ensure that breaches of the law are followed through and dealt with.  I ask the Minister to consider how best that could be put in place by way of an amendment.</P>
    <P>The Garda are extremely responsible, and rightly so, and goods are not seized lightly.  Under existing law goods are rarely seized and where they are there should be a procedure whereby they can be disposed of and the proceeds given to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has given discretion to local authorities to make out their own list of exemptions because different factors apply in different areas. While we want to control casual traders we do not want to kill casual trade because casual trade of a certain kind is part of the appeal and charm of a country. When we go to a European city one of the first places we want to visit is the open air market.  Part of the appeal of an agricultural country &mdash; even though our climate kills this type of trade &mdash; is that it should be possible for cheese makers to sell to the passing public and to tourists.  The same applies to home-made products.  I have in mind Mannings Emporium, Ballylickey, west Cork where the cheeses, fruit and vegetables of the region are put outside the shop in a series of beautifully painted wheel barrows.  This is a charming place where you can get lovely home-made cheese, home-made bread and a bottle of wine. It is what encourages people to visit such a place.  That type of activity fits the landscape like a glove and it is important not to kill the potential in this regard.  There is a number of areas where similar type activities could be carried out and a younger generation will probably do <Col N="299" /> more of that type of work.  If we were to proscribe in law, the potential of putting that in place, it would be an enormous loss.  Local authorities are the best judges of whether that type of activity enhances an area and I am glad they are given discretion under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some young people make very good quality enamel and silver jewellery and if they want to set up in an open air market in a town for the short tourist season, they should be facilitated.</P>
    <P>Many people sell strawberries for the short summer season.  The strawberries I buy on the side of the road taste much better than those in a restaurant and are cheaper.  While the Minister is proposing to include products not included under the 1980 Act &mdash; agriculture and horticultural products &mdash; the scale of fees and the designation policy should facilitate this kind of activity.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister made provision for local authorities to franchise.  I have direct experience of this with the English market in Cork which had become higgledy-piggledy in recent years and where the local authority did not have the resources to run it to its maximum effect.  It was franchised this year and the difference is remarkable as the market is now trading well.  It is important there is provision in the Bill for franchising by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are experiencing difficulty with traders who have historical rights, going back many generations. There is a danger in one or two areas of the country and cities that a pitched battle may erupt where local authorities attempt to put new designations in the areas.  We will have to give whatever assistance we can to put in place a provision seen to be fair to traditional traders. We must also seek to put in place the kind of system that will be fair to everybody and which will improve the trading prospects of people who have traded in those areas for so long.  There has been little investment in those areas which have become run down.  In the long term it is in everybody's interest that an improvement plan be put in place even <Col N="300" /> though it may lead to displacement.  Any assistance that could be given to local authorities to help them deal with that aspect would be welcome.  I am glad the Minister intends to insist on a casual trader having a tax clearance certificate. Local authorities are unclear as to how door-to-door selling will be dealt with in law.  It is up to us to provide for that but the Bill does not contain any clear directive in this area.  I welcome the Bill which, in essence, is a good one.  It is long overdue and I look forward to dealing with it in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of a similar disposition to previous speakers in that this is sensible legislation and likely to contribute to a general improvement in the quality of life of those affected by some of the more wayward dimensions of the problem.  I do not profess to be an expert in this area unlike Deputy Gregory who, unfortunately, is absent.  I cannot say for sure if he would agree with me that it is a sensible measure.  The indications are we will not conclude Second Stage today so perhaps he will have an opportunity to contribute on an aspect of street trading with which he is associated.</P>
      <P>The nub of the Bill is the ending of the crazy dual licensing arrangement.  On the one hand, the Department makes a decision on an application for casual trader's licence and, on the other, the local authority decides whether a permit will be granted.  There is not necessarily any compatibility between the two decisions.  I welcome the fact that the Bill devolves power to the local authority to make the decision as they are in a better position to decide what activity should be carried on in their functional area. However, I do not know if resources will be made available to enable them make and enforce such decisions.</P>
      <P>When the Minister says that local authorities will get the licence fee I do not know if that will amount to a tin of beans. He has not indicated the kind of revenue the local authorities could anticipate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Describing the background to this <Col N="301" /> legislation and how the 1980 Act came into existence, the Minister dealt with the question of competition and the balance that must be struck between the rights of casual traders and those of regular traders who incur overheads not borne by casual traders.  Both sections have their rights and entitlements.  The conclusion of the Restrictive Practices Commission that casual trading amounts to fair trading is an important finding.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister expand on the point &ldquo;subject to it making a more realistic contribution to public funds.&rdquo;  I am not aware of the contribution that is made nor what would be considered &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  I do not know if any more up to date work has been done on it but I would be concerned that devolving power to local authorities as the licensing authority and also devolving the enforcement role to them and to the Garda would result in a &ldquo;that is it off our plate, it is up to them to provide the resources&rdquo; attitude.  I suspect the contribution from the licensing fees is negligible and would not enable the local authority to implement the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>No one can argue with the principle of devolving this function to the local authority.  There is no way in which a Department can decide what is suitable for the respective administrative areas of local authorities.  Local authorities in Dublin differ in terms of the conditions they apply, not to mention other large urban authorities and rural authorities. Their positions are dramatically different in character, environmental considerations and so on.</P>
    <P>There is a wide definition of casual trading in the Bill.  Section 2 defines it as &ldquo;selling goods at a place (including a public road) to which the public have access of right or at any other place that is a casual trading area&rdquo;.  That is a market expansion of the definition from the 1980 Act which contained a raft of exclusions. When one considers that the 1980 Act covered a narrower area and there is still widespread dissatisfaction with its operation, one must conclude there is a major problem with enforcement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> There are different kinds of casual trading and they leave different problems in their wake.  My constituency, which is not too different in some areas from the Minister's, is a sprawling suburban area. Casual food traders can cause major problems.  I cannot remember if my namesake Mr. Jimmy Rabbitte had a licence for his van but his story gave me an insight into the point of view of the trader as distinct from the residents' viewpoint.  The chipper van pulls up at the corner of a street and proceeds to trade.  The irony is that the majority of local residents condone it and utilise the service provided, but for the unfortunate residents immediately adjacent to the chipper van the nuisance can be a nightmare. Litter is strewn around and it serves as a focal point for youths from the area and it can cause a real headache to residents in the immediate vicinity. Frequently these residents get a very poor hearing from their neighbours because they regard it as a facility and the fact that it is a source of constant nuisance to some cuts no ice.  The Minister may say it could be dealt with under the 1980 Act but from my experience it has not been dealt with and for one reason or another enforcement has been deficient.  I know people who were forced to sell their houses as a result of finding themselves at a focal point which attracts this type of casual trader.</P>
    <P>I agree with other Deputies who have highlighted the need to look more closely at enforcement.  It does not seem to follow automatically that the local authority, to whom the functions have been devolved, will automatically be in a position to implement them effectively.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill referred to the character of a town or city and this is very important. We have to strike a balance between the right of regular traders and casual traders.  It is part of the colour and character of areas of our towns and cities that casual trading be permitted.  Mrs. Dunne in the flats has as much right to make a living as Mr. Dunne in the super-market. Both of them supply a legitimate service and, provided it is subject to control and regulation, I see no reason that <Col N="303" /> it is not acceptable.  I recognise that the situation has changed dramatically in recent times.  Until some years ago the items that one could expect to buy from a street trader were restricted to newspapers, fruit and so on.  The range now is much wider and it is a matter of concern to traders who have overheads to discharge. The local authority which is familiar with the situation should be able to strike a balance.</P>
    <P>I have the impression that although local authorities have the power to designate sites for casual trading they have not done so very effectively.  In my constituency, which is a new area, the local authority has not designated areas but there may be financial or enforcement dimensions.  The Department gives a casual trader a licence, for which he must pay a fee, but the local authority is not in a position to provide him with reasonable facilities where he can conduct his trade.</P>
    <P>Generally local people, especially those on low incomes, welcome a market, but they are dissatisfied with the environmental consequences of such a market. The clean up after the traders have left often leaves a great deal to be desired. For some reason this is not being sufficiently addressed.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of flexibility in the Bill in terms of the situation to date and what the local authority may do.  I do not see provision for members of the travelling community &mdash; perhaps the Minister believes it is encompassed in the Bill.  I understand from my colleague, Deputy McManus, in her capacity as chairperson of the task force on travelling people, that the task force has received submissions on this point.  This matter should be addressed and this is the opportunity to do so.  This might address some of the other causes of tension that exists between the settled community and the travelling people.</P>
    <P>Is it envisaged that the local authority will have responsibility for the hygiene of casual food trading outlets?  This is the second area of complaint in politicians' advice centres?  In my experience the local authority officials shrug their <Col N="304" /> shoulders saying they cannot possibly police such outlets.  I presume it is the responsibility of the health board but again it is unclear how it can be done in practice.</P>
    <P>There is mounting concern about the involvement of criminals in casual trading, especially in the cities.  For example, bootleg tapes are sold openly on the streets of this city.  Apart from the question of competition this raises questions as to performer's rights, royalities and the quality of the product.  I read recently that an allegedly famous or notorious criminal has muscled in on the business of fruit stalls in certain parts of the city. It is hard to take, if this is common knowledge, that for some reason we have not been able to address this problem effectively. It is grossly unfair to legitimate street traders who have prescriptive rights and who have succeeded their mothers and grandmothers that this element has been allowed to creep in.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 of the 1980 Act the holders of casual trading permits were allowed to engage in casual trading in one place only or on specified days.  That provision appears to be missing from this Bill.  Has this concept been abandoned and, if so, why?</P>
    <P>The provision that the Department of Social Welfare should be notified when a person has been issued with a licence has been neatly included.  While it would be difficult to object to this provision are we being even-handed?  Is this duty imposed in respect of other activities in the economy? It is hard to believe that the ladies with the prams would be subject to this requirement.  Is this provision applied when Deputy Hughes' constituents or the small number of farmers in my constituency apply for grants?</P>
    <P>When speaking about the tax clearance certificate the Minister said piously that we adopt an even-handed approach.  In my experience this is not the case.  This week the Committee of Public Accounts will examine the way a significant public service contract was given to a business which was not in a position to provide a tax clearance certificate although another business was in a position to do so.  I am <Col N="305" /> not objecting to this provision in principle and it is a good idea that it ought to be applied fairly across the board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill provided we will have an opportunity to examine it more closely on Committee Stage.  I would like to think that this sensible devolution of power will be matched by the provision of resources to allow the local authorities carry out the task envisaged in the Bill given that it impinges on the lives of ordinary people.  A framework will be put in place to improve the position.  Can the Minister give us an estimate of the revenue that is likely to be raised?</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill referred to once-off events.  A large sporting facility in my constituency is a tremendous asset.  It has a national dimension.  Local people have protested about the fall-out from some events held there.  Recently residents tipped the rubbish they had gathered in plastic sacks in the office of the county manager to highlight their exasperation about the difficulties encountered in the wake of major events.</P>
    <P>What is the reason occasional trading and casual trading are not treated in the same way?  What is the reason local authorities do not have control over occasional trading?  This is a major issue for residents in urban constituencies such as mine given that casual trading becomes a focal point for miscreants.  It is of paramount importance that we have the capacity to implement and enforce the provisions of this Bill, otherwise people will not notice any visible difference.  I suspect that we will have to return to the question of financing again.</P>

      <P>Ministers are informed on taking office of the general principle that they should not engage in any activities that could reasonably be regarded as interfering or being incompatible with the duties of their offices.  Ministers are required to draw the attention of the Government to any matter before Government in which they or their family have a material interest, and not to participate in decision-making in the matter unless the Government decides otherwise. These guidelines have been applied by successive administrations over many years and continue to apply.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is preparing an Ethics in Public Office Bill.  This Bill, which is at an advanced stage of drafting and which will deal with the wider area of conflict of interest, will complement existing guidelines and practice in relation to Ministers and Ministers of State.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that while our Attorney General is the adviser to the Government his counterpart in Britain is the adviser to Parliament and, therefore, must be a member of Parliament and that this constitutional difference has presented major problems here in respect of accountability?  Will he agree that the role of the Attorney General in examining warrants requesting extradition, the role the courts have conferred on him as the protector of citizens' rights, as prosecutor &mdash; even though part of that role has been hived off to the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; and his role as adviser to the Government, particularly in giving advice about which others receive conflicting advice, should be reviewed along the lines of the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General?  Will the Taoiseach agree that the Attorney General should be made more accountable to this House or a committee of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution provides that the Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government and is not a member of it.  The purpose of that constitutional arrangement is to enable the Attorney General to give advice on legal issues that is completely frank and free from any party political considerations. The only legal advice that is worth having &mdash; and I am sure all Members would agree &mdash; is from a lawyer who gives unbiased advice so that the client knows where he or she stands.  If the Attorney General were to be answerable to this House in regard to his duties the result would be to draw him into <Col N="314" /> the party political arena which would be highly undesirable.  Furthermore, it would breach the confidentiality of the lawyer-client relationship if he was drawn into debate on the advice he gives to the Government.  I am sure that will clarify the matter.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that under our extradition laws the vetting of warrants by the Attorney General, who sits at the Cabinet table, could be tainted because there is no accountability to the House?  Will he also agree that, for example, the Attorney General has been involved in controversy because of his decision in the X case and other cases?  Will he agree that in the case of the larceny of a consignment of cigarettes, worth approximately £500,000, about which a prosecution did not ensue, that nobody was accountable and that somebody should have been accountable?  Will he agree also that if the Attorney General gives advice to the Government about which the President receives conflicting advice it gives rise to controversy?</P>

      <P>For all those reasons, will the Taoiseach agree that the Attorney General should be brought before this House occasionally or before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security so that both he and the Director of Public Prosecutions are accountable, without interfering with their independence, as is the case in other jurisdictions from which we have taken some of our laws?</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Mitchell raised a number of questions in regard to the Office of the Attorney General because it gives me an opportunity to put certain matters on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is entirely happy with the advice it has received from the Attorney General since his appointment and with the manner in which he has <Col N="315" /> discharged his functions.  Much of the criticism of the Attorney General voiced by a number of sources, usually the same sources, both inside and outside this House, are very wide of the mark.  Even though some of those critics are lawyers they do not seem to have grasped the fact that the courts have repeatedly stressed the independence of the Attorney General's role where the upholding of the Constitution is concerned.  In the past few years a number of difficult and complex cases arose for consideration by the Attorney General which required to be litigated by him in his independent constitutional role.  In those cases he was invariably found to have acted correctly in initiating the proceedings and almost invariably the arguments which he advanced in the proceedings have prevailed. Only the courts have the competence to decide on the appropriateness of the actions of the Attorney General in those areas.</P>
    <P>In the light of the court's vindication of the Attorney General's actions it is regrettable that critics persist in misrepresenting the position.  Many of those critics have rushed to utter their criticism before the court had given any judgment and were then proved wrong, but have refrained from acknowledging that they were wrong.  It is regrettable that that should be the case and where the courts have upheld the advice of the Attorney General and his actions Members at least should accept that he has acted in accordance with the highest traditions of his office.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the House cannot have a reply to supplementary questions.  Will the Taoiseach agree that independence and accountability are different?  The Attorney General has hived off some of his work to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions but retains the right to consultation in respect of it.  Will the Taoiseach agree that there is a growing concern about the failure to take prosecutions in a number of cases involving deaths?  For example, a murder case was not pursued because the book of evidence was not produced and the case had to be re-entered in another way. In another case a major consignment of tobacco was stolen and the case was not pursued.  Somebody should account for the lack of prosecution in cases where an explanation is required in the public interest and that accountability should not interfere with the independence of the Director of Public Prosecution or the Attorney General.  Another jurisdiction has found a way to deal with that matter without interfering with the independence of the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions and it is time we had a similar system here where Deputies could be satisfied that all is kosher.  I am not directing that remark to the current office holders, but the principle of accountability should exist in areas where there is such a level of power and independence.</P>

    <P>To avoid any possibility of confusion, I should explain that it means that at the end of 1992 the total number of outstanding fines and their estimated value for all previous years, including the five years mentioned by the Deputy, was 84,387 and £9.76 million respectively. The total value of fines collected over the five year period mentioned by the Deputy was £34.66 million.</P>
    <P>At any time there is bound to be a considerable number of unexecuted warrants outstanding representing work currently on hands by courts staff and gardaí and this could not be properly termed arrears.  In addition some warrants cannot be executed by the gardaí because the defendant has moved from the address on the warrant and his new address is unknown.  Furthermore, there are many cases where payment of the <Col N="321" /> sums provided for in the warrants would involve genuine difficulties or even hardship for the persons concerned and this is a factor which militates against anything approaching a complete enforcement rate.</P>
    <P>The figures are quite high but the numbers of fines outstanding were reduced by approximately 27 per cent over the five year period.  The fact that the value of the reduced numbers of outstanding fines is increasing probably reflects an increase in the levels of fines imposed by the courts.  With a view to making further progress in this area, I am having the question of payment of fines by attachment of earnings examined in my Department at present.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that even if one-third of the outstanding fines for 1992, the most recent year for which she has given figures, were collected, in-cell sanitation facilities could be provided for every prisoner in Mountjoy?  Would she agree it is totally unacceptable that such a substantial amount of money is left outstanding and that there is a need to approach the collection of fines in a new way?  Would she agree that the possibility of a collection agency, whether in the public or private sector, should be considered as at present there is great wastage of Garda manpower, with gardaí calling repeatedly to homes to collect outstanding fines?</P>

A number of proposals have been made in the recent past by a committee of this House, of which the Deputy's brother is a member, as well as by a number of individuals inside and outside the House.  I will examine all reasonable proposals put before me.  I agree that the amount of money outstanding could be spent in many areas, including that raised by the Deputy.

Will she consider introducing interest payments on outstanding fines to encourage people to pay their fines expeditiously so that Garda time is not wasted in repeatedly calling on people? Will she give the courts power to collect fines, not just by way of attachment of earnings &mdash; we discussed this matter in the House &mdash; but by way of seizure of assets if necessary so as to ensure that the system does not continue to be clogged up by outstanding fines and that Garda time is not wasted in the collection of fines which are mounting from year to year?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>A review of activity levels in the High and Circuit Courts to assess the impact of the altered jurisdiction of the courts under the Courts Act, 1991, has been completed in the Department of Justice. The results of this review will from the basis of proposals which the Minister will be bringing to Government in the near future with a view to eliminating arrears in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the review of the courts has been completed and I look forward to the publication of the recommendations. Would the Minister agree that the delays experienced throughout the country are unsustainable?  Urgent action is needed to allow citizens access to the justice system.  Would the Minister agree that denial of access to speedy litigation is a denial of fundamental human rights, clogs up the system in terms of evidence being unavailable and undermines the justice system by causing litigants to accept small settlements so as to finalise the case?  It also affects efficient trading in the State.  How many extra Circuit Court judges will be appointed? At present there is a two to three year waiting time between the setting down of a case for trial and the ultimate hearing of that case.</P>

      <P>No case can be listed for hearing until a notice of trial is lodged and that is usually a matter for the parties concerned.  Even when a notice of trial is lodged it can be subject to requests from either side for adjournment.  I agree that delays occur which cause difficulty, but all the resources available to us will be used to ensure an efficient and effective delivery of the service.  I am confident that the proposals the Minister will take <Col N="326" /> to Government in the near future will alleviate the problem to a considerable degree.  The extent of the delays varies from one part of the country to another. The problem is not as bad in some areas as in others.  The proposals the Minister will take to Cabinet will be designed to alleviate this problem.  The President of the Circuit Court has agreed to chair a committee which will look at the number of Circuit Courts and the areas they cover.  This will form an essential part of the process to eliminate delays.</P>

The appointment of additional Circuit Court judges will form part of the proposals which the Minister will bring to Cabinet.  It is only proper that the Cabinet should consider the matter before I disclose to the House what it will consider. I am not disposed, therefore, to say the number of additional appointments the Minister will be seeking.  We can depend on the Minister to make a very good case at Cabinet &mdash; she is very persuasive.  I have every confidence that her proposals and the discussion at Cabinet will enable us to get on top of this problem.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has answered his question by stating that serious allegations were made.  Because the inquiries into these allegations have to be very thorough they will take time. The allegations are being investigated by the Garda Commissioner and there is no dragging of heels.

As the Deputy correctly pointed out, a number of changes took place in the unit.  After the first investigation, the results of which were given to the Garda Commissioner, certain other information came to light which both the Garda Commissioner and I strongly felt should be investigated by him.  That investigation is ongoing.  I will have no difficulty in giving the information in that report to the House when it becomes available to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 14, and 53 together.</P>
      <P>I regard programmes which help to divert young people away from crime as an essential part of the criminal justice system today.  One such programme is organised under the Garda National Juvenile Office which operates the Garda juvenile diversion programme, JLO scheme, as well as the Garda schools programme.  Another development is the funding by my Department of community-based initiatives in areas of disadvantage through local community-based bodies established for such purpose. This funding can be channelled through the Garda Síochána or through the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the juvenile liaison service is concerned, the service should be upgraded in line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  I see this matter developing as more gardaí are recruited to the force and as a result of the ongoing civilianisation <Col N="330" /> of the force, both of which measures form an essential feature of the law and order programme outlined by me on 14 December last.</P>
    <P>The first major improvements to the JLO scheme since its inception in 1963 were made in 1991 and other initiatives have since been introduced to further involve members of the Garda Síochána with the young people in the communities in which they serve.  As Deputies know, the changes were quite extensive.</P>
    <P>In so far as crime diversion programmes are concerned, I can inform the House that the Garda are involved in a number of community-based projects aimed at identifying young people at risk and attempting to divert them from crime by developing their social skills and improving their self-esteem.  These include the GRAFT project in Ronanstown, the KEY project in Killinarden, the WHAD project in Cherry Orchard and the Outreach project in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I have been heartened by the success of these youth diversion projects to date and I was glad to announce recently, as part of my package of law and order measures, further funding to increase Garda participation in these type of community based projects in Knocknaheeny-Holyhill, Cork, and Moyross, Limerick, in line with the findings of the Inter-departmental Group on Urban Crime and Disorder and as promised in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</P>
    <P>I also announced recently, in line with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, a proposal to employ two social workers to coach selected JLOs in drugs counselling and related work.  Generally I would like to see a development of the work of the JLOs in the area of drugs, and this is an aspect that I intend to explore further with the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Browne's question, I would like to assure him that the JLO scheme does not prevent a garda from arresting juveniles who break the law and processing their cases through the courts.  The scheme does, however, provide for the cautioning and supervision of young offenders under the age <Col N="331" /> of 18 years as an alternative to prosecution provided the juvenile admits the offence and the parents or guardians agree to co-operate in the implementation of the diversion programme.  The views of the injured party are also taken into consideration.  If a juvenile fails to comply with the terms of the diversion programme he/she may be prosecuted in the normal way.  The JLO scheme has been very effective to date and approximately 89 per cent of juveniles cautioned have not reoffended within their supervisory period.</P>
    <P>I will be introducing a juvenile justice Bill later this year which will repeal the 1908 Children Act and will also include a provision to put the JLO scheme on a statutory footing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the current number of gardaí engaged in the juvenile liaison service and the numbers planned under the expansion?  Is it the case that the number of gardaí enganged in the juvenile liaison service still constitutes approximately 1 per cent of the entire force, whereas the number of crimes committed by juveniles accounts for approximately half of all crimes for which convictions are secured?  Will the Minister confirm that the money made available by her in the recent package for community-based initiatives which will divert young people away from crime was less than the average amount of money required to provide one additional prison place under the same scheme?  Does the Minister consider it is time to have a radical rethink of the way in which resources are applied to the prevention of crime rather than simply towards its control or to punishment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 80 juvenile liaison officers throughout the country, 37 of whom are based in the Dublin metropolitan area and there are no plans to increase their number.  In relation to the amount of money being spent on community based initiatives, this is a new idea as the Deputy is aware. It is one that has been evaluated and <Col N="332" /> which my Department and its officials, in particular the officials working in the probation and welfare area of the Department, feel strongly should be supported in a positive way.  Because of that I secured additional funding this year and two additional projects, one in Knocknaheeny-Holyhill in Cork and the other in Moyross in Limerick, have already been announced.  I am considering a number of projects in other areas throughout the country and they will be provided within the funds available. There are never enough funds but I agree that more investment in community based initiatives can provide sound alternatives for young people, particularly juveniles, who can be supervised in a positive way by the Probation and Welfare Service.  During my term as Minister for Justice I will try to secure from the Department of Finance increased funding for that area of development within the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that there are no plans to increase the number of juvenile liaison officers.  Will the Minister agree that given the success of the juvenile liaison scheme &mdash; and she mentioned an 89 per cent referral figure &mdash; the number of juvenile liaison officers should be substantially increased?  Will she also agree that was the intention in the Programme for Government and give an indication that the number of juvenile liaison officers will be increased to lift the enormous burden already on the juvenile liaison service?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>All members of An Garda Síochána are trained in the investigation of cases of rape and sexual abuse.  This training is comprehensive and covers all aspects of such an investigation, including the traumatic effect of the crime on its victim.</P>
      <P>However, due to the volume of such cases in the Dublin metropolitan area, a woman and child unit was formed in the area in March 1993 to provide an overview of the investigation of crimes of domestic violence, child sexual abuse and other violent and sexual offences committed against women and children.  A key objective of the unit is to ensure a standardised and consistent approach to investigations and to build up within the force a broad body of expertise in this most sensitive area of criminal investigation. The unit assists in the investigation of cases of a serious and complex nature.  It is Garda policy that all members should be able to investigate crimes of this nature.  The purpose of the unit is to enhance the expertise of the members in this area.</P>
      <P>The expertise that has developed within the woman and child unit has been made available to Garda personnel outside the DMA in terms of advice and input to Garda training.  This has led to a current review by the Garda authorities of the question of extending the scope of the unit to other areas outside the DMA, following its successful operations there.</P>

In this regard pilot schemes have been initiated by the Garda in a number of centres, Coolock and Dundrum in Dublin, Henry Street in Limerick and Mill Street in Galway.  In the meantime ongoing discussions are continuing between my Department and the Department of Health and we hope to issue a guideline in relation to inter-agency co-operation that could be operated in a practical and efficient way.</P>

The fact that so many cases have come to the attention of the unit in Dublin makes it clear that this more centralised approach and the gathering of expertise in one location is necessary. Some professional groups, doctors, social workers, etc., are concerned about the question of confidentiality.  Has that concern led to delays in the referral of cases to the Garda and how does the Minister think this should be handled because it is very much tied to the issue under discussion?</P>

      <P>Confidentiality is an issue about which the <Col N="335" /> Garda have been very concerned.  During the in-service training courses and at the the initial recruitment stage of training in the Garda Training College special emphasis is laid on confidentiality.  It was felt for a long time that women were reluctant to report incidents of this kind because they were not always certain they would be treated in a confidential manner.  That has changed and the increased levels of reporting indicates there is confidence in the work of the Garda.  As regards the timetable for the extension of the service, I am hopeful this will take place before the end of the year.  The Deputy Commissioner responsible is anxious to have an extension of the service but it must be done in a planned and programmed way and we hope to extend the service initially to the main-cities.</P>

      <P>This is the inter-agency co-operation to which I referred earlier.  As I said pilot schemes have commenced in Coolock, Dundrum, Henry Street in Limerick and Mill Street in Galway.  They have been working well and we hope to learn from them.  We are discussing confidentiality &mdash; and when agencies should refer cases of this kind to the Garda &mdash; with officials in the Department of Health because both Departments are keenly aware of the necessity to ensure inter-agency co-operation and that case conferences take place in all these instances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>I was impressed by the prospectus prepared by the Irish Criminal Justice Research Institute in the context of its application to me for financial support in September 1993.  The proposed work programme of the institute included research into the operation of the criminal justice system as a whole including policing, prisons, sentencing practice, probation and welfare services, victim support services as well as aspects of juvenile justice.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise, however, that developments in some of these areas are already under way.  The Law Reform Commission, for example, is in the process of completing its work in relation to sentencing policy having published a comprehensive consultation paper on the subject.  My Department has been working on a comprehensive prisons policy document and a proposed juvenile justice Bill and I expect to be in a position to publish both this year.  Furthermore, a research unit will be established at the Garda Training College to undertake practical and mission orientated research of relevance to a modern police force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be difficult to justify expenditure in the region of £50,000 per annum sought by the institute on an open ended basis in these circumstances, particularly <Col N="337" /> at a time of scarce financial resources. The main deciding factor, however, is that there are no funds at my disposal which could be made available to the institute at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any idea what percentage of the £66 million to be allocated to her Department over the next few years for law enforcement and detecting and reducing crime will be spent on research?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that precise information to hand but the House should realise that an extensive amount of research has been undertaken already.  Perhaps I should read into the record some aspect of the research already undertaken.  For instance, we have had the Whitaker Committee in relation to the prison system, the Walsh Committee which looked at Garda training, the Law Reform Commission which engages in a continuous review of our laws, the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, the Martin Committee on certain aspects of criminal procedures, the Committee on Public Safety and Crowd Control, the Interdepartmental group on the administration of justice and the Interdepartmental group on urban crime and disorder.  We have carried out extensive research, and have had it carried out on our behalf independently. People are seeking action, claiming that we do not need more committees, commissions or reports.  The substantial funding announced in the law and order package earlier in the year provides for the kind of action the public is demanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's contention and agree there is an appetite for action on the part of the general public in relation to crime in general. Will the Minister agree that all policy is deficient if it is not firmly grounded and empirical, incorporating research already undertaken?  On the proposal to build a new women's prison, how much research has been conducted into alternatives to prison for women offenders who are, in <Col N="338" /> the main, shoplifters, non-violent offenders?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a later question on an alternative to imprisonment for women.  All of us agree that we need more research, but we cannot allow that to halt necessary developments.  I am glad Deputy O'Donnell agrees that the public is demanding action.  It is important to move ahead with developments already promised while at the same time ensuring that the research unit, particularly at the Garda Training College in Templemore, is up and running very shortly.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to both the Law Reform Commission and the Whitaker Committee.  Would she agree that the Whitaker report and the report of the Law Reform Commission on sentencing were both critical of the absence of adequate information on the whole criminal justice system?  Would she agree that one of the main reasons for resisting any funding for the Irish Criminal Justice Research Institute is that it would be independent, that its information would be available to everybody, including the Opposition, who are badly in need of such independent source of information?  Would she agree that it is time to reconsider her attitude to the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill to create a national bureau of crime statistics since it is clear that the Garda crime statistics do not reflect the true level of crime but rather the level of reported crime, that the prison statistics are outrageously out of date and do not inform us of anything and that there is no information on sentencing policy available to the Judiciary or to legislators?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell tried to raise the National Bureau of Crime Statistics.  Since we have only completed our discussion of that Bill in the House he is fully aware of my views on it.  With regard to his assertion that the Irish Criminal Justice Research Institute would be independent, I hope he is not suggesting that the Law Reform Commission <Col N="339" /> is not independent, that the Martin Committee, the Whitaker Committee or that any of them were stymied by officials of my Department or anybody elsewhere.  All of them have been independent and advanced very radical proposals. In so far as is possible within the scarce financial resources available to my Department many of the recommendations contained in those reports have already been implemented or are in the process of implementation.  I have no reason to stop funding to any research institute merely because it will be independent. The Deputy knows that during the past 14 months I have been very open with him and other Opposition spokespersons. I have not tried to hide any statistics or relevant information and I intend to proceed in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the reports and research to which she referred were very much task-oriented and that we need an independent body undertaking research in the overall area of crime and justice so that we can all be armed with proper research to enable an informed discussion on the whole area of crime and justice on which decisions can be based and we do not rely entirely on &ldquo;top of the head&rdquo; solutions to what are very serious problems for the entire community?</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Gilmore is not implying that we rely on &ldquo;top of the head&rdquo; solutions.  I hope we take cognisance of the recommendations of the various reports put before us.  I have no objection whatsoever to independent research into the whole criminal law area.  I said I was very impressed with the prospectus prepared by the Irish Criminal Justice Research Institute but that I did not see there was justification for the Department of Justice to give £50,000 per annum on an open-ended basis to the institute to undertake its work.  I very much welcome the work the institute will undertake.  I look forward to whatever reports it may publish for the public.  We will look in a <Col N="340" /> very objective manner at whatever recommendations it may make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister is not prepared even to consider funding the Irish Criminal Justice Research Institute.  With the appetite to respond to crime and punishment in a heavy-handed law and order way, there is a danger of an anti-intellectual approach to the problems associated with criminology.  As requested by other Members, I would ask the Minister to reconsider that decision given that, since this institute is based in a university, providing students with employment, it would augment our collective knowledge and understanding of the reasons behind the committing of crime?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I welcomed the establishment of the institute and am supportive of the work it is doing, but I do not have a mechanism within my Department whereby I can spend £50,000 annually towards the work of the institute.  That does not mean that the work of the institute does not go ahead. There are very scarce financial resources available to my Department.  Even if, within those resources, there was money available, there is no way, under present regulations, that I could make £50,000 available to the institute annually.</P>

      <P>The law on naturalisation provides that the Minister for Justice may grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation, although the statutory conditions are not wholly satisfied, where an applicant has Irish <Col N="341" /> associations.  I am prepared to consider an application within that provision where the applicant has invested a substantial sum in the State in a viable business with considerable job-creating potential.

      <P>Can the Deputy give me a specific instance of a proposal having been put to my Department? I do not have any information to hand in respect of specific cases.  It was suggested in the newspapers recently that, because my Department did not act in a particular way, a large number of jobs were lost by way of non-investment by a Taiwanese company.  No application was received in my Department from that company.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister clarified the position on that specific matter.  I was merely seeking to establish general policy.  Can she confirm that no recommendations whatsoever have been made by any Government Minister and can she clarify general Government policy on the issue of passports to foreign investors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated that she would take on board representations from foreign investors who have invested a significant amount of money in this country or in the creation of employment. Can she be more specific in respect of Government policy on foreign investment, particularly to non-nationals and the issue of passports?  Is it possible to do a deal, as it were, with a Government <Col N="342" /> Department and overturn normal procedures in order to get investment into this country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the exact criteria for the granting of citizenship in these cases, each application is considered on its merits.  A general guideline would be that someone with Irish associations would make a substantial investment in the country of, say, £1 million.  The bottom line in relation to any investment is that it must have potential for job creation.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of Deputy Hogan and others I will refer to the background of naturalisation of foreign nationals on the basis of investment.  The possibility of Hong King businessmen acquiring Irish passports was originally raised by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy John Bruton, on 8 September 1983.  The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, wrote to the Minister for Justice on 8 January 1986 concerning the possibilities of Hong Kong businessmen investing here and mentioned certain arrangements that could be made.  Those were good judgments by both Ministers at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If a foreign national is prepared to be associated with Ireland by making a substantial financial investment, purchasing a home and living here, he or she should be considered for naturalisation by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the fact that these Hong Kong investors &mdash; who were prepared to come here when Deputies Bruton and Dukes were in Government &mdash; are not now prepared to come is a clear indication of lack of international confidence in the Government?</P>

      <P>We would all wish to facilitate foreign nationals who wish to invest in Ireland.  Do I understand the Minister to say there is a two tier system for naturalisation; if you can put money up front with a view to establishing a business here there is a fast track method of naturalisation whereas some unfortunate person who wishes to be reunited with his family may have to wait for years before the process of naturalisation is completed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not the case that there is a two tier system or that there is a fast track for naturalisation.  I am glad the Deputy agrees that all of us should facilitate people prepared to make a substantial financial investment by purchasing a home and spending time here in order to provide investment for companies in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A substantial number of Members of this House have, in the past 14 months, made representations to me concerning various companies in their constituencies who have potential investors anxious to invest a substantial amount of money in a company which will either ensure the continuation of the employment or provide for more substantial employment.  I am happy to accept representations from anybody in relation to job creation.  It is not open to anyone to apply for naturalisation on a fast track basis.  It is open to anyone to apply if they can prove Irish associations but they must make a convincing case.  I am interested in what Deputies are saying because the normal representations I receive in the Department suggest that decisions of this nature are not made quickly enough.</P>

When the Minister for Finance made representations about the Taiwanese company I was surprised the Department of Justice did not accede to the request to do a deal.  He made commitments to that company in return for foreign investment to be made here. Subsequently that factory went to Northern Ireland, under the jurisdiction of the British authorities, because they were prepared to do something for that company which this country failed to do.</P>

Immediately I asked the officials in my Department for a full report.  I discovered that no application was made to my Department and nobody approached my Department in that matter.  I am happy to say my Department was not responsible for losing the investment by the Taiwanese.</P>

      <P>The number of deaths in custody in Mountjoy Prison for the years 1988 to 1993 was as follows: 1988, 2; 1989, 3; 1990, 2; 1991, 4; 1992, 1; and 1993, 1.</P>
      <P>I gave the Dáil a detailed statement on the issue of prison deaths in reply to a similar parliamentary question on 24 February and I would refer the Deputy to the record of the House in that respect.</P>
      <P>Mountjoy Prison is the main committal prison in this jurisdiction.  More prisoners go through it every year than the rest of our custodial institutions combined.  It is hardly surprising, therefore, that a high proportion of the deaths in prison custody have taken place there.  The Governor and staff of Mountjoy have shown exceptional commitment to suicide prevention and all the measures mentioned in my reply of 24 February are fully in force there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned about the continuing evidence not only about suicides but about attempted suicides in our prisons, some of which our attention has been drawn to by the statistics of the prisons themselves?  For example, the 189 incidents last year amount to almost one incident for every ten prisoners in the State.  Will the Minister say how many of the recommendations of the advisory group on prison suicides have been implemented in full?</P>

      <P>To put death in custody figures in context it should be noted that more than 6,000 prisoners go through the prison system every year and in 1991 one such suicide occurred.  The advisory group on prison deaths published their report in August 1991 and so far 50 of their 57 recommendations have been implemented.</P>

      <P>I do not have the exact figure but some of the more important ones are the 24 hour a day medical orderly cover in closed institutions; an increase in the number of clinical psychologists from three to six initially including a female psychologist to cover the women's prison; the installation of cell call systems with which distressed prisoners may summon help; the introduction of a service by the Samaritans in all institutions and the availability of cordless telephones to enable prisoners to contact the Samaritans on designated telephone lines; special training courses for prison staff; the establishment of a suicide prevention group in each institution to review suicide attempts and ensure appropriate action is taken at local level; training in the use of resuscitation equipment; employment of a pharmacist; revision of the 1947 Rules for the Government of Prisons; improvements in GP services and the provision of in-cell sanitation, which is a seven year programme as the Deputy is aware.  The remaining recommendations are more long term in nature as was recognised by the advisory group when it reported. They include the provision of a new female prison and a committal assessment centre with a level of services appropriate to them.  The recommendations which have not been implemented will be addressed in the overall developments taking place within the prison system.</P>

      <P>I gave the figures to the Deputy on 24 February. They are: five in 1988, five in 1989, five in 1990, three in 1991 and four in 1992.

      <P>Did the Minister say on 24 February that no record of attempted suicide was kept because of the difficulty of distinguishing between serious and non-serious attempts?  Is this justified given that more women are prone to suffer from depression and self-inflicted injury in prison given their type of criminality and the fact that they are separated from their children?  Would she agree that it is essential to keep a record of attempted suicides in order to monitor the mental health of the inmates?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that records are not kept of attempted suicide because there are many instances of self-inflicted injury which would be difficult to distinguish from deliberate suicide attempts.  All groups, including the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights, agree the need for a dedicated women's prison which would need less security than that in Mountjoy.  As the Deputy knows there is an advisory group dealing with that issue.  I am looking at the possibility of establishing a hostel for women who have difficulty but who are not suitable for, or whose crime might not warrant, a custodial sentence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward a Bill to update the 1980 Act.  Indeed, that Act was introduced by a former colleague from west Mayo, a former Minister of State at the then Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Mr. Denis Gallagher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Explanatory Memorandum states that the primary purpose of the Bill is &ldquo;to achieve greater decentralisation, efficiency and flexibility in the regulation <Col N="428" /> of casual trading&rdquo;.  When the then Minister was introducing the 1980 Act he said the purpose of that legislation was to provide for the control and regulation of casual trading.  From my limited knowledge of this sector, that Act has been an abysmal failure.  In teasing out the provisions of the 1980 Act local authorities have in the main found it an extremely costly exercise in fruitless litigation. The rate payers in Westport have borne the loss of £10,000 in legal expenses in trying to implement the provisions of that Act.  Many cases have been taken to court and I am sure the Minister has included amendments to ensure a level playing pitch that meets the needs of the established trader and the casual trader in modern day trading.</P>
    <P>Casual trading provides a very valuable service in our towns and cities.  Families have been involved in casual trading for many years and have made their livelihood from it.  Casual trading adds character and colour to towns and villages. Visitors look forward to visiting markets where traders erect a stand in the town or village square and try to sell their produce, or crafts, locally produced butter, cheeses and other food items.</P>
    <P>I support casual trading but there has to be a level playing pitch.  Most casual traders are responsible people.  They come to town to trade on what is inevitably the busiest day of the week and they clean up when they have finished.  They travel from town to town and have set pitches in each town.  These people have a constitutional right to make a living and we must not do anything in legislation that would interfere with their rights. Otherwise we would involve the local authorities in court actions and I am sure the courts would vindicate their rights to make a living.</P>
    <P>No business can operate without regulatory controls.  Normal business is subject to such regulations.  There are so many in some instances that it inhibits people going into business in the first instance.  A person in business has to comply with the planning requirements, employment law, health and safety regulations, Revenue in all its dimensions and <Col N="429" /> so on.  People who set up a shop, whether they own it or lease it, have to comply with regulations but heretofore a great many of those engaged in casual trading escaped.</P>
    <P>This Bill, together with previous legislation, is an attempt to level the playing field and for that reason I welcome it. Most casual traders are legitimate operators who buy their merchandise from wholesalers which in itself creates employment here.  Unfortunately, a number of casual traders operating throughout Ireland obtain their goods in a dubious fashion and the origin of the goods would be difficult to determine. The clothing industry is a case in point; one hears of a Hiace van driving up to containers in South William Street or other wholesale areas, loading up and driving away.  The abolition of VAT at the point of entry makes it attractive for people to purchase these goods.</P>
    <P>Consumers who purchase televisions and other electrical equipment of doubtful origin from casual traders from the back of lorries or cars have no protection. While the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, should be congratulated on updating the legislation in this area, consumers do not know who they are buying from because the requirement to exhibit the casual trading permit is ignored.  I have yet to see a permit exhibited on any stall.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed changes. Section 2 defines casual trading.  It does not cover three categories of trading, namely, the sale of goods at auction, adjacent to one's house or business or for what might best be described as philanthropic purposes.  It also enables the Minister and the local authorities to add to the exempted categories of trading not covered by the definition of casual trading.  The Minister may alter or delete these classes.</P>
    <P>Under the 1980 Act a longer list of classes of trading were exempted.  These included the sale of agricultural and horticultural produce, including livestock, by the producer or his servants or agents acting on his behalf and the sale of fish by a crew member who caught them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> There was an ancilliary provision whereby a person who sold this produce, having purchased it from the producer, was obliged to obtain a casual trading licence at a much reduced fee of £5 whereas the normal licence fee was £100.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify that a local authority will be able to add the sale of agricultural and horticultural produce to the exempted classes and that only the Minister will have the power to delete or alter these classes.  Local authorities would like to continue the custom of encouraging people who live in rural areas to sell their spring cabbage plants, apples and strawberries in towns.  I am thinking in particular of the market that is held in my own town on a weekly basis at which calves are sold and turkeys and geese in the run up to Christmas.  Country markets are well established at which housewives add to their income through the sale of home produced cakes and other items.  These markets are based mainly in premises which will not be affected by the Bill but occasionally they take the opportunity to sell in the open. I foresee the local authority of which I am a member adding to the exempted class the sale of the locally produced produce.  People will be concerned when the Bill is put into effect that an activity engaged in on a weekly basis or in the run up to Christmas will not be curtailed.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that local authorities had asked him to control the sale of such produce.  I have no doubt that representations were made.  The Minister made the point that it was difficult to prove in court that produce was produced locally.  I see no difficulty in inserting a provision similar to section 3 (4) under which there would be an onus on the defendant to prove that he was the producer. I do not support those who sell imported agricultural or horticultural produce.  We have many fine fruit and vegetable shops which have to buy their produce in the markets in Dublin.  Casual traders should not be placed in a position of advantage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed change in section 4 whereby a person will have to apply to a local authority rather than the <Col N="431" /> Minister for a licence and will have to produce a tax clearance certificate.  It is right and proper that powers should be devolved to local authorities, who know the people who sell in towns on a weekly basis, to make the decision as to whether a permit should be granted.  It is also important that the local authorities should outline the fees to be charged for such a licence.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper that tax clearance certificate provisions should apply to this activity.  The Minister indicated that no one will be denied a tax clearance certificate on the first occasion.  They will have 12 months to put their affairs in order when they will be required to produce a further tax clearance certificate. No one could object to this in principle.  Similar provisions apply to publicans and bookmakers.  I have yet to see anyone who makes an effort to pay his fair share of tax being closed down by the Revenue Commissioners.  In my experience the Revenue Commissioners are sympathetic and helpful and give people time to put their affairs in order by allowing them to make payments in instalments.</P>
    <P>The provision under which local authorities will be required to notify the Department of Social Welfare that a licence has been issued marks a new departure.  Those who operate legitimate businesses in competition with the established shopkeepers have nothing to fear. Those who suggest that this provision is unfair or discriminatory must have something to hide.  Servants or agents are entitled to protection under the social welfare and employment codes.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 local authorities will be able to make by-laws.  Heretofore they issued casual trading permits.  I welcome this provision which is linked to section 8 and 9.  Those are the two provisions that have been adjudicated on most often by our courts to date.  I welcome the provision that a person aggrieved by any measures introduced by a local authority can, in the first instance, appeal them to the District Court.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the provisions under the Occasional Trading Act, 1979. <Col N="432" /> Small businesses, particularly those in towns away from the administrative centre of each county, are already under pressure because of the multinationals established in most of our major towns. The activities of traders who have successfully used the Occasional Trading Act has caused untold damage.  Before the Minister announced that he intended to make it mandatory for these people to produce a tax clearance certificate, I had intended to ask him to consider doing that.  These people hold hotel sales, invariably on a Saturday or Sunday when officials in the Department who have the authority to check on their veracity are not at work.  They are, in the main, from England and they come here and hire a hotel or hall.  One such sale in my area was, fortunately, cancelled, but other towns were badly stung when people from England came into this country selling furniture and taking deposits when they said they did not have sufficient quantity to supply the goods there and then.  However, none of the goods ordered was delivered.  The Minister for Justice took action in those cases.  It is necessary to root such people out of society because they are doing no favours to the consumer or small shops who have such large overheads.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and hope to say more on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which takes account of a changed situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past year there have been many protests about the increase in VAT to 21 per cent, particularly from the clothing and footwear industries which have been going through a very bad phase.  The competition they often have to face from casual traders is not taken into consideration. It is important to be fair to both sides because casual trading is often part of the character of a place and I have no objection to that.  I was interested to hear the last speaker refer to the fact that large containers come to Dublin city where they are met by vans which then take the goods to different parts of the country for sale.  I wonder about the <Col N="433" /> attractions of that and if a source of revenue is being missed.  Also this might constitute unfair competition.  It is desirable, therefore, that tax clearance certificates are mandatory, even for casual traders.</P>
    <P>The Bill also refers to a certain sensitivity by the Revenue Commissioners on the question of tax clearance certificates for people involved in casual trading.  Such traders, although knowledgeable about the financial side of things, are sometimes illiterate, necessitating a certain amount of sympathy and understanding on the part of the Revenue Commissioners.  Such people have come to me for advice in their dealings with the Revenue Commissioners, my experience has been that they are sympathetic and I would welcome a continuance.</P>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned the holding of sales of goods such as china, cutlery, leather or suede clothing by people travelling from one town to another. There is a certain gullibility on the part of consumers when it comes to evaluating what these people are selling.  There is a certain enthusiasm about these people and people feel they are getting a bargain although often the quality of the goods is questionable.  However, these sales can have a devastating effect on small towns because they suck a great amount of money out of the local economy.  Wherever these sales operate it is important to ensure they are legitimate and that the Revenue Commissioners are aware of what is happening.  People in legitimate trading complain vociferously to me about outside traders coming from England with large containers and taking revenue from the local economy.  The legitimate traders say they are paying rates and trying to do everything above board and that it is not fair they should have to compete against casual traders.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that casual trading means selling goods at a place, including a public road.  I assume the draftsmen were conscious of the Roads Bill which clearly defined the type of activity regarded as casual trading and which would be legitimate on public roads.  The <Col N="434" /> type of venture involving a succession of caravans setting up outside a town and creating unnecessary congestion would not be entertained.  The Roads Bill defined what was acceptable by way of casual trading and included trading of a product over a short term of which there was a tradition, for example, strawberries in Wexford or early potatoes in other locations.  It is not emphasised in this Bill and I do not think it is the intention &mdash; I would not like it to be the intention because it would contradict the principle of what we were trying to achieve in the Roads Bill &mdash; to allow casual trading at the side of a main thoroughfare involving any product.  The term &ldquo;casual trading&rdquo; needs to be properly defined and perhaps on Committee Stage we can discuss further the matter of casual trading along public roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure which provides for the devolvement of the licensing functions to local authorities because they empathise with local communities, are aware of what is happening in the area and are in a strong position to enforce the regulations.  The revenue which accrues from licence fees is not a great fee generator for local authorities.  In the past few years additional duties have been devolved to local authorities, but they have not received a corresponding increase in finance from the Department of the Environment, which normally had that responsibility.  Their enhanced role involves additional spending by the local authority which must come from their scant resources.  That has a knock-on effect because it creates pressure within the local authority in respect of funding for road maintenance and other services which the authority is expected to provide.</P>
    <P>If a local authority is operating on a low budget in terms of finance from casual trading, a mechanism should be put in place whereby the money from the imposition of fines could revert to the local authority, but I am not sure if that is feasible.  We must achieve a sense of balance in regard to the cost of trading licences; and it may be necessary to spell <Col N="435" /> out in regulations an acceptable level of fee for such licences.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned areas of casual trading which do not come under the term &ldquo;casual trading&rdquo;, and he referred specifically to cooked food.  We are all conscious of hygiene and are concerned about the operation of mobile chip vans which operate at venues attracting large crowds.  The health boards should monitor the operations of such trailers.  While the Minister stated that cooked foods are outside the scope of casual trading, the type of food those operators sell is often questionable.  On the other hand, a small bakery, for example, must comply with more rigorous regulations under the health boards.  Similar controls and regulations should apply to the operators of chip vans.  In recent times we opposed EC regulations in the area of food because we felt they were too strict.</P>
    <P>There are many travellers and traders in Limerick but they also frequent other parts of the country to sell their wares. What regulations apply in that regard?  It can cause problems for people in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill tries to achieve a balance and bring about equity and fairness in the area of casual trading and I commend it in that regard.  Section 14 provides that a local authority shall maintain a register of licences, including, as appropriate, details kept in electronic form.  I presume the term &ldquo;electronic form&rdquo; means a computer.</P>
    <P>I believe the Garda carry out their duties in regard to casual trading very sensibly and effectively.  I am sure none of us would like to see the market disappear from the landscape.  Those involved in casual trading give an area an identity, generally in a focal point in town or village. I welcome the Bill because it will mean that such trading will be carried out fairly and that competition will not be unjust or impact on people operating similar businesses at local level.  I support the Bill and look forward to dealing with amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome parts of the Bill, but have reservations about other parts of it.  I welcome the fact that the legislation is being updated and that the various functions in respect of licensing will be centralised under a single authority, namely, the local authority and that we are giving to a single body the function of regulating provisions in respect of casual trading.</P>
      <P>Casual trading in the open air along the roadside, in the marketplace or on the street is the oldest form of trading in existence.  It has a particular history, especially in Dublin.  The ancient tradition of Molly Malone is well known.  I am still trying to get her statue removed from the corner of Grafton Street to its proper place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew the Minister would agree with me.  It should be brought back to Moore Street where it belongs and where the tradition is strongest in this city.</P>
      <P>By and large traders in Dublin deal in perishable goods.  Of the 270 licences which are in existence, 170 are for trading in fruit and vegetables and jewellery.  The personnel engaged in such trading are mostly women.  It is particularly a female tradition passed from grandmother to daughter and granddaughter.  Many elderly women are involved in casual trading. The quality of these women, who are the salt of the earth and colourful both in dress and language, is what gives Dublin and Moore Street its character. Indeed they should be paid to stand out in the open air in all types of weather all year round, trading goods in a friendly manner.  Moore Street is a major tourist attraction.  It is inevitable that when tourists come here they visit that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moore Street has much potential as a tourist area in the context of our history, and ethos and it yields an economic return, any legislation we introduce should not put out of business the dealers who make Moore Street the attraction it is.  While I acknowledge the desirability <Col N="437" /> of updating the existing legislation on casual trading, I would warn that the crude implementation of this legislation could change the face of Moore Street, render illegal the operation of legal traders and bring to an end a tradition that is in the footsteps of Molly Malone.</P>
    <P>When the Casual Trading Act, 1980 was introduced it resulted in the operations of many traditional licensed traders being made illegal because they were unable to find pitches.  The local authority were charged with the responsibility of allocating the pitches in the area of Henry Street, Moore Street and Cole's Lane. Moore Street was a designated area, Henry Street ceased to be one and 13 sites were allocated in Cole's Lane &mdash; a designated area near the Ilac Centre and adjacent to Henry Street and Moore Street.  The City Centre Businessmen's Association objected to those designations, fought the matter through the courts for ten years and lost but in the process the operations of many traders were rendered illegal with some traders being sent to prison or having to pay fines.  During that time I was sent to prison for seven days following a protest so I am aware of what can happen when legislation of this kind is introduced in a crude fashion.  We must not run any such risk in this new legislation.</P>
    <P>Moore Street traders who, as I have said, are mainly elderly women, deal in perishable goods such as fruit, vegetables and fish.  Under this legislation they will become official self-employed business people.  They will have to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that their tax affairs are in order.  They will have to produce VAT returns, invoices and account for overheads.  It will be a daunting task for those elderly women who have no office premises and no business roof over their heads to put together the necessary accounting and business practices to ensure that their affairs are in order.  That is the encumbrance we would be placing on them in this legislation.  Such bureaucracy may cause those women to throw in the towel.  I do not wish to be disparaging towards them, but they are ordinary women and may not have had much <Col N="438" /> formal education.  It would be a disaster for tourism if the rich heritage of Moore Street was lost.</P>
    <P>I invited the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to meet the Moore Street traders.  He met them on Thursday last when they expressed their fears to him.  The Minister agreed to continue to consult with them.  The meeting was attended mainly by women from Moore Street &mdash; 95 per cent of the traders in Moore Street are women.  The Minister said he would seek to ensure that the legislation is implemented in a sensitive manner.</P>
    <P>Once this legislation is passed responsibility for its introduction will be passed to the local authorities.  They will now have the dual function of granting permits which will cost each trader £350 and of granting licences costing £175 which at present is the responsibility of the Department.  The traders will have to pay in excess of £500 for a permit and a licence and they will also have to pay a commercial rate to the local authorities for storage purposes.  The women in Moore Street are paying a certain amount already and have to work in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Act was not intended to deal with the people I am talking of but to deal with a plethora of activities that had proliferated throughout the country during the 1970s when goods were being sold on the roadside on the outskirts of towns, villages and cities.  It was suspected that much of the merchandise on offer such as electrical appliances, hi-fi equipment, carpets and so on, had been smuggled.  The legislation bears the hallmarks of provisions to deal with such operations.  It was intended to deal with the big operator and large penalties were provided for including £500 on summary conviction and prison sentences.  This Bill seeks to impose stiffer penalties that bear no relation to regulating a traditional trading area for the perishable goods of flowers, fish and so on which has operated in Dublin for centuries.  Consequent on the 1980 Act the local authority took on board the intent of the Bill and decided on the designations.  The business community <Col N="439" /> decided the Act was to provide for them and objected to the designations. The 1980 Act was not implemented until 1983 and since then the matter has been hauled through the Circuit Court and the appeal Court.  It was not until 1993 that the business community finally accepted Cole's Lane as a designated area.  During that time the 13 women who had pitches on Cole's Lane were penalised, declared criminals, subjected to fines and imprisonment.  Their perishable goods and prams were taken to Store Street Garda Station.  Those traders who were operating legally up to 1983 were once again operating legally in 1993. That was a disgraceful episode resulting from the introduction of legislation intended to update the then legislation which was focused on the business community and did not cater for the needs of those traditional traders in perishable goods.  The result was chaos.</P>
    <P>People pay approximately £500 for licences and permits and commercial rates apply for storage facilities.  Stalls and materials have to be stored close to the Ilac Centre.  Those charges are paid to the local authority.  There are costs involved in transporting goods to and from the market.  If perishable goods are not sold during the day they may be useless the following day.  Those are the difficulties being experienced.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the procedure is being streamlined.  Powers are being given to local authorities and traders will be obliged to sign an official register.  A tax clearance certificate is also being introduced. I welcome the Minister's remarks that there will be no witch-hunt in terms of arrears.  Tax problems will be sorted out in a sensitive fashion and people will not be prevented from getting a licence due to examinations of previous activities. Questions arise as to how tax clearance certificates will be obtained and how the matter will be dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners.  Will people have to get professional advice on the matter? A brochure should be issued explaining the new procedures and how people can operate without incurring great expense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> Under the Bill the licensee's name will be forwarded to the Department of Social Welfare.  I am concerned about this.  I know of a woman who will continue to work after retirement age and while such people would not have applied for social welfare in the course of their working lives when they reach 66 years of age they believe they are entitled to the old age pension regardless of whether they remain working.  I would not like to see women put out of Moore Street as a result of this provision.  A similar question arises in the case of widow's pensions. These issues should be considered.  We do not want people to believe we are trying to get at them because they are acting illegally, which is not the case.</P>
    <P>For the first time many people will have to deal with invoices and VAT and will have to keep accounts, matters about which they have no experience.  In many cases they will not have to pay tax because, certainly in Moore Street, many of these people are not making much profit.  By introducing this provision we may cause unnecessary concern.  These issues should be considered and an explanatory brochure issued to all casual traders.</P>
    <P>Another major area of trading in my constituency is The Hill, North Cumberland Street, where there are 43 sites. The majority of trading in the city takes place there and in Moore Street.  Much development has taken place under the designated areas scheme and incentives are given for apartment developments. As a result this area is now surrounded by new apartment blocks.  I am concerned that with their new powers, local authorities will get rid of existing trading sites. There is provision for alternative proposals, but that may involve a different area.  I am concerned that the tradition that has existed for centuries in this area will be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  It is time one authority was given responsibility for this matter.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment should ensure, before full responsibility is handed over to local authorities, that the legislation <Col N="441" /> will be implemented sensitively in terms of existing sites.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I welcome this Bill which will be of assistance to local authorities.  Under the Abattoirs Act, passed some years ago, local authorities were obliged to appoint a veterinary inspector.  On many occasions I asked the Minister when regulations would be introduced to allow local authorities to charge fees to recoup the cost of this service, but they still have not been introduced.  To add insult to injury we discovered at our last county council meeting that the sheep dipping service, the only source of veterinary charges on farmers, had been dispensed with.  The Government decided to abandon the concept of sheep dipping, and consider it no longer necessary.  The sheep industry is very important, although the Minister may be thinking only of sheep dipping committees, which is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Sheep dipping is a very important aspect of sheep farming.  Not alone are there no regulations allowing local authorities to charge for veterinary services under the Abattoirs Act, but they no longer receive income for sheep dipping.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Department would hand over responsibility to local authorities if there was a great deal of money involved.  I am concerned that the charges imposed by local authorities will not meet the costs incurred.  Generally Departments hand over liabilities, but where there is money involved they retain responsibility.  I hope this Bill will not be implemented in the same way as the Abattoirs Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will be of help to local authorities in dealing with people, who are not the traditional travelling type, but who arrive in Hiace vans and sell gates etc. at cross-roads or in fields and refuse to move or co-operate.  Local authorities have incurred major costs in bringing <Col N="442" /> such cases to court.  Because the process is so long people on whose land these traders are trespassing feel the local authority is doing nothing to help them. However, it should be remembered that when the county manager goes to court he has to follow all the slow procedures involved.  By the time the case is heard much havoc will have been caused in the locality.  Sometimes these traders move on when they hear the case is due to be heard in court but sometimes they do not.  Under this Bill these traders will no longer be able to thumb their noses, so to speak, at the local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that casual trading does not include &ldquo;selling to a person at, or at a place adjacent to, the place where he resides or carries on business.&rdquo;  Will the Minister say if a shopkeeper will still be able to display his goods on the street, which is adjacent to his premises, without a casual trading licence?  What is meant by &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo;?  Deputy Quill brought us on a wonderful trip through Cork today and gave us a history of wine and cheese. Many people in Carlow sell strawberries on the roadside.  This is a lovely sight&mdash; it means summer is here and there has been some sunshine.  Under the Bill only farmers who can sell adjacent to the place where they live can sell their produce. Farmers who live on a byroad would have to sell their strawberries on a main road. If the word &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; is deemed to mean within ten yards of a premises, these farmers will not be able to sell their produce.  I do not know if it is wise to insist that everyone has to get a casual trading licence.  A farmer who sells strawberries should get a casual trading licence, but will he be entitled to sell his produce on the roadside under this Bill? Under the Roads Act national primary roads have to be kept clear of all obstacles, which is important.  This Bill could have an adverse effect on what is regarded as normal in rural areas, for example, selling strawberries on the roadside.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that an application for a casual trading licence must be made to the local authority not less than 30 days before the first day on which it is <Col N="443" /> intended to engage in casual trading.  A person may require a licence within ten days.  Under the Bill people who sell sweets and chocolate at public events such as sports meetings and concerts, those who sell ice-cream, newspapers and religious objects and fishermen who sell their catches will require casual trading licences.  I regard the sale of fish by fishermen as part of the tradition of seaside areas.  Further consideration needs to be given to the 30-day period as some people may require a licence sooner than that. Will the local authority have the power to change this requirement?</P>
    <P>I presume casual trading includes the selling of chips from vans.  The vast majority of people, especially those who have just left the local pub and worked up an appetite, welcome these vans but other people regard them as a nuisance. They should have to cease operating at certain times at night.  I know old people who do not go to bed until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. because they will not be able to sleep because of the noise caused by people around the chip van outside their house. Consideration should be given in the Bill to the operating hours of these vans.  It is grossly unfair that people who want to go to bed at a normal hour cannot do so because they know they will be wakened later by noise.  I have failed in the past to get a satisfactory reply to this issue and I hope progress can be made in this regard under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Most towns have an area designated for casual trading.  While it was difficult initially to get casual traders to move to the designated area in Carlow town, it has now been accepted.  Will the Minister say if a businessman will be able to let members of the public use his yard without any charge to set up in opposition to those who are using the local authority designated site?  I am not sure from my reading of the Bill if they will be able to do this but it seems it is possible.  We will have been very careless if under this Bill a person can open a private site across the road from a local authority designated site.  Though the cost of the <Col N="444" /> licence may be small, the cost of running the site may be very expensive.</P>
    <P>One could talk about the relaxed way of life in rural Ireland, but it must be accepted that the law in this area needs to be tightened.  I welcome the Bill in general and hope the Minister will respond to my questions in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill.  The difficulties caused by casual trading in large new satellite towns have been a source of major concern.  This Bill recognises the defects in the 1980 Act following the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission which identified a development in illegal trading that needed to be addressed.  The Bill also recognises the experiences gained since 1980 and attempts to introduce more equity to the whole sector of casual trading which is very much an integral part of normal trading activities.</P>
      <P>In the implementation of the new Act it is not the Minister's intention to excessively penalise people such as the Moore Street traders, to whom Deputy Costello referred, or the sellers of strawberries on the side of the road mentioned by Deputy Browne.  We need to strike that balance and address the profitable activities of traders who are not paying their fair share and who do not operate on a proper licensed basis.  I hope the Act will address a number of those anomalies that have become all too apparent in various parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licensing arrangement under section 4 is a reasonable method of control at national and local level.  It will be effective and local small traders will find their local authorities more understanding of their trading activities.  The local authorities in my constituency do not appear to have implemented the 1980 Act in full.  They need to tackle the problem of illegal trading on the outskirts of the large new housing estates, which is addressed in detail in this new Bill and which I welcome.  It is not the intention to involve the small trader, to whom I referred earlier, in the need for proper regulation.  However, when one compares the activities of the corner shop <Col N="445" /> owner, the small trader, the small electrical shop owner or the small furnishing operation with the illegal sale of electrical goods, furnishings, carpets or, as referred to earlier by Deputy Hughes, the booking of large hotel rooms on a Sunday to sell goods when enforcement officers are not as vigilant as they might be, it is clear that substantial profits are made with no contribution to the Exchequer, thereby creating a most unfair trading practice. Many of us have had representations based on the ever increasing commercial rate, and this Bill will ensure that the balance is redressed.</P>
    <P>Section 7 concerns the issue of by-laws and is an effective and pragmatic way of dealing with the whole area of casual trading.  The new powers proposed in section 13 are desirable.  As recommended by the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána, a superintendent can make an instant and realistic decision if someone is substantially abusing the normal casual trading practice.  I am referring to people selling vans or other expensive products.</P>
    <P>A practice prevalent in my constituency is trading in car components.  It is generally accepted that a high degree of car stealing is related to this particular trading activity.  When car components are sought by various members of the settled community, the component not in stock in what are effectively mini-breakers' yards on the side of the road, may be available within a matter of days because the particular car will be stolen and dismantled.  A number of these illegal, unsightly trading activities take place in Dublin west in relation to the car industry and it is most unsatisfactory.  I am glad that under section 13 the appropriate powers will be vested in the superintendent who can make an on the spot judgment and seize goods or vehicles that he perceives contravene the intent in the Act and its various sections.</P>
    <P>The level of fines was referred to by Deputy Costello.  While many of the small traders with a traditional background will be concerned about the severity of fines, they are not intended to be directed at them.  On Committee Stage I <Col N="446" /> hope the Minister will accept amendments which will try to distinguish between the genuine small trader, such as those in Moore Street or the people who sell strawberries on the side of the road in Wexford.  They should not have to bear the brunt of the penalties under section 15.  Perhaps the scale of fines should be related to the estimated value of the goods or some other acceptable working mechanism that would introduce equity to the area of illegal trading.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals to streamline the workings of the courts in dealing with this whole area.  The Garda Síochána experienced difficulties in processing various cases against those committing offences.  A reasonable balance is being struck and the streamlining of the workings of the courts is desirable.</P>
    <P>As the Minister outlined, the Occasional Trading Act, 1979, must be an integral part of this Bill in that the various sections and regulations and workings of the two Bills will be merged. It will, I hope, exclude the possibility of a test case in the courts which would have a negative effect on the intent of the Bill which, I hope will pass speedily through the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction. I hope the new local authorities in County Dublin will tackle the problems in the area of casual trading.  It has been a source of difficulty for them but they have not effectively tackled the issue.  There has been a whole plethora of excuses and deferrals of decision making and the local authorities will have a greater commitment to tackling unacceptable trading activities.  This Bill will also go a long way to address the stolen goods dimension of casual trading.  That is an important provision.  The casual trading of goods by a small minority has dragged the overall aspect of casual trading into disrepute, which is most unacceptable and unfair to those genuine casual traders.  A form of limited regulation at national and local level is desirable because of the inherent mobility of casual trading.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will have a speedy passage. I have no doubt that if it requires fine tuning and amendments on Committee <Col N="447" /> Stage the Minister will be receptive. Deputy Browne mentioned the sale of fish, which would be regarded as a profitable traditional activity.  Those who engage in this practice should make their fair contribution because a fishmonger with a shop, having made considerable investment in refrigerated storage, incurs much greater overheads.</P>
    <P>The casual trading in fish at our fishing ports is desirable and should be allowed to continue, but we must ensure that fishmongers are placed on an equal footing. Those who engage in this type of casual trading should be brought within the system and make their fair contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill whose primary purpose is to achieve greater decentralisation and efficiency in casual trading and ensure a more flexible approach in regard to regulations.  It is intended to devolve the licensing function from the Minister to local authorities and to provide for the use of by-laws as the means of regulating and controlling casual trading.  Another of its purposes is to limit the catalogue of casual trading activities and effect general improvements in enforcement of the relevant regulations.  Those are the main characteristics of the Bill, some of which I should like to deal with in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The devolution of functions to local authorities will afford them greater powers in regulating activities that take place within their jurisdictions.  We all believe in affording local authorities greater control over their local affairs, especially within the three new Dublin local authorities where there is a more positive attitude to local government, a great feeling of expectation on the part of the general public.  Much attention could be focused on the needs of those three new local authorities.  Local authorities constantly engage in the supervision and resolution of difficulties experienced by certain sectors of the community who engage in casual trading. They have greatest knowledge of who is <Col N="448" /> doing what and the best manner in which to deal with it.</P>
    <P>In south-west Dublin there is an enormous problem associated with casual trading engaged in by the travelling community. This causes great difficulty, particularly when local communities are requested to assist in their resettlement. The casual trading aspect of their activities tends to cause friction.  It would be most beneficial if local authorities could segregate large casual traders into separate areas where they could be more effectively controlled, thereby preserving the good will of the settled community to travelling families.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which local authorities could devote greater attention is the dangerous points at which casual trading takes place.  It is absurd to see people engaged in casual trading causing great danger to the motoring public and, sometimes, to pedestrians.  This practice tends to be more prevalent on primary roads when, without warning one comes on a casual trading point.  If large numbers of people become involved it can cause major traffic problems.  Knowledge of such casual trading points would be immediately available to the relevant local authorities who could take immediate action.  The location of casual trading points should be considered very carefully when the by-laws are being drawn up.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I want to draw attention is the devolution of functions to local authorities in regard to the ever proliferating caravans in urban areas from which people sell food in very unhygienic surroundings.  These vans give no appearance whatsoever of having running water or any means of ensuring that the food they sell, the type of cooking utensils they use, or the practices in which they engage while distributing such food comply with current standards of health and hygiene.</P>
    <P>The litter spread in local authority areas resulting from casual trading is of the most offensive kind.  One can see large areas strewn with rotten food, litter and various waste material for the relevant local authority to gather.  A person <Col N="449" /> has made his profit, pocketed the loot and walked away, leaving the local authority to tidy up the mess.  No doubt local authorities could devise some means of recouping expenditure for the work of cleaning up after casual trading.</P>
    <P>In the drawing up of by-laws, the first task is the definition of areas of casual trading.  We must be sensitive to traditional areas for casual trading.  We must not create new areas without providing back-up support, enabling casual trading points to be serviced by the local authorities with regard to general hygiene, control and safety.  The by-laws should ensure immediate control of the cleaning up aspect, stipulating that the onus will be on casual traders to ensure that no expenditure is incurred by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Vehicles must be considered in the by-laws. For example, there could be a van towed by a lorry, or a van towed by a van, when the absurd circumstance could arise that the vehicle without any engine would be the one from which casual trading took place.  However, the vehicle with the engine could be used also for the purposes of casual trading.  Each could be detached from the other, making two separate selling outlets.  It is essential to deter some clever, ingenious people from getting around the regulations.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to newspaper selling.  Will the Minister define casual trading in order to enable local authorities understand precisely the scheduled list of activities.  For example, is the selling of newspapers at a corner or a pitch, as it is often called &mdash; regarded as casual trading.  Can one be a casual trader on the move or a casual trader in a particular area.  There are many examples of street trading outside shops. In the Liberties and in Moore Street in Dublin, casual trading activities take place on the street adjacent to normal retail outlets.  On occasions legitimate retail outlets may be put in serious danger if the by-laws do not take into account the relationship between casual trading and the normal retail outlets.</P>
    <P>How do we complement services such as the control and the quality of food sold <Col N="450" /> in public places?  How can we tie in those regulations with the provisions of the Bill?  How will we enforce consumers rights when a person purchases goods from a casual trading point?  How can we ascertain from whom the article was purchased?  What are the conditions of sale and what rights do people have when some of the purchases are not in accordance with the normal rules governing the sale of goods?  Has the Director of Consumer Affairs the same control over goods sold by casual traders?  Has the consumer the same rights as in the case of goods sold in normal retail outlets?</P>
    <P>Can we be assured that all the goods sold by casual traders will have safety warnings visibly displayed?  Who will deal with the safety aspects of such goods? Trading in scrap cars is disruptive when it takes place in urban areas especially when many such cars suddenly appear in a type of breakers' yard.  Many people queue outside such premises seeking spare parts.  How can we deal with the difficulties that arise from that type of trading?</P>
    <P>The issue of waste disposal must be dealt with in regard to casual trading. Will those who knock on doors and offer to dispose of waste be considered casual traders?  The Bill may not be too specific but it should allow local authorities sufficient flexibility to deal with those borderline cases.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of traffic jams which arise as a result of casual trading.  Garda must be consulted in the preparation of by-laws to give advice regarding the control of casual trading. One could spend hours in a traffic jam in small provincial towns caused by casual traders.  Is it legitimate that national primary or secondary roads should be blocked simply because of casual trading? If a group was protesting the matter would be dealt with differently or if somebody simply blocked the road the law could be enforced in a more effective way.  Controls must be considered.</P>
    <P>The selling of strawberries is a traditional and welcome sight on the roadways in summer.  However areas in Wexford and in County Dublin are totally <Col N="451" /> unsuitable for the sale of potatoes particularly when five or six cars suddenly come to a halt where one least expects them.  The Garda, and local authorities should be given flexibility to deal with these occurrences.  I presume that the selling of vegetables from door to door will be considered as casual trading.  Will self employed breadmen who sell from door to door be classified as casual traders? If so, do we need to take them into account in the legislation?</P>
    <P>A traditional and welcome sight in fishing towns and villages is the selling of fish on the quays from the boats by fishermen.  Must we control and define where the selling of fish should take place?  On occasions casual traders sell fish which has been bought on the market in Dublin.  Should we encourage the sale of fish near the point where it is caught?</P>
    <P>We have to consider whether the selling of team colours in O'Connell Street and in the vicinity of sporting events is casual trading, even though they may be rare occurrences.  The sale of goods at religious shrines will have to be considered. It is worth making a number of points on fees for trading licences.  We should regulate the fees so that they reflect the turnover of the person using the licence.  It is essential that there should be some evidence of compliance with tax regulations.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a licence or permit be displayed, as in the case of a taxi driver.  A plaque showing the name, photograph, registration number and essential details as to how one could follow up an inquiry should be visible to the public when trading is taking place.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 a local authority may make by-laws to control, regulate, supervise and administer casual trading, designate areas where activity may take place, regulate access, fixing of fees, and the enforcement and procedures.  Attention should be paid to the question of enforcement.  When a local authority creates a by-law I hope it will bear in mind the question of enforcement.  We are all aware that unless there are <Col N="452" /> adequate enforcement measures all the intentions of the Bill will come to nought.</P>
    <P>Registration of traders is essential so that we will not have a proliferation of various types of casual trading.  We should strike a balance between the nature and type of activities.  Perhaps we should limit the amount of activity in a defined area to a certain number of traders. If the numbers are controlled there will be fair as well as casual trading. Licence fees should be related to the size of the enterprise and likewise with fines. There is no point in levying fines which are beyond the capability of the trader to bear.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately a minority of people brought discredit to casual trading but the majority of those engaged in casual trading are reasonable people.  We must focus attention on the areas which this minority bring into disrepute.  Through the implementation of the provisions of this Bill, and with the assistance of local authorities, a type of trading will be established that will give nothing but a good service to the people.  The type of casual trading we see in nostalgic films and on television will die out completely if we deal with it too harshly.  We are striking a balance by maintaining what is good and dealing with that which is not acceptable.  I welcome the Bill and assure the Minister of my support for most of its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but would like the Minister to assure me that local authorities will not go overboard in implementing the finer points of law in its provisions.  There is need to regulate casual trading which is as old as tea and is part of our heritage.  As a small boy going to school in the village of Goleen I remember an old man with a pony and cart being at the fair once a month with a few boxes of fish which he sold.  He provided a service to local farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then casual trading has blossomed into big business.  The pony and cart has been replaced by Hiace vans and everything from a needle to an anchor is sold.  Local traders are affected and resent casual traders whose business <Col N="453" /> sometimes is allowed to get out of hand. Small shopkeepers are paying rates and if they only put in a new door or window in their premises they are saddled with an exorbitant valuation.  This makes it impossible for some of them to carry on their business.  That, coupled with an influx of casual traders, has a detrimental effect on the business life of rural areas.</P>
    <P>By all means we should preserve the status quo as far as casual trading is concerned. I was disappointed to note that the Minister proposes to remove the sale of agricultural and horticultural produce by the producer from the list of exempted activities.  I fail to see what damage a farmer could do by selling his produce to the public.  He should be exempted.  It is a well known fact that he gives a service to the community which the people want. When people visit tourist resorts in the summer they are cute enough to know where farm produce is on sale.  They are anxious to buy fresh vegetables, free range eggs and so on.</P>
    <P>Also removed from the list are the sale of sweets, chocolates, etc. at public events such as sporting events and concerts. We cannot all attend football or hurling matches in Croke Park much as we would like to.  Usually one can buy sweets, oranges, applies and soft drinks inside the sports grounds and replenish one's stocks at half time.  I invite the Minister down to my neck of the woods in south-west Cork &mdash; in the Mizen Head, Beara and the Kilcrohane Peninsula, where he can attend a football match &mdash; we do not play hurling in my part of the county &mdash; go horse racing or attend a bowls competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>He would see how life goes on in rural Ireland.  Part and parcel of any family Sunday outing is to buy sweets, crisps or soft drinks from the traders.  The traders are willing to come with their trailers to all the local weekly events and they provide a very badly needed service in remote rural areas.  Will the Minister reconsider this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how many Members <Col N="454" /> have the opportunity to attend a mission. I invite the Minister to a mission in my parish of Goleen, it will start on 19 March 1994.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disadvantaged area, unfortunately, and we are still trying to eke out an existence.  I see nothing wrong with erecting a stall outside the church which sells religious objects to the general public.  There is no shop within 25 miles catering for goods of this type.  Naturally the mission only comes to the parish once every five or ten years and they are not as frequent as when I was a boy, yet they are part of our heritage.  Will the Minister continue to allow the sale of pious religious objects from stalls outside a church during the mission as usual?</P>
      <P>There is no more popular sight than a deep sea angling boat landing its catch on the quay.  Visitors like to go to the quay side to buy the lovely fresh fish.  I detest the attitude of Members who are trying to stifle the sale of fresh commodities. According to the law there is nothing wrong with sending this fresh fish to the market in Dublin or Cork or to the auction halls in Castletownbere or Union Hall.  Castletownbere is 50 miles from some of the little fishing ports in west Cork and Union Hall is up to 40 miles away.  These part-time fishermen have very little to live on as theirs is a seasonal activity during the months of June, July, August and perhaps September.  There is nothing nicer than to buy a fresh lobster or cray fish from the fisherman who has just come in from the lobster pots.

He would then take a different view about exempting the sale of fish by the crew who catch it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Section 13 of the Act of 1980 is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (2) of the following subsections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(2A)  Where the Court is satisfied that a tenancy has been determined wholly or substantially for the purpose of avoiding the entitlement of a tenant to relief under the provisions of this Act by virtue of the provisions of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section, the tenement <Col N="456" /> in question shall be deemed to be a tenement to which this Part applies, notwithstanding that it was not in the occupation of the tenant thereof, or his predecessors in title, during the whole of the period of twenty years provided for in that paragraph.</P>
    <P>(2B)  It shall be presumed unless the contrary is shown by the landlord that a tenancy has been determined for the purpose mentioned in subsection (2A).&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to deal with the situation which has arisen in relation to residential tenancies. Because tenants are entitled to a 35 year lease if they have been in occupation for 20 years landlords have resorted to the tactic of terminating the tenancy in the eighteenth or nineteenth year with a view to avoiding this entitlement.  What is supposed to provide non-disturbance protection for long standing tenants has become the reason tenants are disturbed after 18 or 19 years.  I am speaking about residents in places such as the Mespil Estate in my constituency which was purpose built.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the landlord &mdash; I will deal with their interests which I regard as significant and worthy of protection in a later amendment &mdash; it would be madness not to evict tenants in the nineteenth year if he wants to retain a monthly or yearly time-frame for the tenancies. If he attempts to recover possession for any reason after a period of 20 years the tenant is automatically entitled to a 35 year lease under existing law.  As a consequence the landlord's investment becomes far less valuable immediately as it would be unsaleable with a sitting tenant even though provision is made under the law for a rent review every five years.</P>
    <P>Apart from large institutions, rational landlords pursue a policy of evicting tenants in the nineteenth year of the tenancy to avoid the existing protective mechanisms. To protect the value of their investment landlords prevent tenants on a systematic basis from enjoying the protection <Col N="457" /> available to long standing tenants under the law.  A landlord who behaves rationally would be foolish or improvident to allow a tenant to remain for more than 20 years having regard to the effect this would have on the value of his investment. Few landlords would not seek to protect their freedom of action by shifting tenants from one flat to another to avoid the legal protection available for long-standing tenants.</P>
    <P>It is most unjust that a tenant or family is evicted from a flat or house after 19 years.  A solicitor probably has to advise the landlord to get rid of the tenants because they have been there far too long, if they remain for a further year the capital value of the property and his freedom of action will be significantly impaired.</P>
    <P>We could say we should move the goal posts and reduce the figure to either 15 or ten years and give people the right to 35 year leases after a shorter period of occupation.  One of the difficulties &mdash; the Minister of State pointed this out &mdash; is that if we move the goal posts instead of evictions taking place in the nineteenth year of the tenancy to avoid the protective mechanism they would take place in either the ninth or fourteenth year.  A simplistic solution that people should be entitled to protection after 15 years will not do because over a period of time landlords would apply the same criteria and respond with a pre-emptive move. The solution of changing the period of qualification is not on.</P>
    <P>We could deal with the matter on a principled basis which is mirrored in other statutes.  As a result of recent amendments to the law relating to unfair dismissals, if one party uses fixed term contracts for the express purpose of avoiding the provisons of the Unfair Dismissals Act the tribunal can disregard the fixed term contract where it is satisfied that the chief purpose or motive was to avoid the statutory protection available. That is the principle behind this amendment.</P>
    <P>Where a tenant has been in occupation of a flat for a period of time and where the landlord has no real reason to get <Col N="458" /> rid of him except to avoid the statutory protection, the tenant could appeal to the court to disregard the fact that a period of 19 rather than 20 years has elapsed. The best method is to have a deeming provision under which a landlord would have an obligation to show to the court, if seeking possession and resisting a new lease, that the dominant purpose in terminating the tenancy was other than the avoidance of giving the tenant a statutory entitlement.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is accepted a landlord would have to tell the court the reason he is evicting Mrs. Smith in the seventeenth, eighteenth or nineteenth year of the tenancy and if there is no plausible explanation the court would presume that he is trying to deny her statutory protection.  In those circumstances a landlord would not terminate a tenancy if he knew he was not in a position to protect tenants who had been in occupation for a long period.  It does not unduly attack the landlord's freedom of action and any landlord who can point to any other reason that motivates the termination of a tenancy can do it.  He will be able to say to the court that the reason for terminating a particular tenancy is that he requires the flat for refurbishing or that he is changing the whole nature of the place, that the dominant motive is other than that if the tenant is left there he or she will be entitled to a 35-year lease.</P>
    <P>I concede that the 35 year lease entitlement given to long-standing tenants is wrong.  Most people in a rented house or flat do not want a 35 year lease but they want to be protected from eviction except for a good reason.  In many of these cases one is dealing with elderly people, or people going into the second half of their lives.  Such people do not want a 35 year lease that they can hand on to their children or that binds them to a long period in occupation.  As the law stands they are entitled to opt for any lesser period.  In particular the landlord does not want a 35 year lease foisted on him as the alternative to leaving somebody alone and increasing the rent on a commercial, open market basis from time to time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> When this matter arose before the select committee the Minister indicated that a working party was due to report on this issue and that he could not indicate whether it would report before the Report Stage of this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister may now be in a position to enlighten me about whether the working party has reported and come up with a solution.  It may be that the working party has even arrived at the view that what I am proposing is the only remedy, in which case I would be glad to hear it. I emphasise that this is not simply an academic, lawyer's point.  People in my constituency are being evicted all the time because to leave them where they are for more than 19 years deprives the landlord of freedom of action later; therefore a protection on paper has turned into a nightmare for long-standing tenants.  The protection has turned into a motive for unjust treatment at the hands of otherwise decent landlords who are anxious to protect the value of their investments.  It is a device which causes injustice to people precisely because they have been in the same home for a long time.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the point because I made many of these points on Committee Stage.  Neither do I want to be unduly rhetorical.  However, one cannot turn a blind eye to the injustice that is happening every day under the present law.  There are many people, typically widows in their 70s and 80s, people of limited means, who cannot afford the expense of relocation, who cannot afford to gather up their possessions and go house-hunting at that time of their lives. Even if they could financially afford to relocate, because of their age and vulnerability and their long-standing establishment in one part of a city &mdash; and this is not confined to Dublin &mdash; it is deeply offensive that they should be flung out of their homes at that time of their lives precisely because if they stay any longer they might get the protection which they so richly deserve in any event, the right to live out their lives in the house for which they are paying a fair rent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> I am not unduly tugging at anyone's heartstrings when I say this is a vitally urgent amendment to the law and cannot be put on the long finger.  I accept the situation is complex and that every proposal requires careful study, but unless the goalposts are moved there is no other approach to this problem except the one I am suggesting, to give the court the right to disregard the non-completion of the statutory minimum period where the court takes the view that the dominant motive is to avoid the statutory protection on the part of the landord. Because of my interest in the Mespil estate people write to tell me they are being booted out because they will be in occupation for 20 years if they stay.  Some of them have written about their plight in the newspapers.  There are pensioners well into their retirement who are being flung out in circumstances of huge injustice.</P>
    <P>Unless it is willing to do something about what appears to be a protection but is a massive invasion of those people's privacy this Government, which claims that it is of a centre left persuasion, deserves to be condemned.  I will leave it at that and await the response of the Minister of State, but on this issue I am adamant that there must be action.  I must at least have a guarantee of action.  I must see what the substance of that action will be and will not accept the proposition that a working party is considering the problem.  The working party may continue to consider the problem, but people are being flung out of their homes to avoid the 20-year rule under the 1980 Act.  The time has come for the Government to put up, by coming up with a solution to the problem, or shut up as a Government that pretends to show any social concern for the people who are affected by a barbaric practice brought about by an extremely defective law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell, this problem is not confined to Dublin.  I explained at the select committee that the Government would not be in a position to accept amendments to the Bill dealing with residential tenancies <Col N="461" /> until it had received a report from a working party which was established to look at this matter.  Although I had hoped that the group's report would be available before we took Report Stage of the Bill, regrettably, this has not proved possible. This arises because of the complexities and the group's desire to have extensive consultations with interested groups before reaching their conclusions.  This process of consultation is under way and a measure of its wide-ranging nature can be seen from the fact that members of the working group will meet representatives of the tenants' association in Mespil estate.  If Deputy McDowell wishes to know when that meeting is taking place I will be happy to inform him.</P>
      <P>The group is aware of the urgency with which both I and the Minister for Justice regard their work.  From discussions which I had as recently as yesterday with the chairman of the group I am satisfied that its report will be available in sufficient time to allow any legislative changes which it might recommend and which prove acceptable to the Government to be brought before this House before the summer recess.  I share the concern of all Members of the House about the plight of some long term tenants.  I assure the House that the Government will have no hesitation in accepting any workable proposals that emerge.</P>
      <P>It is possible that what Deputy McDowell proposes today is the ultimate solution.  Nevertheless, there are difficulties in what he proposes.  His proposal is a variation of an amendment discussed on Committee Stage and which contained a presumption that a tenancy had been determined for the purpose of avoiding a provision of the 1980 Act where a person had been in continuous occupation for seven years.  A number of Deputies pointed out on Committee Stage that the practical effect of that amendment would be to jeopardise the position of tenants approaching seven years' occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seven year provision has been dropped in the amendment before the House today.  Instead, it is proposed that <Col N="462" /> such a presumption will apply in all cases where a tenancy is ended, irrespective of the length of time the tenant was in occupation.  For example, it would apply if the tenant was in occupation for only one month.  That is somewhat unrealistic and ignores the fact that there must be a balance between the rights of the landlord and the rights of the tenant.  It is not just a matter of equity.  In changing the law in this area we must have regard to the likely impact on the willingness of people to make property available in the private rented sector.  In that context it is fair to suggest that to make the provisions of the 1980 Act an issue from the first day of a tenancy would be unlikely to encourage people to enter that sector.</P>
    <P>I also have doubts about whether the courts would ultimately regard it as open to the Legislature to impose such a sweeping constraint on existing tenancies. The Government is not prepared to make changes in the law in this area until it receives the report of the working group.  I spoke to the chairman of that working group yesterday and emphasised the urgency of this matter.  He assured me that his proposals, on which we will be taking legislative action if they are acceptable to the Government, will be available in time to enable the Government to introduce legislation before the summer recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this matter at great length on Committee Stage and there was general agreement on all sides that this issue needs to be addressed. Deputies McDowell and Fitzgerald highlighted the problem of the Mespil Flats and expressed concern that there should not be a repetition of that.  The problem which arose in regard to those flats emphasises the need for action.  The Minister outlined the difficulties which I see with Deputy McDowell's amendment and I will not delay the time of the House by repeating what was said on Committee Stage.  There might be a constitutional difficulty in regard to this amendment.  I take the point that if a person commences a tenancy which runs for only one or two years and the landlord seeks to terminate <Col N="463" /> it before it expires, it would be presumed that he or she was doing so to avoid the provisions of the legislation.  We must strike a balance between the private property rights of landlords and the rights of tenants and provide proper protection for tenants without adversely affecting the market and reducing the number of properties available for rent.  On Committee Stage we dealt with some of the difficulties with Deputy McDowell's previous amendment, but this amendment could complicate matters even further.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister was hopeful that the working group considering the matter would report in time for us to deal with an amendment on Report Stage and it is not the Minister's fault that it has not reported.  Because of the complexity of residential tenancy and the need to ensure that we strike a balance between the rights of tenants and the rights of property owners, this matter needs to be carefully teased out.  It is not sufficient to deal with it here on Report Stage.  I share the view of other Deputies that the law is very much against the tenant and creates substantial problems for the residential tenant, whether in an apartment or in a house.</P>
      <P>I hope the report the Minister promised will be published as soon as possible so that we might have an opportunity before the end of the year to address this matter in a comprehensive manner in separate legislation.  Because of the complexities of this area and the difficulties associated with it, I did not include it in my Private Member's Bill.  I confined the provisions of that Bill to business tenancies because that area has its own difficulties and complexities, but they are somewhat less complex than those in the residential property area.  Residential tenancy should be dealt with separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell was correct in tabling this amendment because it gives us an opportunity to highlight certain problems.  Because of the manner in which the amendment is framed I cannot support it.  Perhaps the Minister will be back in the House before the end of the year to address this matter fully.  The <Col N="464" /> amendments tabled to this Bill have given rise to a number of suggestions about how we should deal with the problem. To an extent we teased out the inadequacies of the amendments rather than addressing the solution.  I hope the committee examining the matter will find a solution at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the matter being dealt with before the end of the year.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, stated that he hopes to introduce a Bill in this House before the summer recess; let us not have any more slippage in that regard.  I noted what the Minister and Deputy Shatter said about the rights of landlords.  There is a reason for every claim for possession. A landlord does not get up in the morning and decide to evict some tenants.  There is a reason for every notice to quit.  If a landlord serves a notice to quit on a tenant after one month or year the court will want to know the reason.  The presumption that the landlord is evicting the tenant to avoid a situation which might arise 19 years later will mean very little to the court.  If a landlord tells the court that he or she is evicting tenants because they are a nuisance or for some other reason, the court will not say that he or she is evicting them after six months because in 19 years time they might have rights.  The courts are not irrational.  Even though a presumption might exist, a court confronted with a landlord evicting a tenant after six months, unless it is a completely arbitrary termination of the tenancy for which the landlord cannot advance any reason, would find that the presumption was easily rebutted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deleting the seven year qualification period for the presumption in my Committee Stage amendment, it struck me that the presumption would become more and more difficult to rebut as the protection period threshold came into view.  That was the thinking behind this amendment.  A presumption of this kind will not produce the ridiculous consequences the Minister suggests.  If a landlord evicts a tenant after six months and has a plausible reason for doing so, <Col N="465" /> a court will not hold that the real reason is that in 19 years' time the tenant would have statutory rights.  I say that in defence of the formulation of my amendment. I accept the criticisms advanced by the Minister on Committee Stage in relation to the seven year period but we need a presumption which, effectively, gathers strength and becomes more difficult to rebut as time passes, especially in the nineteenth year of a tenancy.  In those circumstances a court would be vigilant to ensure that there was a good reason to rebut the presumption in this Bill.  In the case of an early termination of a tenancy a court will not disregard the offered explanation and hold as a matter of fact that the landlord is trying to avoid something that might happen in 19 years' time.</P>
    <P>No court would act in that way.  We must presume that the courts act reasonably and, for the same reason, it will not give rise to a constitutional problem.  If a landlord has a reason for terminating a tenancy, apart from arbitrarily throwing a dice and deciding to evict say tenants A and B from flats 27 and 33, he or she can establish that reason to the satisfaction of the court and, at an early stage in the tenancy, the court will rule that the reason given must be the reason because the landlord is not concerned about what will happen in 17 years' time and it is stupid to suggest that is the landlord's motive.</P>
    <P>Likewise in the nineteenth year the reason would have to be a cogent one because the courts will see what is happening and will consider carefully some proffered excuse if in that year of the tenancy a landlord suddenly becomes concerned about redecorating the flat and so on.</P>
    <P>I thought through the arguments Deputy Shatter raised about its reasonableness and commercial viability and practicability as a formula.  For the benefit of the working party with whom the Minister of State is dealing I wish to say I agree with the Minister that the proposed threshold of seven years in the earlier amendment was prone to constituting a different set of goalposts and a rolling and gathering strength type presumption <Col N="466" /> is the right approach.  I am sure something along those lines will be reported as probably the most feasible way of providing such protection.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State said he intends introducing legislation to effectively deal with this problem before the summer recess.  Unfortunately, by that time many people will have suffered the injustice I mentioned and many elderly people will have been put out of their homes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;The following section shall be substituted for section 85 of the Act of 1980:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;85.&mdash;(1)  Subject to the provision of subsections 2 and 3 of this section, so much of any contract, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, as provides that any provision of this Act shall not apply in relation to a person or that the application shall be varied, modified or restricted in any way in relation to a person shall be void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where a tenant is willing to agree with a landlord that any provision of this Act shall not apply or shall be varied, modified or restricted in any way in relation to that tenant, it shall be lawful for the Court on an application made under this section by the tenant by order to declare that the proposed agreement may have effect notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) if the Court, having regard to the circumstances of the landlord <Col N="467" /> and of the tenant, considers that the terms of the proposed agreement are fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the Court has made an order under subsection (2) of this section in relation to a proposed agreement, then such agreement if made in writing shall not be void solely by virtue of the provisions of subsection (1).&lsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are two separate approaches to the issue of contracting out.  One is to permit the market to allow people to contract out simpliciter and the other is to allow a restricted opt out rule or, alternatively, to allow a court supervised opt out system.  It is not irrelevant to our consideration that in the United Kingdom the parliament opted for a court supervised opt out in respect of tenancy agreements in England and Wales and I would favour that approach.  A tenant who has spent 12 years in a flat may want to stay with his or her landlord for the rest of his or her life and not want a 35 years lease. Tenants may be agreeable to allowing their tenancies die with them and give up any rights their next of kin may have. The tenant who wishes to take on a life tenancy may understand it poses a difficulty for the landlord as he or she cannot agree to exclude the tenant's rights under the 1980 Act.  The tenant may want to go to court to get a ruling that it is rational for him or her, say, a pensioner in his or her 75th year, to be given a life tenancy If the landlord and tenant are willing to agree to that formulation in order to avoid the draconian issues dealt with in earlier amendments it should be for the supervisory agency to ensure that the tenant is not exploited or bullied into surrendering rights and that a rational and fair bargain is struck between the parties.  That is the right approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill contained a more radical proposal to the effect that it was possible to opt out simpliciter in business tenancies.  If an opt out provision is universally available, because of differentiation which depends on the state of the market, the general pattern is that <Col N="468" /> the landlord's solicitor dictates the terms of leases except in the case of multinationals running huge food stores in shopping centres.  That is my experience but others may differ.  In virtually all cases a landlord's solicitor would be negligent not to advise his or her client to prepare a separate opt out agreement in commercial leases.  The radical proposal made by Deputy Shatter would have had the effect of nullifying the operation of the Act in future.  It would have the curious effect of existing tenants having entitlements to leases but the landlord would have an opportunity to execute an opt out contract in respect of new tenancies and those tenants would lose their entitlements.  It would give rise to a peculiar position.  Some properties in Dublin would have one status and others another.  It would produce irrational results.</P>
    <P>I am interested in Deputy Shatter's amendments and I look forward to his explanation of them.  A total opt out of the original type proposed is not acceptable. A court-supervised opt out for residential and commercial tenants is the fairest approach.  I hope the Minister's working party will deal with this issue.  In relation to residential tenants the present system is too rigid; it does not take account of legitimate reasons why people would want to opt out, nor does it afford adequate protection.  I know of many cases where tenants asked their landlords in the eighteenth or nineteenth year to allow them remain in the property for their lifetime and that they would not apply for a 35 year lease.  In those cases the landlord's solicitor has had to advise the landlord not to grant the tenant's request because such an understanding or contract is prohibited under existing law.  Something along the lines of a court-supervised opt out is necessary and should be recommended by the Minister's working party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment proposes that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The following subparagraph shall be inserted after subsection (1) (a) (v) of section 17 of the Act of 1980:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" />&lsquo;(vi) in the case only of a tenement falling within the description of the tenement referred to in section 13 (1) (a) (as amended by section 3 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1993), the tenant prior to the commencement of a tenancy, which provides for the exclusive use of the tenement as an office and not as a factory nor as a retail outlet, has executed whether for or without valuable consideration a valid written renunciation of his entitlement to a new tenancy under Part II of this Act.</P>
    <P>(vii)  a renunciation for the purpose of subparagraph (vi) shall not be valid unless the tenant prior to executing such renunciation first obtained independent legal advice.&lsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A consequent amendment would have to be made.  I will confine my remarks to business tenancies.  Originally a number of different provisions were contained in the Bill one of which specifically reflected the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to allow business tenants operating at arm's length to opt out of the provisions and enter their own arrangements.  When the Bill is enacted a person who has held a business tenancy for a period of five years or more will be entitled automatically to a new tenancy for a period of up to 20 years.  It is suggested that in the business area landlords and tenants would like to enter into longer leases than five years and be able to opt out of the right to renew.</P>
    <P>The argument is that while it would suit some landlords to provide a ten-year tenancy they will not do so because they do not want to confine themselves to a further 20-year lease.  It would be an advantage to tenants to know they have the security of the use of the premises for a period of ten years and in return for opting out of the provisions of the legislation they would get some rent relief. This is a proposal that may be advantageous to the landlord and the tenant in a business arrangement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> The original provisions in the legislation allowed for a general opt out clause, but that was voted down on Committee Stage.  One of the reasons given for voting it down was that in the context of retail outlets where someone entered into an opt out clause, if at the end of a ten year lease the person was forced by the landlord to move on, with no right of renewal, they would lose the goodwill attached to the retail premises.  The landlord would have a windfall benefit in that if someone who had operated a successful business such as a restaurant or fashion shop moved on at the end of the ten years the landlord, as well as having a premises to let, would also benefit from the goodwill of the tenant who had been forced to move on.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in that area that specifically applies to the retail sector. This is not a problem that would apply to office premises in that in these circumstances there is not normally a goodwill element.  There are many cases where it would be advantageous to both landlord and tenant to enter into arrangements to provide for a lease longer than five years which would allow for an opt out provision from the legislation.  In a number of European Community countries the law as it applies to office tenancies as opposed to retail outlets and premises used for manufacturing purposes varies in respect of security of tenure issues.</P>
    <P>The amendment I propose is designed to allow for an opt out where premises are made available for office use.  It would allow people to enter into an arrangement at arm's length to exclude the provisions of the Bill, but such arrangement would be valid only if the tenant entering into it first obtained independent legal advice. I disagree with Deputy McDowell's proposal that if there is to be an opt out in terms of this legislation it should be provided for only in circumstances where it is agreed by a court.  In the business sector people operating at arm's length with independent legal advice available to them and with no compulsion to rent a particular premises may, based on their own judgment, enter into arrangements. <Col N="471" /> I see no reason to force people into the expense and difficulty of going to court to get a judge to sanction this type of arrangement.  I emphasise that this applies particularly in the business area.</P>
    <P>Under other legislation, for example, the Matrimonial Home Bill which was held to be unconstitutional for other reasons, an opt out was allowed in circumstances where both spouses obtained independent legal advice on what they were doing.  Under that legislation spouses could opt out of the automatic joint ownership of the family home on the basis of each one getting independent legal advice and could enter into an agreement and make decisions.  In the commercial area where people are legally advised if they make a business decision they should not be forced to seek judicial sanction.  That would create unnecessary work for the courts and unnecessary expenses at a time when we should be trying to limit business expense.</P>
    <P>My amendment deals with office premises. In the context of the goodwill argument, a similar amendment could be made to the legislation to deal with the manufacturing area.  In the case of a premises being used for manufacturing purposes, there is not normally a goodwill element when it comes to passing on those premises.  This amendment could equally deal with the manufacturing area. I tabled the amendment to give the House an opportunity to reconsider this issue.  Since the more radical measure, as it was described by Deputy McDowell, was taken out of the Bill on Committee Stage, a number of articles have been written making the case for reinstating it. I had no hand or part in any of these articles and I do not know most of the people who wrote them, but these people have experience of this area and express concern that if the legislation does not address the possibility of opt out clauses for leaseholds in the business sector an opportunity is lost.</P>
    <P>I received a letter a couple of days ago from a major company operating here which cannot opt out of the legislation. It is a very eloquent illustration of the <Col N="472" /> problems created by current law and shows that those problems will remain unless some opt out provision is included. Even if the Minister does not accept my proposal or that of Deputy McDowell, which applies to both residential and business premises, there is an opportunity for him to bring forward an amendment in this regard in the Seanad.  I will not name the firm involved in the letter, but I will send a copy to the Minister for record purposes.  It states:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Shatter,</P>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill 1994 set out to remedy some aspects in the existing legislation that are greatly impeding the tenants it was enacted to protect.  However, we understand that a vital provision of the Bill has been deleted and that is the one allowing tenants to contract out of the provisions of the legislation to suit themselves.</P>
    <P>We are currently totally hampered, by the lack of this provision, in our efforts to be competitive in very changed circumstances from those prevailing when we entered into a lease 10 years ago.  Computerisation, the European internal market and competitive practices together with the need for organisational rationalisation have resulted in us having approximately 40 per cent of surplus space in the premises we are currently leasing.</P>
    <P>We cannot assign the lease in any reasonable time &mdash; we have been trying for almost 2 years.  Nor can we sub-let the surplus space, on a lease longer than 3 years currently or 5 years if amended, as the renewal rights attained by the sub lessee would result in us sacrificing the break clause option in 2009 (i.e. after 25 years) which we would certainly not want to do.</P>
    <P>Competitive business demands flexibility and companies must not be put at risk by legislation that purports to protect them.  In times of a &ldquo;sellers market&rdquo; in property, tenants are virtually obliged to accept long leases that amount to a strait-jacket over time.</P>
    <P>The contracting out provision is <Col N="473" /> essential to very many businesses and in our own case it would give us some options in reducing our cost burden in line with the needs of the company.</P>
    <P>The writer went on to say that he earnestly requests me to support this need and to campaign to have the contracting out provision included in the legislation. I am not sure whether he is aware that these provisions were originally included.</P>
    <P>That letter was received from a major business that has surplus space and is unable to enter into a reasonably lengthy lease which would not create problems in the future.  Under the legislation it cannot opt out.  In a less successful company this could cause serious financial difficulties, possibly resulting in liquidation.  There is no suggestion that will happen in the case of this company, but it is a serious issue.  This letter confirms what I have been saying, that currently there is provision for a three-year lease or a 35-year lease whereas under this legislation there is provision for a five-year lease or a 20-year lease.</P>
    <P>Many businesses which want to enter into leases of a longer duration than five years but substantially less than 20 years will not be able to do so and many landlords who want to lease their premises for a longer period than five years but who do not want to commit themselves to a 20 year lease will not be able to do so.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider my amendment which would at least address the position referred to in this letter in the context of office premises.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McDowell's amendment, I do not think a court sanction should be required in the business area.  I accept the case in the short-term for enacting legislation which will allow residential tenants to opt out of leases in the circumstances referred to by Deputy McDowell.  It should be possible for a person in a residential tenancy for ten or 11 years who is concerned that they could shortly be put out of the premises to opt out of the lease in the way described by Deputy McDowell.  Because of its very nature, many of the tenants exercising <Col N="474" /> such an opt out clause will be elderly people who think they are in a vulnerable position.  In the context of residential tenants opting out of a lease, there should be a body which gives an imprimatur to such an arrangement before it becomes valid.  I am not sure that this would necessarily need the full panoply of the courts.  For example, one of the existing tribunals could validate these arrangements to ensure an elderly person has not been coerced into signing a document against their will.  Consideration should be given to this point.</P>
    <P>In view of the time and expense involved I am concerned about the involvement of the courts in this issue. The District and Circuit Courts are substantially overworked and understaffed and I am not sure they could cope with additional work.  Neither am I sure about the length of time judges would spend seeking to ensure that people were not coerced into entering these sort of arrangements.  A judge faced with a landlord on one side and a tenant on the other will be tempted to sanction an arrangement without inquiring further into the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>At my suggestion the working party will consider all the proposals on residential tenancies put forward in this debate.  Amendment No. 3 would affect both residential and business tenancies.  The Government is not prepared to make changes in the law relating to residential tenancies pending completion of the working group's report.  When we discussed a similar amendment on Committee Stage I undertook to consider before Report Stage the merits of such a provision in terms of business tenancies.  Having done this, I do not think the balance of the argument would lie with accepting such a proposal. My remarks relate to business tenancies only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's suggestion about a validation procedure in cases where people opt out of residential tenancies is interesting.  In practice it is likely that a court would conclude that where two parties are willing to agree to opt out of <Col N="475" /> a lease that this at least represents a <i>prima facie</i> case that the terms of the proposed agreement are fair and reasonable and it would rarely arise, if at all, that the court would refuse to sanction such arrangements. If this was the case, we would have achieved the position where opting out would be readily available only after people had been put to the trouble and expense of a court hearing.  Both parties would have to get independent legal advice and they could tell the court they understood their rights.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware from our previous discussions that I have had substantial difficulties with allowing opting out provisions of any sort.  In view of the debate in the Select Committee and discussions with interested bodies since then, I have had second thoughts on the matter.  A difficulty arises because our landlord and tenant code does not make any distinction between the different sort of uses to which business premises can be put, even though the issues which arises in practice can be very different.  It has been represented to me that the use of a business premises as an office raises a very different consideration from the use of such premises for trading purposes. The question of goodwill accumulating during the tenancy does not arise in the case of office premises.  As one of the primary functions of the 1980 Act is to protect the goodwill which has been built up, there seems to be an arguable case that those protections are not necessary, at least to the present extent, in the case of office premises.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that the present arrangements work against both the interests of landlords and prospective tenants and that while the extension of the three year period to five years will represent an improvement it will not be sufficient to address the problems which may arise in this area.  I have been told that many businesses would be happy to enter into leases for offices for seven to ten years, which would well justify the fitting out costs, etc., but cannot do so because of the reluctance of landlords to enter into a contract for a period during <Col N="476" /> which a statutory right of renewal occurs. I would welcome the opportunity to consider this matter further between now and the debate in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>A number of different approaches might be taken in dealing with this issue. Deputy Shatter's amendment envisages an opt out provision for offices and possibly some other premises where the issue of goodwill does not arise.  Another option would be to preserve the absolute prohibition on opting out but to provide a longer period for offices and possibly some other premises, say, ten years rather than five years.  A further option would be to increase generally the five year period to ten years but to allow for the payment of compensation for any loss of goodwill where the tenancy is brought to an end after five years.  I would not be in favour of this option because we could create other problems by tampering with the five year period.  At times I have been involved in valuing goodwill and I can envisage cases where the accountancy value put on the goodwill will not compensate the tenant for the disruption, etc. he or she will suffer as a result of losing their tenancy.  I am not suggesting that there would not be difficulties with these proposals &mdash; for example, in defining the distinction between the various classes of premises &mdash; but I would be grateful to the Deputies if they would withdraw their amendments so that I can study the matter between now and the debate in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of Deputy Shatter's amendment &mdash; there is a difference between offices and other premises.  I also accept that the courts may not be the cheapest and most expeditious way of preventing the exploitation of people.  The rent tribunal may be the appropriate body in such cases.  Alternatively, the county register could be used as a sort of filtering mechanism in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in any way trying to throw cold water on Deputy Shatter's amendment, but a landlord knows he can ask a person who has expensively rigged out <Col N="477" /> an office for a higher rent.  He knows that the inconvenience of moving office &mdash; changing the address on notepaper and advising customers of the change of address &mdash; will give him a good deal of leverage over the tenant when a ten year lease expires.  The landlord can effectively blackmail a tenant and drive a hard bargain.  Payment of compensation for disturbance could be a counterbalancing measure to stop landlords putting the gun to the heads of tenants and demanding more than the market rent, in the knowledge that it would cost the tenant dearly to move elsewhere.</P>

      <Col N="478" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Yates on Tuesday, 8 March 1994:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's ineptitude and mishandling of the negotiations and preparation of the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-1999</i>, and calls on it to lay before the Dáil details of the revisions to the Plan that have been discussed with the EU Commission with a clear outline of the annual level of investment from the EU, the Exchequer and the private sector; and affirms that the taxpayer should not be asked to contribute any extra own resources to make up for the shortfall of finance arising from the Government's incompetence and false claims&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, recognising the major contribution to jobs and to Ireland's economic potential arising from the substantial investments to be made with EU Structural Funds and associated public and private expenditure, supports the strategy and priorities set out in the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> and supports the Government in its discussions with the European Commission on the Community Support Framework 1994-1999 to ensure maximum return for Ireland from this expenditure.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised that the National Development Plan has unravelled. It has been drawn up over the past two years under the shameful approach <Col N="479" /> of so-called consultation by the sub regional review groups but always under the veil of secrecy and stamp of authority of the officials of the Department of Finance. It has been put forward as the great bastion of local participation to all participants in the sub regional review groups process who acknowledge that this was nothing more than a charade.</P>
      <P>There was never any public awareness of the proper planning process being put in place.  There was a total failure to release the energy and enterprise of the people in the context of the undemocratic way in which this plan was formulated.</P>
      <P>The lack of any meaningful regional input was part of the criticism by the EC Regional Affairs Commissioner, Bruce Millan, in respect of the 1989-93 spending of Structural Funds.  He warned the Government that proper regional debate and structures were required to ensure that the views and aspirations of the people of all regions of Ireland were taken into account in any sustainable regional plan.</P>
      <P>The lack of consultation in the national plan helped to reinforce the idea of Europe as a distant, remote and imposing bureaucracy.  The 1993-99 national plan provided a great opportunity to inform and empower people at local level which would have allowed them to determine the shape and direction of their lives in their local areas.  It provided a unique opportunity to link people with real power by ensuring that decision-making on the formulation of plans and the disbursement of funds was concentrated mainly at local level.  In other words, successful democratisation of decision-making would have placed the future of our country where it belongs &mdash; in the hands of the people.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the national plan provided a catalyst for local government reform but, unfortunately, it appears the Government is committed to maintaining centralised bureaucratic control over the allocation and distribution of the majority of these funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>School children knew that this was likely to be the last major opportunity <Col N="480" /> for Ireland to attract significant regional development funds from Europe.  The focus of European investment in the future will likely turn to eastern and central European countries, thus it was crucial to get it right on this occasion.</P>
    <P>On 16th December 1992 the Taoiseach made the following statement in Dáil Éireann on the outcome of the Edinburgh Summit: &ldquo;The agreement now reached ensures, and I say this with complete confidence, that Ireland will obtain £8 billion over seven years.&rdquo;  In various statements in the following weeks he clearly indicated that the money agreed at the Edinburgh Summit was &ldquo;in the bag&rdquo;.  I heard that the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, was ill.  I hope she makes a speedy recovery but with the figures in the national plan unravelling, I am not surprised.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said this figure would rise to £8.8 billion when account was taken of the 10 per cent devaluation which the Government was forced to recognise after misleading people for several months on this issue. We now know that only global figures were agreed in respect of EC Regional and Cohesion Funds at Edinburgh and that Spain was the only country to underwrite any guarantee of support in the communique.</P>
      <P>It transpired that the Taoiseach not only misled the Dáil but he misled the people.  This was a useful deception, however, as it saved his political future at the time.  He succeeded in convincing the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party that together they had plenty of money for the following five years to spend their way through a term of office and court significant popularity.  The chickens came home to roost, however, in July 1993 when the Taoiseach sent off his new found friend, Dick Spring, to Brussels to deliver the goods on the fictitious finance that was supposed to be &ldquo;in the bag&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>When Opposition spokespersons and independent commentators queried those figures all knowledge that they were wrong was denied.  The Tánaiste was so bullish about helping out his new friend, the Taoiseach, during those negotiations that he threatened to use the veto if Ireland did not receive at least £8 billion.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste huffed and puffed on the shareout of Structural Funds and ultimately had to climb down.  The ignominious outcome was that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste dissipated the goodwill shown to this country by our European partners as a result of their stubbornness in trying to save their political reputations.</P>

    <P>The ultimate insult to the European Commission and the intelligence of the Irish people was when the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, publicly admonished an official of the European Commission and other &ldquo;mere civil servants&rdquo; on the manner in which European money was being spent in Ireland.  This disgraceful and intemperate behaviour is unbecoming of a Government Minister and further damages relations between Ireland and the European Commission in respect of future issues of importance to us.

    <P>Ireland is now paying a high price for the expensive blunder on the part of the Taoiseach in his handling of Ireland's Structural Fund's allocation.  It demonstrates to all the arrogance of this Government when it failed to acknowledge its huge mistake against the national interest.

I hate to think of the ultimate manner in which the Government will spend this windfall &mdash; it does not inspire confidence &mdash; in fact, the manner in which it is going about it leads me to resort to a remark made by Mr. John Bowman on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on RTE on Monday evening last when he suggests that we could end up being net contributors to the European Union rather than a country in net receipt.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The public interest will be best served by getting on with the job of negotiating <Col N="484" /> the most advantageous spending of the agreed Community Support Framework moneys and in putting this acrimony and personality politics behind us.  Indeed, there is something artificial about much of the controversy in that nothing has changed in relation to the allocation of European aid since the Commission decision of 21 October 1993 when the matter was extensively debated in the Dáil.  For some time the Government has been taking steps to deal with the situation, as demonstrated by the adjustments made to the 1994 Estimates. However, we must not lose sight of what has been achieved and of our obligations to ensure that the funds are used to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>It is important to focus on the fact that the minimum aid package which Ireland is guaranteed to get is more than £7 billion for the period 1993 to 1999 or more than £6 billion for the six year period which the new Community Support Framework will cover.  This is the largest aid package ever committed to this country. Under it, the level of aid per head of population in this country will be the highest in the European Union.  It is an achievement of which the Government can be proud and its impact on the development of this country will be considerable.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing the Government in drawing up the National Development Plan and in now preparing, with the European Commission, the Community Support Framework, is to ensure that we get the best possible long-term return for the economy from the use of these funds.</P>
    <P>It is important to restate here the strategies and priorites on which the Government based the plan and which will direct its approach to the Community Support Framework.  The central objective of the Government's approach is to ensure the best long-term return for the economy by increasing output, economic potential and long-term jobs.  It is further designated to reintegrate into the economic mainstream the long-term unemployed and those at high risk of becoming so.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan set out the Government's strategy to achieve <Col N="485" /> the national and European Community objective of greater economic and social cohesion.  The basic elements of the strategy are first, investment in the growth potential of the economy in industry, in tourism and services, in agriculture and natural resources; second, investment in the country's productive infrastructure to improve the capacity and competitiveness of the economy; third, investment in the development of the skills of our people through education and training in order to increase productivity and growth capacity; and fourth, a special increased emphasis on harnessing local community leadership and local initiative.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Hogan spoke about the issue of local development, I must say I shared his concerns.  Indeed, I was sorry to see him move on from his European portfolio to new pastures.  That is why we have included in the National Development Plan £1,200 million for new local development which was not there last time round.</P>
    <P>The plan was drawn up on the basis that value for money should be central to the choice of programmes and projects. The plan should be ultimately judged by its permanent contribution to job creation and to Ireland's economic performance when the last ECU had been spent.  Each allocation has to be judged against the alternative ways of spending the money.</P>
    <P>In preparing proposals, Departments were asked to quantify the effect of their proposals on the environment as well as their impact in relation to other criteria &mdash; effect on numbers at work, impact on the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged, gender balance, impact on regional rural development, and co-operation with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This emphasis on value for money is something that we will be pursuing further in the finalisation of the Community Support Framework and in a systematic way throughout the implementation process. Perhaps we have all learned that this money from Europe is not free money, that we need to ensure that none of our projects is over-designed, that we <Col N="486" /> get the best value for money and treat this as a scarce resource.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy contains new thinking, new ideas, and most importantly, it draws on the lessons learned from experience.  New elements in the plan are the focus on tackling disadvantage and poverty, the emphasis on gender balance, practical concern for the environment and a strong regional dimension.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I would like to highlight in particular the focus that is being placed on unemployment blackspots.</P>
    <P>In Ireland there are certain communities where unemployment may range from 50 per cent up to 80 per cent or more, where a cycle of hopelessness and despair can set in, where the risk of unemployment and poverty being transmitted from one generation to the next is high.  At the same time in many of these areas there has been an explosion of new energy released when people come together to try to tackle their problems.</P>
    <P>To tackle unemployment in those areas where it may run up to 80 per cent and where unemployment and poverty run a high risk of perpetuation from one generation to the next, we must rebuild the economic potential of these areas. Rebuilding skills, capability and enterprise among those who have become detached from the economic system may not give the same immediate returns as investing in areas with a sound economic base, but it is a vital element of any national plan which claims to be inclusive.</P>
    <P>One of our basic concerns is that EU funds will reach into the core of every local community, especially those most severely affected economically and socially by unemployment and poverty. It is important that the long-term impact of the Structural Funds makes a real difference to communities struggling with chronic disadvantage and poverty.  This applies not only to the specific measures included under the local development programme but to other programmes as well.  We want to see the training schemes and education programmes which are to <Col N="487" /> be funded well targeted to provide the most deprived groups in the labour force with the education, skill and self esteem to be able to compete fairly in the labour market.  We want a fair share of the short term jobs created from the injections of funds into the Irish economy to be available to the long-term unemployed and to those who have a high risk of falling into that category.</P>
    <P>The Government stands firmly by its commitment to tackling social exclusion as a key element of its strategy.  We are making that case very strongly in the course of our negotiations in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the National Development Plan involved probably the most extensive consultative process ever carried in connection with a plan of this nature in this country.  It involved the social partners, sub-regional interests, community and voluntary groups, non-governmental environmental organisations, the Council for the Status of Women and many others.  The National Economic and Social Forum was consulted and the plan was debated in the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>I met all the sub-regional review groups and read their reports carefully. It was not possible to implement all of their recommendations in the plan because, on my table, there were demands for £28 million worth of expenditure. But certainly the flavour of those discussions did influence and shape the thinking on the plan.  The plan was welcomed by a wide range of groups I would like to reassure them in particular that the strategy set out in the plan remains intact and on course.  The task we now face is to ensure that, as the implementation phase begins, we continue to work to get the best return at all stages from the investment being made.</P>
    <P>Discussions with the European Union Commission are continuing in relation to the Community Support Framework which is the agreed basis for the use of the Structural Funds up to 1999.  The overall level of these funds is already settled, subject, of course, to the mid-term review which will take place in 1996. <Col N="488" /> Therefore, there is no discussion of the total amount.  What is under discussion is the manner in which these funds will be allocated to different sectors and different types of expenditure.</P>
    <P>These discussions with the Commission are taking place at official level. To a large extent they are of a technical nature.  They are being overseen by Ministers and Commissioners responsible for the Structural Funds.  Since the National Plan was submitted there have been extensive consultations between the various Government Departments involved and the Commission Services. This process moved into a more formal phase in mid-February.  To the extent that the discussions between the Government Departments and Commission services can refine and improve the measures in the plan it is a constructive process.  We have a shared interest in getting the best value for money.</P>
    <P>There may be some adjustments to be made to the plan, but these would largely be within particular expenditure areas, with the Community Support Framework reflecting the overall strategies and priorities identified in the plan.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the important issue of evaluation of Structural Fund assisted investments.  The whole question has received considerable attention at Community level and justifiably so.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government fully endorses this emphasis on evaluation.  It is vitally important that we get the best return from the EC resources becoming available to us in terms of securing permanent sustainable improvements in growth and employment and of value for money, under all our programmes.  A large number of evaluations have been carried out on behalf of Departments in relation to the CSF 1989-93 and the operational programmes.  The results of these evaluations have been generally positive.  The Government envisages building on the considerable evaluation that has already been undertaken and the plan provides for enhanced investment on evaluation.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the range of investments to be funded under the plan we drew on <Col N="489" /> the experience of the evaluations.  For example, the evaluation recommended that we should continue to invest a large sum of money in education and training in order to have a trained and skilled work force.  That is something that arose from the evaluations.  I believe in drawing on the lessons of experience.</P>
    <P>There has been no delay in discussions on the Community Support Framework. At this stage only one Community Support Framework, that for Portugal, has been approved.  In that case the development plan was submitted in July 1993. Discussions on the Irish Community Support Framework are ongoing and I expect them to be concluded over the next month or so.  Work on the Operational Programmes is proceeding in parallel with that on the Community Support Framework with a view to having the programmes approved at the same time as or shortly after adoption of the Community Support Framework.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates claimed that I gave an inaccurate reply to a question in the Dáil on 23 November 1993 and at the very least implied that I misled the House.  I categorically reject this.</P>

      <P>The question to which I was replying arose from a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 10 November 1993 which stated that the Commission has serious reservations about a series of elements in the plan.  Following publication of that report, officials from the Department of Finance established from the Commission services that they had only commenced their examination of the plan and that they had not yet reached a formal position in relation to it.  Furthermore, I met the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Mr. Bruce Millan, at an <Col N="490" /> informal meeting of Ministers for Regional Policy in Liège on 11 and 12 November 1993.  As I have already told the House, he went out of his way to check out the newspaper report.</P>
      <P>He told me that he had checked with his services, that they were still examining the plan and had not formed a view and that the story had not come from the Commission services.  In the light of this I do not see how anybody could claim that the information I gave to the Dáil was in any way misleading or inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I take very seriously what I say to this House.  I was responding to a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 10 November and I said I had double checked that there was no truth in that story.</P>
      <P>More recent suggestions, in this House and elsewhere, that the Commission has major problems with the plan are inaccurate. They have accepted the strategy set out in the plan.  The discussions that are going on are about the details of the plan.  It is my hope that those discussions, which I expect will be vigorous on all sides will result in a sharper and better focus for the plan as a whole.  The independent evaluation of the plan which the Commission had prepared endorses the emphasis which we have placed in the plan on the importance of education and training in investing in our human resources; it also endorses the emphasis we have placed on rebuilding the economic potential of the long-term unemployed. To some extent we have internal debate within the Commission with one directorate wanting one thing and another directorate wanting something else. This is routine in any large organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen has quoted statements from the Labour Party calling for Dáil discussion of the National Development Plan in 1989 and she has claimed that this shows some inconsistency with our position now.  In the case of the present plan, unlike 1989, the Dáil was given the opportunity to discuss it in July 1993 and to make an input before the Government <Col N="491" /> took final decisions on the plan.  We are conveying in very strong terms to Brussels the wishes of this House and of the Seanad and of all the sub-regional review committees that a significant investment be made under the plan in the county road network, and I am sure we will have the full support of this House in negotiating on that issue.  In a country with a dispersed population it is important that we support investment in county roads.  I am sure I will have the support of the House in making those points to Brussels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cox asked for clarification of the percentage <i>pro rata</i> cutback and what it related to.  The overall cutback is by the amount of the shortfall in EU aid. The net Exchequer contribution is being maintained.  This cutback is then applied to the combined EU and Exchequer components of the plan, excluding the Exchequer elements relating to the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives which are not affected by the shortfall in aid in the Community Support Framework.  In a £20 billion plan, the amount of the shortfall is less than 5 per cent of the total.  We are delivering on 95 per cent of the plan and will expect to deliver in time on 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>The EC Structural and Cohesion Funds for 1994-1999 provide a renewed opportunity to consolidate the benefits gained by the Irish economy from the completion of the Single Market, the Community Support Framework 1989-93 and the beginnings of the process of creating an economic and monetary union.  I look forward to the benefits which the implementation of the Community Support Framework 1994-1999 and the Operational Programmes will yield.</P>
    <P>A wise choice of investments was made, based on a wide process of consultation. We will see a lasting benefit to the Irish economy that will increase our output and economic potential and result in greater employment.  Instead of talking down an investment of over £7 billion the Opposition should welcome the opportunities <Col N="492" /> it offers for the economic benefit of this country.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Creed is in the House I offer him my congratulations on his new posting.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I intend to concentrate on the human resources chapter in the National Plan, being the chapter which has been most unfairly commented on in all kinds of quarters.  It is a chapter of huge importance.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of tumult and clamour relating to the reported attitude of the EU Commission to the human resources chapter.  I am glad of the opportunity to set the record straight on this issue.  That Chapter of the National Plan is to be channelled through the Department of Enterprise and Employment. Detailed discussions on the human resource measures took place in Brussels last week between officials of the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Finance and Commission officials.</P>
      <P>In those discussions the Commission officials made it clear that both the human resources chapter in the National Plan and the draft operational programme which is being negotiated with the Commission correspond to the regulations and the priorities of the European Social Fund.</P>
      <P>What the Commission is seeking is more detailed information on what we are proposing in order to be satisfied of the impact of the programmes on what is regarded as priority areas.  It also wants to ensure that there are clear indicators of success identified for each programme and that each programme has achievable social and economic targets.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies, even such a robust performer as Deputy Yates, will agree that this is the proper approach for the Commission to take.  I assure Deputies that we are more than able to supply the Commission with any further information or material it requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This normal process, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, of interaction and negotiation <Col N="493" /> is a far cry from the picture that the Opposition Deputies are trying to portray of conflict between our administration and the Commission.</P>
    <P>As I said on radio on Saturday, we will not get results if we are too demure.  I would question any party or commentator who would expect us to go clothed in decorum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The evaluation unit is within the labour affairs section of the Department.  It is a highly specialised unit and the evaluation techniques used there are being adapted to become the norm in other European countries.  That is a remarkable vote of confidence in our evaluation unit.</P>
      <P>What was particularly gratifying for me about last week's discussions with the Commission was their very strong support for the new apprenticeship scheme I am introducing which had all party support. I also welcome the Commission's support in the area of training for the employed and the importance of continuous upgrading of our national skills levels.  The Commission also strongly supports my emphasis on training for early school leavers and accepts the need for the social exclusion measures contained in the plan.</P>
      <P>I am concentrating on the human resource aspect of the plan, as this is largely my area of responsibility and it is the area that seems to have attracted the most unfair criticism.  I hope what I said to-night will assure people that this criticism does not reflect the view of the Commission and is, in fact, a distortion of its views.  I said this on radio on Saturday and again want to reiterate that Commission officials last week agreed that our proposals in the plan correspond to the regulations and priorities of the European Social Fund.</P>
      <P>It is very easy to say unemployment black spots should not be attended to but the whole notion of the unification of Europe was based on economic and social cohesion.  To pursue an economic policy without simultaneously having regard for social aspects would be fool-hardy and wrong.  We have placed increased emphasis on local development, economic and social cohesion and social exclusion.  When we considered the number who are unemployed it ill-behoves any party to deride courses of action which we have undertaken through community employment.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the famous national development plan &mdash; famous because it will be important to the people over the next five years.  It has been known since October that the level of EC support for the plan would be £7.2 billion and not £8 billion.  It remains the priority of the Government to retain the integrity of the plan and Labour is totally committed to its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions are taking place between Ireland and Brussels about the plan with a view to agreeing the Community support framework which will set out the broad national and sectoral strategies for use of the EU Structural Funds.  The plan is about jobs and building up a productive potential.  It is about building up the infrastructure of the country, providing sufficient water and sewerage schemes <Col N="496" /> and improving the road network.  Calls by other parties for the plan to be withdrawn are at best disingenuous and at worst irresponsible.

It will be delivered upon irrespective of what the Opposition think.</P>
      <P>The people are not depending on Fine Gael to lead the negotiations in Brussels on this.  If they were we would end up with £5 billion and not the £8 billion which is part of a £20 billion plan.  The people want this plan implemented as quickly as possible.

The Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, referred to the Opposition's myth making about the Structural Fund.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, started and continued the myth until June last year. A headline stated: &ldquo;Reynolds hits out at Euro doubts over £8 billion package&rdquo;.  It was not the Opposition parties who raised those doubts nor the doubts to <Col N="497" /> which he referred.  He was responding to comments by officials and Commissioners of the European Parliament who claimed that the £8 billion package did not exist.

      <P>I am being generous by taking only 8.5 per cent.  This is a humiliating climb down for Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party.  The attempts of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to bamboozle the public has fallen apart.  Until the middle of last week Ministers insisted there would be no significant change in the National Development Plan.  Last Thursday's statement finally confirmed what everybody else had known since last October &mdash; the Government also knew, incidentally &mdash; that the money promised by the European Union was substantially less than claimed by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In spite of knowing this since last October they went ahead and based the National Development Plan &mdash; this heavy glossy plan &mdash; on £8 billion.  To be more precise the figure in the plan is £7.988 billion.</P>

      <P>A great many of the projects will have to be delayed, scaled down or scrapped.  These attempts to deceive the public represent one of the most shameful episodes in our political history.  In virtually any other democracy those involved in such subterfuge would have done the decent thing and resigned from office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to overstate the economic blow from the loss of at least £800 million. It may be more depending on how one judges the figures.  We will now have less money to promote economic development, to fight poverty and reduce unemployment. The sum of £800 million is more than the budget for one of the high spending Departments, such as the Department of the Environment.  Many economists believe this money would create 10,000 jobs.  The net loss to the <Col N="499" /> economy is likely to be even greater as without this money from Europe, it is highly unlikely that an equivalent matching fund will come from the State, unless there is another pot of gold which we have not been told about and the private sector will not invest unless European Union funds matches its investment. The withholding of information from the Dáil on the negotiating position of the Government is about par for the political course of this House.  We are used to being kept in the dark, but what is not acceptable is that a succession of Government Ministers, including the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, reported to the Dáil that firm commitments had been reached on £7.84 billion when they knew this was not the case.  They knew at the very most they would get £7.2 billion. Repeated statements in recent days by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs among others, confirm they are working on the basis of £7.2 billion.</P>
    <P>I spoke on the Adjournment debate last July and I pointed out that the Delors II package was a saga of ineptitude and downright dishonesty.  For my troubles I was subsequently thrown out of the House for telling the truth.  It is not as if the Government was not warned about the dangers associated with its strategy. When the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste claimed after the famous all night meeting last July that we had secured £7.84 billion Mr. Des Geraghty, MEP, warned us of the dangers associated with relying on verbal assurances from Jacques Delors.  He pointed out that our claim was built on shifting sands and that turned out to be the case.  I am indebted to Mr. Des Geraghty for producing figures which will be published in <i>The Irish Times</i> tomorrow to give us an indication of how much this State can expect to receive.</P>
    <P>The figure included in the National Development Plan for European Union receipts of £1,081 million for 1993 is correct. It is incorporated in the sum of £7.2 billion which the Government claims the State will receive and has been verified by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> In the period 1994-99 moneys will be provided under the same three headings: the Community Support Framework, the Community Initiatives and the Cohesion Fund and distributed in line with the share out as agreed.  In the Community Support Framework, under which funds are distributed to Objective 1 countries, Ireland has been allocated £4.284 billion which could be reduced if we continue to insult the Commissioners dealing with this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the word of the Minister of State that it will not be reduced.  I am sure she acknowledges it will not be possible to have it increased in the mid-term review as claimed.  That myth has been exploded.  The sum cannot be increased unless we beggar one or more of the other three Objective 1 countries.</P>
      <P>The amount to be distributed under the Cohesion Fund has also been agreed and Ireland is to receive 9 per cent.  For the next six years this amounts to £993 million in 1993 prices.</P>
      <P>Under the Community Initiatives the four Cohesion countries, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece are to receive £3.964 billion during the next six years. This amount has been fixed.  In the National Development Plan the Government indicated that it expected to receive £516 million of this.  All the money Ireland will receive during the next six years will be allocated from those three pools which have to be shared with Spain, Portugal and Greece.  We compete with them for this money.</P>
      <P>Following pressure from President Delors last October we were granted 9.4 per cent of the amount to be distributed under the Community Support Framework. When the Cohesion Fund was divided we were granted 9 per cent.  We can have no reasonable expectation that we will be granted more than 9.5 per cent under the Community Initiatives.  It would be unrealistic to claim or argue that we will receive any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should stop building <Col N="501" /> on myths.  Having had the figures of £8 billion and £7.84 billion discredited the figure of £7.2 billion is also about to be challenged.  If we add the likely maximum receipts from the three pools for the rest of this century at constant 1993 prices we get a total of £5.654 billion.  If we add the allocation we received for 1993 of £1.081 billion we get a grant total of £6.735 billion, not £7.2 billion.</P>
    <P>What is the likely shortfall?  The short answer is that it could be as high as £1,253 million, not £800 million.  There is no point in the Government screaming at the Opposition parties and arguing that they are talking down our prospects of receiving European Union funding and at the same time saying that this funding has been wrapped up.  We have legitimate questions to ask about the way in which the negotiations were handled and about what the Government is doing in touting a National Development Plan which was launched at the beginning of this year based on the figure of £8 billion when it knew last October &mdash; and as far back as last July as far as I am concerned &mdash; that we would not get anything like that figure.  Despite this it still insists that the programme will be completed and that it will be able to convince Spain, Portugal and Greece that Ireland needs the money it has been allocated and that it will be handed over.  It is unacceptable that the Government is perpetrating this myth, nonsense and make believe.  It should tell us the truth about the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the National Development Plan can be sliced by between 8 per cent to 10 per cent or by whatever figure is agreed after the figures have been juggled yet again.  It is unacceptable that the allocations under the headings employment creation, the environment and other key areas such as measures to combat poverty, which are grossly underfunded will be cut by the same amount as allocations under the headings where there is major expenditure. Only 8 per cent of the total amount to be made available, be it £7 billion or £6.7 billion, will be allocated under the heading social exclusion. <Col N="502" /> Eighty per cent of this will be directed at training programmes.</P>
    <P>The Dáil has been treated with contempt by the Government.  Information was withheld and misleading and inaccurate information was given to the House.  When the Government was elected we expressed a fear that its unprecedented majority would lead it to believe it could ride roughshod over the rights of the Dáil and particularly the Opposition parties.  Our views have been confirmed by the manner in which it has handled the controversy surrounding the funds.  Even when the alarm bells were ringing in Brussels the Government continued to make claims in the Dáil that it knew it could not deliver on.</P>
    <P>What value can now be placed on promises made by the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald in the light of the promise made by her last November that not one line, sentence or paragraph of the National Development Plan would be changed?  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, the Minister of State and a Labour Party Deputy earlier tonight accused the Opposition parties of talking down our prospects of receiving funds and at the same time claimed that the amount of money was fixed and not in question.  They cannot have it both ways. If this is so, how can raising valid questions in the Dáil be seen as talking down our prospects.  To paraphrase the fictional prime minister in a recent BBC serial &ldquo;To Play the King&rdquo;, the dogs in the street think that Government Ministers have been and are lying through their teeth.  Members could not possibly say anything like that lest we be expelled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to talk down the money we are getting, but the strategy in the national plan means that whatever money we get will not be enough.  We are facing into a free market and greater energy tax and, as a peripheral country, we will be up against it. The tragedy of not getting the money we were supposed to get is all the more stark when one bears in mind what we must face when this money runs out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> The genesis of the national plan is in the Maastricht Treaty.  At that time the most favoured view was that the money would be the reward for voting for the Maastricht Treaty, for being &ldquo;good Europeans&rdquo;. Others, more pragmatically, regarded it as compensation for the damage that would ensue following the enactment of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>The money that was available at that time has apparently dwindled and one can only speculate on the circumstances of that but it has certainly left the Government with egg on its face.  In Denmark the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty had to be put a second time because the first result was not what was required by those who wanted it passed. In Ireland the vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty was rock solid and could not be shifted, but the circumstances of arriving at that result have changed, which is an amazing thing to reflect on historically.</P>
    <P>The reduction that is talked about is largely centred on administrative difficulties subsequent to the amount being negotiated, and does not take into account the effects of devaluation.  The figures are meaningless unless we take into account the exact value of what we are getting.  The Minister for Finance has tried desperately to find refuge in the mid-term review.  I compliment him on his optimism, but his statements about that will ring hollow in many other countries, some of which are poorer than Ireland and will be clamouring for that money.  I would not depend on the mid-term review and I doubt if many people outside this House take it seriously.</P>
    <P>The Cohesion and Structural Funding are presented in this glossy package which is a weighty enough document. However, some fundamental aspects of what lies ahead of us are omitted.  The European rules we are supposed to be following, having been good Europeans and having voted for the Maastricht Treaty, are being flouted by the Government, not to mention people outside this House.  It is important to draw attention to the fact that our own Government has <Col N="504" /> a certain gall in saying that the Opposition is talking down Structural Funding, the Cohesion Funding and the other European funds when it is coming across as a mediocre European with double standards.</P>
    <P>We agreed to provide information and make decisions about our environment. For example, 1993 was the deadline for indicating which of our waterways were sensitive and which were not so that plans could be made as to the location of sewage treatment plants and other facilities &mdash; 1993 has come and gone and we have not provided that information.  On the Cohesion Fund we were to provide a 50 per cent breakdown between environmental projects and infrastructural projects. The environment element was reduced to a tiny percentage with one sewage treatment plant, hardly 50 per cent.  We are asked to produce a plan with the year 2000 in mind, looking at the next few years rather than the future for generations.</P>
    <P>It was intended that money would be provided for sewage treatment of the highest standard.  However, we are settling for secondary, rather than tertiary treatment and we are neglecting the 2005 deadline which provides that no discharges shall be allowed from towns with populations of 2,000 or more people.  Is the Government expecting this country to last into the next century, or is it choosing not to think about it because of its dire prospects?</P>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of short-term, day-to-day planning which is frightening when one realises that this money is meant to provide for a sustainable existence for this country.  When it runs out we will be faced with increased energy tax while at the same time relying completely on road-based transport for most of our economic activity and, in agriculture, because the plan makes no provision for organic farming, we are relying on chemical farming.  We are storing up huge problems.  The building of the peat-fired station does nothing except indicate how serious things will become unless we review the plan on the basis of <Col N="505" /> sustainability not just until the year 2000 but beyond.</P>

His study shows conclusively that there is a relationship between poor education and unemployment.

      <P>Before I was elected to this House I was involved in local community development and unemployment movements and am proud of that.  For the first time in this plan a structural base is being put in place by the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, to ensure that the type of movements in <Col N="508" /> which I have been involved on the north side &mdash; which have led to the north side partnership &mdash; not alone proceed but continue to raise the morale everywhere there is a partnership.  In his excellent publication on achieving social integration, Hugh Frazer stated that the National Development Plan creates real possibilites for providing the key resources over an extended period of time for such development.  Both the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, deserve commendation for the work they put into the plan.  A sum of £7.2 billion will be available in the period between now and 1999 and every time I am present at the opening of a development, such as the Tallaght hospital project in a few years' time, will remember that the A team of Fine Gael is on the back benches and, sadly, the B team is on the front benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been listening to the Z team.  There are three aspects to the Government's problems in regard to EU funding for the National Plan.  The Government got the overall figures wrong, it apparently included ineligible projects for the plan and the overall spending priorities are unacceptable to the European Commission.  I will deal with each of those aspects in turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the mistake in the overall figures, the Government has known for many months that it would have to scale back the National Development Plan because EU aid would be less than expected.  It was aware that the five year plan which the Dáil approved following a lengthy debate last October would have to be radically changed.  It was also aware that the plan would have to be stretched out to become not a five year plan, but a six, seven or eight year one or, alternatively, <Col N="509" /> some elements would have to be dropped.  Even though it was aware of those matters the Taoiseach and his Ministers consistently denied that this would have to happen.  That was dishonest and dishonest politics are always bad politics.  This Government has been dishonest about the plan.</P>
    <P>At the end of last month the Government finally admitted the truth and agreed that the plan would have to be radically revised.  It showed itself to be very indecisive.  At a meeting on 1 March the Cabinet was asked to make serious policy choices between programmes in the light of the reduced resources it eventually admitted was at its disposal. At that meeting the Cabinet was given an opportunity to act in accordance with the maxim that to govern is to choose but, characteristically for a Fianna FáilLabour Coalition, the Ministers decided to dodge making a decision.  They opted instead for an indiscriminate 8.5 per cent cut across all programmes and refused to set any priorities.  Instead of Ministers having the courage to set out priorities for the spending of the money the entire matter was left for decision in negotiations with European Union officials on the Community Support Framework.  In effect, European officials will now make the decisions for the Irish Government. From long experience, I recognise that inability to make difficult decisions or choices as an ingrained characteristic of the Labour Party in Government.</P>
    <P>In regard to the inclusion of apparently ineligible projects, our main difficulty relates to the Tallaght Hospital project. The only basis on which a hospital could be included in an economic development plan for EU aid is on the basis of Article 1 of Council Regulation 4254 of 1988 which refers to &ldquo;investment contributing to increasing economic potential, development, structural adjustment of regions, where the need is demonstrated for ... health facilities&rdquo;.  I read the relevant passages in the National Development Plan about the Tallaght Hospital and I do not believe the Government has met the exact economic criteria set down in that regulation.  If the Government's <Col N="510" /> case for the Tallaght Hospital is accepted &mdash; obviously one hopes it will be &mdash; it would appear that all hospital projects in Objective One countries would also be eligible for European aid.  That would create a difficult precedent.  The Government did not read the European Union regulations properly before submitting its plan and that shows its incompetence.</P>
    <P>The third problem with the plan concerns its overall priorities.  The Commission is questioning the use of EU aid to finance &ldquo;make work&rdquo; schemes with little real training content and the general lack of quality control on training, in particular the job placement record of some training courses is low.  The Government did not read the European Union regulations closely before submitting its plan.  Article 1 of Regulation 2084 &mdash; 1993 of the Social Fund Regulations states that the objective of the fund is occupational integration of unemployed persons.  That means finding viable jobs and not providing long-term &ldquo;make work&rdquo; schemes.  The Government is mistaken in its training strategy because it confines aid to State run or State controlled institutions.  The private sector is excluded from receipt of EU aid for training and that is unacceptable. Instead of giving vouchers or training credits to potential trainees to shop around for the best possible training course the aid is given exclusively to State run institutions, either FÁS or the Department of Education and they decide what courses to provide.  That centralised, socialist approach to training policy promotes an inefficient allocation of resources.  The Department and the Government are making a strategic error in confining funds in that way.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the European Commission in its recent White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment recommended training vouchers for trainees rather than State training institutions having a monopoly on the funds to be allocated.  That is something I have advocated since 1987 and I am glad the Commission, if not the Government, <Col N="511" /> have accepted the wisdom of that proposal.</P>
    <P>I regret some aspects of the tone of the debate.  I listened to a number of contributors including Deputy Brian Fitzgerald from my constituency and Deputy Broughan from Dublin North-East. It was interesting that Deputy Broughan sought to justify the criticisms voiced by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment of Mr. Landeburu, a reputable European Commission official. Deputy Broughan referred to him in disparaging terms.  Mr. Landeburu is a socialist Basque doing a good job in the European Commission and Deputy Broughan referred to him as a bureaucrat.</P>

As the Deputy knows it is the policy of the socialist party in Europe to enhance the powers of the Commission and Parliament and reduce those of the Council of Ministers &mdash; which works to defend the interests of big countries &mdash; whereas <Col N="512" /> the Commission is the defender of small countries.  It is particularly injudicious and contrary to the national interest for our officials to abuse officials of the European Commission which is our sheet anchor and protector.

      <P>It is implied that to do anything else would be contrary to the national interest.  What sort of weak-kneed Government is in office?  It is unable to do its job abroad in the face of criticism at home.  A vigilant Opposition which maintains sustained criticism of the Government helps it to do its job effectively. The Government negotiating abroad on behalf of this country and saying it will have a difficulty in getting a proposal accepted in the Dáil because the Opposition is causing it problems does not recognise that its negotiating position is enhanced and strengthened by that criticism.  It is a sign that the Government has lost its way when all it can do when contributing to a debate like this is to attack the Opposition for criticising the Government.  That is one of the weakest <Col N="513" /> arguments ever advanced.  I have been a Member of the House since 1969 and I have rarely heard it advanced by any Government.  This Government, with a majority of 38, is so lost in the achievement of its objective that it must criticise the Opposition.  That is a sign of serious weakness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government underestimated the intelligence of the people and thought they could not add, read and know the Government's statements about the plan were manifestly untrue, it simultaneously underestimated the intelligence of European Commission officials.  I am glad the <Col N="514" /> Government has come down to earth and recognised that that type of political activity, which may suffice at the level of a vocational education committee where the spoils are being divided and deciding what teachers will be appointed, does not work when dealing with EU matters.  It is regrettable our Government is operating at such a low political level that it is unable to conduct an argument on behalf of our people in a serious fashion.  For those reasons the Government has let the country down in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The Government operated a special programme for disadvantaged areas under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Twelve areas were included in this programme which, from all accounts, was very successful.  The successor to this programme under the National Development Plan includes the original 12 areas and a further 21 areas.  Why has the south Sligo-north Roscommon region not been included in the designated areas?  The region cannot possibly be excluded because it does not qualify under the criteria set out by the Government.</P>
      <P>According to the Government statement, the areas included in the plan were chosen after a detailed assessment of the indicators of disadvantage.  What is the difference between south Sligo-north Roscommon and County Leitrim in terms of disadvantage?  As we all know, County Leitrim has lost half its population since 1926.  However, when one breaks down the census of population on a DED basis one can see that precisely the same thing is happening in the south Sligo-north Roscommon region.  While I am very pleased that County Leitrim has been included in the plan, I do not know why the Minister did not include south Sligo-north Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to some of the areas which will benefit from inclusion in this very valuable scheme.  Mayo central, where there will be a by-election, has been added to Mayo north which had been included.  Donegal, Connemara, east Galway, Limerick west, Offaly north, Kildare north-west rural, Monaghan, Cavan, Longford and Westmeath rural have also been included.  What disadvantages afflict these areas which do not afflict south Sligo-north Roscommon? The people of south Sligo-north Roscommon know that these areas do not suffer from any other disadvantage and all they have to do is to look at conditions in their neighbouring counties to see that this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Government excluded this area because it believes the unemployment level is not high enough?  The <Col N="517" /> unemployment level there is well above the average even though the numbers on the live register are artificially reduced by the many social employment schemes and other programmes.  In addition, this area suffers from a high level of emigration: because there are no jobs available the young people emigrate to England or America or migrate.  All the socio-economic indicators show a serious decline in population.  The population in south Sligo-north Roscommon decreased by 6.9 per cent during the period 1986-91 and in some parts it decreased by as much as 10 per cent.  This evidence of disadvantage cannot be refuted.  I will never understand the aberration which occurred in the Taoiseach's office to exclude this area from the scheme.</P>
    <P>The local development programme can be very valuable in aiding community endeavour and no where is this community endeavour flourishing better than in south Sligo-north Roscommon.  The Taoiseach will be aware of this from the submissions from people in this area which litter his office.  There is no statistical or logical reason for excluding this area from the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is very familiar with conditions there.  The communities are trying valiantly to help themselves but there is widespread disappointment and disillusion at the failure of the Government to give them this extra helping hand which has been made available to less disadvantaged areas.  The people want to build their own future, improve the quality of their lives, solve their own socio-economic problems and generate employment for the long-term unemployed. I call on the Taoiseach to include south Sligo-north Roscommon in a new disadvantaged area or the extension of some of the adjoining areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is disappointment in a number of areas at their not being designated for inclusion in the local development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the programme is to harness and make full use of the potential <Col N="518" /> at local level to bring about social and economic development.  It involves enabling and empowering local communities to become involved in prioritising and implementing action in their own areas.  It involves also developing the capabilities of local communities to contribute to tackling unemployment and pursuing local development.  It is a process, not a project based approach to development.</P>
    <P>The local development programme will emphasise promoting enterprise; developing community involvement and initiatives; supporting groups and individual projects or enterprises; overcoming barriers to employment creation; assisting unemployed persons to develop the confidence and skills to enter or reenter the labour market and enhancing community life within disadvantaged areas and achieving substantial improvements in the physical environment of these areas.</P>
    <P>The programme will be developed through the county enterprise boards, the new Leader programme and area partnership companies in designated disadvantaged areas.  A county enterprise board has now been established for each county, including Sligo.  The Government has also stated the view in the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-99,</i> that Leader can be applied effectively to all areas.  It is also our objective that the new Leader programme should have a wider remit to include training, community and environmental development and capacity building at local level.  The objective is that the rural areas which have been designated will be provided with developmental assistance under the local development programme so that they can maximise their potential to benefit from a new Leader with a broader remit.</P>
    <P>The areas designated for inclusion in the local development programme were announced by the Government on 9 February. The areas included the 12 existing partnership areas with extensions to six, 11 new urban areas and ten new rural areas.  The areas were chosen on the basis of detailed assessment involving objective <Col N="519" /> and measurable indicators of disadvantage, feasible operational boundaries and viability in terms of size and economic base.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum, the Combat Poverty Agency and other such agencies were involved and data produced by them were used in arriving at the objective assessment.</P>
    <P>It is not intended to add to the areas already announced but I stress that the exact boundaries of each area have not been finalised.  The decisions on the definitive boundaries will be made by the Government following a local consultation process to be undertaken by the national co-ordinating team working to the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development which reports to the Taoiseach.  The consultation process will include local representatives, State agencies operating in the area, voluntary bodies and the local community.  During this process it will, of course, be possible to consider whether there are areas adjacent to the designated areas which it would be sensible to include.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern in this matter, and it is precisely for this reason that the Government chose the approach of designating the broad areas and then, through a process of local consultation, deciding on the boundaries.  The areas of County Sligo adjoining those already designated will be considered before final decisions are taken on the boundaries.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the targeting of areas is just one element of the local development programme.  Through Leader and the county enterprise boards all areas will benefit from the process.  The disadvantaged areas element is not, however, a nationwide programme.  It is designated to focus specific measures on the areas of highest deprivation so that these areas can more effectively use and benefit from mainstream developmental activities.  The Deputy must appreciate, therefore, that the number of areas must be limited in terms of the resources being made available for these measures.</P>
    <P>A second aspect of the consultation process is to decide on the most appropriate <Col N="520" /> type of partnership structure to put in place in each area.  The practical operational requirements will be taken into account and will be influential.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that the boundaries for all newly designed areas will be agreed before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht teacht isteach agus éisteacht leis an rud atá a rá agam ar an cheist tábhachtach seo.  I look forward to his reply.</P>
      <P>Our last exchange in the House took place on the day of the tragic ferry sinking in Castletownbere.  Obviously this sad event was on my mind in wording this question but my constituency of Dublin North also has a ferry service, albeit an irregular one, to Lambay Island from Rogerstown.  Because the island is now severely depopulated the ferry service is not as regular as it used to be.</P>
      <P>Many other ferries operate daily and the safety of each vessel is critical to normal life for many coastal and inland waterway communities.  The Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, is an important measure to ensure safety at sea but my concern, which I am sure is shared by many others, is that the necessary resources do not seem to have been provided to ensure its full effectiveness.  How many of our ferries remain unlicensed since the Act was passed two years ago and what amount of money has been spent in pursuing the owners of such ferries to ensure they comply with all the regulations?  What resources and staff have been assigned to this task?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the licence issue, the provision of a lifeboat service is also critical to many ferry users.  I understand, for instance, that there is no RNLI station within a reasonable range of Castletownbere and I ask the Minister to take <Col N="521" /> this into account in his plans.  It is odd that a town of the size and importance of Castletownbere does not maintain a lifeboat service.</P>
    <P>The incidence of such tragedies raises many questions on how safety can be improved.  Some people in Cork have told me they are quite surprised that tragedy has been avoided in the past, given the often precarious arrangements which exist for ferrying people and goods.  They referred also to experience in other parts of the country.  It is important to allay the fears of people, particular those depending on tourism, and tourists themselves.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, bhí ráité an t-am deireannach gur cuireadh ceisteanna faoin tubaist i mBaile Chaisleáin Bhéara go raibh níos mó cúnaimh ar fáil do bháid farrantóireachta na Gaeltachta ná mar a bhí sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

    <P>Impím ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta é sin a rá go soiléir agus impím ar an Rialtas é a chur i bhfeidhm mar tá a fhios agam go bhfuil gach duine, is cuma cén teanga a labhrann siad, chomh brónach céanna de bharr na tubaiste seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sargent for sharing his time with me on this important matter.</P>
      <P>I must impress on the Minister the necessity for treating non-Irish speaking islands in the same manner with regard to grants for the provision of ferry services as Irish speaking islands.  Whether it be an Irish speaking island or not, it is surrounded by water which causes the same hardships for islanders who have to travel to and from the mainland.  The playing pitch will have to be levelled as far as the treatment of those categories of islands is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that huge funding has been provided by the European Union for islands off Scotland and that the United Kingdom Government succeeded <Col N="522" /> in getting such funding.  I understand the Spaniards have succeeded in getting huge funding for a special air service from the mainland to the Canary Islands.  The French and Portugese, received special allocations of European funding to improve ferry services to islands off their coast.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to endeavour to obtain the necessary funding to upgrade the standard of ferry services to all islands off our coast.  If such an initiative saved one life only it would be worth the expenditure.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his kindness in travelling to Castletownbere immediately following the recent tragedy there. I know he will do his best to alleviate the problem if at all posible.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Sargent as ucht an cheist seo a chur os comhair an Tí. Seo an tarna huair gur pléadh an cheist anseo.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Sargent and to my old pal, Deputy Sheehan, who has seriously concerned himself with fishing and fisheries within the short period I have been responsible for this portfolio, for raising the matter.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Sargent correctly pointed out, the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, for the first time, introduced a requirement that vessels carrying not more than 12 passengers be assessed and licensed whereas, prior to 1992, that requirement applied to vessels carrying in excess of 12 passengers.  Therefore, it will be seen that the Act constituted a vast improvement on the position that had obtained up to then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sargent asked about the number of vessels licensed and I wish to inform him that since 1992, 156 ferries in both categories operating around our coast have been assessed and licensed. Prior to licensing each vessel must be surveyed by the Department's marine survey office for sea-worthiness, including stability and construction standards as well as compliance with the relevant life-saving and fire-fighting standards.  An <Col N="523" /> additional 60 small ferries have been surveyed and licences will be issued when the deficiencies and shortcomings have been rectified.</P>
    <P>Following on the tragic accident in Castletownbere Harbour on 24 February last I instructed that the operation of small ferries be comprehensively reviewed.  The tragedy there was that the ferry that went under was not licensed &mdash; the <i>Misneach</i>, the regular ferry, was being surveyed at the time.  Like other Members I should like to convey my sympathy to the traumatised community and the families of the victims.  The review I requested will concentrate on compliance with and enforcement of the law.  The review will determine also whether existing safety requirements need to be enhanced particularly in relation to the carriage and loading of vehicles, livestock and other cargo.  Local and other agencies, notably harbour masters and the Garda Síochána, have been asked to assist by checking and reporting immediately on any services operating within their local areas which are unlicensed or are operating in any way in contravention of licensing requirements, conditions and safety standards.  This reporting arrangement will be continuous.</P>
    <P>Other agencies with specialised local knowledge such as the regional fisheries boards, local authorities, the Commissioners of Irish Lights and regional tourist boards are being asked to assist the Department in identifying and targeting non-compliance with licensing requirements, conditions and safety standards.</P>
    <P>Other steps which have been or are being taken include the names of licensed operators issued to the media and around the country as part of a strategy to bring community and media pressure on previously unlicensed operators to comply. In addition, the Garda Síochána will be asked to intensify enforcement of the existing law.</P>
    <P>The marine safety awareness campaign for 1994, <i>inter alia,</i> will focus on compliance with licensing requirements, conditions and safety standards on small <Col N="524" /> ferries.  The inter-departmental islands committee, being chaired by my Department, has been requested to consider and advise, as a matter of urgency, on all possible aspects, including funding, of access transport to our offshore islands and the measures necessary to ensure their safer operation.  Furthermore, standards for the carriage of vehicles, livestock and other cargo on all coastal ferries are being assessed with a view to enhancing them, as necessary, and the existing manpower resources of the Marine Survey Office are being reviewed.  Deputy Sargent put his finger on a very important point, that of resources, the availability of which is being examined.  The responsibilities of the Marine Survey Office are wide-ranging, covering all aspects of maritime safety, including cross-channel ro-ro ferries, conventional cargo ships and container services as well as coastal ferries and fishing vessels.</P>
    <P>I assure the House I will spare no effort to ensure that the best possible standards apply and are enforced on all ferries operating in the service of local communities around our coast and to protect the safety of those who utilise those services for work or for pleasure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter.  The decision of the Minister and his Department to allow approximately 100 head of cattle of unknown status be moved from the pound near Ballinagh in County Cavan to a private farmyard in north Dublin is hard to understand. Those cattle, many of them in-calf heifers, were part of a herd in County Donegal which I understand is restricted under TB regulations.  They were removed by Donegal county sheriff with the intention of sending them to a meat plant for slaughter but finished up in the council pound in Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Monday, 28 February I informed the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and his Department, of the anxieties of farmers in the Cavan-Monaghan <Col N="525" /> region and on Thursday, 3 March I discovered the sheriff, on behalf of National Irish Bank, had been facilitated by the Department in moving these cattle to north Dublin.  How can the Minister justify this action when I or any other farmer would not be allowed move even one animal from a closed TB or brucellosis herd until that herd had cleared at least two tests other than to an export meat plant for slaughter?  It is disappointing that the Department took this action against the best interests of disease control and those of a Donegal farming family.  It represented a big change from the day this House was recalled to help the Goodman group against a number of banks for the sake of jobs in the meat industry, something my party supported.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to test these animals on this farm in Dublin?  Can he give this herd a new herd number and give these animals a clear status regardless of the standard of the original herd? Does the Minister realise how much hardship is suffered by many farm families resulting from their adhering to the rules laid down by his Department and officials?</P>
    <P>Proper regulations should be adhered to.  Many farmers experience enormous difficulty in obtaining separate herd numbers for their sons or daughters who live on separate holdings in order to benefit from the quotas and premia available under the European Union regime.  They have great difficulty also in getting payments if they make the smallest mistake when filling in a complicated form.  For the sake of the industry and the unfortunate animals concerned they should be sent back to their herd of origin where they can be housed, looked after and tested under the supervision of the Donegal sheriff or whoever he or the court decide.  It is unfortunate that so many herds are at risk.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about candidates being parachuted into the different parties.  I am sure the farmers of County Dublin are scared of 100 animals being parachuted into their area.  They are being forced to go through unnecessary herd tests and it is unknown what could <Col N="526" /> happen if the slurry or waste from the housing of these cattle is not properly dealt with.  I cannot help thinking that it may be even more difficult to draw down EU funding for TB eradication if this type of action by the Department is allowed to continue.  I ask the Minister to treat this issue very seriously.</P>
    <P>Ordinary farmers are going to extraordinary lengths to contain disease.  The Minister allowed the movement of a herd from Donegal to the west, then to a pound in Cavan and from there to the middle of many farm families in County Dublin.  They do not know what happened to them or what the consequences will be.  What steps will the Minister take to ensure that those farm families do not lose their livelihood?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this question is that under the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes, restriction control measures are put into effect following the disclosure of reactor animals in a herd as a result of a test.  The holding on which the reactor herd is located is restricted on foot of a notice issued by a veterinary inspector.  Following the application of the appropriate testing regime to the herd, so that all the animals in the herd then test clear, the herd is derestricted on the basis of a formal herd derestriction notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided that animals move in compliance with animal health regulations, the matter of their movement is a matter of commerce and trade.  Thus, animals from clear herds which are pre-movement tested may be freely moved to a mart for sale.  Animals not pre-movement tested may move on foot of a permit from one location to another.  A herdowner or person in charge requests the permit, and on the basis that the proposed movement is in accordance with the animal health regulations, a permit is issued.  The permit is not a direction by the Department to move animals, it is essentially a document to facilitate the movement of animals from one location to another. <Col N="527" /> It is important that this point is clearly understood.</P>
    <P>The movement of all reactor animals can only be by means of a movement permit issued by officials of my Department. Following the disclosure of reactor animals, the policy is to have such animals removed quickly to a registered meat export plant.  To maximise the effectiveness of control under the animal health regulations reactor animals are specially ear punched and a visible additional tag is applied so that when moving under permit, the animals are clearly identifiable as reactors to minimise the risk of mixing with clear animals.</P>
    <P>Under certain and specific conditions a herdowner whose herd remains restricted may be facilitated to purchase replacement stock on the basis of permission given by a veterinary inspector.  Also, animals in a restricted herd which are not reactors may be moved on foot of a permit to slaughter at a meat plan or, for other reasons, to another secure holding. However, the critical point is that this holding then falls under the restriction control applicable in respect of the original holding from which the animals were moved.</P>
    <P>In regard to the case referred to by the Deputy, while the animals adverted to were from a restricted herd, they were not reactor animals.  The restriction which applied to the original holding has been carried to the holding in County Dublin.  The movement was at all stages under permit by and with the permission of my Department in accordance with animal health regulations.  Permits were requested by the person in charge of the animals and permits were issued in accordance with the normal procedure. The procedures that applied in this case were similar to those that would have applied in any other.  These animals were moved in accordance with the animal health regulations.  My Department did not direct or request that the animals be moved.  In other words the movement of animals is and always has been a strictly private matter when the regulations are complied with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> I understand this is a sensitive case because of a dispute between a herdowner and a lending institution. However, the role of my department should not be misrepresented; we are not party to this dispute.  The role of my Department was to respond to a legitimate request for permits to move certain animals, and to issue these permits in accordance with the regulations.</P>
    <P>The permitting of animals under the animal health regulations is strictly enforced and herdowners are obliged to comply as a condition for the securing of payment of the appropriate reactor grants, with other grants including depopulation grants and income supplement. The movement of any animal into or out of a restricted herd without the permission of a veterinary inspector at the district veterinary office would be viewed in a most serious light.  Any such movement would, of course, be illegal and could give rise to prosecution under the bovine TB and brucellosis orders.</P>
    <P>Given the very substantial cost of the eradication programmes in terms of the contribution by farmers and the Exchequer alike, movement control of diseased animals by means of a movement permit is accepted as being a fundamental requirement in the control and limitation of the spread of disease. Because of the very obvious risk to clear herds and, in consequence, to herdowners' livelihoods, herdowners accept the inconvenience and need for strict movement permit control and have a creditable compliance reputation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Currently my Department is developing a computerised animal movement permit project which will enhance the precision and effectiveness of the present permit arrangement and which is designed to expedite the processing and payment of headage premia.  The system will facilitate rapid trace-back to sources of disease and will be a powerful new resource to assist the reduction of the low but chronic incidence of bovine TB in particular.</P>

      <P>Deputy Theresa Ahearn gave me notice of her intention to raise the matter of the closure of St. Joseph's college secondary school, Cahir, County Tipperary, leaving 120 students without secondary education from July 1994, and the proposals for the continuation of secondary education for the students involved and for the future employment of the present staff.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Brian O'Shea, will reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to ask your guidance in regard to whom I would address this matter in view of the fact that no representative from the Department of Education is present, which I regret.  Nevertheless, I assure the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, that if he has the answer I wish for this evening, the people of Cahir will be only too willing to receive it from somebody in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>The announcement that St. Joseph's college, Cahir, is to close in July has caused consternation in the town and the surrounding communities.  There is sadness and regret that a school which served the students of the Cahir area so well has to close.  It means that 120 second level students will be out on the street unless alternative accommodation is found urgently.  There is a degree of uncertainty and alarm among students, parents and teachers as to what their future holds. They need to be reassured immediately that second level education for boys will be provided in Cahir town next September so as to prevent a haemorrhage of students leaving Cahir for other centres. Unless this reassurance is given immediately, and I mean tonight, parents are likely to begin making alternative arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the staff of St. Joseph's college in Cahir who are making desperate efforts to search for a new building to ensure they and their students can continue their educational relationship <Col N="530" /> until the new community college comes on stream.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to state her role and responsibility in ensuring secondary education for the students in St. Joseph's. I would welcome a commitment from her to provide the necessary finance and resources to ensure an alternative building can be provided.</P>
    <P>The college has a history of excellent results paving bright and successful futures for its students.  I ask the Minister to allow this great partnership to continue until the new community college is opened.  Accommodation will be found if the Department is prepared to fund any necessary rent or alterations.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's response will end the worry, uncertainty and insecurity of parents, students and teachers and that she will state that the students will be able to continue their education in an alternative building in September.  It is vital that this assurance is given to the parents otherwise there will be a haemorrhage of students from Cahir. Once they take up accommodation in other centres it will be difficult to get them back to the Cahir area.  I hope to be able to assure everyone in Cahir that the Department will fund any rent or necessary alterations to suitable accommodation which may be proposed to the Department.</P>

      <P>I have a particular interest in St. Joseph's as one of my sons went to school there.  When I was notified by the principal and teachers of the need to close the school for safety reasons I immediately notified the Minister.  I told her that although the school would form part of the new community college, the construction of which will begin in 1995, alternative accommodation would have to be found in the interim to ensure the students would not be dissipated to other schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A list of alternative accommodation was submitted to the Minister and she said she will keep in touch with the parents and teachers.  I have no doubt that the Minister will respond positively when suitable accommodation is found. <Col N="531" /> The Minister is committed to the concept of a new community college in Cahir.</P>

    <P>Each of the school buildings is in poor condition and in need of replacement or extensive upgrading.</P>
    <P>In the early eighties new building projects were sanctioned for the convent school and the vocational school.  Subsequently in January 1985, following unsuccessful attempts to reach agreement on a single school development, it was decided that two new schools would be provided in Cahir, a vocational school and a co-educational secondary school, subject to the agreement of the two secondary school managements.  Such an agreement was not forthcoming and in July 1985 the Minister agreed that the planning of the new Mercy Secondary School should proceed as originally sanctioned.</P>
    <P>In the context of the renewed emphasis on rationalisation, the Department raised again with the managements the question of a single school for Cahir. Following prolonged discussions at local level, agreement was reached in 1989 on the provision of a single post-primary <Col N="532" /> school for the centre.  Agreement was also reached that the amalgamated school should be a community college under the aegis of County Tipperary (SR) Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>As is the case with all such major building projects the numbers to be provided for in the proposed new school in Cahir were reviewed on a number of occasions since 1989.  In the light of the latest information on demographic trends it is proposed to plan the school for 800 pupils in the long-term.  Architectural planning of the new school is at stage 4.  The project is included in the list of building projects which it is hoped will commence construction in 1995 and 1996.</P>
    <P>In the interim since 1989 the condition of all three school buildings in Cahir deteriorated further.  Essential repairs were carried out to the secondary and vocational schools to enable them to continue to function adequately pending the provision of the new school building.  In the case of St. Joseph's College the outlay which would be involved in bringing the school buildings up to an acceptable standard for insurance purposes etc. was prohibitive. In the circumstances the management authorities decided to close the school with effect from July 1994 and notified the Department accordingly on 6 February 1994.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be assured that sufficient places will be made available for the students of St. Joseph's college next September.  A number of options for the provision of alternative accommodation are being examined in the Department in consultation with local school managements.</P>
    <P>The staff of St. Joseph's college consists of a principal and seven permanent teachers.  Discussions will take place shortly with the interested parties on the position of the teachers currently serving in the school.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 March 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 30 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>Statistics relating to petitions are maintained by reference to petitions finalised rather than to petitions received or the fines involved.  Information which is readily available is set out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  Details of sums actually remitted under the petitions procedure are not extracted from court records for statistical purposes and could only be obtained by undue expenditure of staff time and effort over a protracted period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that it is misleading to <Col N="350" /> suggest that a loss of revenue to the Exchequer automatically arises as a result of the mitigation of fines under the petitions procedure.  The fact that a fine is imposed does not mean that the Exchequer is assured of receiving payment of the sum involved.  In fact, given that the basis on which most fines are reduced is the petitioner's inability to pay, one certainly cannot assert that reduction of the fine causes loss to the Exchequer.  Every court order for the payment of a fine recognises that the fine may not be paid and provides an alternative penalty in default of payment. In many cases the alternative penalty provided by the court in default of payment of the fine is committal to prison I would remind the Deputy that the cost to the Exchequer of maintaining a prisoner is £700 a week or £38,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>I should like to add a few general points about petitions.  The petitions procedure is the exercise of clemency by the Minister for Justice under section 23 (3) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, and delegated authority of Government dated 30 March 1951.  This power to commute or remit penalties imposed by the courts is not as extensive as may be generally believed.  Civil cases are excluded and there is no power to mitigate costs, expenses or compensation awarded by the courts or to intervene in the matter of community service orders, disqualifications from driving or endorsement of driving licences or in cases which are <i>sub judice</i>.  Neither are petitions considered in cases where power of mitigation is conferred by legislation on other authorities, such as the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Any person is entitled to petition penalties which come within the scope of the petitions procedure, either on his or her own behalf or on behalf of another.  Each case is considered on its merits having regard to the basis of petition, offence involved and penalty imposed.</P>
    <P>Consideration is primarily given to any circumstances which might warrant mitigation and which, for one reason or another, was not made known to the <Col N="351" /> court or which could not have been taken into account by the judge in fixing the penalty, for example, where a mandatory penalty is prescribed by law, or which arose subsequent to the court hearing.  In the majority of cases the decision to exercise clemency is taken on humanitarian grounds as an alternative to the imprisonment of the defendant in default of payment of the fines imposed by the court.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied from my experience of operating the procedure over the past year or so that it is a simple and straight-forward mechanism which enables a penalty to be varied, where appropriate, to take account of a defendant's current <Col N="352" /> domestic and financial circumstances.  I am also satisfied that I and my predecessors have operated the procedure in a responsible and compassionate manner.</P>
    <P>I should like to state clearly that the petitions procedure is not an alternative to the court system in that it has no function in determining the guilt or innocence of a defendant or the appropriateness or otherwise of penalties imposed by the court in the light of the evidence presented at the hearing.  Such matters are properly the subject for appeal to a higher court and petitioners are usually advised to that effect, especially in the former case because there is no power to remove convictions under the petitions procedure.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the prisoners concerned, who were dealt with in the Special Criminal Court, have been convicted of very serious offences, many of them having a subversive motivation. The main difference in the regime for those prisoners, compared to prisoners in other closed institutions, lies in <Col N="353" /> the high level of security which applies to them.  They are also subject to more stringent conditions in regard to occasional paroles and early releases.  As an offset to the stringency of security requirements they are allowed a measure of freedom in relation to choice of activities within the cell-block which may not apply in other closed institutions but the differences are relatively minor.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 17 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that I have received a submission from the Ballina Urban District Council in relation to the need for a new Garda station in Ballina.  However, to date I have not received a submission from the Garda representative bodies.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are no plans at present to provide a new station at Ballina as accommodation in the existing station is considered to be adequate for the foreseeable future.  In recent years two Garda houses have been converted for use as part of the Garda station proper.  Shower and toilet facilities have been upgraded and a number of rooms have been decorated.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the situation at Ballina is under ongoing review and the possible need for further refurbishment works will be considered later this year having regard to the availability of finance.</P>

      <P>The format of identification parades, and the manner in which they are held are procedural matters for the Garda authorities, and are not governed by any positive rule of law or practice of general application.  A point worth mentioning is that there is an obligation to explain to the suspect that he or she is <Col N="355" /> not required to take part in the process. No inference may be drawn from the faulure to take part.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive guidelines on the procedures to be followed have been prepared by the Garda authorities and have been circulated to each member of the force.</P>
      <P>The procedures which are followed by the Garda in relation to identification parades are the same in all cases, including those involving persons who are suspected of sexual offences.</P>
      <P>The overriding consideration in any identification procedure is to exclude any suspicion of unfairness or the risk of erroneous identification, and to make sure the witnesses' ability to recognise the suspect has been fairly and adequately tested.</P>
      <P>However, the Garda authorities are also aware that it is important that the witness in an identification parade, who like the suspect is under no obligation to take part in the procedure, is given every help and support in what for some people can be quite a traumatic experience.</P>
      <P>The fact that the inherent fairness of the procedure followed at the identification parade is among the matters which may be questioned by the defence in the course of the trial provides a powerful incentive to ensure that proper procedures are observed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 26 together.  If I could be satisfied that imprisoning female offenders was not necessary and that there was an effective alternative available, I would be only too glad to adopt it.  The simple fact of the matter is that for some female offenders the courts find it impossible to impose other than a custodial sanction.  I do not believe that any amount of study will demonstrate other than that prison, in some cases, is unavoidable.</P>
      <P>I am referring here not just to women offenders who commit very serious offences, for example, murder and armed robbery for whom society would expect a custodial sanction, but also a varied core of women offenders for whom alternatives have not worked.  These include, for example, serious drug addicts who persist in crime to feed the drug habit or offenders who persist in crime anyway regardless of the leniency already shown to them by the courts.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt, of course, that many of the women who end up in prison have been seriously disadvantaged or deprived, abused or exploited.  That is why I am determined that the new women's prison will be designed and organised with an ambiance, activities and facilities which will give them maximum help to cope with their disadvantage and every assistance and encouragement to lead them to a more constructive life-style.  The first step in this process has been my establishment of an expert Steering Committee to advise me on the best options to take in relation to the design of the women's prison and I look forward to a stage where I can be satisfied that the prison will meet the high standards I am setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ceed with construction of a new women's prison, I am also determined to promote alternatives to custody to the maximum for women and male offenders alike. These include greater recourse to probation, supervision and Community Services <Col N="357" /> Orders, and the promotion and development of hostel-type treatment.  I am, in fact, considering the provision of a new hostel in conjunction with the construction of the new women's prison.  This hostel would be geared towards women offenders who showed that they did not need a custodial setting but yet required an organised environment in which to prepare for full return to the community. The Deputy will also be aware of my support for the &ldquo;New Opportunity for Women&rdquo; (NOW) project under which a specialist training and education centre will be set up in the community for the benefit of women offenders.  The project is being supported by European Union funds.  It represents a very positive development in the overall treatment approach to women who come in conflict with the law and in a way, will complement the development of the new prison.</P>

      <P>On a daily basis about 2,200 persons are in custody in our prisons.  Prisoner numbers of this order create ongoing pressure on available custodial accommodation, facilities and services for prisoners.  However, continuous progress is being made on a programme to provide additional accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years a new institution, which accommodates 320 persons, was provided at Wheatfield, and a new health care unit at Mountjoy which accommodates 57 persons was also opened.  The Deputy will be aware that as part of the comprehensive law and order package I announced last December, 210 additional prison spaces will be provided at a total estimated cost of £25 million. 150 of these spaces will cater for male offenders.  The remaining 60 additional <Col N="358" /> spaces will be provided by way of a selfcontained facility for 60 female offenders which will be designed specifically to meet their special needs.  I am satisfied that with these additions to the prison system sufficient places will continue to be available for serious offenders for whom no other alternative would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>I expect shortly to publish a five year plan-policy document for the prison system which will contain detailed proposals for a long term strategy in relation to a wide range of issues, including those of accommodation and custody alternatives.</P>

      <P>Serious disturbances in prisons are very much the exception rather than the rule.  This is due to the combined effect of professionalism on the part of prison staff and, let it be said also, the general common sense appreciation on the part of the vast majority of offenders that the difficulties and misunderstandings which arise from time to time in all prisons are best resolved by discussion.</P>
      <P>I have received a full report on the circumstances which arose in the Women's Prison in Mountjoy on 11 February. I think the better course, now, would be to confine myself to making just three points.  The first is that a situation which had the potential to cause injury and distress to offenders and staff alike was brought to a conclusion without injury to either.  Second, it is standard practice, following a disturbance, to examine all of the circumstances which gave rise to the incident and to take any lessons that may have emerged fully on board.  Third, it would be wrong to leave unchallenged the implication in the Deputy's questions that there are issues &mdash; or that there were issues in this instance &mdash; which could or would not be addressed without resort to a disruption of good order in the prison.  Matters that cause concern to offenders are resolved day in day out by means of discussion and that is as it should be.</P>

These include close liaison and co-operation between the Garda authorities, Bord Fáilte and <Col N="363" /> other tourist interests, deployment of additional gardaí in areas frequented by tourists and the provision and distribution of information leaflets containing advice on protecting property and belongings, etc.  In addition, the topic is covered extensively in Garda in-service training courses.  Gardaí are encouraged to avail themselves of language training courses.  The Garda office in O'Connell Street serves as a centre for advising tourists to Dublin on preventative measures which they can take.</P>
      <P>These are not once off measures designed to respond to a particular situation at a particular time but represent a comprehensive set of measures designed to ensure an effective, long term response to the problem.  For this reason the measures taken are kept under regular review.  In addition, I am informed by the Garda authorities that any other measures which are considered necessary to deal with the problem will be implemented.</P>
      <P>A new initiative in the area of crimes against tourists has been the decision to establish a tourist assistance service in the Dublin area which will be operated by the Irish Association for Victim Support &mdash; IAVS.  This new concept is being modelled on the existing Amsterdam tourist assistance service and will provide tourists who have been the victims of crime with a practical support service in order to assist them in overcoming the initial trauma of their experiences.  The Garda Síochána have been involved in setting up this service and will be providing premises for its operation.  I understand that the necessary arrangements for the establishment of this service are well advanced.  I expect that the new service will commence in April.  I am confident that it will prove to be of immense benefit to visitors to this country who suffer the misfortune of becoming victims of criminal activity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>What was at issue in the debates on the Criminal Procedure Bill, 1993 was whether a definition setting out the effect of a pardon should be inserted in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In that regard I am satisfied that there is no need to define by statute the legal effect of a pardon.  Apart from constitutional or other considerations involved, a definition would be unnecessary since, under existing procedures, pardons can be worded in such a way as to achieve for practical purposes the same effect as a definition.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in respect of the period mentioned.  The small claims procedure pilot scheme was in operation for a period of two years from 10 December 1991 to 7 December 1993 and statistical information is available regarding the applications received during that time.  I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate that information in the Official Report.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> As part of my plans to publicise the small claims procedure, I held a press reception in Galway on 6 December 1993 to announce the nationwide launch of the scheme.  This resulted in coverage in the national press, television and radio in <Col N="366" /> addition to some local radio and newspapers. I also have plans for the placement of advertisements in national and local newspapers during the coming months.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that statistics are not compiled in a way that would provide the information sought, and that to obtain the information would require the expenditure of an unwarranted amount of Garda time and resources.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy, however, that the Garda authorities are committed to the rigorous and onging enforcement of the road traffic laws, especially those relating to serious offences such as speeding. For my part, I am determined that the Gardaí are in a position to take full advantage of modern technological developments to assist them in this vital area of law enforcement.</P>
      <P>The use of in-car video units, for instance, has proved most successful elsewhere in Europe in combating speeding and, today, 16 such units are in operation with the Garda Traffic Corps.  These video units allow the Garda to film breaches of the speed limits as they occur and record the actual speed of the vehicle in question on screen.  The film can then be played in court to facilitate prosecution. In addition to the video units, 307 hand-held radar units are used by gardaí throughout the State.</P>
      <P>This has translated into a most effective level of enforcement.  I note from the Garda Commissioner's Annual Report for 1992 (the last year for which figures are available) that there were 30,327 prosecutions for speeding during that year.  This averages out at over 580 prosecutions for speeding every week of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 52 together.  Deputies will be aware that the law and order package, costing £66 million over three years, which I announced in December 1993 is directed towards specific projects and developments in the law and order field. It is intended to improve the capacity of the Garda Síochána to deal with crime, to finance measures to help the prison system to cope with higher numbers being committed to custody and to expand the court system.  All of these measures were suggested following examination and research of deficiencies requiring correction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financing of academic criminological research is a separate issue. Many specific research projects have been carried out into particular aspects of the criminal justice system, including the prison system, in recent years and my Department is constantly looking at ways of improving research.  I would like to highlight three developments.  First, senior officials of my Department recently met with the Director of the Central Statistics Office to consider how criminal justice data can be more closely co-ordinated and interlinked.  Following that meeting it has been decided to set up a special study group to examine the matter in more detail and report back to me.  Second, and in the context of my ongoing review of the prison system, I intend to consider the possibility of developing within my Department a specific research resource for the prison system.  Finally, in so far as the Garda Síochána is concerned, I would like to remind the House of the decision to set up a Research Unit, in line with the recommendation in the Walsh Committee report comprising a Head of <Col N="369" /> Research, civilian researchers and Garda researchers.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that on 31 January 1994 at the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, a young man was sentenced to three years imprisonment, with 16 months suspended, when he pleaded guilty to assault, occasioning actual bodily harm to Mr. Séamus Braid.  The death of Mr. Braid was throughly investigated by the Garda authorities and a large number of witnesses were interviewed and statements taken.  A file on the matter was prepared and submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who decided on the appropriate charges and against whom they should be preferred. The Deputy will appreciate the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions in these matters.  I should, however, state that a total of ten witnesses, including the accused, stated during the Garda investigation that the assault on Mr. Braid was carried out by one person only.  Despite Garda appeals in the media for further witnesses not a single person has come forward to suggest that someone, other than the accused, was involved in the assault.</P>
      <P>I am aware that during the course of the trial a number of points arose which gave rise to suggestions that somebody other than the accused might also have been involved in the assault on Mr. Braid.  These matters were dealt with in court and I could not, having regard to the independence of the trial Judge and the courts, pass any comment on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> The position is that the Garda have confirmed to me that they have no evidence at all that the assault on Mr. Braid was carried out by more than one person.</P>

The estimates are taken from the CSO's annual macroeconomic estimates of agricultural output, input and income. They represent the total amounts available to remunerate farmers, members of their families and other agricultural producers for their labour and management input and to cover interest on borrowed capital.  Thus interest payments on borrowings for productive purposes are not deducted in arriving at this measure.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Section 8 (4) (a) of the National Archives Act, 1986, the Department of Foreign Affairs has withheld 16 files from public inspection in the National Archives on the grounds that their release would be contrary to the public interest.  The Department's policy has been to keep to the absolute minimum the number of files withheld in this category.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (4) (b) and (c) of the Act further provides that, subject to certification, departmental records which</P>
      <P>(b)  would or might constitute a breach of statutory duty, or a breach of good faith on the ground that they contain information supplied in confidence, or</P>
      <P>(c)  would or might cause distress or danger to living persons on the ground that they contain information about individuals, or would or might be likely to lead to an action for damages for defamation</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>may also be withheld from public inspection. Under these provisions the Department's <Col N="373" /> approach has been to withhold as a general category, all personnel and consular files which relate to individual members of staff or the public.  The number of individual files, particularly in the consular category over the period since the Department was established is substantial and runs to an estimated total of around 40,000.  In the case of files in these categories, however, the Department has been willing to re-examine any files in which researchers express a particular interest, with a view to de-restriction wherever possible.</P>
    <P>The foregoing is the position in relation to the number of files withheld.  In so far as the Deputy in his question seeks information on the number of individual documents, as distinct from files containing documents, I regret that the precise information sought is not readily available and compiling data, particularly in relation to the various personnel and consular files, would involve an inordinate amount of staff time.</P>

    <P>(¹)Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown are to some extent estimated.  The figures <Col N="374" /> shown in the table are the tax paid by full-time farmers together with estimated tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits.</P>
    <P>(²) Of the £82 million amount paid in 1988, some £38 million was a once-off payment of tax arrears under the tax amnesty.  In effect, the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; yield in 1988 was £44 million.</P>
    <P>(³) The yield in 1991 from farmers was reduced by the once-off effect of deferring payment of the balances of 1990-91 tax from 1991 to 1992. Ordinarily these balances would have been paid in 1991 but were deferred to 1992 as a transitional effect of introducing the Current Year Basis of assessment for self-employed persons in 1990. The yield from farmers in 1991 was further reduced because of a decrease in farming profits.</P>
    <P>The figures given in the answer do not include the PAYE tax paid on employment income earned by farmers or their spouses.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and it is not distinguishable until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have been analysed.  An analysis of the returns for the income tax years 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91, the latest available, indicates that the following amounts of tax were paid by farmers, including trader-farmers, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for those years:</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a payment of residential <Col N="380" /> property tax is accompanied by a self-assessed return which contains, among other details, the name and address of the relevant taxpayer.  While this information is known to the Revenue Commissioners on an individual case basis, statistics are not recorded in such a manner as would enable the proportions requested by the Deputy to be provided. However, the Revenue Commissioners have recently examined 400 residential property tax returns from the 14,797 residential property taxpayers in 1993. About three-quarters of these live in Dublin.  It must be stressed that this was a very limited sample.  It should be noted also that the value threshold in 1993 was £91,000.</P>

      <i>Notes on Table</i>
    </P>
    <P>(1)  The numbers provided for other self-employed include proprietary directors.  Proprietary directors, while formally taxed under the PAYE system, are akin to the self-employed and should be taken into account when analysing the income distribution of the self-employed sector generally.</P>
    <P>(2)  The income definition used is &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; which is the income from all sources before adjustments are made in respect of capital allowances, qualifying expenditure and personal allowances and reliefs.</P>
    <P>(3)  As the farming profits of trader-farmers cannot be distinguished from their other income, this group is included with the other self-employed in the table.</P>
    <P>(4)  The income distribution of full-time farmers is not yet available for years after 1990-91 and these cases are included instead with other self-employed.</P>
    <P>The apparent fall in the overall numbers of full-time farmers between 1989-90 and 1990-91 is due to an increase in the number of cases who, because their incomes were too low to attract a tax liability, were notified by inspectors of taxes that tax returns were not required until their position was further reviewed.</P>

    <P>Since 1986, my Department has produced three annual reports covering the years 1985-86, 1987-88 and 1989-91 which were published in 1987, 1989 and 1992 respectively.  An annual statistical report for each year since 1986 has also been published.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has commissioned a number of studies and reports on various aspects of the social welfare system, including information technology strategies, which were for internal use only and which were not intended for publication by the Department.</P>
    <P>Currently, my Department has commissioned two reports from the Economic and Social Research Institute.  One of these reports concerns the identification of factors which are associated with short or long term poverty, based on the 1987 survey of poverty and income distribution which was carried out by the institute.  The Department has also been involved with the institute in the development of a computer-based system to model the tax liabilities and social welfare entitlements of households and the institute is preparing a report which outlines certain results from this in relation to the family income supplement scheme. It is anticipated that both reports will be available in 1994.</P>

      <P>The free electricity allowance scheme operated by my Department is available only to people who are in receipt of welfare type pensions and who satisfy the living alone condition attached to the scheme.  The scheme was essentially designed for elderly or disabled people living alone with a view to encouraging them to live at home.  Approximately 185,000 people receive the allowance at present at an annual cost of about £25 million.</P>
      <P>Any extension of the allowance to long term unemployed people would have to be considered in the context of the overall objectives of the scheme and would give rise to significant additional costs which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I am aware that particular concern has been expressed about the level of drug activity in certain parts of Dublin.  I have met with the Garda authorities to discuss the matter and recently visited the Meath Street area with the Assistant Garda Commissioner with responsibility for the DMA, to see at first hand the problems in the locality.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that in Dublin there is a number of small groups involved in the drugs scene and that these are the subject of surveillance and their activities are closely monitored in co-operation with law enforcement agencies abroad.  This co-operation has resulted in a number of important seizures.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>The age profile of the prison population, both male and female, is one of many statistical aspects of the penal system which are monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department.  The annual reports for prisons and places of detention contain a number of statistical tables on this subject.  Instances of elderly women receiving custodial sentences are quite rare.  It is a fact that, in several cases, the particular offence which may have resulted in a woman's sentence may be relatively minor.  It is not, however, possible to draw a conclusion about the reasonableness or otherwise of the courts decision in these or any other cases without knowing something about the offender's previous criminal history, the number of times other alternatives have been tried and so on.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, satisfied that prison should be used only as a last resort and that a range of alternatives should be available to the courts to apply in suitable cases.  There are already about 3,500 offenders at any one time, currently on supervision in the community, 850 on Community Service Orders, as an alternative to custody and a significant number of these are female offenders.  I am anxious to extend the use of community based sanctions and this will form part of a five year plan for prisons which I hope to release in the near future.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Registrar of Titles about the application referred to by the Deputy and I am informed that, despite extensive searches in the Land Registry, it has not been possible to trace the application referred to.  The Registrar of Titles has indicated, however, that the Land Registry is experiencing a huge influx of applications for copy file plan maps as a result of the area aid scheme.  Since the beginning of 1994, the level of intake is 100 per cent higher than for the corresponding period last year.  All available staff in Mapping Branch and Records Section of the Land Registry are working overtime at present in an effort to deal with the applications. All applications are being processed in order of receipt and it would be impracticable <Col N="391" /> to deal with any particular application out of turn.</P>
      <P>However, if the applicant referred to in the question can supply information to the Land Registry confirming that he made application on 17 November 1993, the matter will be attended to as quickly as possible.</P>

The deceased person's family was represented at the inquest by a solicitor who cross-examined the gardaí involved and other witnesses in the case.  In addition, the Garda authorities conducted a full investigation into the incident and forwarded the file to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who directed that further proceedings were not warranted.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 88 together.  In the case of companies approved for assistance by IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta, there was a net decline of 359 jobs in the manufacturing sector in 1993.  In the case of companies approved for assistance by IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta, the net number of jobs created in the services sector in 1993 was 952.</P>

      <P>In accordance with an order made under subsection 8(11) of the National Archives Act, personnel and pension case files and related records concerning individual civil and public servants are withheld.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid his 1993 cattle headage grant on 3 March 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was paid 60 per cent advances of his 1993 suckler cow premium on 30 November 1993 and of January-February 1993 special beef premium on 8 February 1994.  A 60 per cent advance of his June 1993 special beef premium will be paid shortly.  Payment of the balances cannot <Col N="408" /> be made to a particular applicant until all applications received from him/her in the course of 1993 have been processed.  This is necessary to ensure compliance with EU regulations covering in particular the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density.  The processing of November 1993 applications means that in most cases payment of the final 40 per cent of premium will not start before late March.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) is the National Authority with responsibility for undertaking measurements of the naturally-occurring radioactive gas, radon.  The average radon concentration in Irish houses is about 60 becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m³) compared with typical outdoor values of about 5 Bq/m³.  Surveys to date indicate that about 4 per cent of houses in Ireland have radon concentrations above the Reference Level of 200 Bq/m³.  This is the radon concentration level above which remedial measures should be considered. While houses with high radon levels are found throughout the country, there is evidence of a greater incidence of such houses in the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>During 1992 a geographically-based national survey, which will run over several years, was initated by the RPII. Radon measurements will be made in over 6,000 homes nationwide and statistical evaluation of the results will allow the percentage of houses above the 200 Bq/m³ Reference Level in each national grid square to be predicted.  All measurements are for a twelve month period and, once completed, will identify any areas at particular risk from indoor radon and allow Planning Authorities to consider what actions might be desirable to limit radon accumulation in new buildings.</P>
      <P>The RPII also offers a radon measurement service for homes at a cost of £15 per house.  Measurements are also taken, on request, in workplaces and schools. The risk associated with exposure to high radon levels is regularly higlighted by the Institute in its reports and press statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Longterm exposure to high radon levels can lead to an increased risk of contracting lung cancer.  Based on current knowledge, it is estimated that lifetime risk of contracting fatal lung cancer as a consequence of exposure to a radon concentration of 200 Bq/m³ ia about 2 per <Col N="411" /> cent or 2 in 100.  In Ireland the underlying lifetime risk of contracting fatal lung cancer is about 3 per cent or 3 in 100. When combined with the additional risk from radon exposure at 200 Bq/m³ this results in a 5 per cent lifetime risk or 5 in 100.  For smokers, the risk is likely to be considerably greater than this, while for a person who has never smoked the risk may be lower.</P>

      <P>The Western Health Board regards the provision of a home for the elderly in Ballinrobe, County Mayo as an important element of their community care programme. Before approval can be given to this development I must take into account the internal priorities of the Western Health Board and competing demands for capital funding from the other health boards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 120, 121 and 122, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 21 February, 1994, the Blood Transfusion Service Board announced its national blood screening programme for Rh Negative blood type women who had received Anti-D Immunoglobulin.</P>
      <P>As of yesterday, the number of women who have been tested for Antibodies for Hepatitis C is 28,788.</P>
      <P>I understand that, while some GPs did not receive their packs until after 22 February 1994, the Blood Transfusion Service Board put these packs in place as quickly as possible and that all GPs have now received the test materials.</P>
      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board has now distributed information packs to all GPs outlining in detail the procedures which are in place to advise, counsel and care for those women who have tested antibody positive for the antibodies to Hepatitis C.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the screening programme set up by the Blood Transfusion Service Board is to screen all women who received Anti-D Immunoglobulin from 1970 to 18 February, 1994.  It is the Board's intention to screen children of women who have tested positive as soon as they have been identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to again encourage all women who <Col N="416" /> received Anti-D Immunoglobulin at any time from 1970 to 18 February, 1994 to come forward for testing under the free Blood Transfusion Service Board National Blood Screening Programme.</P>

      <P>Boards of management of primary schools would be expected to co-operate with parents and members of the public in the provision of information pertaining to primary schools, bearing in mind the rights of the pupils and their parents and the requirements of the Rules for National Schools and the Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure.</P>
      <P>In the post-primary area, my Department has taken several initiatives to promote involvement by parents in the education of their children.  The most recent circular on the matter emphasised the desirability of ensuring that positive and effective communication exists between the parents' representatives on the Board of Management and the Parents' Association attached to a school.</P>
      <P>Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline issued by my Department have recommended that parents be actively encouraged to become involved in the process of drawing up a code of behaviour and discipline.  They state that parents should be kept fully informed from the outset of instances of serious misbehaviour on the part of their children and their co-operation in addressing the problem requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> The recent circular on Selection Procedures for the Enrolment of Pupils in Second-Level Schools stated that it is important that each school should disclose its enrolment policy and the criteria used in selecting pupils for enrolment. Parents will thus be fully informed on the selection procedures and this will help to allay fears of discrimination against their children.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, Boards of Management would be expected to co-operate, as fully as possible, in the provision of information relevant to the education of students.</P>
