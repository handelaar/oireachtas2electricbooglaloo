      <P>Sir, my office has informed the Ceann Comhairle's office that the wording of Question No. 10 in my name has been incorrectly transcribed onto the Order Paper in the General Office.  My question referred to a Sinn Féin councillor who justified punishment beatings, not participated in punishment beatings.  I do not know how that word came to be used as it is not the word I used.  I have checked the text I supplied to the General Office and it contained the word &ldquo;justified&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The IRA ceasefire announcement, ending its campaign <Col N="949" /> from I September, was a truly momentous development, allowing the peoples of Ireland and Britain to emerge from the shadows of violence into a new era of hope.  The announcement of a complete cessation of violence and its definitive commitment to the success of the democratic peace process marked an historic turning point, and in my judgment clearly involved, and was intended to involve on the part of the IRA, a permanent end to the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence.  This judgment has been completely borne out in the subsequent six weeks.  A speedy and pro-active response was necessary to help consolidate the commitments given in the ceasefire statement and thus decisively to advance the peace process.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that many people &mdash; particularly in the Unionist community &mdash; are apprehensive and uncertain about the new era now emerging.  That is very understandable after 25 years of sustained violence and terror.  Violence has diminished trust and deepened the divide between the two traditions in Northern Ireland, as well as between North and South.  The IRA ceasefire announcement challenges us all to start building bridges of trust across our historical antagonisms, accepting that each tradition holds an indispensable part of the solution.</P>
      <P>My decision, along with Mr. John Hume, MEP, to meet with Mr. Gerry Adams six days after the ceasefire announcement was guided by the absolute conviction that, in the IRA statement, the Republican movement was acknowledging a full and unequivocal commitment to the democratic peace process, and stating in a binding way that it would not attempt any further to resolve problems or remedy injustices by the use of force.  Developments since 1 September strongly vindicate that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint statement issued by myself, Mr. Hume and Mr. Adams at our meeting on 6 September is of great significance.  In it, the leader of Sinn Féin joins <Col N="950" /> us in giving a total and absolute commitment to democratic methods of resolving our political problems.  He commits his party to our shared objective of an equitable and lasting agreement that can command the allegiance of all.  Furthermore, there is a clear and unequivocal acknowledgement that the problem cannot be resolved without the participation and agreement of the Unionist people.</P>
    <P>These clearly stated commitments, when taken in conjunction with the IRA ceasefire announcement, constitute a tremendous breakthrough for everyone on this island.  The cessation of violence is for real, it is for good.  The statement issued by IRA prisoners in the Maze on 9 September confirms that the ceasefire will hold &ldquo;in all circumstances&rdquo;.  Further statements made by the Sinn Féin leadership lend even greater authority to that commitment.</P>
    <P>The recent spate of so-called punishment beatings in both communities are indefensible acts.  Such acts of brutality add an unnecessary negative dimension to our collective efforts towards advancement of the peace process by damaging public confidence.  The problems and structure of policing is an issue that will have to be addressed at an early stage so that full public confidence in a regular policing system be established in all areas.  Our concerns in that regard have been made known to Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>We now need to build on the IRA cessation of violence.  A complete peace naturally demands a similar action by all paramilitary groups.  In that regard, the Tánaiste and I are encouraged that loyalist paramilitaries are engaged in a process of deliberation with a view to calling a ceasefire.  Time and space may be required by them before a definitive decision is reached but, in the meantime, violent attacks, of which there have been a number right up to the present, should cease forthwith.  No understandable purpose can be served by a continuation.  The use of force as an instrument of change is outdated and counter-productive to the advancement <Col N="951" /> of any political objective.  The Downing Street Declaration removed any justification for violence, either loyalist or republican.</P>
    <P>An atmosphere of complete peace would facilitate a gradual process of demilitarisation and the safe and permanent disposal of weapons and explosives held by paramilitary organisations on all sides, so that they can never be used again.  Our security forces have had great success in recent years in locating and destroying weaponry for use by paramilitary organisations, and these efforts will continue.</P>
    <P>An onerous responsibility rests on all to grasp the unique opportunity which now exists to reach political agreement in an environment of peace.  The two Governments are well advanced in our efforts to formulate a joint framework document that would constitute our shared understanding on the broad outlines of a settlement.  It is our intention that these discussions will be finalised in advance of my next meeting with the British Prime Minister which will take place over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I would like to reassure both communities that the purpose of this document is to assist a subsequent all-party talks process.  Our approach is guided by the fundamental reality that an eventual political settlement will require the participation, agreement and consent of both traditions.  The two Governments have made that position very clear.  The British Prime Minister stated on 16 September that any new agreement would be put to a referendum in the North.  For our part, the Tánaiste and I have stated in the Programme for a Partnership Government that &ldquo;since the final outcome of such negotiations will need to be acceptable to the people North and South, we will seek endorsement in a referendum for an agreed package&rdquo;.  I want to repeat that commitment here today.  Concurrent referendums.  North and South, on any substantial new agreement follow logically from the Downing Street Declaration, which speaks of giving effect to <Col N="952" /> any measure of agreement on future relationships in Ireland which the people living in Ireland may themselves freely so determine without external impediment.  The undertakings given in that regard should provide both traditions with the necessary reassurance in terms of their shared political future.</P>
    <P>An ongoing review of progress in the joint framework document discussions features prominently in my contacts with John Major, including at our meeting in the margins of the European Council meeting in Corfu at the end of June.  In view of the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved, I do not propose to bring into the public domain any aspect of the ongoing discussions on the document in advance of intergovernmental agreement being reached.</P>
    <P>I repeat that a constitutional balance is essential if the necessary allegiance of each tradition to an eventual agreement is to be secured.  The assurance to Unionists on Northern Ireland's constitutional status being conditional upon majority consent there, needs to be balanced by a reformulation of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, to reflect agreement that the wishes of the people are paramount, and by a strong all-Ireland institutional dimension to accommodate not just the Nationalist identity, but also the practical needs of both communities and both parts of Ireland to give effect to the European Single Market on this island.  In short, an agreed settlement demands the achievement of a balance between the two sets of rights, allegiances and aspirations and the establishment of common interests and positions between them.</P>
    <P>With flexibility on all sides, the Tánaiste and I are confident that through a process of democratic dialogue and persuasion, conducted in an atmosphere of peace and goodwill, we can and will agree a new political accommodation founded on consent and respect for difference.  In our search for agreement, we can all take heart <Col N="953" /> from the many obstacles already overcome.  The prospect of an Ireland at peace with its historic diversities is now within reach, but we all need to work hard in a spirit of generosity to achieve that goal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's opinion that the IRA is continuing to engage in punishment beatings in parts of his island?  Does he consider that punishment beatings represent paramilitary violence and is he aware that such parliamilitary violence continued after the cessation of violence was announced by the IRA?  When the Taoiseach met the leader of Sinn Féin did he ask him about punishment beatings?  Did the Taoiseach say he believed these should stop?  Did he ask Mr. Adams to use his influence with the IRA &mdash; and undoubtedly he has influence with the IRA regardless of whether he is a member of it &mdash; to bring these punishment beatings to an end?  In particular, did the Taoiseach raise with Mr. Adams the fact that a Sinn Féin councillor, Mr. Alex Maskey, sought specifically to justify punishment beatings?  I draw attention to the fact that these punishment beatings occur with the use of an iron bar and people's legs are being broken.  These are not simply bar room brawls, we are talking about people being admitted to hospital with their legs broken as a result of punishment beatings administered apparently by the IRA, an organisation which we are asked to believe has ceased support for violence.  Is this use of punishment beatings in Nationalist areas reconcilable with the commitment to non-violence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The punishment beatings to which Deputy Bruton referred came to our notice subsequent to the meeting with Mr. Hume and Mr. Adams but I have made my position abundantly <Col N="954" /> clear to Sinn Féin and indeed I have said it publicly also.  I strongly disapprove of any such beatings which run counter to all our efforts to establish confidence in the peace process.  I have made that position abundantly clear publicly and indeed to Sinn Féin and on my next meeting, whenever that occurs. I will certainly again raise the matter fully with Mr. Adams.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement that the punishment beatings are indefensible acts but when did the Taoiseach specifically tell Sinn Féin that they are unacceptable?  Will the Taoiseach tell the House what response, if any, he received from Mr. Adams or any member of Sinn Féin to the statement that punishment beatings are unacceptable?  Will the Taoiseach agree that it is not acceptable for Sinn Féin to participate in any democratic forum when it is prepared to engage in punishment beatings to terrorise members of the Nationalist population while, at the same time, further undermining the confidence of the Unionist population?</P>

      <P>What response did the Taoiseach receive from Sinn Féin regarding punishment beatings? Has it given a commitment to use its influence with the IRA to have these beatings stopped?  Will he impress on it the need to lift the threats of expulsion which have resulted in many young people being expelled not only from <Col N="955" /> their homes but from Ireland, and forced to live abroad?  Will the Taoiseach indicate when the deferred Anglo-Irish summit will take place and if it is expected that the framework document will be ready by the end of this month, as reported?</P>

      <P>The intention is that negotiations on the framework document will be completed before we fix a definitive date for the meeting between the British Prime Minister, John Major, and myself.  I have not received any response to our condemnation of the punishments referred to, but I will be glad to make Deputies aware of it when I receive it.  I will take every opportunity to condemn them because they are indefensible acts.  I have made inquiries about expulsions and to the best of my knowledge &mdash; I do not say this is 100 per cent accurate &mdash; there is no evidence of such.  However, if the Deputy has evidence of expulsions I would like to hear from him and would make the same strong representations regarding them. During the course of my inquiries I came across cases of people who were expelled from particular areas but who are now back in those areas and on whom there is no pressure to leave again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed that concern to the Prime Minister, John Major. when I spoke to him on the telephone. He is committed to the objective to which we are committed that violence ceases for ever.  I explained to him that we believe the process should be consolidated and underpinned at the earliest possible moment because if a vacuum is allowed develop it could endanger the peace process.  We do not want that to happen.  I will be in touch with the Prime Minister again.  I expect <Col N="956" /> to receive a letter from him today setting out his views to which I will respond before the end of the week and will make the point Deputy Harney is making to me, which is that the time has now come, in the sixth week of peace, to accelerate the response of the British Government to ensure we are all seen to underpin the peace process.  The British Government should exert whatever pressure it can to ensure a cessation of violence by loyalist paramilitaries.</P>

Has the Taoiseach asked Mr. Adams if Sinn Féin accepts that in a referendum on both sides of the Border on a joint settlement, either side has the right to say either &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to an agreed settlement?  Has he discerned whether Sinn Féin accepts the right of the electorate of Northern Ireland or of the Republic to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The Government, as I stated many times in the House, is clearly and absolutely committed to the consent principle.  The Deputy should be well aware of that.  It is our continuing position.</P>
      <P>At my first meeting with Gerry Adams I raised the prospect of the destruction of arms in due course and he said that was a matter that would have to be addressed in talks, but that we only see one set of paramilitaries cease violence and the next step is for the loyalists to cease violence.  The destruction of arms is a matter for talks down the line, as indicated by the Tánaiste.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if he expects the framework document to be ready by the end of this month or when will it be completed?  I welcome the fact that we have had six weeks of freedom from IRA shootings and bombings.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if he has made any attempt to talk to Unionist politicians with a view to encouraging the cessation of violence by loyalist paramilitaries? Clearly, that is a necessary prerequisite to serious progress being made.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach asked me for evidence regarding expulsions.  The organisation, Families Against Intimidation and Terror, informs me that people are still prevented by the IRA from returning to their homes.

    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> I agree with the Deputy that the next stage must be a cessation of violence by loyalist paramilitaries.  No one should be under any illusion that the road to consolidating the peace process will be simple and straightforward.  We will encounter difficulties along the way.  We have a new opportunity, a new hope for the future and a new expectation. Things are changing in both communities in Northern Ireland but things are happening which we would like to think would not happen.  We will have to recognise what is going on and try to get it out of the way.  It will not be easy or straightforward but the prize at the end of the day is worth striving for.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach must have misheard my earlier question.  I did not ask him if the Government supported the consent principle, as I know it does.  I asked him if Sinn Féin supports it and if he has been able to so discern in his discussions with that organisation.  Will the package to be put in a referendum to people on both sides of the Border include an amendment to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution? Will the establishment of the joint bodies, with executive authority, on an all-Ireland basis require an amendment to the Constitution in that they will trench on the authority of Dáil Éireann by way of their brief including accountability to a body not accountable to Dáil Éireann, namely a Northern Ireland assembly of some kind?  Is it not likely that the final package put to the people on this side of the Border will involve three separate referenda on the same day, one on the package as a whole, another on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and another on the joint bodies in so far as they trench on the authority of the Dáil and Seanad?</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton is trying to jump ahead of himself and everyone else.  For obvious reasons, as I made clear in my reply, these are sensitive issues that must be dealt with between the two Governments in the first instance and between all parties in the <Col N="959" /> second instance.  Consequently, it is not my intention to debate every aspect of every proposal put forward during the talks on the framework document or during the talks between the two Governments to finalise the document. I hope the Deputy appreciates this point.</P>
      <P>In regard to his question about the position of Sinn Féin.  Deputy Bruton is well aware of the proposed terms of reference for the forum.  I see these issues being properly addressed within the forum, and that is where we intend to address them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already made clear, I raised that issue at our first meeting, which was not very long. Many issues had to be discussed at that meeting and I raised that issue.  As I have said, the next obvious step is a cessation of military operations by the loyalist paramilitaries.  The question of the destruction of armaments can then be discussed between the security forces on both sides.  The British Government has to engage in discussions with Sinn Féin, which it has said it will do after a period, and this is one of the questions which will have to be addressed in these discussions.  I have made it clear that the destruction of armaments will have to be on the agenda down the line, but we have to take it step by step; this is a step by step process.  We are all aware of the number of arms held and if the peace process is to be consolidated for all time then the destruction of these arms must be addressed.</P>

If there is a potential problem in regard to, for example, the authority of the Dáil <i>vis-a-vis</i> an all-Ireland body with executive authority, the time to ask questions is now, not afterwards.  Will the Taoiseach agree that on occasion the legal advisers to the Government got themselves into some difficulty because they did not anticipate constitutional problems before the event and waited until afterwards?  Will he further agree that in raising questions about these so-called long term issues the Opposition is serving a useful democratic propose and deserves an answer?</P>

      <P>Recognising that all of us have obviously to exercise a degree of sensitivity in regard to the current situation, will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the principle of consent, which all parties in this House and in the British Parliament have accepted, has not been accepted by Sinn Féin in <Col N="961" /> those terms?  It has explicitly rejected the Downing Street Joint Declaration and we should not pretend otherwise, although there is a necessity to engage it in dialogue to try to convince it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not lay down an absolute condition that every aspect, line and word of the Downing Street Joint Declaration had to be accepted before entry into the forum for peace and reconciliation.  If every issue was answered and cleared up there would be no need for a forum.  The forum is the proper place for consultations and debate to take place between parties.  I have also made it clear at every opportunity that entry into the forum will not in any way interfere with the principles, commitments, psychology or policy of any party.  Let us have a genuine forum where we can address all the problems which need to be addressed and which are dividing the two communities in the North.  Parts of the Downing Street Joint Declaration clearly pose problems for some people and they can seek to resolve these within the forum.</P>
      <P>With regard to coercing the Unionist population into a united Ireland, Sinn Féin has made in clear on a number of occasions that it will not use coercion as an instrument to force people into a united Ireland.  The statement issued after the meeting between John Hume, Gerry Adams and me should be studied very closely.  It states that the problems cannot be resolved without the involvement and agreement of the Unionist population.  Many statements need to be closely scrutinised.  The forum for peace and reconciliation is being set up to do a particular job and issues such as the ones raised here can be fully discussed in the forum.</P>

      <P>At various times the Taoiseach and others have used the <Col N="962" /> terms &ldquo;demilitarisation&rdquo;.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House what that term means to him and what it demands of all parties, including the British parties, in terms of timing and substance?  I gather that there is continuing evidence of racketeering and intimidation in the North.  Does the Taoiseach believe that a continuation of racketeering in Northern Ireland has the support of the leadership of the republican and loyalist elements?  Yesterday the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, made a remark to the effect that the British Government may never be in a position to say that it accepts the IRA cease-fire is permanent.  That remark seems odd and out of context. What is the Taoiseach's reaction to it?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If this is an example of Deputy O'Keeffe's definition of brief I would not like him to ask me a long question.  In regard to his final question, during my last telephone conversation with him John Major assured me that every day brought him closer to acceptance of the real position about the cessation of military operations and he would not delay a decision by the British Government any longer than necessary.  He also pointed out the importance &mdash; we all recognise the need for this &mdash; of having the confidence of the British people and Unionist population in any steps he takes along the road.  I have no doubt that the two of us are heading in the same direction.  Both Governments know where they want to finish and we will arrive there in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I totally deplore any criminal activity and I have no doubt that the security forces in the North will deal with the type of racketeering to which Deputy O'Keeffe referred.  I do not have any substantial evidence that such racketeering is taking place and if it exists I am sure the security forces will take full cognisance of it.  There will always be problems associated with our efforts to consolidate the peace process and we have to deal with each issue as it arises. There is much support on the ground <Col N="963" /> for the peace process and hopefully peace will be achieved at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to ask one of the dozen or so questions I would like to ask the Taoiseach.  When the Taoiseach next meets Gerry Adams, in addition to the matters of immediate importance which he has been urged to raise with him, for example, exclusion orders, enabling people to come back to Northern Ireland and the cessation of punishment beatings, will he ask him if he will make arrangements to inform relatives of the whereabouts of a number of bodies so that they can be returned to them for a Christian burial, thereby enabling personal affairs to be dealt with?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 64, 80, 84 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>I intend to ensure that tourism throughout the island benefits from the achievement of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my direction, my Department has been working in recent months with its counterpart in Northern Ireland to enhance existing co-operation in North-South tourism development.  It was in <Col N="965" /> furtherance of this work that the recent meeting between the director general of Bord Fáilte and the chief executive of the Northern Tourist Board took place. Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board &mdash; at the instigation of its parent Department &mdash; were instructed to work together to devise a programme of new and expanded co-operation marketing initiatives.  I hope to announce progress on these initiatives in the near future.</P>
    <P>Of course, one of the markets with the greatest potential for traffic growth in the new political situation is Britain. I have recently received a proposal from the industry for a special marketing effort in the UK and other European markets in 1995 which would be modelled to some extent on the very successful US marketing initiative.  As I said on many occasions, I am very much in favour of the concept of involving the private sector in a partnership approach to the promotion of Ireland as a tourism destination.  Certainly I will give this proposal very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>It is time now to build on the prospect of a &ldquo;peace dividend&rdquo; and to make a special effort to exploit the rich potential of the British market in the new and exciting circumstances.</P>
    <P>There has already been extensive cross-Border co-operation, including joint promotion overseas, supported by the International Fund for Ireland and the EU INTERREG Programme.  I am confident that both the International Fund and the new INTERREG Programme will continue to be increasingly supportive of new ways and means with which to increase cross-Border tourism.</P>
    <P>As to the question of establishing an umbrella tourist body for both part of the islands, it should be clear &mdash; and if it is not, I now wish to make it so &mdash; that any institutional developments such as an all-Ireland tourism body are entirely a matter for the two Governments and not for the tourist boards.  In this context, the possibility of institutional change, in all its forms, will be considered in the appropriate way at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>While welcoming the positive tone of the Minister's reply I am sure he is aware that at present we benefit from 3 to 4 per cent only of the British tourist market, the same as Portugal and Cyprus.  Therefore, I am sure he will agree that the British tourism market holds vast potential for us.  Will the Minister confirm or refute recent paper reports that there is not a very good relationship between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Tourist Board?  Furthermore, will he confirm if some sections within Bord Fáilte in England refused to distribute the &ldquo;Be Our Guest Guide&rdquo; this year, believing it would give hoteliers in Northern Ireland an unfair advantage?  In addition, will the Minister say what progress is being made on common branding between both parts of this island in that in the past the brand &ldquo;Heritage Island&rdquo; was very successful as was the Gulliver initiative? Will he say whether, at the last meeting between the two chief executives of the respective tourist boards, any progress was made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As Deputy Deenihan said, the percentage of United Kingdom visitors here is approximately 4 per cent.  Therefore, even if we achieved a small percentage increase, it would represent a very large number of new visitors here, which is one benefit which should accrue from the announcement of the cessation of violence by the IRA on 31 August 1994.  Indeed it makes sense that our nearest neighbours should come here and that we should have a greater percentage travelling here than to Portugal or Greece, as the Deputy said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that there have been <Col N="967" /> good relations between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Tourist Board for some time past.  Within my period in office I have met my counterparts in Northern Ireland, as have the people in Bord Fáilte and the Northern Tourist Board continuously, and they co-operated with one another.  I should say that the International Fund for Ireland funded a number of joint tourist marketing efforts abroad which has continued over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the distribution of a particular guide.  I might point out that that was a story attempted to be hawked around this city for some time, which surfaced last week in a certain magazine which specialises in that type of journalism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In regard to the matter of common branding on both parts of the island &mdash; the Deputy gave the example of &ldquo;Heritage Island&rdquo; which has been very successful &mdash; I might say that in recent months, before the announcement of the cessation of violence by the IRA on 31 August last, officials of my Department and their Northern Ireland counterparts met regularly and proposed some very interesting ideas.  A number of such meetings took place between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Tourist Board.  Something on the lines suggested by Deputy Deenihan may come forward but it is too early to predict just yet.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 56, 355 and 356 together.</P>
      <P>I expect to be in a position to respond to the findings of the consultancy review of Bord Fáilte within the next few weeks.  Until then, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on changes, if any, to existing structures.  In July, the consultants were asked to do some further technical work in relation to the review which has recently been completed.  In reply to questions earlier in the year, I said that my disposition was to publish the findings of the consultants and that remains my position.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the consultants adequately canvassed the views of the industry during their work and any criticism in this regard is unwarranted.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that he should decide once and for all the exact future role of Bord <Col N="969" /> Fáilte?  Is he aware of a certain degree of uncertainty within the tourist industry as they are unclear as to the precise future role of Bord Fáilte, bearing in mind also the demoralising effect on Bord Fáilte employees occasioned by the delay in taking decision on their future?  Will the Minister say whether he returned the consultants' report to them following its initial submission to him?</P>

      <P>We received the final report in July.  Since August is a holiday month, we have been considering the consultants' report in recent weeks. Having considered their report I will be outlining my proposals in the next few weeks.  I said on many occasions in this House that we will study the consultants' findings in depth and I will bring forward my proposals having considered them carefully.  Indeed I said to Deputy Deenihan previously that the future of Bord Fáilte employees should not be an issue.  I do not accept for one moment &mdash; in the case of a semi-State agency which has existed for the best part of 60 years &mdash; that the fact that I commissioned an independent study to examine its role should cause unease.  If semi-State agencies were to be established, continue to function over a period of 60 years, independent of the relevant Minister and never be examined, there would be no point in a Minister being responsible.</P>
      <P>All the State agencies have been reviewed during the past number of years.  This consultants' report looked at the role of Bord Fáilte.  I do not accept that there has been any demoralisation, in fact, I find the opposite as many people in Bord Fáilte look to the future with confidence.  Those in the industry who earn a living from tourism are pleased to move forward with the Minister and welcome new ideas.  That is my feeling from travelling around the country.  I am sure Deputy Deenihan, who is in touch with his constituents in north Kerry, will find the same from those involved in the tourist industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister may not agree that the point at issue is the campaign he orchestrated through the media against Bord Fáilte rather than getting consultants to examine its role. Is the Minister aware that Bord Fáilte had its own internal examination of its role?  The point at issue is not so much the consultants' report as the campaign the Minister launched, through the media during the past year, in regard to Bord Fáilte.  I appeal to the Minister, in everybody's interest, to make a decision on the future role of Bord Fáilte as soon as possible because it is hindering preparations for the 1995 season.</P>

      <P>I will be submitting my proposals shortly.  If every State agency could define its own role, more or less on the lines of &ldquo;physician heal thyself&rdquo; there would be no point in having a Minister in any Department.  If all the State agencies could define their own role, independent of Government, we could either do away with the agencies or the Government.  I have not conducted a campaign against Bord Fáilte. I said in other fora that if many of the agencies spent an equal amount of time in doing what they were set up to do rather than promoting themselves we would be an awful lot better.  This applies not only to the agencies under my remit but to all agencies.  Ministers have always found that State agencies spend an inordinate amount of time looking after the promotion of themselves.  I will publish my proposals shortly and I am confident that Irish tourism will be better as a result of this consultant's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>There is a number of significant differences between the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999 and its predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These include: the increased investment targets.  Total investment is forecast at £652 million compared with about £380 million in the last programme.  The EU contribution has more than doubled from about £170 million to £369 million; while all the constituents areas of the programme have secured increased resources, the greater emphasis on marketing in the new programme is evidenced by a trebling of resources.  EU funds for marketing have increased from about £18 million to £15 million; in the capital development area, new features include a specific emphasis on securing large scale projects, on enhancing the tourism angling product, on developing a range of cultural tourism projects and on improving small to medium sized hotels on a selective basis; in training, programmes include the training of early school leavers and the unemployed for a career in the tourism industry, as well as enhancing the skills of those already employed.  The industry may now also seek direct support for tourism training, where suitable courses are not already provided by <Col N="972" /> CERT or the Department of Education, and the arrangements for administering the programme will differ, as described in the following paragraphs.</P>
    <P>As before, the Department of Tourism and Trade will be responsible for the overall management of the operational programme and it will exercise creative and strategic role in fulfilling this task.  Bord Fáilte remains an implementing and operational agency in the areas of product development and marketing in the same way as CERT does for training and Shannon Development for product development in the mid-west.  As was the case with the last programme, these organisations have considerable administrative and technical expertise in the areas involved which should be utilised to represent significant inputs in the decision-making processes.</P>
    <P>Decision-making authority will be exercised on this occasion by separate product development and marketing management boards, which will each comprise up to two relevant agency persons, one official from my Department and three independent business-professional members.  The decision to approve or reject individual applications will be made by the boards alone, who will take into account, <i>inter alia</i>, the advice of Bord Fáilte and other agencies in making their decision.  These management boards, when appointed, will establish their own internal arrangements for processing grant applications.</P>
    <P>These new structures are fully consistent with my approach since becoming Minister for Tourism and Trade of encouraging greater private sector involvement in securing the future of Irish tourism.  They are also consistent with long established and widely respected models used by other agencies, for example, the IDA, in dealing with grant applications and approvals. The idea is to bring some broader practical business and professional experience to the process to augment &mdash; and perhaps even contest &mdash; the limited institutional and tourism-related views which the various organisations alone <Col N="973" /> could bring to bear on the various projects.  Accordingly, by combining equal representation from the public and private sectors, the overall decision-making process will benefit, as will the quality of investment itself.</P>
    <P>All arrangements are of course subject to review in the light of whatever decisions I may take on the AD Little report which examined the role and functions of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the management boards, to which the Minister referred, which henceforth will have a role in deciding individual applications for funding under the EU Operational Programme, be established on a statutory basis and will the necessary legislation come before the House?  If so, the House will have time to debate such a proposal.  If not I would be concerned about the Minister's proposals in regard to management boards because I can foresee other developments.</P>

As I said in my reply, it is better to have a broader range of experience in deciding applications from the specialised tourism sector.  The persons I will be appointing will be renowned in their own right as independent professional business people.  That is in line with what the IDA has done and has worked well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must think I am a bigger fool than I am.  I am astonished at the information he is conveying.  Is it true that this decision is being made to circumvent the provision that existed under the previous operational programme for tourism whereby Bord Fáilte was appointed by the EU Commission to vet and make decisions on the applications which came before it under the programme?  To circumvent that is it true that the Minister in proposing management boards is seeking to put hand picked people appointed by the political master &mdash; presumably himself and the Taoiseach &mdash; in a position where they will make the decisions on the applications.  This will open up the whole area of the distribution, allocation and investment of this substantial sum of money from Brussels to political patronage, something on which this House has to take a stand.  I ask the Minister to stop, rethink and consider bringing forward legislation to set up these boards, if necessary under a statutory instrument of this House, not in the <i>ad hoc</i> manner he proposes which smells of political patronage.</P>

Since then the State scheme has provided cover directly &mdash; without the use of an agent &mdash; only for short-term political risks and medium-term risks.  Under the revised scheme, the Department's practices correspond with the recommendations of the beef tribunal in relation to applications for cover.</P>
      <P>It is my intention in all future cases to seek the consent of the Minister for Finance where cover in excess of £3 million is proposed, as recommended by the tribunal.  No other changes in the operation of the scheme, or otherwise, fall for implementation by me arising from the tribunal recommendations.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, the Minister is saying that the only recommendation of the tribunal he proposes to implement is the last one concerning a ceiling of £3 million, which will be transferred to the Minister for Finance. How does the Minister reconcile that with his commitment and that of the Government to implement all the recommendations on this aspect of Mr. Justice Hamilton's report?  Where does he stand on the question of the requirement stipulated by Mr. Justice Hamilton concerning the sourcing of the product? Can I take it he would agree that a Minister who is negligent enough to insure a product sourced outside this jurisdiction would not be worthy to hold office?  What does the Minister propose to do about that?</P>

      <P>As I tried to explain in my reply and on other occasions <Col N="979" /> when this question was asked, a substantive restructuring of the export credit insurance scheme took place in November and December 1991 under the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley.  The majority of the matters alluded to in Mr. Justice Hamilton's report have been covered by changes which took place at that time and under which I have operated. Regarding the Deputy's specific question &mdash; for fear he might be confused about the Minister for Finance &mdash; Mr. Justice Hamilton's second recommendation states that amounts in excess of £3 million should be approved by the Minister only in consultation and with the specific consent of the Minister for Finance.  We will ensure that recommendation is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of sourcing has become a standard question put to applicants for export credit since November 1991.  The Deputy will recall this happening late last year when we dealt with the question of export credit to Iran in respect of beef exports.  All other matters referred to in Mr. Justice Hamilton's report have been overtaken by events.  Since November 1991 the State is in the business of insuring only against political risks.  I have operated under the changes made in November 1991, but we will take into account the second recommendation of Mr. Justice Hamilton, namely, that the consent of the Minister for Finance should be sought for amounts in excess of £3 million.</P>

In regard to Mr. Justice Hamilton's recommendation concerning the assessment of risk, are there new procedures in place to assess the risk?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case and there is no mystery about it.  When the changes were made in 1991 a press release was issued in which all those matters were alluded to.  Since then countries have been divided into categories and limits set in respect of the amount of risk by an advisory group comprising officials of various Departments.  Apart from the £3 million clause to which I referred, all the other matters have been taken into account and form part of the way the export credit insurance scheme has operated while I have been Minister for Tourism and Trade.  Deputy Rabbitte may have heard the recent criticism that the manner in which the Department operates the scheme is too restrictive, but changes have taken place and account has been taken of all the matters raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that people will be astonished there are not to be any published changes to the regulations covering the scheme since Mr. Justice Hamilton's report and that the only changes are those put into effect when Deputy O'Malley was Minister, before Mr. Justice Hamilton concluded his deliberations.  It is most unsatisfactory if the Minister is satisfied that there should not be published changes to the regulations and I will have to return to the matter on another occasion.</P>

They have been taken into account and are in place in the Department.  Events have overtaken the matters to which Deputy Molloy referred. Mr. Justice Hamilton's second recommendation covering risks in excess of £3 million had not been taken into account and we have now taken it on board. Deputy Molloy was not the Minister responsible for the Department when those changes were made but if he checks with his colleague he will learn that, with the exception of recommendation No. 2 which has now been dealt with, the other recommendations had been accepted before Mr. Justice Hamilton's report of July 1994.</P>

An article by Mr. Colm McDonnell, chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association carries the heading, &ldquo;Export Credit Insurance &mdash; Beware of Excessive Zeal&rdquo;.  He says that the United Kingdom has gone on the attack in respect of export credit insurance and intends to increase its exposure to £3.2 billion by 1995.  Mr. McDonnell says that we are too restrictive in regard to export credit insurance.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;regarding export credit insurance.  It is a matter of debate whether the State should be responsible for export credit insurance.  The British Government is using it as an aggressive political tool to sell UK exports abroad and it has a very high exposure at present.  During my term as Minister for Tourism and Trade and for some time earlier we operated a selective and restrictive policy and that has been the wish of the majority of Members opposite, but Ministers have been abused for such decisions.  We cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>It is contradictory to make the case for liberal export credit insurance policies like those in the United Kingdom.  For some time our approach has been restrictive and the accusation has been made that it is extremely difficult to secure export credit insurance from my Department.  A balance must be struck between protecting the taxpayer and having export credit insurance policies in place that allow people to export goods.  Striving to achieve that balance has bedevilled previous Ministers.</P>

      <P>The Minister decried the restrictions in the recent operation of the export credit insurance scheme. <Col N="983" /> Does he not agree that those restrictions stem from the fact that the scheme was abused in the past, when the entire portfolio was used up for exporting one product to one country?  Will the Minister indicate his view on Mr. Justice Hamilton's first recommendation conerning whether the application should be made directly to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland or to the Department, having regard to the fact that those exporters who applied to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce managed to get cover and those who applied to the ICI did not?  Will he indicate his attitude to involving the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the matter of dairy and food products, having regard to the fact that when the then Minister, Deputy Burke, took over that portfolio he sought to put in place that matter as it had not been provided for until then?  The then Minister for Agriculture did not take responsibility for the matter and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce seemed happy to keep it that way.  What does the Minister purport to do on that matter?  Is a breakdown still not available of how the portfolio is allocated in respect of products, countries and so on?</P>

      <P>I have not decried the absence of export credit insurance for all markets.  I explained the difficulty which arises from adopting a liberal approach, which creates difficulties and in the long term is an expense on taxpayers, while encouraging exports.  Mr. Colm McDonnell, chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association, makes the point that a more liberal scheme should be adopted and as the Minister responsible I am seeking to strike a balance between the liberal expansion of the scheme and the restrictions in place now.  On Deputy Rabbitte's point in respect of Mr. Justice Hamilton's first recommendation, as a result of the Government's decision of November 1991 applications for political risk cover are now made only to the Department <Col N="984" /> of Tourism and Trade.  We are no longer in the business of short term commercial risk insurance and, consequently, a differentiation does not apply.</P>

      <P>Let us take a simple case.  If an exporter wants export credit insurance for a transaction in connection with a commercial risk, he goes to an insurance company inside or outside the State &mdash; some companies are going outside the State to insurance companies in the UK, France and other places. The Minister for Tourism and Trade no longer underwrites policy having to do with commercial risk. An exporter can go to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and get cover in the normal way as thousands do.</P>

The recommendations made by Mr. Justice Hamilton, apart from No. 2 which I have now implemented, have already been taken on board and were announced in a press release on foot of the report of independent consultants which was commissioned earlier that year.

Is the Minister telling the House that the No. 2 account, the socalled national interest account, the purpose of which was to cover products <Col N="986" /> being exported from this country for which no commercial insurance was available in the marketplace, has been terminated?  Is he saying that the recent insurance for products being exported to Iran is not under the national interest account, and is he saying that he has no intention of renewing the national interest account along the lines mentioned by Deputy Deenihan where political risk is deemed to be involved?  I do not believe it is common knowledge that the No. 2 account has been shut down.</P>

Deputy O'Malley did not keep them a secret.  He got a report, he announced a Government decision and published it and all the regulations, which he implemented and which have been implemented since that day.</P>
      <P>In regard to what Deputy Rabbitte said earlier we are somewhat at cross purposes.  There is political risk insurance which operates under very strict criteria since that decision in 1991. Mr. Justice Hamilton's recommendation No. 2 has now been implemented. I will make available to the Deputy at my office or in correspondence all the changes that were made in 1991 and perhaps that will resolve the matter.  We have been at cross purposes and I would not like to see Deputy Rabbitte getting his blood pressure too high.</P>

      <P>Latest information from the OECD indicates that visitor numbers in the OECD area increased by 5 per cent in 1992 over 1991 and by 1.6 per cent in 1993 over 1992.  The corresponding figures for Ireland show growth of 4.4 per cent. and 4.9 per cent respectively, followed by a 6.6 per cent increase in 1993 over 1992.  Moreover, the indexed growth for Ireland's tourism receipts has exceeded the average for all OECD countries, and OECD European countries, over the last five years.</P>

      <P>I am not sure from what figures the Minister is quoting, but the OECD studies I examined show a lack of growth in the Irish tourism industry in comparison with many other countries throughout the world covered by the OECD studies.  Surely the Minister will accept that tourism is an industry in which enormous levels of growth have been achieved in other countries.  The Minister may be quoting an average to seek to bring down the figure for all countries.  Of the OECD countries included in these studies Ireland does not feature very highly in the level of growth attained in the tourism industry. There is a tendency to pump out figures claiming we are doing exceptionally well but in a world context, certainly in an OECD context, from the studies I looked at recently we are not doing very well.  Surely there is greater potential in the tourism industry than we seem to be achieving.  We spoke earlier about the operational programme and we all hope there will be substantial growth, but looking back on what we have done &mdash; the only comparison we can make is on past achievements, not future expectations &mdash; there seem to be some levels of growth but very small compared to achievements in other countries.</P>

In regard to the figures, according to the famous quotation, there are lies, damn lies and statistics, and it depends on how one reads them. Deputy Molloy read the statistics in one way and I read them in another, but we are talking about the same report.  In the last five years Ireland has shown tourism growth figures in excess of OECD European countries.  However, I would not like to be complacent.  I agree there is considerable potential for increased growth in Irish tourism and we want to get our share of an everincreasing market.</P>

We are not getting a huge proportion of the growth in tourism and that is clearly borne out by the OECD report.</P>

For example, in 1993, we attracted 18,000 Japanese to Ireland whereas Great Britain attracted 468,000 and we attracted 422,000 Americans whereas Great Britain attracted 3,319,000.  We have been performing very well with limited resources, particularly in terms of marketing by Bord Fáilte, but there is major potential for the future.

In the past five years growth in Irish tourism has outperformed that of our competitors.  Statistics look impressive when starting from a low base &mdash; for example, if a person earning £100 a week receives a 20 per cent increase he will get £120 whereas if a person earning £400 a week receives a 20 per cent increase he will get £480.</P>

      <P>The Minister is complacent, particularly regarding statistics &mdash; and their source &mdash; on tourism growth.  Agencies in the mid-west claimed a huge growth in the American market this year, but there is a black hole in these figures because the people did not come to Ennis, they were not to be seen on the streets of Limerick and when I was in Sligo recently I did not see them there.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the announcement in this year's budget of the £100 million small business expansion loan fund, I agreed with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, an allocation of £25 million for tourism projects.  Given the limited resources available and the expectation that demand would greatly exceed supply, it was necessary to focus the scheme on areas where it would be most beneficial in terms of tourism development and job protection and creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully recognise the importance of a vibrant restaurant sector to the overall Irish tourism product.  However, while the sector clearly benefits from tourism growth, it is less dependent on tourism for its survival than many other sectors. Accordingly, I decided that restaurants would not be eligible for assistance under the scheme.  The scheme has made a major contribution to tourism development, one from which the restaurant sector will benefit significantly. <Col N="996" /> Furthermore, as the tourism element of the scheme has been fully subscribed the question of reviewing my decision does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a gregarious character and has been known to dally for a while in restaurants throughout the country.  As I am sure he will appreciate, people have acquired wealth during the years but this has not been reinvested locally.  It would be far more beneficial if people could invest in a local project under the small business expansion scheme to develop the local economy.  I think the Minister would also agree, in terms of his own projections and plans for the development of the tourism industry, that areas remote from metropolitan areas are an attraction in themselves.  An added incentive is the development and expansion of restaurants, particularly seafood restaurants in maritime areas.  Will he, therefore, reconsider his decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to reconsider my decision to exclude restaurants from the small business expansion scheme even if I wanted to as the £25 million allocated to me by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, has been allocated as announced last week by the ICC which acts as agent on my behalf.  The remaining £75 million under the scheme will be allocated to manufacturing industry. Given the small amount of money available we had to focus the scheme on areas where it would be most beneficial in terms of tourism development.  If the number of visitors increases the restaurant sector will benefit more than any other sector.  If I had an unlimited amount of money available I might be in a position to broaden the scheme but we had to focus it and the amount available has been allocated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was also tabled last May.  The Minister, therefore, had many opportunities to include restaurants if he had wanted to do so.  Is he aware that 27,000 people are <Col N="997" /> employed in the restaurant sector? Does he agree that because of the demand for non-hotel restaurants the restaurant sector now plays a vital role in the industry?  If a similar scheme is introduced next year will the Minister consider including it?  It is inexplicable that the Irish Restaurants' Association is not represented on the tourism council.  Some time ago the Minister promised me that he would consider the possibility of allowing it to be represented.  Has he reached a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is the subject of a later question.  The restaurant sector is represented on ITIC, the umbrella body for the tourism industry which has a number of representatives on the tourism council.  The restaurant sector is not represented on the council.  On the question of extending the scheme to include restaurants, as I explained to Deputy Kenny, we had to target the £25 million which has now been allocated.  We have, therefore, no scope to extend the scheme.  If a similar scheme is introduced next year with a similar amount of money I could not see myself being in a position to broaden the criteria.</P>

      <P>The Asia-Pacific region is expected to yield massive tourism and travel business in the future. Bord Fáilte has staff representation in Australia, which also includes coverage of New Zealand.  There is active involvement with the major carriers and travel trade there.  The successful introduction of common-rating fares from <Col N="998" /> Australia has been a major factor in increasing business.  As part of the special tourism promotion and development fund £100,000 was made available to Bord Fáilte for extra promotion of Ireland in Australia.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus are actively working in the Japanese market through one of Japan's leading tour wholesalers.  Another additional £100,000 was allocated to help promote this market.  Singapore, Malaysia and Korea are also being targeted for future growth.

      <P>That is also the subject of a separate question.  I have a limited amount of money available and it is not possible for Bord Fáilte to be represented all over the world.  We have to concentrate on specific markets.  There is growth in tourism from that region. In the past two years we entered a new arrangement with a tour operator in that region and it proved very successful.  In the past three years the number of visitors who came to Ireland directly from Japan more than doubled, admittedly from a small base.  In 1994 in excess of 20,000 will visit this country from Japan.  It will be part of our new strategy to ensure that visitors from Japan to Europe will find themselves in a position to visit Ireland.  We are applying the technique of common fare ratings, the subject of a separate question, to attract the vast numbers who come from that region to Dublin at no extra cost.  With the best will in the world it <Col N="999" /> will not be possible for us to be represented around the globe but there will be growth in tourism from the Asia-Pacific region and many other areas also in the years to come and we have increased our representation there.  I intend to make other changes in the near future.</P>

    <Title>Ireland-Russian Federation Agreement on International Road Transport: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the Russian Federation concerning International Road Transport, copies of which were laid before the Dáil on 7th October, 1994.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to move this motion in this House.  The provisions of the international road transport agreement between Ireland and the Russian Federation are an important element of trade between the two countries.  In broad terms the agreement establishes the conditions under which Irish international hauliers can operate into, out of and in transit through Russia.  Likewise it sets the conditions for Russian hauliers who wish to operate into Ireland.</P>
      <P>Trade between Ireland and the Russian Federation continues to grow and has significant potential for further growth as the Russian Federation makes steady progress towards a market based economy.  Irish exports to Russia totalled almost £60 million in 1993 and reached £24.0 million in the first two months of 1994 alone.  Irish exports from Russia were £25.7 million in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> Revenue and Consultancy has been very satisfactory and many Irish firms and organisations have successfully won contracts in areas such as power, generation, training, agricultural development, transport, aviation, software systems and financial and banking services. The value of contracts won by Irish firms to date exceed 17 million ECU.</P>
    <P>Irish exports to Russia in 1994, which continue to be dominated by food and food products, are likely to significantly exceed the value of 1993 exports.  Last year saw a noticeable increase in exports of Irish clothing worth £10.4 million and computer equipment worth £8.2 million to Russia, and the indications are that exports in these areas will continue to grow this year.  Irish imports from Russia continue to be dominated by raw materials.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta is the biggest Irish investor in the Russian Federation with six joint ventures revolving around its particular expertise with duty free shops. Aer Rianta's operations include duty free shops in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Vyborg on the Russian-Finnish border and retail shops and pubs in Moscow.  I am glad that among the joint ventures being undertaken by Irish companies in Russia there is a transport-warehousing-distribution company operated by one of our most prominent international hauliers.</P>
    <P>Naturally this increase in trade results in an increased need for freight movements.  The agreement concerning international road transport has been negotiated to facilitate such freight transport. Since the agreement was initialled in February 1994 some 33 Russian permits were issued by officials of our Department to Irish hauliers wishing to carry loads directly from Ireland into Moscow.  Each journey is a major undertaking.  Two routes are followed by Irish hauliers, the first being over land via Poland and Belorussia into Moscow and the second is via ferry from Northern Germany into Finland into Russia through Vyborg, St. Petersburg and on to Moscow.  Irish international hauliers <Col N="1356" /> find it worth while to undertake those journeys with sensitive computer systems, certain foodstuffs and beef.</P>
    <P>A most worth while provision of the agreement is the elimination of a road tax previously demanded by the Russian authorities from Irish hauliers.  This road tax was of the order of US $750 per journey and was a significant extra cost on the consignor.</P>
    <P>As indicated earlier the main thrust of this agreement is the facilitating of transport operations between the two countries.  To that end this agreement provides for the following.  Regular transportation of passengers by coach to or through either country by transport operators of the other will be authorised by mutual agreement, with details of routes and schedules exchanged.  Permits, to be exchanged by the contracting administration, will be required for non-regular passenger transportation between the two countries.  A permit will be required for the carriage of goods by road for hire or reward between the two countries and in transit across either country.  A carrier of one country may perform transport operations between the second country and a third country provided any relevant agreements between the second and third country allows such operations. Permits will be issued by the competent authority of one country on behalf of the competent authority of the other country.  Certain transport operations will be exempt from the requirement to hold a permit.  A carrier of one country will not be allowed pick up goods at a point in the other country and set them down elsewhere in that country, cabotage is prohibited.</P>
    <P>There will be a reciprocal exemption from taxes and duties connected with the issue of permits and from vehicle taxes and duties on fuel contained in the standard fuel tanks of a vehicle.  Carriers and drivers of either country must, while in the other country, comply with the laws and regulations in force in that country.  Penalties may be imposed on transport operators who infringe provisions of the agreement and each party <Col N="1357" /> will assist the other in effecting such penalties.  Vehicles from one country will respect any limitations on weights and dimensions or restrictions on routes used which may be imposed by the authorities of the other country.</P>
    <P>The agreement also contains a protocal which lays down detailed rules for the implementation of this bilateral agreement.  I commend this motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to express my disgust at the recent stopover visit by President Yeltsin at Shannon Airport and to state categorically that his actions and behaviour are not consistent with the exemplary mode of conduct one would expect from a Head of State.  It made the Taoiseach, the Ministers and the battery of officialdom associated with that event look rather foolish nationally and internationally, and that is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing aviation matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been particularly distressing for the Taoiseach in view of his enormous efforts to meet the Head of State of the Russian Federation at Shannon.  It was an exceptional effort on the Taoiseach's part when one considers that he could find time only recently to meet the Tánaiste and others associated with Government business at airports, such as the recent fleeting encounter at Baldonnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also appropriate that the Taoiseach should visit Shannon to learn at first hand the difficulties the Shannon region, particularly Shannon Airport, face in future.  He will have been made aware on many occasions that great efforts have been made over the last number of years to improve infrastructure at the airport.  Various requests <Col N="1358" /> have been made to improve the parking area for planes and to upgrade the lighting systems on the runway to facilitate a particular type of aircraft.</P>
    <P>Shannon has been to the fore in attracting significant airline business to the area, particularly from East European and Russian states.  Transit passenger traffic at Shannon Airport was on a downward slide in 1981 because of the high price of aviation fuel, but the former Minister, Paddy Cooney, concluded a barter agreement with Aeroflot.  That is an indication of the type of initial trade and agreements we signed at that time with Russian states, particularly the USSR.  The provision of competitively priced fuel allowed charter companies from many countries to use Shannon Airport.  Business increased from that initiative and allowed Shannon personnel, through Aer Rianta, to set up many duty free facilities in Russia, Ukraine and other East European countries.  I am glad the Minister acknowledged the enormous work carried out by Aer Rianta in developing duty free facilities and significant export business between Ireland and Russia in the past 15 years.</P>
    <P>Aeroflot originally operated flights to friendly socialist countries in South America but following <i>glasnost</i> and the Russian acceptance of the free market the Aeroflot conglomerate broke up.  In spite of the break-up of the airline and clear indications that business was about to fall off at the time, Shannon Airport was allowed to use this development without a clear picture of the future arrangements between Ireland and Russia in the context of the airline. The Irish Government and the Fianna Fáil Minister then responsible, Deputy Séamus Brennan, did not take accommodating action to meet the new position of the declining business.  It is regrettable that Deputy Brennan's successors have made the position worse.</P>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil led Government removed the stopover at Shannon Airport despite the promises made by Fianna Fáil before the last general election.  It also established the Shannon Task Force but we have yet to see its <Col N="1359" /> report.  The introduction of another layer of bureaucracy was announced by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, when he stated he would establish an agency to administer a new fund to market the Shannon area in addition to the existing State agency charged with the responsibility of promoting the region and, in particular, Shannon Airport.  What is required is not another layer of bureaucracy but the granting of additional powers to the existing agencies in the Shannon area to support development.  The Minister is seeking to outgun his Labour Party colleagues in Government by setting up quangos, task forces and committees rather than taking decisive action.  It is regrettable that the Minister should have picked the day of Yeltsin's stopover disaster at Shannon to make a wooly statement on this matter.  Before any difficulties arose, particularly in relation to Aeroflot, he should have made the statement about his intention to visit the Russian Federation to seek to retrieve some of the business that inevitably was going to be lost.  Unfortunately the approach to developments at Shannon Airport has been reactive rather than proactive. Aeroflot has become a major player in the Frankfurt hub at the expense of the Shannon region.  I hope the Minister can make up for lost time by retrieving some of that business lost.</P>
    <P>The Bilateral Road Transport Agreement between Ireland and the Russian Federation is welcome, but it should be extended to include other forms of transport, including aviation, at the earliest possible opportunity.  It is stated that the purpose of the agreement is to facilitate both haulage and passenger operations between Ireland and Russia and to allow transport operators in each country to obtain permits from their transport administration for operations to, from and in transit throughout the other country.  That is a welcome development, but unfortunately for transport operators the competition of the Single Market in the European <Col N="1360" /> Union and the extension of bilateral agreements are more theoretical than practical.  I ask the Minister of State to review the problems experienced by road hauliers throughout the European Union and by Irish hauliers in respect of various member states.  The French authorities are notorious for causing delays to Irish road hauliers travelling through their country and do not operate in the spirit of the various European directives put in place in the context of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a peripheral nation, requires the smooth transfer of goods to the European Union and Eastern European countries, as well as to the Russian Federation.  I am delighted a bilateral agreement will be formally signed this week to ensure the smooth passage of goods transported from Ireland, Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation states.  I hope the Bilateral Transport Agreement between Ireland and the Russian Federation will work smoothly and that, at European Union level, the Minister will air the grievance of Irish road hauliers who travel throughout the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposed establishment of a Bilateral Transport Agreement with the Russian Federation.  I am disappointed that some of the terms of the agreement are restrictive, particularly in regard to a carrier not being allowed to pick up goods at one point in a country and set them down elsewhere in that country.  I do not understand why the Minister agreed to that restriction when he had the opportunity to secure freedom of the market.  Airports and roads have a complementary role to play.  Our country is export-oriented and that explains why main road hauliers are located close to airports.  For that reason I am disappointed the Minister does not propose to introduce bilateral air freedom rights.  The Government has presided over the downgrading of the solid achievements reached between Shannon Airport and Aeroflot.  Because of the hesitant attitude of the Department <Col N="1361" /> of Transport, Energy and Communications the transport business will go downhill.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the increased business Aeroflot has transferred to the Frankfurt hub I would like the Minister to indicate efforts being made by the Government to retrieve the business lost.  The road transport agreement will affect haulage travelling to and from Frankfort Airport.  Will the Minister indicate whether the prohibition on cabotage will affect calls to the Frankfurt hub which is servicing Aeroflot and how Irish hauliers will be affected?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bilateral Transport <Col N="1362" /> Agreement between the Russian Federation and Ireland and I hope its provisions will help to introduce more liberal trading arrangements between both countries and eliminate difficulties in the transport industry.  I hope it will help develop strong trade between both countries and will build on the new relationships Ireland is developing with the Russian Federation.</P>
    <P>The amount of trade Ireland has been doing with Russia shows a balance in our favour and I hope that position will continue.  We are a small country in comparison to the large numbers in the Russian Federation.  At the same time we recognise the exceptional difficulties its government faces in seeking to deal with the massive changes taking place throughout that state, a large territory with a huge population.  It is a critical time in the development of Russia and I hope that democracy will be strengthened, that market trading will bring prosperity to its people and that there will be mutual benefit to Irish and Russian people as a result of such bilateral arrangements.  Will the Minister avail of this opportunity to inform the House about developments at European level in regard to the liberalisation of the heavy road transport market?  I understand Commissioner Oreja expressed disappointment that progress on liberalisation of the heavy road transport market was very slow.  The question of driving hours, lorry weights, and tachographs has still not been resolved. These matters are of importance because lorries, buses and other heavy vehicles operating under this bilateral agreement will be affected by the overall regime of controls on heavy transport vehicles.  I hope we will see much greater progress in liberalising rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>I have read the terms of the bilateral agreement which seems comprehensive. It provides that disputes be settled by mutual agreement, discussion and consultation.  I wish both sides every success and offer a welcome to the Russian Minister who is visiting here this week to sign this agreement.  I hope this is a <Col N="1363" /> sign of continuing development of relationships between our two countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the fact that the Government has chosen to conclude this reciprocal road transport agreement with the Russian Federation almost 20 years after the CSCE Final Act.</P>
      <P>The realignments in Eastern Europe pose both dangers and opportunities.  It is partly the failure to encourage responsible exploitation of the economic opportunities which has led to the political turmoil currently being witnessed in the Russian Federation.  I hope the present agreement will be one of a series of bilateral contacts between Ireland and Russia.  The expansion of trade between our two countries builds on the foundation laid by Aer Rianta in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  The present agreement offers a wide range of opportunities for Irish exporters as well for hauliers and coach tour operators, opportunities which I hope the Government and its agencies will augment by seeking further niche opportunities for both goods and service exporters as well as expanding tourism between Ireland and Russia and encouraging technology transfer.  It is a matter of regret that President Yeltsin's recent indisposition prevented such matters being discussed at the highest level.  It is to be hoped that the return visit by the Taoiseach will take place in more propitious circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis for such co-operation on a wide range of matters has already been laid at EU level, not only with Russia but with countries of Eastern Europe in general.  During the past few years the value of Irish exports to Russia has, with some intermissions, climbed steadily while changes to the COMECON regulations had further boosted the opportunities for trade, especially in the previous restricted field of information technology.  In recent years around 200 Irish companies have explored the opportunities offered by a new and <Col N="1364" /> expanding market which is likely to grow in both volume and diversity over the coming years.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister will comment on whether the figures he gave in his introductory address concerning the performance of exports for the first two months of this year are likely to be continued for the remainder of the year.  It seems that they would more than double our performance of last year if they were to be maintained at the rate of £24 million which the Minister gives for the first two months of this year.</P>
    <P>Although welcoming the agreement, I am concerned about some practical aspects.  For example, Article 8 stipulates that transport operations covered by the agreement can be performed by carriers licensed to carry out international transport operations in conformity with the internal legislation of their own country.  It seems that the widespread breakdown of civil society following the collapse of the Soviet Union makes Russian licensing procedures less than reliable, and I am concerned that Article 8 could endanger Irish road users and could be an imposition on Irish road hauliers.  By the same token I would have preferred a stipulation that only international rather than national drivers' licences be accepted within the terms of the agreement.  I would also have welcomed restrictions on live animal transport at a time when such transport is being wound down.  While such agreements generally conform to a basic blueprint, there is a case to be made for varying the terms according to specific conditions in the other contracting country.</P>
    <P>I welcome this bilateral agreement.  It is not contentious and I hope it will lead to an enhancement of trade between the two countries.  Certainly the trade position as it stands, although relatively modest, is nonetheless definitely biased in favour of this country.  I hope that trend continues and that this bilateral agreement makes some small contribution towards that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade (Mr. N. Treacy) Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade (Mr. N. Treacy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank all Deputies for their very constructive contributions.  I reiterate that this agreement is an important element in our trade with the Russian Federation and I can confirm that our Department is currently negotiating similar bilateral agreements with other East European countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and Latvia.  We hope to be in a position to start discussions on international road transport with other emerging East European states next year.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased with the response by our international haulage sector, which has risen to the challenge of carrying freight into the Russian Federation.  Each journey is an arduous undertaking which is not without its hazards, not least the poor road infrastructure and often freezing conditions. International haulage generally is a growth area.  I am glad to say that Irish hauliers are fully participating in that growth.  There are now over 1,800 Irish hauliers with international licences, the highest ever on record.  This sector plays an important role in the continuing export drive.  As an island nation with an open economy foreign trade is essential if we are to continue to generate wealth and sustain jobs.</P>
      <P>Access to markets in the European Union is regulated by community authorisations.  Some 1,800 Irish internationally licensed hauliers are in possession of Community authorisations and have unlimited multilateral access to the hauliers in each member state of the union.</P>
      <P>I stress the need for Irish hauliers to remain within the law in all respects, whether in the case of road traffic laws, weight requirements or techograph legislation.  Compliance with the laws and regulations of each member state should ensure that delays are avoided. Deputy Hogan referred to that matter earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Carey referred to the lack of cabotage in this agreement.  There is no country that allows cabotage to operate <Col N="1366" /> internally.  One cannot have an international haulier go into another country, pick up goods in that country and set them down within that country.  That does not happen anywhere in the world, and rightly, because it would distort the market and put people out of business. The European Union is looking at this question to see if it would be feasible to have a totally open transport market whereby people could operate in any part of the Union at any given time.  In so far as we can, we have ensured that any changes in European legislation or in European directives do not mitigate against the progress being made by Irish hauliers across Europe and in all parts of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister sure about that statement that no country in the world allows cabotage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the information available to me and I have never found it anywhere in my 15 months dealing with the situation.</P>
      <P>A professional, efficient and competitive road haulage sector is of critical importance to our success as a trading nation.  As an essential auxiliary to the productive arm of our economy Irish hauliers deserve our full support.  Ensuring that Irish international hauliers have access to haulage markets in the developing Eastern European countries is also of vital importance.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Irish haulage sector, who are a dedicated, professional and committed group.  Without their professionalism and dedication and the services they provide we could not continue with the annual increase in exports in recent years.  The fact that they service all the industries, move goods out of the country rapidly and bring raw materials back is of vital importance to growth in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement with the Russian Federation is part of this whole development and I am delighted we have concluded it, it will be signed this week.  I <Col N="1367" /> was in Moscow last St. Patrick's weekend and was very impressed by the investment being made there by Irish companies, particularly Aer Rianta. Some people who went there to work for that company have gone into business on their own.  There is tremendous rapport and co-operation between the Russian and Irish authorities.  There is a very positive climate of economic development and training between both countries and this can be expanded and developed.  Aer Rianta is a flagship organisation which has done tremendous work for Ireland in many parts of the world, particularly Russia.  It has built up tremendous relationships with all the Russian authorities.  I again commend this motion to the House for its acceptance.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, and the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, came into effect on 1 January 1993, bringing into existence on that date 12 new statutory based institutions.  This legislation has done a number of very important things: it has defined the memberships and functions of the colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology; it provides for the roles of governing bodies; it has established the post of director as chief executive in all of the regional technical colleges and <Col N="1368" /> the post of president as chief executive in the Dublin Institute of Technology; it has provided for the establishment of an academic council in each of the institutions with clearly defined functions; it has established all staff as employees of the particular institution, and it has allowed for the drawing up of programmes and budgets on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The Bills before the House are aimed at addressing difficulties which have arisen in the appointment of governing bodies to the colleges and the institute, which were not contemplated when the Acts were drafted and passed in 1992. Before outlining the specific issues which the Bill deals with, it is worth recalling at this point the development of the regional technical colleges from the time of their establishment in the 1970s under the vocational education committees to their foundation on a statutory basis as autonomous higher education institutions from January 1993.</P>
    <P>The early 1960s saw the publication of the reports <i>Investment in Education</i> and <i>The Training of Technicians in Ireland.</i> A steering committee was set up to advise the then Minister for Education on the provision of technical education.  This committee's report in 1969 formed the basis for the establishment in the 1970s of most of these colleges. The report related the colleges to economic growth both nationally and in their own particular regions.  In their continuing adaptation over a period of almost 25 years since then the colleges have continued to stimulate demand for skills which the economy needs.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology can trace the development of technical and technological education in Dublin to much earlier times &mdash; from the Artisans' Exhibition in Earlsfort Terrace in 1885, through the opening of the Kevin Street College in 1887 and the Rathmines Technical Institute in 1902, to the association with the School of Music in 1904, the opening of the Parnell Square College in 1906 and the Bolton Street Institute in 1911.  The link <Col N="1369" /> with the University of Dublin in 1975 for the conferring of degree awards was another important milestone.  In 1978 the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee established the Dublin Institute of Technology on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to ensure better co-ordination of the work of its third level colleges.</P>
    <P>The growth in this sector in this period has been very marked.  In the period since 1980, whole-time student numbers in the regional technical colleges have risen from 6,500 to 25,000, an increase of almost 300 per cent.  In the same period the enrolment of whole-time students in the colleges which form the Dublin Institute of Technology has risen from 4,000 to 10,062, an increase of 150 per cent.</P>
    <P>The 1992 legislation, since coming into effect, provides new opportunities for the sector to broaden its range of activities and to branch into new spheres of development.  Activities such as applied industry-supported research, technology transfer, services to regional industry, industrial training, product development technology centres and new industry incubation are now an ever-increasing feature of the sector.</P>
    <P>In general the structures of the regional technical colleges have been strengthened by the appointment of senior managers as registrars and secretary &mdash; financial controllers.  These are supplemented by support and ancillary staff who are concentrated in the finance, personnel, industrial liaison and student support areas.  In the Dublin Institute of Technology, a number of senior management appointments have been made to strengthen the areas of finance, personnel and student support services.  A fully fledged administrative and academic structure is currently being developed by the institute.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, national and indeed EU initiatives point to a number of developments in higher education. These include participation and access, partnerships, continuing education and international links.  The regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of <Col N="1370" /> Technology have a major contribution to make in all these areas.</P>
    <P>In the case of participation and access the colleges and the institute have been major instruments in broadening educational opportunity and access.  They provide national and regional access to courses at a wide variety of levels matching closely the abilities and ambitions of students.  They have developed co-operatively transfer possibilities to higher studies on a large scale and also provide a programme of professionally oriented part-time education and industrial training.  The success of the Tallaght college in the context of access and participation of the local community is the most recent testimony to this.</P>
    <P>In forming partnerships with economic life the colleges and the institute are working with national and international development agencies.  New industry incubation, co-operation with and assistance to indigenous industry and the attraction to the regions of investment in development are and will continue to be major functions of the sector.  Whether through associated technology parks or through tourism courses and the services sector, the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology will be significant regional and national contributors and will provide support for community and rural development projects.  They will also contribute to technology up-dating in the education sector generally.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing demand for continuing education and in the future it is expected that there will be a higher proportion of mature and part-time students.  As a result greater diversity of access and life-long education will be required.  The regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology will be expected to offer an education service to these students given their highly regarded traditions in these fields.  Pilot schemes in open and distance learning are already a feature of the sector and can be expected to grow. <Col N="1371" /> Where international linkages are concerned many students of the institutions covered by this legislation participate in a wide range of EU programmes in the education, culture, science, technology, information and other spheres.  The institutions also have a range of developmental and research programmes with industrial and international partners.</P>
    <P>A new feature of the regional technical college-DIT sector is the development of two projects in association with the NOW Programme of the European Union.  NOW stands for New Opportunities for Women and the programme has as its aim the promotion of equal opportunities for women in vocational training and employment.  The projects are being implemented in Cork Regional Technical College and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with my Department, Cork regional technical college has developed an initiative called &ldquo;Women into Technology&rdquo;.  This initiative has two aspects.  Firstly, there is a 30 week pre-training course for women which equips them with the necessary knowledge, confidence and skills to pursue further education in engineering and the applied sciences.  These are areas which traditionally have a very low proportion of women.  Special time-tabling, career guidance and introduction to role models are features of the initiative.  Significant interest was shown in this course during the information sessions prior to its commencement and by June 1994 100 women had participated.</P>
    <P>The other aspect to this Cork initiative is a schools programme which provides a one week &ldquo;taster&rdquo; course for young women through practicals and lectures in science, engineering and technology.  In addition to the programme for pupils in schools, information seminars are also held for parents.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology initiative, based in the Bolton Street college, promotes greater take-up by women of careers in engineering and <Col N="1372" /> technology.  It does this through an interlinked network of short courses, link courses, seminars, and open days. This initiative has met with great success and interest on the part of young women and their parents.</P>
    <P>Both initiatives have the full support of my Department and other regional technical colleges are being encouraged to consider how best they can encourage the participation of women in non-traditional areas of study and careers.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges and the institute have a record of achievement behind them and a challenging future ahead of them.  The realisation of the aims and ambitions for this sector of third level education will best be achieved by a co-operative effort of all the interests involved and the harnessing of a wide range of relevant experience and expertise.  This must be firmly rooted in the governing bodies and in the method of their selection. Under the 1992 Acts, governing bodies were given a central role in the new institutions.  They are in all respects their legal personae, the bodies through which the institutions carry out their functions.  For this reason it is essential that the method of appointment of governing bodies be free from uncertainty so that they can be in the best possible position to guide and direct the institutions and to pool together as wide a range of experience and expertise as possible in the interests of advancing their goals.</P>
    <P>In enacting the 1992 legislation, the Oireachtas rightly recognised that it would be in the interests of the institutions if the method of appointing governing bodies ensured a reasonable gender balance.  In general it is necessary in public life to ensure that men and women are fully represented and given the opportunity to make their contribution.  Traditionally this has not been the case due to a significant under-representation of women.  In the case of educational institutions gender balance assumes a particular significance in view of the role these institutions have in educating young people in all aspects of <Col N="1373" /> life.  Governing bodies are charged with the overall governance of colleges where in many cases women comprise more than 50 per cent of the student population.  The total current number of women students in the sector is 15,000. Given the importance of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology in the development of their regions and in the national educational framework it is essential that there should be balance in the range of experience and expertise available to them.  Gender balance facilitates this.</P>
    <P>In January 1993 the Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment to a radical programme of affirmative action in appointing women to State boards with the objective of achieving a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women among the direct Government nominees within a period of four years.  Subsequent to this the Government in March 1993 set out a gender balance policy to increase the participation of women in public life and to ensure that men and women are fully represented and given an opportunity to make their full contribution in all aspects of public life.</P>
    <P>Regretfully the experience to date has been one of extreme difficulty in securing an appropriate balance of women on the governing bodies.  The structure of the appointments system at present is that the vocational education committees make recommendations to the Minister for Education on the composition of the governing bodies and the Minister formally makes the appointments.  Recommendations come from six areas in the case of the colleges and seven in the case of the institute.  These are nominees of the vocational education committees, academic and non-academic staff, students, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and relevant organisation in areas such as agriculture, industry, commerce and the professions.  The institute has an additional nominee from Trinity College.</P>
    <P>In late 1992 the then Minister, on <Col N="1374" /> receipt of nominations from the committees, appointed the first governing bodies to the 11 regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology from 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1993.  The Minister had requested the committees in forwarding their nominations to have regard to the requirement in the legislation that the Minister must ensure an appropriate gender balance, as determined by him, in appointing governing bodies.  The response was very disappointing with only one vocational education committee, County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, making nominations which reflected an appropriate gender balance.</P>
    <P>When guidelines were issued to the relevant vocational education committees in November 1993, for their nominations for the new governing bodies to be appointed with effect from 1 January 1994, my Department sought nominations in accordance with the Government's policy on gender balance.  It was indicated to the committees that I would have no option but to refuse nominations under the various sections where the required gender balance was not met.  Letters in similar terms were sent to the outgoing governing bodies in the context of staff and student elections and to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in connection with their nominee under the Acts.</P>
    <P>Once again in late 1993 and early 1994 the nominations from vocational education committees generally failed to provide an appropriate gender balance.  By March 1994 I found that the situation with regard to the appointment of governing bodies in the institutions had reached an impasse, with the vocational education committees in most cases either unable or unwilling to put forward proposals on the basis of minimum representation of 40 per cent for men and women.</P>
    <P>The requirement to ensure gender balance is a duty imposed upon me by the Acts and if I had simply accepted the position I would have been in breach of the spirit of the legislation <Col N="1375" /> which the Oireachtas saw fit to pass.  On the other hand, the vocational education committees pointed to a weakness in that legislation.  While it imposed an obligation on the Minister for Education to ensure gender balance in appointing governing bodies it imposed no such obligation on the vocational education committees in making recommendations as to the people to be appointed.</P>
    <P>This quite clearly places me, as Minister, in a very difficult position.  To meet and discharge my statutory obligation to ensure gender balance I have had to return to the Oireachtas for the necessary powers.  I did not, however, consider it to be in the best interests of the institutions if they were left without governing bodies.  Accordingly, I appointed the governing bodies as recommended to me, but only for one year instead of the five year term I had originally intended, and I indicated my intention to seek amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I should, of course, indicate that throughout all these proceedings, I was very heartened by the fact that County Dublin Vocational Education Committee willingly provided nominations with gender balance in line with Government policy for Tallaght Regional Technical College.  The Dublin Institute of Technology is now also at the point of reaching a gender balance in line with Government policy.  I congratulate Tallaght Regional Technical College and the Dublin Institute of Technology and their respective vocational education committees on their recognition of the significance of providing role models at the level of governance for the students of their institutions.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the legislation I was conscious of the fact that vocational education committees could not be expected to bear the full responsibility for gender blance.  As is the case in most public and private organisations, the level of representation of women on vocational education committees and in local government generally is very low. This is one of the main reasons for the <Col N="1376" /> gender balance policy in the first place. It would be unreasonable, accordingly, to expect the vocational education committees to address gender balance from their nominees only.  I also considered that where any group was in a position to put forward more than one nominee that group should also ensure a gender balance.  This is particularly appropriate in the case of academic staff and students.  These groups have two nominees each and I now propose to give statutory effect to a policy directive already being implemented in all colleges and the institute, to the effect that one of these two nominees must be a woman and the other a man.</P>
    <P>In further assisting the vocational education committees to provide a balanced list of recommendations I propose to alter the procedures for the making of nominations by relevant bodies.  There are five such nominations.  At present the vocational education committees choose five organisations and must accept their nominees.  This gives the vocational education committees little control over the nominations process.  This could cause difficulties if the nominees did not accord with the efforts of a vocational education committee to achieve a gender balance.  I now propose a change in the wording of the legislation which will enable the vocational education committees to seek nominations from any number of organisations and from among those nominated they may choose those whom they consider are best suited in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>If the provisions now proposed are enacted I am confident that vocational education committees will have little difficulty in practice in assisting the Minister for Education in ensuring a gender balance on governing bodies and that the original Acts can finally, after two failed attempts, be implemented in this respect in the spirit intended. However, I believe that a stalemate of the kind which developed over this issue of gender balance on governing bodies cannot be allowed to occur again.  It is extremely damaging for the operation <Col N="1377" /> and reputation of the regional technical college-Dublin Institute of Technology sector and carries serious legal and financial risks if colleges are left for any significant period of time without governing bodies.  Accordingly, I propose in section 3 of the Bills to provide for a situation where a vocational education committee, in making recommendations to a Minister, in respect of the composition of governing bodies, fails in their statutory obligations.  The Minister in certain circumstances would be able to by-pass the normal appointment procedure and appoint any person or body of persons to take over the functions of a governing body.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this provision I have sought to ensure that it is reasonable and proportionate and that it strikes a balance between the need to put governing bodies in place with as little delay as possible, while at the same time protecting vocational education committees from arbitrary or unfair action on the part of a Minister.  I have also sought to ensure that the power of the Minister is not so wide as to enable her to completely set aside the provisions of the Acts as originally enacted.  Accordingly, any person or body appointed under this power could hold office for not longer than one year.  This period in most cases would enable a Minister and a vocational education committee to resolve whatever difficulties led to the appointment in the first place and a governing body would then be appointed in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Apart from the issue of gender balance the appointment of governing bodies was delayed earlier this year because of litigation relating to who should be allowed to participate in the elections for academic staff nominees.  This matter was the subject of a High Court judgment which extended participation in the elections to certain part-time staff.  In bringing forward provisions setting out in some detail who the electorates for academic and non-academic staff should be I have sought to implement the spirit of that judgment by including part-time staff in the elections. At the same time I am conscious of the <Col N="1378" /> fact that some part-time staff have only a very limited commitment to the colleges and the institute, in terms of the number of hours they work there.  It would be inappropriate that such staff would be allowed to participate in elections for governing body positions on the same basis as staff whose contribution is much greater.  In reconciling the rights and interests of part time staff who make a significant contribution to the colleges and the institute and the rights and interests of staff who work on a full time basis there, I propose to limit participation in the elections to all permanent staff and to those part time staff who work at least 50 per cent of the hours of whole time staff.</P>
    <P>I also propose in these Bills to amend the method by which student nominees for the governing body are chosen.  The legislation provides that two students are to be elected by the student body in accordance with regulations made by the governing bodies.  College managements and the Union of Students in Ireland made representations to me to change this method of selecting student members of the governing bodies.  Their concern was that elections for governing bodies separate from the Student Union elections could lead to a situation where the student members on the governing bodies would have no formal link to the Students' Union in the colleges.  This would cause fragmentation of student representation which would be damaging to the colleges and the students' interests.  In recognition of those concerns I propose to amend the method of selection of student members by providing that selection is to be made according to regulations made by the governing bodies.  This will enable local managements to work out with students how best their interests can be represented on the governing bodies.  The provision, if accepted, would put the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology on the same footing in this respect as the University of Limerick and Dublin City University when this method of selection is working well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> I now propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to outline to the House the provisions of the Bills as presented.  My remarks on the individual sections apply to both Bills and I will indicate points of difference as they arise.</P>
    <P>Section 1 merely provides that the Principal Act referred to in the Bills is the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992 or the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the method of selection of a governing body.  It replaces subsection (4) of the Principal Acts.  This provision would effect no change in the overall composition of the governing bodies.  In the case of the regional technical colleges there will continue to be 17 ordinary members comprised as follows: six to be nominated by the vocational education committee; two each to be nominated by academic staff and students; one each to be nominated by the non-academic staff and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and five to be nominated by relevant organisations as determined by the vocational education committee.  In the case of the Dublin Institute of Technology, there is one additional member &mdash; a nominee of Trinity college.</P>
    <P>The changes to the present subsection (4) which would be effected by this provision are the imposition of a formal requirement that in the case of the student and academic staff nominees, one from each group must be a woman and the other a man and in the case of relevant organisations the vocational education committee may seek nominations from any number and then choose five for recommendation to the Minister.  The provision also establishes clearly who among the staff are entitled to participate in the elections.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) imposes a statutory obligation on the vocational education committees to ensure a gender balance and to implement ministerial directives in making recommendations.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) effects the substitution of these provisions for the provisions in the 1992 Acts. <Col N="1380" /> Subsection (4) makes the provisions relating to the electorate for staff members retrospective to safeguard the elections which took place in the wake of the High Court judgment.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that in the event that a vocational education committee fails to abide by their statutory duty in making recommendations and persist in that failure after it is brought to their attention, the Minister may appoint any body of persons to perform the functions of the governing body for a period not greater than one year.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that where a member of the governing body who was elected by the staff of the college or institute ceases to be a member of that staff he or she will also cease to be a member of the governing body.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is intended to address the difficulties posed by the fact that the governing bodies leaving office last year had in effect, after the striking down of their regulations governing staff elections by the High Court, left office without making valid regulations.  A full governing body could not be appointed until regulations were made but regulations could not be made until a governing body was appointed.  This &ldquo;catch 22&rdquo; situation is addressed by providing for the appointment of a less than complete governing body which would then make the necessary regulations.  It is retrospective to cover the present governing bodies which were appointed under this procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the short title, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>In summary the Bills seek to bring a certainty to the process for electing staff members to governing bodies; ensure that an appropriate gender balance is effectively implemented on all governing bodies; assist nominating bodies to achieve gender balance in their recommendations and prevent a situation from ever arising again where failure on the part of nominating bodies could jeopardise the good order and management of the colleges and the institute.</P>
    <P>I commend these Bills to the House.</P>

      <P>By way of an aside, I would point out to the Minister the turbulent history of legislation relating to technological education.  It was on the day the Government collapsed in 1989 that the recommendations of the Hardiman report on technological education relating to the granting of university status to the NIHEs at Dublin and Limerick were approved in Dáil Éireann. The Minister should also be aware that during the course of Second Stage of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1991 and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1991 the then Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, moved on to greater things and it was her successor, Deputy Davern, who completed the passage of these Bills through the House.  We all know that his tenure of office was very short indeed.  As the Minister introduces these two Bills in a turbulent political climate, I wonder if the hand of fate is about to strike a third time.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology has been one of the great success stories of our third level institutions.  At present there are in excess of 10,000 whole-time students taking a range of courses at apprenticeship, technician, degree and post graduate levels. Part-time day and evening students numbering in excess of 15,000 are taking a wide range of courses.  With the Dublin Institute of Technology participating in the CAO-CAS system it provides a valuable source of further educational options for the 65,000 students taking the leaving certificate annually.</P>
      <P>The regional technical colleges which were first built at Carlow, Waterford, Athlone, Dundalk, Sligo and Letterkenny in the late 1960s and 1970s have grown from fledgling institutions to major educational establishments providing a third level education for in excess of 25,000 students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend and salute the individual <Col N="1382" /> regional technical colleges for the marvellous work they have done and continue to do and, likewise, the individual colleges within the Dublin Institute of Technology system.  The commitment of the staff members in all of these institutions has led to the high standards which have been achieved and we must also recognise the input and dedication of the various vocational education committees within whose jurisdiction these colleges lay for so many years. The introduction of the Regional Technical Colleges Bill, 1992 and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, 1992 transferred many of the responsibilities from these vocational education committees to new governing bodies.</P>
    <P>I read with interest over the past few days the Second Stage debate which took place on these Bills in this House and a number of amazing factors emerged.  I found that the Minister's own party, the Labour Party, opposed the original Bills on Second Stage because it felt the Bills should not be published prior to the education Green Paper and the debate that was to take place on that.  I wonder if the Minister has spoken with those party colleagues who contributed at that stage and what their reaction is to the publication of this amendment to the Acts, with such far reaching consequences, prior to the publication of the Minister's White Paper.</P>
    <P>A major part of the Bills now being proposed by the Minister relates to the introduction of gender equity on the boards of these colleges.  It is also interesting to note that in the Second Stage debate on the original substantive Bills I could not find any Deputy who referred to the need for such provisions or who commented on this factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding, I am very much in favour of gender equity in public appointments to boards, etc.  However, many women and women's groups feel that <Col N="1383" /> women should not be given places on these boards simply because of their gender but should occupy places as of right and because of their ability to do the job well.  I fear that the provisions of these amendments will be ultimately a disservice to women and will damage their just cause for greater representation.  Because of the Minister's insistence on interfering in the normal democratic practice, these Bills may even be found to be unconstitutional.  They seem to have been hastily prepared and do not address the difficulties being experienced by the various colleges in relation to the operation of the original Acts of 1992.</P>
      <P>Perhaps this omission can be explained by the fact that the Minister does not seem to have consulted any of the colleges I spoke with and on whom this legislation is to be imposed.  Even a cursory discussion with many of them would have indicated that wide ranging problems are experienced under the original Acts which could have been amended by these Bills had the Minister initiated a process of consultation with those colleges.  Such consultation was widely engaged in by my constituency colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, and there is great disappointment that the present Minister failed to consult the colleges before introducing this legislation.  The first many of them knew of it was when they read the press reports indicating it had been launched by the Minister.  If the Minister consulted the colleges, perhaps she will indicate with whom she consulted and whether it was on a formal or informal basis.  She should take a leaf out of the book of the former Minister who consulted widely with the various colleges on every aspect of their development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister engages in wide ranging discussions on other topics but she must realise the important role of the regional colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology and give them equal treatment with the other participating groups in education.  Debate on this issue has been non-existent and the <Col N="1384" /> Minister is being driven by non-elected ideologues who seem to have far greater control of the Minister and her policy than the many elected representatives who are in touch with the real issues. Why, since the debate arose last October, has the Minister cause to issue directives on the holding of elections on a panel basis?  The muddle and confusion caused by these contradictory directives could easily be sorted out at face to face meetings with the people involved, but such meetings did not take place.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the policy of ensuring gender balance in public bodies but I wonder if this Bill will do it or if it too will be referred to the Supreme Court. If that happens the policy of ensuring gender balance in public bodies could suffer a severe set back.  I am concerned about clauses in the Dublin Institute of Technology (Amendment) Bill which will make part of this Bill retrospective to January and April 1994.  This was not mentioned in the Minister's speech. Introducing Bills of a retrospective nature is nothing new in the House but very few Bills have been introduced when court cases relating to clauses therein have been involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister is attempting to do the work of the courts as there is a court case next week which will be affected by the Bill.  This is a very dangerous practice.  Two Ministers who deliberately introduced legislation to override pending court cases found it a dangerous practice which would not be tolerated by the courts.  I refer to the Pine Valley case and the Sinn Féin funds case both of which are matters of public record and should be brought to the attention of the Minister immediately. With a court case involving the Dublin Institute of Technology Academic Staff Association due for mention in the courts next week it is foolish for the Minister to try to settle the matter by introducing this Bill.  I urge the Minister to withdraw the retrospective sections immediately and not end up with more <Col N="1385" /> egg on her face than she has accumulated from the debacle of the free colleges debate and her recent encounter with the Irish churches which has left her reeling from the blows of many croziers, not just from one side.</P>

      <P>The Minister's concept of staff representatives being elected from two constituencies, male and female, is repugnant to democracy and the right of the individual to cast his vote in whatever manner he chooses. We have a long tradition of democracy and the single transferable vote so that one's voting wishes are reflected in the candidates elected to office.  The Minister's amendment will allow first past the post to be elected and will not reflect the democratic wishes of voters.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Second Stage of the substantive Bills as reported at column 640 of the Official Report, 7 November 1991, Deputy O'Shea stated: &ldquo;This is a view with which I concur since it is consistent with the concept of worker participation and the exercise of democracy at the basic levels of society and its institutions&rdquo;.  He was referring to his wish for open democratic elections to positions on the governing bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If constituencies are created within the college how can the male or female electorate have a say in selecting colleagues of the opposite sex?  Is the Minister further suggesting that if the president of one of these institutions is a male the next president must be female?  Perhaps she will soon say that scholarships awarded by institutions should be on a gender equity basis &mdash; two female students, two male students. If that were the case the six scholarships awarded by the Dublin Institute of Technology in the past year would have been given to three males and three females whereas all six scholarships were awarded to female students because they were high achievers.  Since the Minister is so committed to gender equity let us look at the primary sector <Col N="1386" /> of the teaching profession where approximately 80 per cent of the teachers are female.  What measures is the Minister taking to equalise the situation bearing in mind the increasing number of single parent families, most of whom are headed by females which means that, in the absence of male teachers, children do not have a dominant male influence in their lives until they are teenagers?  This could have a serious detrimental effect on their development and is far more important than items contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to the Dáil Official Report of 26 January 1994 when she replied to a question indicating that of the 21 Principal Officers in her Department 18 were male and three were female.  Where she had direct jurisdiction she appointed males to the top positions of programme manager, special adviser and director of communications within her Department.  How does she respond?  Is that why she is introducing this legislation?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael supported the thrust of the 1992 Acts.  These have been generally implemented but a number of difficulties have arisen which the Minister would have heard about had she consulted the colleges.  One relates to the various constituencies created for the election of members to the governing bodies of these colleges.  In some cases these constituencies have been manipulated to enable, in one case I know of, a staff member to become a member of the board as a representative of one of the constituent bodies rather than a representative of the staff body.  I am aware of another case where a special nominating body was put forward by a vocational education committee in order that a disgruntled vocational education committee member could become a member of the governing body.  This mechanism has been used in a number of areas to facilitate people who could have been nominated to the board in their respective constituencies but, having failed there, another mechanism was designed to suit them.  This should have been addressed in the Bills <Col N="1387" /> but unfortunately the Minister failed to do so.</P>
    <P>The enlargement of the constituencies gives rise to many questions about how this legislation would be implemented.  The number of constituencies that will be formed is not mentioned nor is the way in which people will be nominated from the various constituencies.  The Minister indicates that the vocational education committee will choose from them.  Having seen the way in which some vocational education committees manipulate situations and get their own members on the boards I am sceptical about what will happen in future.</P>
    <P>It is acceptable international practice for colleges to establish research committees to identify nominating bodies appropriate to the academic and research activities of the institution.  The legislation should provide for similar arrangements in regard to the nominating bodies.  This is a very important development which should be considered further on Committee Stage. Given that the Minister proposes to increase the numbers of nominating bodies, colleges should put forward a list of recommended bodies from which the vocational education committee would select the nominating bodies.  In practice, there has been no consultation between the vocational education committees and colleges about the nominating bodies.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty encountered by the regional technical colleges in particular relates to the necessity for programmes and budgets to be submitted to the relevant vocational education committee on 1 March every year.  Once the programmes and budgets are approved by the vocational education committee they are forwarded to the Department of Education for approval before 1 May.  Under this procedure courses are not ratified by the Minister until some time in July.  The timescale under this procedure has serious implications for colleges offering new courses.  For colleges involved in the <Col N="1388" /> CAO-CAS system, this date is much too late to attract students to new courses.  I ask the Minister to review this procedure and to consider changing the timescale.  Approval of programmes and budgets by the Minister at an earlier date would enable courses to commence at an earlier stage in colleges.  There is no reason those dates cannot be brought forward considerably.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this point.</P>
    <P>I will be putting down Committee Stage amendments to a number of sections.  I should like the Minister in her reply to deal with a number of points.  The word &ldquo;required&rdquo; is used in section 2 of the Dublin Institute of Technology (Amendment) Bill.  Will the Minister say who is required to do what?  Will it be the director or president of the college?  Will there have to be a written contract?  Who will decide on this matter in the event of a dispute? In referring to equivalent part-time staff, is the Minister including employees such as canteen staff, cleaning staff etc. who work in the college on a part-time basis?  What about technicians whose pay in many cases derives from research grants?  Will they become equivalent part-time employees?  The Minister needs to clarify these points.</P>
    <P>What are the implications of including in legislation a provision relating to the teaching of not less than 280 time-tabled hours in a college?  Will this set current teaching contracts in legislative tablets of stone?  Given recent European Union decisions, what will be the knock-on implications for the pensions of part-time workers in the public service?  Will it also give rise to 50 per cent pension rights?  Some EPT staff may have pensions for non-college work and when these are aggregated with the 50 per cent college pension the total may give rise to additional claims from permanent whole-time staff.  What is the advice from the Department of Finance on the potential cost of the provisions in the Bill?  Would it not be better for the Minister to withdraw the Bill and <Col N="1389" /> have it redrafted?  Subject to the clarifications I am seeking, I support the concept in section 2 but I do not support the wording of it, which is dangerous.  I will put down an amendment to propose that regional technical colleges should be called regional colleges.  Given the vast array of facilities they provide, modern day regional colleges should not be restricted by the title &ldquo;technical&rdquo;.  When the Acts were being debated in the House Fine Gael put down an amendment proposing that these colleges should be called regional polytechnics.  That amendment was rejected by the Minister of the day.  I ask this Minister to consider calling these institutions regional colleges.</P>
    <P>I will also put down an amendment proposing uniformity in regard to the titles of the persons in charge of these colleges.  Under the Dublin Institute of Technology system, it is agreed that the person in charge shall be called the president, while a director shall be in charge of a faculty within the college, for example, the director of building studies.  Given that these colleges operate in an international field, it is important that there is no ambiguity about the status of the directors.  I will be proposing that the principal or director of each college shall henceforth be referred to as the president of the college.  This will give the person in charge status on the European scene and removes any doubts about his position within the college system.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to this point.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Bills do not contain a commitment to the establishment of a regional college in Thurles.  My colleague, Deputy Michael Lowry, will deal with this issue.  I also regret that the Minister has not availed of the opportunity to establish a full regional college in Castlebar.  Deputies Enda Kenny and Michael Ring will deal with this issue in greater detail.  I welcome the thrust of the Bills which provide for a greater involvement by women on the governing bodies of regional colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  While <Col N="1390" /> supporting the Bill on Second Stage, Fine Gael will put down Committee Stage amendments which I hope the Minister will accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the principle of the Bills.  I believe in gender equity and I commend the Minister for enshrining that principle in the Bills.  At a time when we should be debating education in general and the White Paper on education in particular it is ironic that we are debating Bills which more or less tinker with existing legislation.  Instead of rebuilding the entire education edifice we are tinkering with legislation.</P>
      <P>At a time of such uncertainty about local and regional education authorities it is ironic that we are talking about the powers of vocational education committees.  The Minister has concentrated on structures and, at times, battles with bishops instead of creating the type of educational system society needs and dealing with the White Paper on education.  We have seen an extraordinary turn around in this area in recent times. The Minister has held a series of meetings, to try to achieve consensus on the local education structures.  While I commend her on this &mdash; in educational terms, one would give her full marks &mdash; unfortunately I would have to send out for the external examiner on what happened next.  As is generally known, it was proposed to establish by consent local and regional education authorities which would provide support for and ensure an equitable distribution of resources to, all the schools and colleges in their areas.  Following that discussion, an announcement was made &mdash; regrettably it was made in the media &mdash; that the Minister intends to retain the vocational education committees within the new local education structures.  This announcement was elaborated on by the Secretary of the Department of Education who stated that under the new structures the vocational education committee would fulfil the functions they currently undertake for their schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any surprise that the ASTI <Col N="1391" /> reacted with such dismay and amazement, finding that the premise on which they entered into discussions turned out to be false?  They were led to believe that the outcome would be that all schools would have a single local or regional education authority structure. As they said in their letter to the Minister dated 28 September 1994 &mdash; which I believe has been circulated to all Members of this House: &ldquo;In such a system, decisions about the allocation of resources could be made on a fair, open and transparent basis and in such a way as to ensure equity in the system&rdquo;.  Can it come as a surprise that the ASTI took the view that the Minister yielded to political pressure in retaining the vocational education committees while, at the same time, wishing to establish separate regional education councils? They state &mdash; with some justification &mdash; that the continuance of the vocational education committees and their current functions would inhibit regional technical colleges from carrying out their functions in an equitable manner. Indeed having two layers of local education authorities turns the original objective on its head and would result in the duplication of authority and responsibilities, inefficiency and unnecessary expense.</P>
    <P>The final two paragraphs of the letter from the ASTI to the Minister sums up the type of frustration felt by others interested in and committed to the reform of our educational system.  They state:</P>
    <P>In common with many other major organisations in education, the ASTI entered into the debate on the establishment of the local/regional council structures on the understanding that, in future, there would only be one such structure in the education system between all schools and the Department of Education.  In the course of the various consultative processes in which we all engaged, there was no support for the model of local/regional education structures <Col N="1392" /> which you have now adopted.  In this context, your decision to retain the existing local structure for some schools and establish another structure for all schools is astonishing and inconsistent.  The consultative process has been ignored.  You have undermined the consensus approach to policy development.</P>
    <P>The net effect of this decision will be to create confusion and incoherence in the administration of the education system.  It will lead to duplication of services and wasteful use of resources.  It will encourage unhealthy rivalry and, in your own words, destructive competition between schools and will be damaging to the interests of the education service.  The ASTI executive committee has now decided to withdraw its support for the concept of regional education structures.</P>
    <P>In terms of what the Minister set out to do, at the very least her present predicament is unfortunate although relating these remarks to vocational education committees I am not implying any criticism of them because, in the main, they do a very good job.  However, we should question the vocational education committees, at second-level, continuing to operate under the provisions of the Vocational Education Act, 1930; it was considered inappropriate to third-level institutions which is the reason the Acts we now seek to amend were implemented.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister regrets that the recommendation of the international study group on technical education, the Hardiman report &mdash; that the Dublin Institute of Technology should be a statutory body and that the regional technical colleges should break away from the vocational education committee structure, giving them full independence &mdash; was not implemented in its entirety.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a detailed account of the college structures.  I agree that the Acts went a considerable way to giving the institutions greater freedom and <Col N="1393" /> autonomy and with the premise that the governing bodies of such institutions should be reflective of society and of the interests appropriate to the activities of such colleges.</P>
    <P>The recognition of gender balance is an important principle I wish to see ratified.  I commend the Minister on her determination to adhere to that principle in that I believe there should be gender equity at all levels.  Women's representation is critical on boards of educational establishments.  One can still find evidence of sexism and attitudes are difficult to change.  There is no doubt that, just as we would not have had the advances in equality legislation without the prompting, even insistence, of the European Union, it will take insistence that women must be represented on boards to make it happen. I have spoken to a number of young women &mdash; while agreeing that one will hear it more from men &mdash; who do not agree with what they call this gender thing, they do not consider it to be necessarily a good idea; &ldquo;too womany&rdquo; is a phrase that has been used.  Yet, whenever one pushes those young women on what they mean by that, they are not very clear.  A quarter of a century after the revival of feminism, this is the stage we have reached, a vague discomfort that women have got too far. Given that they have not got far enough, that is worse than ironic. It is positively sad to think that young women, in particular, feel that boards comprised of equal numbers of men and women in some way would favour women.  Some of this prejudice is dressed up as legitimate concern.  For example, there is an attitude that we would allow unqualified women on boards predicated by the quite inaccurate assumption that all men on boards are well qualified, over-burdened with appropriate degrees, free of all bias, and none of them past his best.  That is not the case.  Boards in the education or almost any other sector have very fine men, with very fine minds and track records but they also comprise men of minimal qualifications, and perhaps <Col N="1394" /> intelligence, stamped with political and other sectoral interests.  Of course, it might be that we give unqualified men a higher rating than unqualified women or, conversely, that we rate male experience higher than female experience.</P>
    <P>Some politicians might remember, during the European elections, commentators talking about the electoral chances of two Fine Gael candidates.  I remember an observation that Alan Gillis is a very experienced person, the implication being that Monica Barnes's experience, having been garnered by a woman on women's issues, was somehow less valid than his garnered on farming issues.  That comment does not take from the man concerned.  Nonetheless the House will get my point in relation to women's experience.  The gender issue has become muddled, unfashionable and confused.  Indeed the Minister should talk to her colleague, the Minister of Equality and Law Reform, in this respect because attitudes are difficult to change and there is no doubt that we need relevant legislation to bring that about.</P>
    <P>On the two Bills before us, as my colleague, Deputy McGrath said, certain elements of their structure need amendment.  On the process of nomination and appointment it seems appropriate that the electorate in academic staff elections should be comprised of permanent, full-time staff.  I was glad to note that the Minister had taken on the spirit of the High Court judgment in relation to part-time teachers.</P>
    <P>I wonder about the provisions of section 2 (1) (g) which makes provision for the vocational education committees to seek nominations from any number of relevant organisations.  Has the Minister thought of the possible consequences of this, for example, just how wide will this remit be?  That needs to be teased out on Committee Stage. Does the Minister consider that the powers in section 3 (2) are extreme?  I am endeavouring to be even-handed in this matter.  I accept that the Minister must take on board certain powers in relation to what she is endeavouring to <Col N="1395" /> do here because, without them, nothing will happen.  However, I am also concerned to ensure that ministerial powers do not go too far.</P>
    <P>Any legislation dealing with gender equity tends to be low on the legislative priority list.  I realise there are other more immediate issues the Minister should address.  However, as these Bills refer to third-level educational institutions, I might comment briefly on them.  For example, I do not believe it appropriate for the Minister to talk about unsustainable promises of free third-level education since the State does not provide even free primary level education.  Every parent knows that they will be involved in so-called voluntary subscriptions or fund raising activities &mdash; one might describe it as &ldquo;education by cake sale&rdquo;.  Primary education should be afforded priority in being rendered truly free to children and their parents.</P>
    <P>At third level we need that urgent review of the grants and maintenance system.  We have only to look at the results of the survey, which show that Dubliners from affluent areas are 15 times more likely to go to university than their counterparts from disadvantaged parts of the city, to realise just how inequitable is the system.  I ask the Minister to publish the report on third level grants because there continues to be speculation in the media on the contents of that report.  I do not know why the Minister would not publish it.  It is political inaction of the worst type.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the current income level cut-off point to qualify for a full grant is too low and seriously penalises countless middle income families in the PAYE sector.  Given the shortage of third level places and the overcrowding in colleges such as UCD and UCC, where does the Minister intend to find places for these people when the era of free third level education for all dawns?</P>
    <P>I am glad we have had the opportunity to debate this Bill and I am sorry <Col N="1396" /> it does not appear to have the wholehearted support I had expected.  I will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  I commend the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to defer implementation of the Review Body special pay award for Ministers so as to set a necessary headline in relation to overcoming the current industrial relations difficulties in State companies, maintaining control of public expenditure and improving the competitiveness of our economy.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is opposing the increases of 17 per cent in pay for Ministers for two reasons.  First, at a time when the Government is appealing for sacrifices from so many other workers, it is completely irresponsible for it to award such huge increases to itself; and second, on any performance related criteria, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Ministers do not deserve any increase in pay.  The Taoiseach is to get an extra £13,900 a year.  This increase is about the same as the average industrial worker's total wage.  How can the Taoiseach justify awarding himself an increase of as much as the total income that many workers have to live on and use to raise their families?  The Taoiseach's increase works out at £267 per week.  This increase is over four times the total amount of the non-contributory old age pension.  The total amount the Taoiseach will receive is 30 times that received on a weekly basis, or on a montyly basis, by an old age pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste will get an extra £230 per week.  This increase is almost four times more than the individual long term unemployment assistance rate. <Col N="1397" /> These increases are being claimed by the same Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers who introduced a tax on unemployment benefit and who abolished &mdash; because they could not afford it &mdash; pay related benefit.  They did these things which affected those at the other end of the income scale while they are now taking these disproportionate increases for themselves.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their Ministers have complacently accepted this huge 17 per cent pay rise, five times as great as the rate of increases awarded to ordinary TDs and far more than the 2 per cent increase for other workers under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is now the second highest paid Prime Minister in Europe; the Tánaiste is now paid more than eight other EU Prime Ministers.  This is scandalous and unsustainable.  The British Prime Minister is paid about £1,377 per million British citizens whose interests he has to look after.  The Dutch Prime Minister is paid about £5,400 for each million Dutch citizens he has to look after.  Our Taoiseach, on the other hand, no doubt reflecting his importance as world statesman and world traveller, now believes he should award himself a pay rate of £27,400 for each million Irish people he looks after. Compare that with £1,377 which the British Prime Minister is paid for each million British citizens he looks after. The Taoiseach is paid over 20 times what John Major gets on a <i>per capita</i> basis.</P>
    <P>We know the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste love to travel.  &ldquo;Leaving on a jet plane&rdquo; would probably have been a very suitable campaign anthem in the general election we nearly had this week.  Yet, there is a serious side to some, but by no means all, of this travel by Ministers and the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their Ministers regularly go to Europe in search of extra aid, extra billions of aid for this country, on the basis that we are one of the poorer members of the European Union.  How can they make a good case <Col N="1398" /> for that proposition when they are paying themselves more than the other Prime Ministers and Ministers sitting around the table?  How convincing is it to say that money should be taken from French or British taxpayers, because Ireland needs it on grounds of poverty, when the people making that case have decided they are entitled to a higher salary than the French and British Prime Ministers whose taxpayers are supposed to find the extra money for this poor country that can afford to pay its Prime Minister more than the rich countries? It does not make sense, and it has been said that in Europe personal relations are important.</P>
    <P>If you are making a case around a dinner table or a meeting table that Ireland needs more money and if you are being paid more than the people from whom you are asking that money, it does not help you make your case effectively, especially if the case is Ireland is poor.  How can Irish Ministers credibly negotiate a special case for Ireland on the basis of relative disadvantage when the same Ministers pay themselves more than the Ministers from the country whose money we are asking to given to us on ground of relative poverty here.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should not forget that workers covered by national pay agreements, such as the <i>Programme for Competiveness and Work,</i> must prove genuine improvements in productivity and more efficient work practices to justify any extra pay under a special pay claim.  Looking back on the shambles of the past few weeks, how could anyone say that a pay increase is justified for these Ministers?  All Ministers now have an array of programme managers and other assistants financed by the taxpayer to help them in their work.  This reduces the personal load that falls on Ministers and further undermines the argument that a disproportionate personal pay increase for Ministers is justified.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Competiveness and Work</i> agreement to special payments in the public service must <Col N="1399" /> result in savings and improved quality of public service in whatever public service area the extra special pay increases are being justified.  What savings has this Cabinet made to justify an extra pay increase for the individual members of the Cabinet?  Can Ministers justify this enormous pay increase through their savings in their own area of work? These are the criteria that apply under the <i>Programme for Competiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>There is little evidence of savings or frugality of any kind on the part of Ministers of this Government in their own areas of work.  We have only to look at the vastly inflated budgets for personnel and travel in Minister's offices to see that instead of savings, there have been increases in outgoings in areas directly controlled by Ministers. There is little evidence of saving in the increased use of luxury hotels, the demand to use only the presidential suite in a particular hotel as a condition for staying there, the wasteful use of the Government jet and helicopter and the awarding of jobs in the public service to relatives, friends and cronies at the taxpayer's expense.  Those are now seen as part of the essential perks of office. They do not represent savings, but extra expenditure which would not justify a special pay increase for Ministers.</P>
    <P>Have taxpayers seen any improved quality of public service from the Ministers concerned?  Last week the Taoiseach and Tánaiste were in such a sulk with one another they could not bring themselves to have a telephone conversation about the position in TEAM Aer Lingus and Irish Steel when it appeared 3,000 jobs might be lost.  An employer would sack two employees who were unable to have a civil telephone conversation about a major problem which involved them, yet at the highest level in the Government there are two people who put their pride at such a premium that, even though 3,000 jobs were at risk, they could not bring themselves to talk to one another about the matter. <Col N="1400" /> They do not deserve to be in employment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and his Ministers have treated the Government as if it were their private property: the levers of powers are used for their benefit; friends and relatives are parachuted into specially created Government jobs; national lottery funds are distributed by Ministers as sweetners to vocal constituents and lobby groups; statutory bodies, such as Bord Fáilte and the VHI, are taken under political control to maximise patronage and unelected minders &mdash; briefers &mdash; run the country while their Ministers cross the globe on even longer and more frequent trips.</P>
    <P>Some months ago we saw how Ministers handled that most precious of all civic rights, the right to a passport, the right to citizenship of this egalitarian republic.  The award of citizenship was done in secret on the basis of a recommendation from one Minister to another.  As a result of one such chain of recommendations, a huge sum was invested in a company substantially owned by the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The beef tribunal report also showed that the Taoiseach was politically untrustworthy.  It showed a Taoiseach who recklessly broke almost all the terms of a Cabinet decision by which he was bound.  He casually gave away £2.74 million of taxpayer's money to the Goodman organisation.  He made arbitrary decisions at secret meetings.  He deceitfully concealed information from the Minister for Finance and from officials of his Department.  He took part in breaking the law in respect of an IDA grant agreement.  He pushed through a tax amnesty that would allow benefit to the Goodman organisation even though he knew its tax practices were before the beef tribunal.  He pretended he did not know he was insuring intervention beef, even <Col N="1408" /> though all the written evidence throughout the beef tribunal report shows that he could not have avoided knowing that the beef he was insuring for export to Iraq was intervention beef.</P>
      <P>I believe that the beef tribunal report showed a pattern of conduct that clearly showed the Taoiseach as unfit for the office he holds, or any other senior public office and certainly undeserving of a pay increase of £13,000 per year from taxpayers.  Yet Fianna Fáil and now, it appears, Labour, believe he should get that increase.</P>
      <P>The trappings of power are much loved and abused by this Government. As well as paying themselves excessively, they like to live well.  The best hotels, the sunniest beaches, the finest restaurants must be found.  What better way to do that than with the aid of a private jet.</P>
      <P>To the embarrassment of the Air Corps it is now habitually used, perhaps against its wishes, as the aerial wing of Fianna Fáil.  It was only natural that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste should meet at Baldonnel airport on Sunday night as the Taoiseach called on an Air Corps helicopter, paid for by taxpayers, to ferry him back from a Fianna Fáil convention, in Cork.  That is abuse of taxpayers money for a party purpose.  On other occasions he travelled by Government jet to attend Fianna Fáil fund raising events in the United States while there on trips financed wholly by taxpayers.  Fianna Fáil made no contribution to the cost of his trip.  It was all paid for by taxpayers even though it was partly used by him for Fianna Fáil fund raising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get a special pay increase, ordinary public servants are supposed to make savings.  The use of the Government jet and other Air Corps aircraft and helicopters by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste is an example not of saving but of gross waste of public money.  I am reliably informed that the Government jet costs £5,000 an hour to keep in the air.  On this basis the Taoiseach's recent round the world trip cost a minimum of £250,000 for travel alone, duplicating <Col N="1409" /> routes with numerous scheduled flights that could have been used.  The now almost monthly transatlantic trips of the Taoiseach cost a minimum of £50,000 each &mdash; duplicating routes that Aer Lingus flies twice daily.</P>
    <P>So widespread has the wasteful use of the Government jet become that I am told it has, on occasion flown empty across the Atlantic &mdash; still costing £5,000 per hour &mdash; to meet the travel whims of other Ministers who were somewhere in Europe.  The Government jet, other aircraft and helicopters are used to ferry Ministers and their families around the country and abroad to meet holiday plans, attend funerals and deal with Fianna Fáil financial business.</P>

      <P>The abuse of the Government jet and other aircraft, paid for by taxpayers, and the consequent run-down of the Air Corps is so serious that I am asking the Dáil Committee on Public Accounts to make a special investigation into this matter.  So far we have been unable to get information on <Col N="1410" /> the cost of ministerial trips using the Government jet, but the waste is so great that it must be brought into the open.  It is wrong that our Defence Forces should be deprived of necessary moneys because those moneys are being used for this purpose.  If there is to be a Government jet, it should be accounted for in the Taoiseach's Vote.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has consistently criticised the growth in the public service pay bill. The Minister for Finance is making noises about controlling public spending in next year's budget.  How can he be taken seriously when he awards himself a 17 per cent pay increase?  Special pay awards, like the one the Government is awarding itself, have over the years forced a divergence between pay in the public and private sectors.  Most employees in the private and public sectors receive only annual inflationrelated increases.  What moral authority has the Government got to call for wage restraint or spending cuts when the Ministers award themselves a 17 per cent personal pay increase wholly at the taxpayers' expense, when Deputies and others in the public sector are being awarded a 3 per cent pay increase? What justification is there for Ministers awarding themselves 17 per cent when they have so many facilities that others do not have?  I understand that new arrangements for evaluating special pay increases are to be made.  I wonder why the increases to be awarded to Ministers were not evaluated in that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public spending is running out of control across the board.  Over the past four years while prices have gone up by 10 per cent, public spending has risen by 40 per cent.  Workers all over the country rightly complain about high taxes. There are two ways to give workers more take home pay; cut tax rates or raise the rate of pay.  The Government controls tax rates and also agrees limits to pay increases.  This applies to most workers but not to the Government.  In its isolated ivory tower surrounded by a golden circle of fawning admirers its members, it seems, can avoid high taxes simply by awarding themselves more <Col N="1411" /> pay; others do not have that facility.  The announcement of these huge increases was handled with deviousness and stealth.  On the eve of a major Dáil debate on the beef tribunal report and the announcement of the IRA ceasefire which the Government knew about, the Ministers' pay award was quietly slipped out.  If the Government thought this shabby tactic would fool the people, it certainly underestimated their intelligence.  I understand in a telephone poll on RTE this morning, over 3,000 people voted against this increase while only 169 supported it.  A famous New York hotelier, charged with tax evasion, once said that taxes were only for the little people.  This Government is showing exactly the same contempt by treating the people as &ldquo;little people&rdquo;.  Do as we say, the Government tells the people, not as we do.  The people will judge the Government by its actions and not by its rhetoric.  They have taken note and will not forget.</P>

    <P>Before the last election the Labour Party lectured everybody on the need to make Irish politics more ethical.  It specifically ran a campaign to abandon what was then termed &ldquo;the golden circle&rdquo;.  When it got into Government it stopped the gravy train, but only long enough for it to get on.  We must now ask the Labour Party how it can say it is putting justice into economics when it can give a widow an additional £1.80 per <Col N="1412" /> week this year and at the same time grant our hero the Tánaiste an extra £230 a week.  How can trust be put back into politics when the Cabinet increased its pay by 17 per cent while ordinary workers only got the 2 per cent under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work?</i> A new golden circle has been established.  It mingles with the rich and powerful, particularly in the United States.  It travels the world in its own jets; it is surrounded by a court of cronies in the form of special advisers and programme managers and it has the most palatial offices.  It is, namely, our new champagne and caviar Cabinet. Soon resentment of the Government will resemble the views of the tabloid press about royalty in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed with the poor turnout on the Labour benches tonight.  Not one element of its conscientious rump could turn up.  We will not even see on the plinth the wrestling match with their conscience on this subject.  However, when the ministerial Mercs run down that dual carriageway to Cork, pass the Silver Springs and turn left over the River Lee and spread out to canvass Cork North Central and South Central the message will be clear because this Government is brass-necked and bare-cheeked enough to brazen this debate out.  More letters have been received by editors of newspapers on this topic than on any other in living memory and all polls have shown an overwhelming revulsion by ordinary people at what is being proposed in a year in which the Minister for Finance has singled out certain people for particular hardship.  I refer to the decision to abolish pay-related benefit to unemployed people who also find unemployment benefit being taxed for the first time, resulting in many people, part time workers and married women who have to scrape for a living and to educate their children, being deprived of up to £28.50 a week.  Many <Col N="1413" /> householders faced the family home tax for the first time because of the widening of the net.  Mortgage relief and VHI relief squeezed the middle classes again by reducing relief to the standard rate of tax.  Simultaneously there are no bounds to the Government's display of arrogance and extravagance.  The pay rise of over 17 per cent is out of line with all Government policies on pay control.</P>
      <P>Where are the socialist principles of equality and social justice when the total increase for a widow in a year is £93.60?  I have to say, if we are calling a spade a spade, that what has not come out so far in the public debate is that Ministers not only have a whopping salary, they also have a chauffered Mercedes with two full-time chauffeurs and get an expense allowance of £5,640 on top of a TD constituency allowance.  We are talking about an additional tax free perk of £8,000 to ice the cake.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder the Government was able, with alacrity, to put together a sub-committee to mediate on difficulties between the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach.  There is the imperative to cling together so that they can reap the full rewards of what has been backdated to 1 March and will be paid on 1 April.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the Minister's amendment in replying to the debate because I am fascinated to know what the Minister will say.  He and I know there is a problem of low pay in the public service.  Before this award in the four year period between 1987 and 1992, a clerical officer, a clerk typist, the lowest grade had received a pay increase of 36 per cent while the pay of secretaries of Departments went up by 101 per cent. Already the rich are getting richer under Fianna Fáil in office.  Then we have the international comparison.  I thank <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> for its invaluable research in converting it into Irish punts and so on.  We are acknowledged to be the third poorest country in Europe.</P>

      <P>This research includes the inflators and deflators and gives the full benefit of the ministerial increases.  We see that the poor Greeks only get one-third of what Deputy Reynolds gets.  A Government spokesman said we were not comparing like with like when comparing the Taoiseach's salary with that of John Major.  Of course that is true as John Major has a far more onerous schedule, a far bigger economy to run and many more global interests.  John Major is worth much more money, but Albert has to get £18,000 more and, of course, Dick has to get substantially more than most prime ministers.</P>
      <P>The last laugh I got out of this was when I picked up the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning and saw the Fine Gael motion described as a cynical measure. I find it difficult to take lectures on cynicism from a Government Minister who tried to slip this through knowing that news coverage of the IRA ceasefire would deluge the front pages of the papers.  It was a deliberate attempt to camouflage and hide from the public a level of self-indulgence that can only be described as startling and outrageous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;acknowledges the independent and expert role performed by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector over the last 25 years in providing advice on remuneration levels to the Government at various times,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;recognises that it has been the policy of various Governments to accept and implement the recommendations of the Review Body and that the Government accepted in principle the recommendations in Report No. 35 of the Review Body when that <Col N="1415" /> Report was published in 1992, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;supports the implementation of the recommendations in respect of all groups dealt with in Report No. 35, without exception, on the deferred phasing basis, extending over 1994 and 1995, decided on by the Government, this approach being in line with arrangements for other similar cases agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the context of the negotiation the Pay Agreement which forms part of <i>The Programme for Competitiveness and Work.&rdquo;</i></P>
    <P>The amendment sets out for the information of the House that we are dealing with pay increases which were recommended by an independently constituted and expert review body, the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, that similarly recommended increases have in the past always been implemented as a matter of policy by the Government of the day, that the recommendations we are now dealing with are those in Review Body Report No. 35 which were made in 1992 and accepted then by the Government and that, therefore, implementation of the recommendations has already been deferred by two years.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks the support of the House for implementation of the recommendations, in full, on the phased basis decided on and approved by the Government.  This involves payment of a series of increases recommended from 1992 and payable in 1994-1995.  It extends still further into the future the element of deferral for these awards.  It is pointed out that full implementation of the increases is in accordance with the wishes of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who raised the matter at the conclusion of negotiations on the pay agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> except that a greater degree of <Col N="1416" /> deferral is being applied than Congress would have wished.</P>
    <P>So that the House will be aware of the amount of expenditure at issue in the motion, I would point out that if the increases referred to were deferred for a full year the amount involved would be some £170,000 which represents 0.004 per cent of the Exchequer pay bill.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I would like to take Deputies back to the days before the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector was established in 1969.  At that stage, there was no mechanism whereby a totally objective and independent assessment could be made of the appropriate pay levels for top politicians, senior members of the Judicary, top civil servants and chief executives of State-sponsored bodies and other State agencies.</P>
    <P>The main source of advice in relation to administrative and executive posts had to come from top civil servants who, with the best will in the world, were not in a position to take a global and detached view of the situation. They were faced with a particularly difficult task and no matter what advice they gave they could always be accused of being wrong.  Their colleagues could accuse them of being too conservative in their own case and other top people in the public sector could feel that they did not have a sufficiently satisfactory appreciation of their particular job and of the level of remuneration that should apply to it.  In the eyes of the public at large they could be accused of having an undue influence in determining their own rates of pay.</P>
    <P>Making recommendations in relation to elected representatives &mdash; both ordinary Members and office holders &mdash; was, of course, particularly difficult. This was usually done by seeking the advice of a Committee of the Dáil or Dáil and Seanad.  This could hardly have been regarded as an objective method.</P>
    <P>The problems in relation to the provision of advice were, however, secondary to the problems posed for Government in relation to the taking of <Col N="1417" /> decisions on the levels of remuneration that should apply to top posts in the public sector.  In the first place, pressure would come from time to time to increase rates in different parts of the public sector.  One day it could be senior civil servants as a result of the implementation of an arbitration finding for staff lower down.  Another day, it could be county managers for a similar reason, or because of other developments in their own area.  Another time, it might be the chief executive of a major State-sponsored body where changed circumstances were felt to warrant a major revision of pay.  Deputies will appreciate that while taking decisions on this <i>ad hoc</i> basis might solve the problems of the day it led, inevitably, to the creation of other problems across the board.  The whole scene was unsatisfactory all round &mdash; it was haphazard and unco-ordinated.</P>
    <P>Another major problem for the Government lay, of course, in the area of their being sole arbiters on the salaries that should be paid to themselves and their fellow politicians.  While this was a very difficult problem for the Government in the first place, Members of this House were also faced with a situation whereby they would have to enact in legislation every single increase in remuneration not only for office holders but for themselves as well, without having the benefit of transparently objective advice.</P>
    <P>Against this background the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector was established by the Government 25 years ago in order to address the problems I have outlined. Over the years the review body has achieved a very high standard of expertise and objectivity, and its recommendations have invariably been implemented.  While its findings are not, of course, binding, the Government of the day would have to have very good reason to set them aside in the case of any group.  It is always open to the Government to decide to delay implementation and this has been done in the past, and in the present case.  However, <Col N="1418" /> this can only apply within limits, otherwise the value and standing of this independent body is undermined and rendered worthless.  Deferrals, in all honesty, merely defer the payments that have been agreed as equitable and just. What possible sense, not to mention equity, could there be in so delaying awards as to make them worthless with regard to the very terms of reference on which they were based.</P>
    <P>On this occasion the Government was dealing with Report 35 of the independent review body which made recommendations in relation to the remuneration of all top level posts in the public sector, including Government Ministers. The review body, which constituted eminent members drawn from the legal, industrial, commercial and agricultural segments of the private sector as well as two members from the Labour Court, recommended on this occasion that some 55 posts at the apex of the group of 650 with which they were dealing should receive substantially higher increases than the others.  This was the view of the review body and they came to that view without any input whatsoever from the Government.</P>
    <P>The review body indicates in its report that, in conducting its review, it carried out a survey, as on previous occasions, of the remuneration levels of posts in private sector organisations. These included indigenous public and private companies, financial organisations, agricultural co-operatives and subsidiaries of foreign companies operating here.  In addition it examined available published information on executive salaries in the private sector, data in relation to movements in the CPI and average industrial earnings, and information which was provided in the various written and oral submissions.</P>
    <P>In making comparison with posts in the private sector the review body took account of not only basic salary but also other benefits in cash or in kind.  It also took account of the different cultures <Col N="1419" /> pertaining in the public and private sectors, making due allowance for factors like job security, and the strong sense of public service commitment among people serving in the public service.  It was also acutely aware of the particular difficulties that pertain in determining appropriate levels of remuneration for elected representatives.</P>
    <P>The review body accepted that the responsibilities and workload of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Ministers and Ministers of State had increased very considerably in recent years as a result of a wide range of factors, including the increasing growth in the volume and complexity of public administration, the increased emphasis on achieving consensus with the social partners in relation to economic and social policy, and the increasing demands of the parliamentary system.  It said that it has been particularly concerned with the need to ensure that the levels of remuneration for the very top posts within its remit, might more realistically reflect the heavy burdens of responsibility involved, and the extraordinary demands which are made on the holders of these positions.  It considered that the current rates of remuneration payable to members of the Government failed to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>These statements from the review body are a clear indication of the thoroughness, objectivity and sense of fairness which it brought to its task.  The resulting recommendations are extremely well grounded.</P>
    <P>As regards the actual rates which are the subject of the motion, nobody in this House could argue with any degree of conviction that the rates are excessive by reference to what would be paid in the private sector for jobs with comparable levels of demands on the job-holder, in terms of time and range and level of responsibility.  Members' knowledge and experience will bear this out and I would hope that those who are <Col N="1420" /> supporting the motion would have the grace and courage to at least admit this and acknowledge that they are playing a political game.</P>
    <P>Recent experience in the public sector bears out the point I am making.  In recent times it was necessary to go to the open market to recruit chief executives for some of our major commercial State bodies.  To secure the appointment of those of the calibre needed it was necessary to agree a remuneration package well in excess of the rates which are at issue in the motion, even though members of the Government to whom these rates would apply are required to exercise overall responsibility over the companies in question.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the review body recommendations, the Government had a number of options open to it.  It could have rejected the findings in total, it could have deferred any decision for a further period, it could have accepted the recommendations in part or it could have accepted them in full.</P>
    <P>It seems as if there never is a good time to give public servants a pay rise and Members of the House will note with great interest those who are opposed to the granting of these objectively-merited increases.</P>
    <P>To reject the findings in total would have been unprecedented in the 25 year history of the review body.  As Members will be aware, and as I have said, determining remuneration levels for themselves, politicians generally and top level posts in the Judiciary, Civil Service, Garda, Army, local authorities and health boards, harbour authorities and State-sponsored bodies has always, over the years, posed problems for the Government of the day.  It was to help solve these problems that the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector was established.  Since its inception 25 years ago, the review body has produced four general reports on the remuneration levels that should apply to the groups covered by its remit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> The recommendations in the first three reports were implemented by various Governments, in each case after an interval.  What happened in relation to the fourth report also followed that pattern.  That report was published in July 1992 and at that time the Government announced that the findings were acceptable in principle.  Much later, in August 1994, the Government announced that the recommendations would be implemented, but on a phased basis, with the first phase applying from 1 April 1994 and the second from 1 May 1995 &mdash; more than three full years after the report was presented.  Neither in July 1992 nor at any stage up to August 1994, when it was announced that the findings would be implemented, did the Opposition parties indicate that the findings should be rejected or, indeed, modified in any way.  If I was politically bad-minded, which I am not, I would put on the record the reason that happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not bother. Purely partisan meanness and play-acting is behind this motion.  Not in July 1992 when the validity of the claim was accepted, not in July 1993 and not in August 1994 when we announced a phased implementation of the awards was there a call for a rejection of these impartial findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To reject the findings would have made nonsense of the existence of the review body.  It would also have gone against the express wishes of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, a body that speaks for a majority of the workers in this State.  In the context earlier this year of finalising the pay agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> Congress leaders sought a specific undertaking from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste <Col N="1422" /> that the review body findings would be implemented.  This request was made by Congress on the basis that the review body report should be treated in the same way as a number of &ldquo;past the post&rdquo; Labour Court or arbitration findings which had already been accepted in principle.  These were to be implemented under special phasing arrangements outside the strict terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Congress was given an undertaking that the review body report would be implemented without exception and this has been done.</P>
    <P>While the Government could have put off implementation further, this would amount to no more than postponing an award, and in the meantime many of the groups covered by the report &mdash; and we are talking here about people filling key posts in the public sector, including ordinary Members of this House and the Seanad &mdash; would feel a growing sense of grievance and frustration that their position was being ignored.  For the past two years the all-party groups have been asking me to implement the report.  In view of the fact that the report was already on hands for two years, and in the light of the representations made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, postponing indefinitely a decision on implementing the findings contained in Report No. 35 was not a real option in so far as the Government was concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards a partial implementation only of the review body recommendations, this would have been an option when the Government was dealing with the question of implementation in July 1994 but there were cogent reasons against it.</P>
    <P>It is important that the review body findings should be regarded as a coherent unified statement of the levels at which the groups covered by its remit should be remunerated and should be regarded as being acceptable on a global basis.  Selectively to pick and choose <Col N="1423" /> from the overall package would be tantamount to a qualified rejection and could lead to the whole package becoming unravelled.</P>
    <P>All groups have already experienced severe deferment.  The first phase of the 1992 report was not being implemented until 1994, with full implementation deferred further until the middle of 1995.  It would not make sense to push any aspect of implementation out further, particularly in view of the fact that the next review is due to commence in 1995, with the report due in 1996. Members on all sides will have great interest in that report.</P>
    <P>The overall approach on this occasion was for the review body to recommend higher increases for those at the top of each grouping covered by the review body.  The following percentage increases illustrate this point: chief executives of the larger State bodies, 13 per cent to 30 per cent; chief executives of the smaller bodies, nil; secretaries of Government Departments, 17 per cent; assistant secretaries, 1 per cent; Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, 9 per cent; assistant commissioner, 4 per cent; chief justice, 17 per cent; district justice, 8 per cent.</P>

      <P>In the case of politicians, this approach is reflected in the recommendations.  Members of the <Col N="1424" /> Government are bracketed with the higher posts in the other groups at 17 per cent with the non-office holding Members of the Dáil being placed at just less than 4 per cent.  If the Government was to forgo the increases recommended in its own case, this would result in an imbalance in the relative position of politicians with the rates being paid to the top people in the other groups.  What the Fine Gael motion is saying in effect is that the Government should have put the profession of the office-holder at a disadvantage with that of other groups; in other words, devalue the worth of the office-holder.</P>
      <P>Future holders of these positions from the benches opposite are free now to announce their own decision to forgo and refuse to accept these increases when they take up the offices that we now hold.</P>

      <P>I have always accepted in public life, both as Minister for Labour and Minister for Finance, that agreements freely entered into by consenting social partners should be fairly implemented.  If the Members opposite feel that these increases are unwarranted, let them refuse to avail of them in their own case.  In all fairness I must implement the independently arrived at review and enforce it on a phased basis. That is only right and proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what I have outlined, I think every Deputy will accept that when the Government came to take a decision in July 1994 on a report issued in 1992 which was based on factual data for 1991 it had no real option but to implement the recommendations in full. It was fully conscious of the circumstances generally in which it was taking its decision and so decided to slow down implementation by phasing it into 1995. That was a significant step.  To have gone beyond it would not have made <Col N="1425" /> sense.  In particular, the singling out of any group, no matter who, for further deferment would not have been regarded as acceptable.</P>
    <P>In the light of the position I have outlined, I see the motion tabled by Deputies Bruton and Yates as a cynical attempt to make a political issue out of what all Governments during the past 25 years have always regarded as a difficult area for them to handle.  It is a shabby effort to further denigrate our difficult profession of politics.  Where is the spirit of personal sacrifice among the members of Fine Gael that they wish unilaterally to impose on Members on this side of the House?  It is also cynical for another reason.</P>

      <P>Section 8 of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members and Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices) (Amendment) Act, 1983 provides that the Government order of 30 August 1994 which gives effect to the review body increases for politicians, including Ministers, be laid before Dáil Éireann.  The section goes on to say that if a resolution annulling the order is passed by Dáil Éireann within the next 21 sitting days the order shall be annulled from the date of the passing of such a resolution.  The particular order referred to, which was laid before the Dáil on 30 August 1994 in accordance with the provisions I have referred to, also provides for an increase in the personal remuneration of each Member of this House of 3.8 per cent or some £1,000 and of 7.6 per cent or some £20,000 for Deputy Bruton in his capacity as Leader of the main Opposition party.  This is known as the party fund.  It is cynical in the extreme that Deputy Bruton did not take his courage in his hands and endeavour to wipe the slate clean of all the special <Col N="1426" /> increases emanating from the review body recommendations by moving a motion to annul the order.  I will leave it to Deputies themselves, and to the general public, to form their own views as to why Deputy Bruton did not adopt this course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to address some of the points raised by the Fine Gael motion.  A point is made about &ldquo;the current industrial relations difficulties in State companies&rdquo;.  I take it that, given the date on which the motion was tabled, 22 September 1994, this related in the main to Irish Steel and TEAM Aer Lingus.  Since then I am happy to note that the problems in these two companies have been largely resolved and that we can all look forward to a bright future for them.</P>
      <P>As regards the other point &mdash;&ldquo;maintaining control of public expenditure and improving the competitiveness of our economy&rdquo;&mdash; these are major goals of which I, as Minister for Finance, am continually conscious.  In no way would I see the pay increases in question having a negative impact in this area.  The Government would not have taken the decision it did on implementation if there were any risk on this front.  In this context the standing terms of reference of the review body requires it, in making its recommendations, to have regard to the state of the public finances and Government pay policy.  I am fully satisfied that the eminent members of the independently constituted review body had full regard to these factors when making their recommendations in 1992.</P>
      <P>The motion proposes the deferment of the increases but the increases have already been deferred to a considerable extent.  This is illustrated by the fact that: the recommendations in question were based on the outcome of a review of salaries carried out in 1991; the review body report was published early in 1992; a decision to implement the recommendations was not taken until July 1994 and payments are phased over 1994 and 1995, the second phase not being paid until May 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To push deferment beyond that, either generally or in relation to any specific group, would make a nonsense of the whole report and of the review body.  This is particularly so when we <Col N="1429" /> consider that the next review is due to get underway in 1995 with the report due in 1996.</P>
    <P>Many unworthy and personalised remarks have been made in this debate about the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. They are as unworthy as the squalid motives of their perpetrators.  In the business world, on the shop floor and in the public sector, performance-related pay is an increasingly important feature of incentives to working people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me correct Deputy Yates on some of the matters he got wrong.</P>
      <P>Incomplete information has been published regarding the remuneration of other Prime Ministers.  First, virtually every Prime Minister in the European Union, with the exception of Ireland, has one or more official residences with staff provided.  The British Prime Minister has a country house as well as 10 Downing Street.  Many of the figures published in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> last week are for the Prime Minister's salary only and exclude his salary as a Deputy. Deputy Yates excluded their salaries as Deputies in the figures he quoted.  We must compare like with like.  For example, the Belgian Prime Minister gets £88,000 on this basis and an official residence and not £44,700.  Equally, the Danish Prime Minister gets £87,000 and not £44,000 as suggested in the article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> and has the use of an official residence.  We understand that the Greek Prime Minister gets a very substantial personal allowance, the size of which is not in the public domain, but a six figure sum which brings his emolument above the level of the Taoiseach's.</P>
      <P>Practically all the European Prime Ministers are in the £80,000 to £100,000 pay range, with the crucial difference that the other Prime Ministers have an official residence provided, which is a valuable form of benefit in kind.  For instance, Belgian MPs get a housing allowance of £1,000 per month.  The Prime Minister's housing allowance in kind must be considered to be at least as good, and this would bring his salary up to £100,000.  Outside the European Union, the Australian Prime Minister is paid £136,000.  These facts are in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> The notion that the Taoiseach is better remunerated than his counterparts is simply unsustainable.  Taking into account the benefit in kind of an official residence, he will now be paid at a comparable level to the vast majority of his colleagues around the European Council table.  This is surely, as it should be.</P>
    <P>I wish to give my few remaining minutes to my colleague Deputy Sean Power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputy Power will be looked after in the reshuffle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>An impartial review body decided to award increases to 600 people but following much media coverage the party opposite decided to table the motion before us tonight.</P>
      <P>The debate focused on two people in the main, the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach and to a lesser extent on Ministers.  It is unfortunate that we cannot debate the issue without pensonalising it.  Deputy John Bruton went out of his way to paint a picture of the Taoiseach as untrustworthy and someone who should not hold this position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

All Irish people feel very proud of this achievement and we will always owe him a debt of gratitude for his efforts in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We often refer to the low esteem in which politicians are held and to the cynicism of the electorate but this debate does not help the situation.  We have tried to compare the remuneration of the Taoiseach to that of other Prime Ministers, however the rewards offered by the private sector to somebody holding a similar position would be far greater.  I would go even further, most people accept that the Taoiseach and <Col N="1433" /> the Tánaiste would be better off in the private sector.</P>

      <P>It is grossly irresponsible for any Taoiseach, Tánaiste or any set of Ministers to vote themselves annual increases of this magnitude at any time, even at the best of times.  It is little short of obscene that they should choose to do so at this juncture.  It is a time of maximum challenge and worry for every worker in the commercial State sector as their companies struggle to come to terms with the open market and the competitive environment of the post-Maastricht European Union.  I refer to the rationalisation that has already taken place in a number of State companies and is due to take place in a number of others.  I refer specifically to the problems of Irish Steel as they <Col N="1434" /> occurred in my area.  I wish to pay tribute to Deputy Mulvihill for the very active and sustained part he played in trying to bring about a successful settlement of the problems in Irish Steel.</P>

      <P>In Irish Steel the company attempted to put in place an £8.4 million cost saving survival plan.  Months of negotiation took place which rocked the community of Cobh to its foundations. The demands made on them sent shock waves down the spines of the workers in Irish Steel because of the extent of the sacrifices they were called upon to make to ensure the plant's survival and the retention of some of the jobs.  The shedding of jobs, in addition to pay freezes, was recommended in the context of that survival plan.  The workers put their country and their company first and made the sacrifices.  They accepted the job shedding and the pay freezes to enable the plant to be saved and by so doing they gave some cause for optimism.</P>
      <P>Where was the Minister for Enterprise and Employment during this crisis in Irish Steel?  Did he play a proactive role in this process?  He did not. Like Louis XIV he stood back in splendid isolation and let the whole process take its course.  Everybody knows that if he had travelled to Cork and played a more active role that final resolution would have been brought about in a speedier way and a great amount of taxpayers' money would have been saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When all this trauma was taking place in Irish Steel, where were the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste?  They were jetting around the world, passing one another in mid air, one going east while the other was going west.  If there is a precedent in history for this kind of cavalier behaviour, it can only come from the <Col N="1435" /> Bourbons of France in the days leading up to the French Revolution when Marie Antoinette, from a distance, said: &ldquo;Let them eat cake&rdquo;.  That was how this Government behaved during the traumatic events in Cork.</P>
    <P>What happened in Cork, to one degree or another, is due to be repeated throughout the State commercial sector, company by company.  The ESB already has its own cost saving plan on the table involving, I understand, the shedding of approximately 2,900.  Bord Telecom is heading for an even greater challenge. Aer Lingus is at the beginning of a viability plan and the list goes on.  There is one factor, however, that all of these companies have in common.  In the case of each company major sacrifices will be demanded.  There will be pain not only for the workers but for their families also, who will be expected to put in place in their households vastly reduced budgets.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances the Government should seize the opportunity to give good example, to give leadership and decide that on this occasion they will forgo these huge salary increases. What standing has a Minister when he addresses a conference or a seminar and recommends, as he does, that they tighten their belts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being asked to except this small group of privileged people.  If there was ever a time since the foundation of the State when a Government had an opportunity to give leadership, to point the way and to create an environment within which all these rationalisation programmes could be put in place and where the suffering could at least be made a little more palatable to the workers, the time is now. The Government passed up this opportunity.  It is totally out of touch with what is happening in the country and what is due to happen.</P>
      <P>I would argue that in a republic there should not be such a disparity between the earnings of one sector and another, all of whom are paid out of the public purse.  Consider, for example, the Taoiseach's annual increase which amounts to almost £14,000.  The Tánaiste's annual increase is £12,304.  How does that compare with the annual income of other workers in the public sector?  A young member of the Garda Síochána, after three years on the beat, risking his life against a rising tide of crime, is paid £13,261.  That figure is substantially less than the annual increase we are giving to the Taoiseach.  That is the topping up he is being given in addition to an already sizeable salary.  A qualified nurse charged with life and death duties in a hospital who has completed three years training receives an annual salary of £13,552.  That is less than the annual increase we are now giving to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The picture is broadly similar in the case of teachers.  A qualified primary teacher must be teaching for three years before the annual salary exceeds the level of the salary increase to the Taoiseach.  The same broadly applies in the case of secondary school teachers.  The Taoiseach's pay rise is greater than the average industrial wage.  Thousands of <Col N="1437" /> families must rear, clothe and feed their children with an annual income which is less than the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as if the Taoiseach is badly paid.  He was earning £82,000 so he was not doing badly when one considers that there are 300,000 people out of work in this little Republic and that our GDP is not exactly at the top of the EC league and does not compare with the GDP in countries the Minister took for comparative salary purposes.  The Taoiseach will receive an annual increase in excess of what we pay a young garda, nurse, teacher or worker on an average industrial wage.  Surely that is the ultimate obscenity in a country that calls itself a Republic.</P>
      <P>How can the Government insist that public sector workers must confine their pay demands to the level of inflation, in other words to 2.5 or 3 per cent when they blithely award themselves pay rises of 17 per cent and are already in receipt of hefty salaries?  How can the Government with its sizeable Labour element tell workers on an average industrial wage of £13,100 that they must forego pay rises while Ministers with free ministerial cars, offices, office staff and a host of other perks are paid salary increases in excess of 17 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that this is a Government in exile and it is in the truly quintessential meaning of that word because it is in exile from the people.  It is out of <Col N="1438" /> touch with the reality of everyday life lived by the majority of citizens.  It is a Government of gross extravagance, living wildly beyond our means and has done so since assuming office.  Highly paid programme managers earn £40,000 a year.  I said before that if the Government had decided to appoint an equivalent number of judges to district courts the position in regard to crime and its horrendous consequences for citizens would be different.  If its priorities had been right the Government would have appointed judges instead of programme managers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been out of the country on 36 occasions since he took office in 1993.  Consider the cost of that to taxpayers.</P>

      <P>While he is topping up his tan think of the workers roasting in Irish Steel and TEAM Aer Lingus.  We live in a strange country.  The Dáil has resumed after a lengthy recess but the Government has not put a legislative programme in place for this session.  I have been a Member of the House for eight and a half years and this is the first time I could not get a copy of the legislative programme for the new session. I believed the Government would have prepared the Juvenile Justice Bill but there is no evidence that it will be brought before the Dáil in this session despite the fact that 40 per cent of all crime is committed by juveniles with horrendous consequences for the victims and for the young people themselves who are doing untold and irreversible damage to their prospects. Despite that we are still working under juvenile justice legislation enacted in 1908.  It is not as if the groundwork for the Bill had not been done.  An all party committee which I chaired spent six months putting firm recommendations in place which would form the basis of <Col N="1439" /> this long overdue and badly needed Bill. Yet there is no indication that such a Bill will be put on the agenda.</P>
      <P>What about the Waste Management Bill so badly needed and long overdue? We all see the rubbish on our streets, unauthorised dumping and the failure to use modern technologies to deal with waste and refuse in the manner of other European countries.  The bones of that Bill were put in place by Deputy Harney as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  The Bill was practically brought to fruition when the Coalition Government was brought down by the comments and behaviour of the Taoiseach.  Will this Government be brought down by similar behaviour before the Waste Management Bill comes before the House?  The Minister for Arts and Culture promised the broadcasting Bill but there is no sign of that on the agenda for this session.  That is how the Government orders business for this House.  Deputies have come back from their holidays prepared to tackle new legislation and bring existing legislation up to date.  I have never seen such a cavalier approach by a Government since I was elected to the House.</P>
      <P>The Government is out of touch with what people are saying and thinking.  It is so caught up with projecting itself in the media and looking towards the camera that it has forgotten to look at the people who voted for it.  It has left the electorate behind and unless it changes its tune there will be a vastly different result at the next election.  However that is no consolation to the taxpayers who are called on to foot the bill for these huge pay increases which have been brought into being.  It is no argument for the Minister for Finance to say that the Taoiseach is worth every penny he gets. How does one measure the work of a Taoiseach?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.  It has been said that the best servants of the people, like the best valets, whisper unpleasant truths into their masters' ears.  It is a matter of some regret that in the case of the Tánaiste his advisers did not heed this advice; rather they allowed him effectively to endorse the codification of tax fraud, and the country is still paying the price.  The Exchequer may well have lost out financially on other tax revenues which could have been collected were it not for the diversion of staff.  Overall the Exchequer has possibly lost out to the tune of several hundred million pounds &mdash; the difference between the 15 per cent bargain basement rate and what would have been collected if these staff had not been diverted.  It is hardly surprising that the details are being kept under wraps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most damaging political blow wielded by Fianna Fáil on the reputation of the Labour Party during the past ten days was the deliberate and calculated leaking by sources close to the Taoiseach of the quiescent stance of Labour Ministers at Cabinet when the tax amnesty came up for approval.  We have the Taoiseach's word for it that with the exception of the Minister for <Col N="1442" /> Finance not one Minister complained about the implementation of the tax amnesty.  Labour Party supporters and compliant taxpayers will find it unbelievable that not one of the six Labour Ministers around the Cabinet table raised a murmur of dissent when this charter for cheats and criminals was put in place, a charter which was subsequently availed of by the Goodman organisation which professionally organised the biggest tax evasion scam in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>This is not just a question of financial loss to the State, it also relates to the damage caused to our moral credibility. The granting of an amnesty to those who deliberately set out to avoid paying their fair share of tax was wrong in 1989 and in 1993 when the Labour Party gave it its imprimatur.  Tax evasion is not a mere misdemeanour, it is a crime.  Every pound in tax avoided is an extra pound on the tax burden of compliant taxpayers, ordinary citizens whom the Government promised to champion.</P>
    <P>Last year was a bad one for the taxpayer.  There was a threat that the tax system would be undermined as a result of the implementation of the Waiver of Certain Tax Interest and Penalties Act, 1993.  The Constitution is a masterpiece of brevity and clarity on this point.  It clearly sets out the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; he shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of Dáil Éireann and shall report to Dáil Éireann.  It is clear that the constitutional status of the office held by the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot be undermined by laws passed by this House.</P>
    <P>In regard to his report, the Comptroller and Auditor General has said he was informed by the Revenue Commissioners that &ldquo;whatever about the formal legal position, it was their view that the publication of the carrying out of such an exercise and of the comments based on it would call into question the fundamental confidentiality arrangements on which the incentive amnesty was based&rdquo;, This is a reference to the <Col N="1443" /> attempts by the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out on a random sample basis an analysis of certain data concerning the efficacy of the tax amnesty.  It appears that he has been obstructed from doing his work in the manner he is entitled to do as a constitutional officer of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was alone among his Cabinet colleagues in opposing the tax amnesty.  This explains the timidity with which he put the measure through the House.  However, he managed to extend it without ever giving us a credible explanation as to why he was doing so.  Having regard to the information which has come to light, one wonders why he did.</P>
    <P>This is an issue which requires more explanation.  Can the Minister assure the House that, irrespective of any requirements of confidentiality legislated for by this House, the Comptroller and Auditor General, as a constitutional officer of the State, will not be obstructed in carrying out such analysis as he feels is necessary to measure the effectiveness of the tax amnesty as against people who previously availed of the 1989 tax amnesty and what would have been yielded if the ordinary tax collection system of the State was allowed to do its job in the normal fashion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to set the record straight on this matter and I thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising it. There is no question of the Revenue Commissioners hampering or refusing to assist the Comptroller and Auditor General in carrying out his duties. Before going into detail, it is necessary to recall the background to the amnesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent tax amnesty scheme was provided for, and implemented in accordance with, the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, which was passed by the Oireachtas in July of that year.  As Deputies are aware, the amnesty arrangements <Col N="1444" /> resulted in the securing of £260 million for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that the amnesty scheme effectively contained two types of amnesty: an incentive amnesty, for individuals only, under which they could settle their tax liabilities up to 15 April 1991 by paying 15 per cent of the relevant income or gains and a general amnesty under which both companies and individuals could settle liabilities by paying the tax in full but without interest or penalties.  There were a number of exclusions, broadly related to cases at investigation or enforcement at the time the amnesty was announced.</P>
    <P>It was recognised that a key to the success of the amnesty, especially as regards people with undisclosed income who did not avail of the 1988 amnesty to any significant extent, was to provide guaranteed confidentiality for participants.  This was to give an assurance that people could put their tax affairs in order through the 15 per cent incentive amnesty without any question of being marked out subsequently for Revenue attention.</P>
    <P>To give effect to this fundamental aspect of the amnesty, special arrangements were put in place under the legislation.  These involved the establishment of a special office distinct from revenue's normal operations &mdash; the office of the chief special collector &mdash; to deal with applications for the incentive amnesty.  The arrangements are set out in section 7 of the 1993 Act.  The special office was headed by the chief special collector and staffed by special collectors, all of whom were required to make declarations of confidentiality over and above the normal Revenue confidentiality obligations.  There was to be no contact with, or provision of information to, normal Revenue officials except in clearly defined circumstances, that is, the validation of declarations and payments under the incentive amnesty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> Notwithstanding the confidentiality requirements, the legislation allowed information on the operation and outcome of the amnesty to be made available in certain circumstances.  It allowed certain information, in aggregate form, to be given to the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissiones.  It also allowed the provision of such information to the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Accounting Officer of the Revenue Commissioners as they might reasonably require to ensure that special collection functions have been discharged in accordance with the Act. Section 7 (5) states that, where such information is provided, it may be used only to ensure that special collection functions have been carried out properly.  The proviso to section 7 (5) indicates that the relevant provisions shall not prevent the Comptroller and Auditor General from carrying out his functions, including exercising his reporting duty to Dáil Éireann.  This proviso was inserted by my Department after consultation and in agreement with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Thus, the provisions were intended to protect the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General, while safeguarding confidentiality for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <P>It is in the operation of these provisions that the difference of opinion to which the Deputy refers, and which is elaborated upon in the recently published 1993 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, has emerged.  As well as carrying out an audit of the Office of the Chief Special Collector, the Comptroller and Auditor General sought to use the outcome of the incentive amnesty to check on the effectiveness of Revenue's normal procedures for collection of taxes.  He did this by using sampling methods which compared information obtained from the Chief Special Collector's Office with data on Revenue's normal records.  I should make it clear that, as he has <Col N="1446" /> stated publicly, the Comptroller and Auditor General was not obstructed in any way by the Revenue Commissioners in carrying out this sampling. Indeed, the Revenue Commissioners first became aware of this sampling when they were asked for comments on the draft report prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>In subsequent correspondence, the Revenue Commissioners expressed concerns about the carrying out of the sampling exercise and the proposed publication of material based on it.  The Commissioners made clear that, in expressing these concerns, they had no desire to challenge the role and functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General and that the decision on material to be included in the report was a matter for him.  The Revenue Commissioners have always co-operated fully with the Comptroller and Auditor General in his assessment of the normal Revenue collection procedures and the Comptroller and Auditor General has full access to all the data available on the normal activities of Revenue.</P>
    <P>In this instance, however, the Commissioners had to be conscious of the fact that the amnesty legislation is placed under their care and management.  They were concerned that sampling of information in the manner envisaged and publication could, directly or indirectly, lead to a breach of the embargo on the communication of data from the Office of the Chief Special Collector to other parts of Revenue or elsewhere.  The Revenue Commissioners raised a question about whether the legislation envisaged solely an audit of the operations of the Chief Special Collector's Office or could be used for the purposes of a wider check of Revenue's normal operations which, as I have mentioned already, are in any event subject to ongoing audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. <Col N="1447" /> They also questioned the appropriateness of publication of comments and analysis based on the sampling exercise. The Chief Special Collector expressed similar concerns and indicated that he had pointed out to the auditor that the access he had allowed to information in his office was solely for the purpose of the audit of the operations of his office.</P>
    <P>It will be very clear from what I have said that there is no wish on the part of either Revenue or the Government to frustrate the Comptroller and Auditor General in his important duties.  It is also clear that Revenue had reasonable grounds for raising the points it did in regard to the operation of section 7 of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has indicated that he is seeking legal advice on the relevant provisions of section 7 of the 1993 Act in this regard and Revenue has welcomed this. We must await the outcome of that consultation.  It is important to note that, whatever that outcome, the Comptroller and Auditor General has emphasised in a public statement that there is no question of publication of information on details of individuals who availed of the amnesty.</P>
    <P>I hope that this has helped clarify the position to the satisfaction of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, one of the most serious maritime disasters in recent years occurred a fortnight ago with the sinking of the car ferry <i>Estonia</i> when, sadly, many hundreds of lives were lost.  Such a tragedy must give rise to serious concerns about the safety levels in the construction and operation of car ferries, including those which carry thousands of Irish people in and out of this country daily.  Sadly, the <i>Estonia</i> disaster constitutes but another sad chapter in ferry disasters.  Indeed. <Col N="1448" /> one might well predict that another such tragedy could be expected in six or seven years' time based on their record to date.</P>
      <P>We must decide that we cannot await another such tragedy, that as a country requiring ferry services, we must lead the way in pressing for an investigation of the cause or causes of these accidents and, more important, how they can be avoided in the future.  We must ask why, with all the modern technology available, today's car ferries can sink much faster than, say, the huge vessel the <i>Titanic</i> which sank in the early part of this century.  I am told that that ship took approximately two-and-a-half hours to sink whereas today's ro-ro ferries can sink within minutes.  Therefore, it has to be acknowledged that many of today's passenger ships have become less rather than more safe.</P>
      <P>At European Union level the Minister for the Marine must demand that the infrastructure/construction of these car ferries be altered.  For example, longitudinal bulkheads, which I am told are standard in vessels other than car ferries, must be installed on car ferries. That would be costly but not as expensive as a loss of life.  A case must be made for sufficient European Union funding for the relevant ferry companies to ensure that such infrastructural change can be effected.  In the aftermath of the <i>Estonia</i> disaster we will have to seek and obtain clarification on the bow door closing arrangements and options.  We were told by the Minister for the Marine last week that all the ferries operating in and out of Ireland use a system different from that on the <i>Estonia.</i> I should like confirmation from the Minister on that point because I am told that some ferries coming into and leaving our ports operate the same system as was used on the <i>Estonia.</i> We must ascertain which system is best and ensure that it is implemented, not on some, but on all such ferries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also investigate the system of emergency evacuation from ferries in <Col N="1449" /> distress.  For example, we must question the usage of life rafts in addition to life boats.  I am informed that in recent times there has been greater usage of life rafts than life boats, which would appear to be a matter of economics rather than one of safety.  If life rafts are held not to be as useful or safe as life boats, a change in that regard will have to be implemented.  There must be an urgent review of all safety warnings and drills and any outdated rescue equipment replaced by a more modern type.</P>
    <P>Equally important, much clearer guidelines must be issued on the feasibility of ferry travel in extreme weather conditions.  Many Members will know of passengers who travelled in such weather conditions which they found to be very upsetting and difficult.  Clear guidelines must be issued as to the types of weather conditions considered to be unsafe for travel and we must insist on the law being respected in that regard.</P>
    <P>I should like those points clarified as a matter of urgency because many lives have been put and remain at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that all of us in this House share a great sense of shock and sadness at the tragic accident in the Baltic Sea two weeks ago. A message of condolence to the Prime Ministers of Estonia, Finland and Sweden has been sent by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise to Deputies, that while strict safety standards are observed and enforced on Irish ferries, there can never be room for complacency.  Standards will continue to be backed up by a constant process of review and reappraisal by the Department of the Marine, shipping companies and crew.  In addition, we will continue to press for and fully support, further international initiatives to enhance ferry safety.  In the immediate aftermath of the <i>Estonia</i> tragedy the <Col N="1450" /> Minister for the Marine ordered safety checks on all ferries operating into Irish ports.  I can advise Deputies that the outcome of these operational and structural checks has been positive.</P>
    <P>The Marine Survey Office of the Department of the Marine, which is responsible for carrying out safety inspections on ferries, operates a strict year-round inspection programme for all passenger ferries using Irish ports. The inspection programme is designed to ensure compliance with the national and international safety standards and to encourage and enforce a culture of safety, reliability and best practice.</P>
    <P>I can also advise the House that the Minister signed new regulations to give effect to a recent agreement between North West European States which applies passenger ship stability standards in excess of the current International Maritime Organisation requirements.  Ireland and the UK took the lead in this initiative and its implementation will be an important contribution to ferry safety.</P>
    <P>The national ferry safety committee, which is chaired by the chief surveyor of the Department of the Marine, reviews safety standards for passenger ferries operating into Ireland on an ongoing basis and takes full account of international developments.  At the Minister's urgent request, the committee will be meeting in special session next week to asses the implications of the <i>Estonia</i> tragedy, to review all aspects of ro-ro safety and to report to him on the matter.</P>
    <P>Other recent incidents have highlighted the importance of having cargo and vehicles on board ro-ro ferries properly secured, particularly in bad weather.  The Department of the Marine reviews and issues guidelines on securing freight at regular intervals.  These guidelines were reissued to shipping companies following the tragic occurrence in the Baltic. <Col N="1451" /> The International Maritime Organisation announced a priority review of ro-ro safety in the aftermath of the <i>Estonia</i> tragedy.  The review will be carried out by an international panel of experts and will draw on the advice and information available from member states.  The Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, welcomed this initiative by the IMO and Ireland will play a very active part in the work of the panel.  We expect that the review will produce a number of concrete recommendations on key aspects of ferry safety.</P>
    <P>This appalling tragedy has underlined, yet again, the importance of being constantly alert to the need to prevent, predict and pre-empt all risks as far as we humanly can.  We are committed to ensuring a positive outcome to the national and international initiatives on ferry safety which are now underway.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister on 18 May 1994 during the debate on the Estimate for his Department what the prospects were for the proposed new power station.  At that time the Minister <Col N="1452" /> informed me he had received the feasibility study on the project.  He also told me that discussions with the EU Commission on funding the project in the context of the operational programme for energy were in course and expected to conclude by the end of June.</P>
      <P>Since then the new Community Support Framework has been published and confirms a shortfall of £2 billion in the Government's investment projects. Some £2 billion worth of projects which were included in the so-called national plan will have to be cancelled or deferred.  That has given rise to a great deal of trepidation in many areas of the country, not least north Kilare and east Offaly &mdash; the area in which it was proposed to site the new power station. That area has been badly affected in recent years by a number of events which reduced employment and by the failure of the policies of the Government to convert growth into jobs. Employment on the bogs has sharply reduced as the Minister of State is aware.  The power station at Allenwood has been closed and there are fears about employment in other peat burning stations in the midlands area.</P>
      <P>The other enterprise in the region, agriculture, is hedged with so many restrictions that it is almost impossible to do anything new.  The prospects for entire communities in that area are bleak, to say the least.  I had an example of it last Saturday where I was told that in the town of Rathangan alone, a small town on the edge of that area, 13 families have sons or daughters in their late teens or early twenties in the cities of Sydney and Perth.  High emigration is now becoming endemic and is the norm rather than the exception right across the midland region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against that background I and the people of north Kildare and east Offaly want to know the status of this peat fired power station project.  Specifically, can the Minister tell me whether the project is now definitively included in the operational programme for energy and, if not, why?  If the project is <Col N="1453" /> included what European Union funding is allocated to it and what Exchequer funding goes with it?  What steps, if any, is the Minister taking to secure partners for the venture because it was proposed that this would be a joint venture project?  In the event that the project is included in the programme what arrangements are contemplated for the supply of peat to the power station?  I may be anticipating, Sir, but I have a fairly shrewd idea of what the Minister's reply will be.  In the absence of clear and specific answers to those questions I will be forced to the conclusion that the Government has something to hide and that that something can only be bad news for the people of north Kildare and east Offaly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>Is cúis áthais dom an freagra a thabhairt don Teachta Dukes. Bhí mé anseo cúpla uair leis an Teachta agus bíonn an-áthas i gcónaí orm teacht ar ais chun éisteacht lena óráidí.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to inform the House of the latest developments in relation to the proposal to construct a new peat fired power station.  Irish energy policy has three primary objectives: the supply of a choice of fuels, as efficiently as possible, at internationally competitive prices, taking account of supply security, socioeconomic and environmental considerations; the consumption of this energy, as efficiently as possible and the production of as much, as is economically possible of national energy requirements from indigenous sources.</P>
      <P>The use of peat for power generation fits into this policy on all fronts, for three main reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of a discovery of new reserves of natural gas, peat will be Ireland's only significant source of indigenous energy.  The role of peat in providing a secure source of energy will, therefore, become more vital, even though its contribution to our overall needs is relatively small.  By using the <Col N="1454" /> latest technology available and taking advantage of the most modern and efficient methods available for harvesting, peat will be a competitive source of energy, when compared with other fuels, for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>When they were commissioned, the existing peat stations had efficiencies comparable with the alternatives then available and contained wider benefits in terms of supply security, employment and infrastructural support in rural areas.  These benefits remain valid today.</P>
    <P>The fact that efficiencies have advanced in newer alternative power stations provide an incentive to invest in modern peat burning technology.  Not to do so would be tantamount to ignoring a national resource that should be harnessed for the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>Against this background, Board na Móna prepared a feasibility study for the construction of the new station, which would utilise peat resources, that would otherwise not be used to full advantage.  In this connection, I pay tribute to Bord na Móna management and workforce, for its initiative in preparing the proposal.  The enterprising nature of the company is demonstrated by the manner in which the initial study has been progressed.</P>
    <P>The study demonstrated the economic feasibility of the project and the Government has demonstrated its support for the peat industry by including the project in the National Development Plan.  As part of its consideration of our application for Structural Fund assistance, the EU Commission, as is normal for major projects of this kind, requested that an independent socioeconomic cost benefit analysis be carried out.  That study has now been completed and the Commission's formal confirmation of funding support is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>The main features of the proposed station will be a fuel requirement of 1 million tonnes of peat, per annum an <Col N="1455" /> improved conversion efficiency of 36.7 per cent compared to the average of 25.5 per cent in the existing peat stations; the direct employment on a permanent basis, of approximately 90 in the station; the employment of 450 at peak, during construction, involving more than 700 man years in total, with bog preparation work, creating a further 1,120 man years employment; the support of 250 permanent and 250 seasonal jobs, in peat extraction, when fully operational; and a direct income impact of £19 million during operations, the vast bulk of which, will accrue to the local economy.</P>
    <P>I pay special tribute to my Government colleague, Deputy Cowen, for his tenacity, dedication and positive support for this project at Government, Council of Energy Ministers' meetings in Brussels and in the European Commission.  I am confident this project will come onstream.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to be gained from speculation regarding the outcome of the European Union Commission's assessment of the proposal.  The proposal has been demonstrated to be economic and I am confident that European Union funding will be forthcoming and that the project will proceed as planned with the full support of the Government.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Publication of VHI Report.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to ask the Minister his intentions regarding the review group report on the VHI.  Many of the 1.3 million customers of the VHI are very concerned about recent reports confirming massive underwriting losses this year. The VHI is reduced to selling off some of its financial investments to bridge the revenue gap and it expects to lose £15.5 million this year on its core insurance business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company's plans to counter the £15.5 million underwriting loss with investment of £12 million are unlikely <Col N="1456" /> to be realised and the projected net loss of £3.5 million will turn out to be much greater.  As many of us have already seen a copy of the special review group report.  The Minister should publish it immediately so that customers and investors in the VHI can assess the position for themselves.  He should also spell out immediately his plans for the VHI as it faces the introduction of competition in its core health insurance business under the terms of the European Single Market.</P>
    <P>The report warns of the possible loss of subscribers to the VHI in view of the fact that since 1991 the entire population has been entitled, without significant charge, to public hospital services and free consultant services.  It also points out that this year's budget began a phased reduction, from 48 per cent to 27 per cent, over three years of tax relief on VHI premiums.  Added to the danger of a negative subscriber reaction is the recent 9 per cent price rise.</P>
    <P>Identifying the need for the VHI to operate to a clear commercial mandate, the report calls for the company to cease being an executive agency of the department of Health.  It also identifies the necessity for a culture of innovation, imagination and customer responsiveness to be urgently introduced into the VHI organisation.  The review group recommends that the VHI should be on an identical footing with possible private sector competitors in regard to all aspects and dimensions of industry regulation.</P>
    <P>The report also warns that while the VHI may not face immediate competition under the European Union's deregulated market, it is likely that at some stage in the near future it will face competition in part or all of its core markets.  It states that income must be increased by increasing premiums and/or increasing membership and that expenditure growth must be curtailed by reducing the extent of benefits provided and/or reducing the cost of such benefits.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to tell to the House whether he accepts the findings <Col N="1457" /> of the report, whether he intends to implement them and whether he intends to publish the report to make members of the VHI aware of the company's position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>In January of this year the Minister for Health announced the appointment of a review group to examine the operations of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, particularly in the light of the introduction of the Single Market in health insurance throughout the European Union.  The specific terms of reference were:</P>
      <P>To examine and report on the strategic and operational capacity of the VHI having regard to the introduction of the Single Market and the provisions of proposed insurance legislation and to make recommendations on the actions to be taken by the Minister and the VHI, in the light of the conclusions emerging from the examination.</P>
      <P>The members appointed to the review group were Professor David Kennedy as Chairman, Judge Catherine McGuinness and Mr. Robert P. Willis. The Department of Health supplied the secretariat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated by these terms of reference the Minister was particularly concerned that the VHI should be able to respond to the challenges of competition as presented by the Single Market.  The VHI has been the main insurer in health insurance in Ireland since 1957 and has provided an excellent service to its members throughout that period. However, the possible advent of competition means that the board is obliged to evaluate all its operations and plans to establish whether these are appropriate to a more competitive environment. The examination by the review group was designed to assist both the Minister and the board in deciding what changes <Col N="1458" /> were necessary so that the VHI members would continue to have a cost effective service.</P>
    <P>The final report as presented to the Minister in June was a thorough examination of the board's activities including issues related to marketing, finance and management.  The report has been of assistance to the Minister in the preparation of new legislation to amend the 1957 VHI Act and has also helped the VHI board in its preparations for the Single Market.  The weaknesses identified by the group are being addressed so that the board will continue to play an important role in the future health insurance market.  The underwriting difficulty mentioned by the group was subsequently addressed by an increase in premium rates with effect from 1 August 1994 and a vigorous approach by VHI to develop an aggressive approach in marketing new products while at the same time maintaining, as the review group mentioned, its tradition of a thrifty and cost conscious organisation.</P>
    <P>The latest financial information received by the Department of Health from the VHI is that the organisation expects to break even in this year after investment income is taken into account.  It is anticipated that the financial situation will improve because of the recent premia increases.  A critical aspect of an insurance company's financial profile is the reserves position and, in regard to VHI, this has shown an increase from £6.6 million in 1989 to £66.4 million in 1994; this allows the VHI to meet EU solvency margins.  In addition, overall membership is continuing to rise and this will of course make a contribution to the improving finances of the board.</P>
    <P>I can therefore give every assurance to VHI members that the VHI's finances are not threatening the organisation's viability and that it will continue to give subscribers and their dependants <Col N="1459" /> a high quality service.  I am quite confident that it will remain a major player in any future insurance market in this country.</P>
    <P>As regards the publication of the review group's report the Deputy and this House will appreciate that it is a confidential document containing much sensitive information of a commercial nature and it would be inappropriate to <Col N="1460" /> publish the report.  Indeed I very much regret that a Member of the House has used information from what was clearly a sensitive internal document to attempt to gain short term political advantage. Neither the VHI, its members nor Members of this House have benefited from this exercise.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 October 1994.</P>

      <P>High on the list of visitor attractions to this country, are the personal nature of the welcome extended to our visitors, and the unspoilt, uncrowded open spaces.</P>
      <P>My intention is to develop a sustainable tourism industry which will preserve these attributes.  In doing this the policy focus will be on two areas; enhanced promotion of tourism throughout the country in the hitherto little frequented tourist destinations; and a determined effort to develop off-peak business.  Earlier this year I announced a special seasonality marketing initiative involving Bord Fáilte and the industry with a total budget of £1.5 million &mdash; £800,000 of which is the State contribution and £700,000 from the industry.  I have now announced a second campaign for the autumn of this year and early 1995.  This again is a joint marketing effort with the industry with the State contributing almost £500,000 and matching funds coming from the industry.</P>
      <P>Activities in the product development area to broaden and extend the spread of tourists throughout the country include: the development of canals, inland waterways and angling facilities, further development of heritage towns and a new programme to restore heritage gardens.</P>
      <P>Another important contribution to lucrative off-season business will be the promotion of Ireland as a major international conference centre, particularly in the light of the Government's proposals in the National Development Plan for the construction of a new, state-of-the-art, convention centre here.</P>

        <i>The National Development Plan 1994-99</i> identifies weaknesses that exist in the tourism industry; a growing but, in international terms, still relatively low, level of marketing activity resulting in serious under-utilisation of tourism plant, especially outside the peak periods; the tourism industry remains highly seasonal &mdash; 30 per cent of visitors to Ireland arrived in the peak July/August period in 1993; less than adequate competitive, reliable and regular access links to our existing markets; critical gaps in tourism product and in tourist activities; a need for expanded training investment to continue to raise quality and service throughout the industry; and a continuing need to improve the cost competitiveness of Irish holidays.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme which I have just launched seeks to address these weaknesses by concentrating on a large expansion in marketing activities, with a particular emphasis on off-season business; further product development to meet specific market deficiencies; major improvements in the conference, angling and culture and heritage product, and an expansion in the range and scale of training in order to cater for anticipated employment growth, to improve the quality of service to visitors and to help the industry adapt to Ireland's changing tourism market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, to ensure that the full resource capability of my Department, in exercising its overall management responsibility for the Operational Programme, is applied continuously to addressing these weaknesses most effectively, the areas concerned have been identified as key result areas in my Department's overall Strategic Statement.  That is to say, priority departmental attention will be diverted, in <Col N="1016" /> future, to realising qualitative and quantitative improvements in the areas concerned during the lifetime of the Operational Programme.</P>
    <P>In addition three specialist working groups of the Tourism Council were established to cover the broad areas of access, marketing and product quality/ development and concentrate on key issues affecting tourism development.

One of these strategies, for which I have set aside £1.25 million, is to associate Ireland's many leading sporting and artistic performers with tourism marketing and to seek to have international sporting finals take place in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The agreement with Jordan Grand Prix Ltd. falls into this category and covers the 1994 FIA World Formula One Championship.  Under the terms of the agreement, which is the subject of a formal contract between Jordan Grand Prix Ltd. and Bord Fáilte, the Jordan drivers, cars and other equipment will carry the &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; insignia for a fee of £400,000.</P>
      <P>The potential promotional impact of this arrangement is enormous.  The World Formula One Championship is contested over 16 events, 15 countries, on four continents.  The live television audience for each race is 480 million in more than 100 countries and each Grand Prix attracts an average 200,000 spectators for the duration of the event. The arrangement with Jordan represents a massive media opportunity to raise awareness of Ireland, both generally, and as an exciting and interesting tourist destination, to an enormous global audience, of a scale much larger than we could possibly hope to reach through conventional promotional spends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> In my view, new and innovative strategies are absolutely necessary if we are to achieve our ambitious tourism revenue and employment targets and bring about a significant improvement in the seasonal profile of our visitors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 77, 82, 359 and 361 together. The information requested by the Deputies is set out in the following tabular statement which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Estimates by the Central Statistics Office of overseas visitors to Ireland for the first six months of 1994 show a 9 per cent increase over the same period in 1993.  While official CSO figures are not available for individual continental markets, Bord Fáilte have estimated that the number of German tourists as at June this year may have increased by up to 6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> Present indications are that Bord Fáilte's original target of 3.5 million tourists for 1994 will be exceeded.</P>
    <P>The Government's initiatives for marketing and promoting Ireland as a tourist destination are undoubtedly contributing to improved performance and growth in tourist numbers during 1994.</P>
    <P>The House will be already aware, from a reply I gave to Deputy Broughan on 14 April, 1994, that I asked for a special promotional focus to be placed on Dublin in the context of the new extended campaigns within Britain and mainland Europe, which are now in place by Bord Fáilte in co-operation with my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Earnings Committee is responsible for co-ordinating and enhancing the effectiveness of Ireland's promotional effort abroad, including co-ordination of publicity in the overseas markets.</P>
      <P>The Government has asked the Foreign Earnings Committee to:</P>
      <P>(i)  examine the question of putting &ldquo;enhanced effective co-ordination mechanisms in place to achieve the necessary single-minded pursuit of Ireland's economic and commercial interest abroad by all our agencies and programmes including the diplomatic service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(ii) to draw up a medium-term plan (four-five years) to improve the original effectiveness of representation overseas concerned with Ireland's economic and commercial interests (mainly in those markets where the bulk of promotional moneys is spent), encompassing a strategic approach, practical initiatives for implementation and, where appropriate, operational targets; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii) to monitor and review the <Col N="1021" /> operation of the medium-term plan and to modify it, where necessary, in the light of changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>The committee meets under my chairmanship and consists of the chief executives of overseas promotional agencies and senior officials from relevant Government Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The committee is of the view that there is no &ldquo;single image&rdquo; of Ireland which would fully serve the specific marketing needs of all the agencies, but has directed that they always seek to maximise joint promotion efforts where suitable opportunities arise.  Each of the agencies tries to create an appropriate awareness in target markets of the facets of Ireland which can best contribute to the promotion of its sector, taking care to ensure that the image they are portraying does not have a detrimental effect on the promotional efforts of the other agencies.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware I announced a number of new common-rating arrangements in July this year.</P>
      <P>For Australia and New Zealand via London a limited common-rating arrangement has existed since 1988. This has now been consolidated into arrangements with all major carriers to Europe from Australia and New Zealand and will operate not only via London but also via Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt.  The arrangements cover all fares and will now include, in most cases, Cork and Shannon as well as Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An arrangement has been made with <Col N="1022" /> Emirates Airline to common-rate Dublin with London from the Gulf.</P>
    <P>For Bangkok and Singapore an arrangement has also been made with Qantas to common-rate Dublin with London from Bangkok and Singapore through selected agents who will target high-potential markets.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are also in progress in relation to Hong-Kong and South Africa to establish similar common-rating arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have allocated a sum of up to £600,000 to assist Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus in the marketing of these new arrangements through TV, Radio and Tour Operator promotions.  Aer Lingus are also making a financial contribution to this programme through discounted <i>pro-rata</i> fares.</P>
    <P>No plans are in place yet to common-rate Canada or Argentina.  However, like Australia and New Zealand, common-rating with Japan has existed for some time.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the trade mission which I led to Hong Kong, Guangdong and Shanghai from 12-16 September.  The delegation consisted of 25 companies from a wide range of Irish industries including electronics, software, telecommunications, engineering components, technical instruments, consumer goods as well as several companies in the services sector.  The main purpose of the mission was to help win new business in China and Hong Kong, and from this point of view the mission was highly successful, with the participants reporting significant new business and prospects as well as the consolidation of existing trading relationships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> My programme also included several meetings and trade presentations attended by Government and business figures in Hong Kong, Guandong and Shanghai, in the course of which I sought to deepen our trade links and raise awareness of Ireland as a modern industrialised economy and a quality trading partner with much to offer China and Hong Kong by way of goods and services.</P>
    <P>There are certainly major opportunities for Irish businesses and services in China.  The Chinese economy has seen average annual economic growth of 9 per cent per annum over the past ten years and billions of dollars in foreign investment pouring into the country.  China offers particular opportunities in tradeable services such as aviation and technical consultancy, management and training, but also in the areas of construction and electronics for selected industrial products.  The Special Economic Zone of Guangdong, which was the main focus of the mission, is investing heavily in upgrading its infrastructure and in the next decade will be a major purchaser of power generation, telecommunication, and construction equipment.  I am particularly anxious to ensure that Irish businesses win a significant share of this growing market.  Hong Kong is an important established trading partner in its own right and a key access point for Irish companies wishing to do business in China.</P>
    <P>Irish exports to Hong Kong and China have shown encouraging growth in recent years and in 1993 we recorded a trade surplus with Hong Kong for the first time.  Ireland's trade with China has been growing in recent years although we still buy far more from China than we export.  My objective is to have a better balance while continuing the growth in total trade, and I am confident that the recent trade mission, together with An Bord Tráchtála's ongoing activities, will play an important part in bringing this about.</P>

      <P>Fingal Tourism Initiative was set up in May 1993, with the aim of examining the potential of the Fingal Region as a tourism development area, thus complementing the objectives for Fingal as set out in the Regional Development Plan 1994-1999 formulated by Bord Fáilte with full input from Dublin City and County Regional Tourism Organisation.</P>
      <P>The need for a survey and development plan was identified through a consultation process with all interested parties throughout the Fingal area.  The Environmental Research unit in UCD has been recently asked to carry out the study and Fingal County Enterprise Board have provided £5,000 by way of a grant towards the cost of the study.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the importance which the Government attaches to tourism in terms of job creation and local development.  I can assure him careful consideration will be given in the context of the Operational Programme to the recommendations in the UCD Study regarding tourism development in Fingal.  I would also like to point out that with support from the last Operational Programme a total of £11.9 million has been invested in tourism projects in the Fingal area such as Newbridge House, Donabate, St. Margaret's Golf Club, Howth Lodge Hotel. In addition half a million pounds has been invested in agri-tourism projects in Fingal supported by the agri-tourism grant scheme.  Developments such as Malahide Marina and Malahide Heritage Town are examples of how the tourism potential in this area is being addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>The matter of flights and transport fares are a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I understand that under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2409/92 on fares and rates for air services which came into effect on 1 January 1993, all EU airlines are free to set air fares on intra-Community routes without regulatory inteference by Governments, subject to certain safeguards.</P>
      <P>From a tourism perspective I am, of course concerned that air fares to Ireland should be competitive.  Considerable improvements have taken place in recent years in access to this country and Ireland is relatively well serviced by both charters and Schedule flights and by sea carriers.</P>
      <P>There is also open competition on sea-ferry routes and both vehicle and passenger traffic continues to increase. In 1995 capacity on the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire routes will be significantly enhanced when B &amp; I and Stena introduce their new ferries.</P>
      <P>I allocated £3 million to a special advertising campaign in the US market in 1994 and this has proved very successful in bringing an additional 40,000 US tourists to Ireland.  This means that almost half a million US tourists will visit Ireland this year.  Marketing support is available to sea and air carriers through the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, with a maximum rate of 50 per cent for off peak business.</P>

      <P>The official Department of Finance forecast for merchandise exports, published in their Economic Review and Outlook for 1994, is for growth in export volume of about 7 per cent.  Export prices are expected to increase by under 4 per cent on 1993. Applying these growth rates to the official 1993 CSO trade statistics, 1994 exports are projected to reach an estimated £21.9 billion for the current year.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance advise that their forecasts reflect expected growth in demand in our main markets, and are largely unaffected by transfer pricing behaviour that may take place in the multinational sector.</P>
      <P>An Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, and on which my Department is represented, has been recently established by the Government to examine, <i>inter alia,</i> the statistics available on external trade and their impact on national income statistics.  The group is still deliberating.</P>

      <P>During my supplementary estimate speech in the Dáil in February this year I mentioned that I had reserved a figure of £0.5 million to <Col N="1028" /> enable me take on board good proposals coming from the Tourism Council.</P>
      <P>A number of excellent proposals to overcome the problem of seasonality in the industry were submitted to me by the Tourism Council.  I subsequently launched an Autumn Seasonality Campaign in a joint effort with the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>The campaign markets Ireland as a destination for short breaks and shopping trips and will build on the proven successful campaigns which have been running already in the Spring Seasonality Campaign.</P>
      <P>Britain and mainland Europe have been targeted and the programme is expected to attract an additional 25,000 visitors.</P>
      <P>The campaign will also bring 80 of the top decision-makers among European incentive travel organisers to Ireland. Incentive travel which is developing in Europe, especially in Germany, offers solid potential for season extension.  In addition, Ireland is being marketed as a location for British Corporate Conferences and meetings which have potential to generate high spending visitors.  A direct mail initiative aimed at attracting high spending visitors from the UK to attend leading Irish Festivals is also being supported.</P>
      <P>Further proposals covered by this fund include:</P>
      <P>(i) the production and widespread distribution of an attractive booklet by Office of Public Works detailing its heritage attractions.</P>
      <P>(ii) the commissioning of research on developing a Brand Image for Irish tourism.</P>
      <P>The campaign is well advanced and all the moneys are committed.  The total campaign will prove a major boost for the industry, especially in the off-season.</P>

      <P>A number of proposals to establish a National Conference Centre have been considered by a special Interdepartmental Committee.

      <P>Whereas there is little doubt about the positive economic spin-off of such a development to the economy, the direct benefits to the individual developer may not be sufficient to encourage the development.  In this context a number of private investors have expressed interest in the development of casinos as part of a wider development complex which would include, <i>inter alia</i>, a National Conference Centre, but this is an issue which raises wider considerations and has not yet been opened to formal consideration by any inter-Departmental group.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, my Department has been designated as the national authority in charge of Programme management.  In exercising this role, my Department will chair and service the National Monitoring Committee for the Programme which will have the general power to modify the budgets of individual sub-programmes in agreement with my Department and the European Commission.  A subsidiary committee, the Tourism OP Co-ordinating Committee, also chaired and serviced by my Department, will have the general power to adjust similar budgets at measure level within each Sub-Programme.  All of the Departments and agencies participating in the programme are represented on these committees.</P>
      <P>The majority of funding for heritage projects in the Programme is being made available through the Natural/ Cultural Tourism Sub-Programme, which is being administered by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Decisions in relation to which heritage projects will qualify for EU funding will be made by these Departments under this Sub-Programme.</P>

    <P>In summary therefore, while my Department is involved in managing the programme's overall budgets, it does not actually determine how much money is allocated to heritage projects or what projects are ultimately assisted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>CERT, the State Training Agency has served the tourist industry extremely well and their training programmes have had a considerable impact on the development of the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>This performance of Irish tourism over the last Operational Programme, which outstripped international competition, shows clearly that the range of products and services provided by the Irish Tourism industry succeeded in attracting a large volume increase in visitor numbers, against the background of stiff international competition.  Given the essentially labour intensive nature of tourism, this would suggest that an effectively satisfactory balance was maintained between standards of product and service and optimum staff levels.  In the final analysis, the level of staffing is a matter for individual industry establishments.</P>
      <P>I certainly do not wish to be complacent about staffing and services standards in tourism, they can always be improved.  The Tourist Operational Programme which I announced recently contains a special sub-programme on tourism training.  Total investment of over £110 million (to which the European Social Fund will contribute about £82 million) will be allocated under this sub-programme to tourism training.  In addition I am asking the Tourism Council to help me draw up a blue print for Manpower Policy for the Tourism Industry until the end of the century.</P>
      <P>These proposals will have a major impact on the quality, profitability, professionalism and performance of the industry.</P>

The Product Development Sub-Programme includes a measure which will support the development, at regional level, of a number of stand-alone, high profile projects, in traditional and developing tourist centres, which would attract visitors to the area.  Support will also be available for improvements to existing attractions and for developing smaller complementary projects which would add to the appeal of certain centres.  Furthermore, special interest holiday facilities in these areas may, under certain conditions, also benefit from support.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 360 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has, of course primary responsibility for addressing crime, including crime against tourists.  However, as Minister with responsibility for tourism, I continue to be concerned about this issue. While official statistics are not available, I understand from the Department of <Col N="1036" /> Justice that preliminary figures show that there has been a decrease in the number of crimes committed against tourists in 1994, compared to 1993.  The main reason for this reduction in crime is effective policing on the streets.</P>
    <P>The role of the tourism industry is also important in reducing the opportunities for criminals to thieve from our visitors.  The level of liaison between the Garda, Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry is high, and all sectors of the industry are co-operating to distribute &ldquo;Take Care&rdquo; leaflets in four languages, and advise visitors on the steps which they should take to protect themselves and their property.</P>
    <P>The introduction of The Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service earlier this year has also had a positive impact.  The service provides emotional support and practical help with re-issuing of travel tickets, advising on money transfers, liaising with embassies, etc.  The service deals only with cases referred to it by the gardaí and virtually all clients seen this year elected to continue their holiday in Ireland, and in many cases, promised to return.</P>
    <P>The reduction in crime, particularly in the number of serious offences, has had a beneficial effect on the level of coverage by the international media.  There have been very few such reports in the overseas media this year.</P>
    <P>Finally, while there are grounds for concern about this problem, it is important that we keep a sense of proportion.  The growth in crime against tourists is a worldwide phenomenon and Ireland rates very well in any international comparisons.</P>

      <P>The Agreements embodying the results of the Uruguay Round are due to come into effect on 1 January next.  The texts have been laid before the House and I am arranging for a motion approving them to be submitted shortly.  I am confident that, with the co-operation of all the parties in the House, this approval will be forthcoming without delay.  Following Dáil approval, the Government will arrange to have the necessary instruments of ratification of the Agreements by Ireland deposited by the deadline of 1 January.</P>
      <P>The Agreements must also be ratified by the European Union, since external trade policy is in general the responsibility of the Union rather than of its member states.  The European Court of Justice has been asked by the Commission to rule on the issue of whether, under the Treaties, the Union or the member states are responsible for certain new trade areas covered by the Uruguay Round Agreements, such as services.  As the Court has recently indicated that it will deliver its judgment before mid-November, this should provide sufficient time to complete the process of Union ratification by the deadline of 1 January.</P>
      <P>Most, if not all, of the trade liberalisation commitments agreed in the Uruguay Round will be implemented within the European Union by means of Union measures binding on all member states. The necessary legislative package to implement the liberalisation measures which come into effect on 1 January next was presented by the Commission on 6 October and is at present being examined by member states.  It is expected that the Council of Ministers will have approved the package in time for the 1 January deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of the outcome of the case before the Court of Justice, I understand that no primary legislation will be required in Ireland to give effect to any of the Uruguay Round measures which are due to come into force on 1 January next.  As the EU legislative <Col N="1038" /> package consists mainly of measures which are directly applicable throughout the Union, little secondary legislation is likely to be needed.  The Government will make every effort to ensure that any such secondary legislation is in place by the deadline.  The Government will also arrange for the making of an Order under the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act in order to give the new World Trade Organisation legal status and appropriate privileges and immunities under our law.</P>
    <P>In summary, I do not anticipate any difficulty in ratifying and implementing in Ireland the Agreements embodying the results of the Uruguay Round.</P>

      <P>In general, there is a high level of visitor satisfaction with the quality of food available in restaurants and other establishments.  The food business is becoming more market orientated and more of the domestic market is being attracted to dining out more frequently.  Our successful efforts to increase tourism is stimulating greater attention to providing good quality food at a variety of price levels.</P>
      <P>I believe, however, that more can be done with our quality Irish food with a view to promoting a distinctive Irish cuisine.  When raising this point in my speech to the ITIC Conference on 28 March last, my purpose was to ask the industry to consider what it could do to further this objective.</P>
      <P>Currently, Bord Fáilte and the Irish Hotel and Catering Institute are co-ordinating a programme to combine the efforts of the hospitality industry to improve awareness about the value of a distinctive Irish cuisine.  The industry will be encouraged to work with the institute and others at improving perceptions both as to the quality of Irish food products and the rich potential this offers for a national culinary identity.</P>

      <P>It is still too early to quantify the full benefits of the peace process.  However, there is no doubt that the peace process provides the tourism industry, North and South, with a major opportunity to increase tourism business to the island of Ireland.  The violence in Northern Ireland has been a serious deterrent to potential visitors since 1969 and removal of the threat of violence should have positive results on tourism performance in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> I also believe that cross-Border trade and business development activities increase the overall level of business on both sides of the Border, with consequent economic enhancement and the creation of new business and new jobs.  I believe that it will provide an excellent opportunity to capitalise on the joint promotional and trade development activities we have been involved in for several years.</P>

      <P>The evidence is that first-time visitors regard Ireland as quite good value for money.  The 1993 Bord <Col N="1041" /> Fáilte Survey of Travellers shows that 93 per cent of first-time visitors regarded Ireland as very good, good or fair value for money, 60 per cent regarded it as good or very good value.</P>
      <P>The improvement in recent years can be seen in the comparison of figures for 1987 and 1993.  In six years the percentage of visitors regarding Ireland as poor or very poor value for money has dropped from 41 per cent to 9 per cent. For first-time visitors the figure is even lower with only 7 per cent rating Ireland poor value.</P>

      <P>The timeliness of official economic statistics is a matter of the highest priority for the Central Statistics Office whose objective is to ensure that key economic data are available with the minimum possible delay. The speed with which statistics can be produced is however dependent on the response to surveys by businesses and individuals; the resources which can be deployed on statistical work; and the necessity to ensure that the published results are of an acceptable quality.  A reasonable balance must be struck in taking all these factors into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some particular difficulties have recently arisen due to the introduction of a new survey system for foreign trade statistics, following the completion of the EU Single Market.  This has led to delays in the production of trade statistics in all member states.  The CSO and the Revenue Commissioners are examining how the current situation here can <Col N="1042" /> be improved.  Some less serious delays have occurred in the production of certain other economic statistics due to the decentralisation of the bulk of the CSO to Cork earlier this year.  It is expected that these temporary difficulties will be rectified in the near future.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the new intrastat survey system, following the abolition of intra-EU customs controls, has resulted in some discontinuities in the classification of trade by country of origin/destination.  The problem arises in relation to non-EU trade which transits through other member states.  Previously some of this trade was incorrectly classified as EU trade, whereas under the new system the classification by origin/destination is more accurate.  As a result, the published figures tend to overstate the real increase in trade with non-EU countries, while understating the increase in intra-EU trade.</P>

      <P>The conflict in Rwanda has given rise to one of the largest and most difficult refugee crisis in the world.  In addition to the 2 million people who are displaced inside Rwanda more than 1.5 million Rwandans have fled to neighbouring countries, 850,000 are in refugee camps in Zaire and 520,000 are in camps in Tanzania.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> The efforts of the international community are helping to alleviate the terrible conditions in the camps.  But any long-term solution must involve a return of the refugees to their home country.  The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General, the UN Force in Rwanda (UNAMIR) and the UNHCR are working to create the conditions which would enable such a return to take place.</P>
    <P>Since the outbreak of the conflict in April the Government has allocated £3.25 million for humanitarian relief.  In addition over 60 members of the Defence Forces are assisting, in a civilian capacity, in the humanitarian work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and of Irish Non-Governmental Organisations in Rwanda/Zaire.</P>
    <P>Inside Rwanda the UN Assistance Mission (UNAMIR) has responsibility for providing security and support for returning refugees.  The force is close to attaining its authorised strength and Ireland has not been requested by the UN to contribute troops to it.</P>

      <P>The concerns of the Government at the human rights situation in East Timor and at the actions of the Indonesian authorities there have been set out in replies to several previous questions.  Since June, when I last outlined the steps taken by the Government, the Government has continued to take an active interest in the plight of the East Timorese people and has highlighted its concern at recent bilateral and international meetings:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; in my address to the United Nations General Assembly on 28 <Col N="1046" /> September, I pointed to human rights abuses in East Timor as an issue requiring international action;</P>
    <P>&mdash; at the recent Conference of European Union and ASEAN Ministers in Karlsruhe, Germany, Minister of State, Mr. Tom Kitt, raised the concerns of the Irish Government and people directly with the Indonesian Foreign Minister Mr. Ali Alatas;</P>
    <P>&mdash; and during his visit to Australia last month the Taoiseach discussed the issue with Prime Minister Keating.</P>
    <P>In addition, with Ireland's strong support, the issue of East Timor was covered in the Memorandum submitted by the European Union to the United Nations for the 49th session of the General Assembly, and was raised by the German Presidency of the EU at the EU/ASEAN Conference in Karlsruhe.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to raise this issue at every appropriate opportunity.  I shall also continue to support the dialogue between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the United Nations as the best means of achieving respect for human rights and a lasting solution to the question of East Timor.</P>

      <P>The number of temporary staff recruited to the Passport Office and the duration of their contracts varies depending on the level of seasonal demand.  The following table gives details of the recruitment of temporary clerical assistants in the last six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey of staffing structures in the Passport Office, conducted by the Department of Finance last year, recommended an increase in the permanent staff of the Passport Office from 48 to 82, and a maximum peak season temporary staff of 54.  The recommendations of the Department of Finance report were accepted on the basis that an increased level of permanent staffing would help ensure that the Passport Office was better equipped to deal with demand on a year-round basis.  As part of the implementation of the report's recommendations a confined competition was held among serving temporary staff in the Passport Office, from <Col N="1048" /> which six permanent appointments were made to my Department.</P>
    <P>Subsequent increases in the level of demand for passports in the early part of this year led to the redeployment of an additional 23 staff from the Central Statistics Office and the Revenue Commissioners (who became available because of the decentralisation programmes of these Offices), to the Passport Office.</P>
    <P>While the increase in the number of permanent staff in the Passport Office will involve some decrease in the numbers of temporary staff recruited in the future, I can assure the Deputy that there will be a continuing need for substantial numbers of temporary staff during the peak season in the Passport Office.  I would also like to emphasise to the Deputy that the decision to move towards a higher proportion of permanent staff in the Passport Office was taken as a result of Department of Finance recommendations on efficiency and not as a consequence of the Government's decentralisation programme.</P>

      <P>I subsequently wrote to a large number of organisations interested in the field of foreign policy, inviting them to submit their views by the end of November of this year.

      <P>I would like to repeat that anybody who wishes to make known their views on any aspect of foreign policy, in the context of the White Paper, is welcome to do so by writing to me, preferably by the end of November.</P>

My intention is to arrange for a total of seven seminars to be held in a number of venues around the country between now and next spring.  Each seminar will focus on a particular aspect of foreign policy. They will be open to representatives of interested bodies and members of the public, subject obviously, to limitations of space.  The first seminar, dealing with Development Co-operation, will take place early next month.  I will shortly be announcing details of this and other seminars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my appointment as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs in January 1993 I have fulfilled 33 European Union ministerial commitments abroad, eight Anglo Irish related ministerial commitments and four other commitments in relation to UN General Assembly, OECD and Stability Pact Conference.  I have also undertaken ten other official trips abroad.  Those arose in connection with State visits abroad by President Robinson and recommended official bilateral visits.</P>
      <P>Details of the trips undertaken by me in the periods 31 January-4 October 1993 and 1 January-27 March 1994 have already been supplied to the House in replies to parliamentary questions on 7 October 1993 (Questions Nos. 16 and 23) and 29 March 1994 (Question No. 86).  Details of the other official visits abroad during the period October-December 1993 and from April 1994 to date are given in the following tables.  In so far as the most recent trips are concerned, actual costs arising for my Department have not yet been brought fully to account.  However, the estimated total cost arising for my Department of the trips listed in both tables, inclusive of the costs of those accompanying me, amounts to approximately £127,000.</P>
      <P>Every effort continues to be made to keep the costs of visits to the minimum consistent with the appropriate discharge of my responsibilities as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Since my appointment I have been conscious of the need to keep expenditure on ministerial travel to a minimum.  To this effect I arranged for my travel budget to be reduced by approximately 12 per cent for 1993 and I am hopeful that this reduction can be maintained in 1994.</P>

      <P>A total of 39 consultants were employed on short-term contracts under the Irish Aid Programme to assist with the review of existing aid projects and to plan and prepare for new projects.  The total cost of these consultancy services amounts to £1,007,447.</P>
      <P>Within the Department of Foreign Affairs, a consultant was employed to advise on the preparation of the Department's Strategic Management Plan at a cost of £4,061 plus VAT and the services of a consultant to the Legal Division of the Department have been retained at a cost, to date, of £7,666.</P>
      <P>In addition one person has been appointed to carry out the duties of adviser and programme manager at a current annual salary of £44,089.</P>
      <P>There is one programme manager in the office of the Tánaiste who assists the Tánaiste in managing and co-ordinating the achievement of the Government's objectives in the Partnership Programme for Government.  He provides administrative back-up to the Tánaiste to assist in the achievement of these objectives and meets regularly with the other programme managers to review progress.  In addition there are two special advisers employed in the office to provide legal, economic and general advice to the Tánaiste on Government policy matters.</P>

In the light of the significant improvement in the security situation the Government believe that there is now a major opportunity for progress in this regard.  The Government has therefore welcomed the decisions taken to date to rescind closure orders on 16 Border crossings, and the announcement that a review of all road closures is under way.  I have emphasised to the Secretary of State the importance of ensuring that the review is concluded as rapidly as possible and leads to a programme of re-openings in all of the affected areas.  The Deputy can be assured that I will continue to monitor closely progress in this area within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>

    <P>The decision to exchange Ambassadors on a resident or non-resident basis is a matter for agreement between the two States concerned.  It is not unusual for a State to accredit an Ambassador on a non-resident basis to another State while accepting the establishment of a resident Embassy by that State.  All of the countries listed above have indicated that they would welcome the establishment of a resident Irish Embassy in their capitals but they accept that we are not in a position to do so at the present time because of the limited resources of our Diplomatic Service.</P>
    <P>Ireland has had diplomatic relations with Hungary since 1976.  Ireland's Ambassador to Austria is concurrently accredited as non-resident Ambassador to Hungary.  The possibility of extending our network of resident missions is kept under continuous review in the light of our national and international interests and the resources available to us. However, it would not be appropriate <Col N="1059" /> to speak publicly in advance about proposals, if any, which may be under consideration at any particular time since decisions in these matters have to be agreed in each case with the foreign Government concerned and could be announced only after consultation with it.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the normal hours of attendance for Customs officials is 9 a.m. to 5.15 p.m. Monday to Thursday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday.  Attendances outside these hours are provided, as required, at various locations e.g. airports and ferryports.  In addition, Customs staff employed on Mobile Task Units and in the Customs National Drugs Team (CNDT) are rostered for attendance between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on weekdays (Monday to Saturday) with provision for payment of overtime, if needed, for attendances outside these hours.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners established the CNDT on 1 January 1993 to combat the smuggling of drugs and to take account of the greater responsibility placed on Customs to protect the external frontier of the European Union, in this regard, following the introduction of the Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CNDT is an intelligence driven organisation which uses modern technology and maintains contacts with Customs administrations throughout the world by means of International Conventions to which Ireland is a contracting party.  Comprising over 70 staff <Col N="1061" /> the CNDT consists of Intelligence Units, Operational Units, Maritime Units and Sniffer-dog Units which are strategically based at locations throughout the country.  These specialist officials are supplemented by the general cadre of Customs and Excise staff who are also responsible for the detection and prevention of drug smuggling as part of their normal duties.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the hours of attendance of Customs officials combined with the extra resources and intelligence operations of the CNDT and the availability of Mobile Units to assist, when required, are adequate to monitor the illegal importation of drugs into this country.</P>

This protection was afforded by virtue of the Wildlife Act, 1976, (Protection of Wild Animals) Regulations, 1990, (S.I. No. 112 of 1990) which came into effect on 1 June, 1990.

      <P>In view of the concerns which had been raised in relation to the C45 system the Black Economy Monitoring Group was asked to carry out a thorough review of the operation of the C45 system and to make recommendations on action to curb any abuse and to improve the system generally.  The groups recommendations were endorsed by the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The majority of the groups recommendations concerned closer monitoring of the system by the Revenue Commissioners, improved information flow between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare and the redesign of forms to ensure that sufficient information is available to match income tax and social welfare records.  The implementation of these recommendations has commenced and all administrative recommendations will be implemented by the start of the next tax year i.e. 5 April, 1995.</P>
      <P>Two of the recommendations would, however, require statutory changes to carry them into effect.  The first concern a recommendation that both parties should sign a form prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners at the start of the contract verifying that the C45 system is the most appropriate system in their case.  The second relates to the withdrawal of the special recognition given to the gang or group system within the C45 regime.</P>
      <P>Both recommendations are under examination within my Department and will be considered by me in good time for the next Finance Act.</P>

      <P>When the Royal Canal was taken over by the Office of Public Works in 1986, CIE retained ownership of the canal bank at this location.  Only the water channel was transferred and the Office of Public Works have no powers in relation to the adjoining lands which CIE retained. This effectively eliminates any scope for the Office of Public Works to carry out enhancement measures other than on the canal itself in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the canal channel, all of the Spencer Dock has now been dredged of accumulated spoil and <Col N="1071" /> debris.  Negotiations are well advanced with Irish Rail on the provision by the Office of Public Works of a lifting bridge for the railway at North Strand and it is hoped that work on this project will commence this winter.  The installation of this bridge will restore boat access to the Royal Canal from Dublin Bay for the first time in nearly 40 years.</P>

      <P>The officer concerned, who was an Assistant Principal in my Department, was seconded to the Department of Education from September 1987 to March 1988.  On her return to my Department she was assigned to Finance Division (EC Section), and served there until her retirement.</P>
      <P>My Department did not seek or receive advice from a psychologist in relation to the officer concerned.  In November 1992 the officer did, however, send me a copy of a psychologist's report dated June 1992.</P>
      <P>In 1992, my Department outlined to the officer her entitlements in regard to voluntary early retirement.  The officer took voluntary early retirement in August 1993.</P>

      <P>However I would point out that responsibility for the administration of special schools is a matter for the Minister for Education and any accounting issues are a matter for the Accounting Officer for the Education Votes.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General conducted a special project audit on Special Schools which was completed in October 1991.  The project report formed part of the 1990 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, published in November 1991.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General's report was discussed in the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Secretary of the Department of Education submitted a comprehensive report on Special Schools to the committee in October 1992 indicating that new and streamlined financial control/accounting procedures were being put in place to rectify any deficiencies in the area of financial control.  These new procedures included a series of audits of Special Schools which have since been undertaken by the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>The income tax relief that is available <Col N="1076" /> for non-reimbursable medical expenses is a generous relief which costs the Exchequer some £8 million each year. The relief is intended to alleviate the hardship which could otherwise arise for taxpayers because of unforeseeable costs of medical care incurred as a result of disability or illness.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the maintenance of the core element of the relief which is designed to assist taxpayers who are faced with unexpected expenses of a sizable nature.  The extension of the relief to cover routine expenses, i.e. the costs of routine dental, optical and maternity care, would go beyond the basic intention of the relief and I have no plans to extend the relief in this way.</P>

      <P>The present position concerning the decentralisation programme to Dundalk is that a total of 85 staff of the Revenue Commissioners have already moved and are in temporary accommodation.  The question of designating a section of another Department to make up the overall target figure for Dundalk of up to 150 staff is at an advanced stage of consideration.</P>
      <P>The decentralised staff will be located in a new building at Newry Road where a site is available.  Following a public advertisement, a number of developers applied to be included on a short list of those specially invited to submit their proposals for the building.  This list will shortly be finalised.  Drawing up of the plans for the building will commence as soon as the final brief is received from the designated Departments.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to distortions in the operation of deposit interest retention tax between building societies and credit unions whereby deposits up to £20,000 are not notifiable to the Revenue Commissioners when held in credit unions; the proposals, if any, he has to review the law in this area; and whether he has satisfied himself that there is equality of treatment between credit unions and building societies in the operation of corporations tax.</Quest>
      <QRef>[870/94]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax treatment of credit unions and credit union savings accounts reflects the distinct social and voluntary character of these bodies.  Credit unions are exempt from corporation tax, and income arising from credit union savings accounts is not subject to deposit interest retention tax.  However, individuals are obliged to report such income in their annual tax returns to the Revenue Commissioners, and the income is taxable at the individual's marginal rate. Credit unions are required to notify Revenue automatically of interest payments in excess of £500 per annum in respect of individual deposit accounts; the dividend income in respect of the initial shareholding of £6,000 with a credit union is not subject to this automatic reporting requirement.  In addition, under the general legislation governing third-party returns, Revenue may request details of all payments in excess of £50 made by a credit union.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the concerns have been expressed by building societies in regard to the expanding role of credit unions as providers of financial services to the community and the appropriateness of the current tax provisions in these circumstances.  I will be reviewing the position in the light of these concerns, and in the context of whatever proposals are made in the forthcoming credit union legislation to allow credit unions to develop their financial services.  The Deputy will be aware of the important contribution of the credit union movement in particular in supporting members of the community who would otherwise have found it difficult to obtain access to credit, and I will be anxious to keep this in mind in any such review.</P>

      <P>As part of the Government's decentralisation programme the Revenue Commissioners have decentralised a large part of the office to Nenagh, Ennis and Limerick.  In order to maintain the same level of service to its customers at no greater cost the Commissioners provide a facility whereby customers in the 01 area can contact the aforementioned locations by calling a Dublin number, from which they will be connected at no extra cost.  This onward transmission is effected by means of the Government Telecommunications Network, GTN, which is a private internal network used by Government Departments to facilitate speedy and cost efficient communication within and between Departments.</P>
      <P>The reference to &ldquo;high speed dedicated links&rdquo; in the 1993 Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners is a reference to use of the GTN between staff in Sarsfield House, Limerick, and other Revenue offices throughout the country, rather than a reference to a facility for public telephone access to Revenue offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the general question of variation in the level of telephone call charges and the standardisation of such charges by, for example, the provision of a freefone or 1850 service for all callers nationwide, I would refer the <Col N="1086" /> Deputy to the reply given by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in response to a question from Senator D. Neville on 5 May 1994, as recorded in the Seanad Official Report for that date.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners are conscious of the need to keep telephone call charges from the public to a minimum and have instructed their staff to use the call-back service in cases where telephone queries to Revenue offices cannot be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners are constantly endeavouring to minimise compliance costs and to improve both the level and quality of service to taxpayers and to this end I am informed by the Commissioners that they are currently in the process of setting up a central telephone information office which will make it possible for telephone callers to have their queries dealt with without the need to make additional calls to other offices.  This new office will be modelled on the existing Revenue information offices, which cater for personal callers.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme allows health boards to assist eligible persons with the cost of private rented accommodation or mortgage interest payments.  The scheme is administered with minimal computer assistance which has limited the amount and quality of statistical material available.</P>
      <P>A new statistical system for the scheme was introduced on a phased basis in 1993 and is now fully operational in seven health boards.  The North-Western Health Board will provide similar statistical analysis from its computer system.</P>
      <P>However, factual data on the number of recipients of rent supplements in the Dublin year for years 1990 to 1993 is not available.  The Eastern Health Board has provided an estimate of the number in payment at the end of December for these years.</P>

    <P>In recognition of the increasing role of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in housing provision and the attendant financial implications, the Government decided in July 1994 that a review should take place, of the role of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in housing provision.  This review will attempt to identify the reasons for the increase in supplements and to identify the likely trends for the future.  It will also consider what is the most cost-effective way of assisting those on social welfare incomes to meet their housing needs.  I will be considering this matter further when I receive the report of the group in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme excludes people in full time employment from receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.  The extension of the scheme to include the payment of mortgage supplements, for a certain period, to people who were previously unemployed and subsequently take up full time employment would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I have introduced special arrangements designed to ensure that homemakers do not suffer a loss of pension entitlement because of time spent full time at home looking after a child, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
      <P>From 6 April 1994, time spent working in the home rearing young children up to six years of age or caring for incapacitated people will be disregarded in determining entitlement to contributory old age pension.  A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded.</P>
      <P>No statistics are available on the number of women who failed to qualify for a contributory old age pension due to gaps in their employment arising from time spent as homemakers and accordingly it is not possible to estimate costings in this regard.  However, adult dependant allowances would be payable in respect of the vast majority of these women.  These allowances currently amount to 72 per cent of the personal rate where adult dependant is aged over 66.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear scheme has been administered by the health boards on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare since I introduced it in 1990.  In 1993 over <Col N="1094" /> 255,000 children benefited under the scheme at a cost of £10.7 million.  The 1994 figures are being compiled at present.</P>
      <P>In 1993 serious delays were experienced by clients of the Eastern Health Board in receiving allowances under this scheme.  Because of these difficulties the Department asked the health board to examine the operation of the scheme in its area.  Following the review measures were put in place by the board to ensure that there would be no delay in the issue of payments to clients for the 1994 scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme runs from the beginning of June to the end of September every year and this suits the families concerned.  In practice the majority of payments are made in mid-August. However, applications will be accepted by health boards until the close of the scheme in September.</P>
      <P>My Department, in its circular to health boards on the operation of the scheme, requested all boards to ensure that the majority of payments are made by 31 July 1994.  The scheme has operated satisfactorily in all health boards this year with families throughout the country receiving their payments in good time to make provision for their children's needs.</P>

      <P>The legislation provides for the assessment of smallholders means as the yearly value accruing from the use of property.  Statutory regulations specify that the yearly value is to be ascertained by deducting expenses necessarily incurred from gross income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> Over the years deciding and appeals officers have, in applying the legislation, made allowances for such expenses as the cost of fertilisers, repairs to farm building and fences, cost of replacing farm machinery, use of hired labour other than family members, cost of electricity and transport used for farming purposes, veterinary expenses, purchases of fodder and animal feed, rent of land, crop sprays etc.  Agricultural subsidy payments are taken into account as farm income along with other income such as that arising from the sale of livestock and crops.</P>
    <P>The compilation of the assessment is greatly facilitated if the smallholder has retained invoices for the various expenditure items as well as receipts for the sale of livestock etc.</P>
    <P>Details of all sources of income and expenses are recorded on a special form &mdash; IN93, a copy of which is given to the smallholder.  This form was agreed with the farming organisations on the introduction of factual assessment in the mid 1980s and has recently been revised to take account of changes in farming since then.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently developing a new integrated computerised system for all short term payments including supplementary welfare allowance.  This system will support a range of modern payment methods, and will eventually facilitate the co-ordination of multiple payments, such as the payment of rent supplements along with unemployment assistance.  It is planned to introduce the new system on a pilot basis in the health boards in mid-1995, and to have it fully implemented in all boards during 1996.</P>
      <P>To minimise inconvenience for customers who must attend at health centres for payment of rent or mortgage supplements monthly payment has been introduced, where possible, by health boards.  In a number of areas, rent or mortgage payments are posted to customers.  These initiatives, have reduced significantly the frequency of attendance at health centres for the customers involved.</P>

      <P>A person is entitled to disability benefit if they are certified as incapable of their normal occupation and if they satisfy the relevant contribution conditions.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> The new card which is made of plastic and has an encoded magnetic stripe replaces the cardboard &ldquo;registration card&rdquo; which was formerly issued to customers to notify them of their RSI number.  The RSI number is printed on the front of the social services card and is also encoded in the magnetic stripe.  The legal provision for allocating and issuing the RSI number is contained in section 223 of the Social Welfare Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The new card is also replacing the &ldquo;signing card&rdquo; which has been in use over the years at local offices of my Department.  At present, for example, customers who collect their unemployment payments at post offices, are required to use the new card.</P>

      <P>Payment of a Christmas bonus this year of 70 per cent of normal weekly payments has been approved by the Government.  There will be a minimum payment of £20 and in all over 1.2 million people will benefit &mdash; 733,000 recipients and their 488,000 dependants &mdash; at an estimated cost of £37.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with previous years, the Christmas bonus will be paid to pensioners and other people receiving long term social welfare and health payments including the elderly, widows, lone parents, the long term unemployed, and people in receipt of carer's allowance from my Department and disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health boards.  This year, for the first <Col N="1099" /> time, participants in community employment will also receive the bonus payment where they had entitlement prior to joining the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Christmas bonus was introduced originally in 1980 for elderly and other pensioners.  It was subsequently extended to include the long term unemployed in receipt of long term unemployment assistance.  People in receipt of invalidity pension are also covered for the bonus.  Any further extension of the Christmas bonus to other categories of recipients would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>In keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government to continue to increase child benefit over time in the context of the integration of the tax and social welfare systems, the rates of child benefit have been significantly increased during the past two years.  The Social Welfare Act, 1994, provided for increases in the monthly rates from £20 to £25 for the third child and from £23 to £25 for subsequent children.  In 1993, the rate payable for the first three children was increased to £20 representing an increase of over 26 per cent.  The total cost of these improvements is £61.5 million in a full year.</P>

    <P>At a recent conference on family income support organised by my Department as a contribution to the International Year of the Family, I <Col N="1100" /> announced the establishment of a committee under an independent chairperson to bring forward proposals for the future development of child benefit. There are many ways in which the scheme could be developed in the future including the payment of benefit beyond the present age of 18 in respect of those in full-time education.  All of the options in this area will be examined by the committee and whatever proposals are brought forward will be considered in the lead up to the 1995 budget.</P>

      <P>In general, health boards do not provide assistance towards the cost of child-minding facilities for lone parents.</P>
      <P>I have made special arrangements this year under the lone parents allowance scheme to assist lone parents with the cost of child minding.  From July 1994, up to £30 per week of a working lone parents earnings is disregarded in assessing means for lone parents allowance.  In addition, child-minding &mdash; travel expenses of up to £50 per week and PRSI contributions are disregarded when calculating a working parent's entitlement to lone parents allowance and half of the remaining earnings are assessed.  For example, a lone parent with earnings of £100 per week, who avails of the above disregards can qualify for a lone parents allowance of £70.20 in addition in these earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of circular 13/93 was to inform health boards of the assistance available from voluntary organisations <Col N="1101" /> to lone parents in second chance education schemes and to indicate that payment of supplementary welfare would not be appropriate in these cases.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to promote opportunities for lone parents to avail of education opportunities.  In 1993, grants totalling £117,000 were given by my Department to 35 voluntary and community organisations around the country for projects aimed at helping lone parents to get back into the workforce or participate in second chance education.  Some of the projects funded that year included the provision of crêche facilities for young mothers attending educational courses.  This year a sum of £200,000 has been allocated for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I introduced regulations in November 1991 enabling people who, as a result of having been insured for periods in public service type employment at the modified rate of social insurance contribution, have gaps in their record of insurance for old age contributory pension and retirement pension purposes, to qualify for pension.  These arrangements provide that in cases of a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; insurance record a <i>pro-rata</i> pension is payable, which is proportionate to the periods of insurance completed at the full rate.  Any increases of pension payable in respect of an adult dependant are calculated on a similar basis.</P>
      <P>These arrangements are similar to those which apply under EC regulations to people who have mixed insurance in a number of different EC member states.  A similar formula applies under various reciprocal agreements on social security to which Ireland is a party. Accordingly, this formula is regarded as the internationally recognised standard for the award of pensions in cases of mixed insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People qualifying for these <i>pro-rata</i> pensions are also eligible for additional benefits such as free electricty, free television licence, free telephone rental, <Col N="1104" /> which would otherwise not be available to them.</P>

      <P>At the invitation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, I will be addressing the General Assembly in New York on 18 October 1994.  As part of the UN's programme for the International Year of the Family, the General Assembly will be devoting a special session to &ldquo;the Implementation of the Follow-up to the International Year of the Family&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have also been invited by the German Presidency to address the International Conference on &ldquo;Working and Caring: Developments at the Workplace for Family Carers of Disabled and Elderly Persons&rdquo; which will be held in Bonn on 24 and 25 November 1994. This conference is being organised jointly by the German Ministry for Family and Seniors and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions as part of their contribution to the International Year of the Family.</P>
      <P>As the details of the travel arrangements have not yet been finalised, it is not possible to give the projected costs of these visits.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at my Department is currently accompanying the President on her State visit to Tanzania. Final costs are not currently available. The Minister of State has no proposals for any further official journeys this year.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists householders who are on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is payable to eligible households from mid-October to mid-April.  An additional payment of £3 per week is made in the Dublin area because of the higher cost of smokeless fuel.  The smokeless fuel allowance will be extended to include Cork city and adjacent areas from the beginning of 1995.  The national fuel scheme has been extended to include recipients of disabled persons rehabilitation allowance which would benefit up to 2,000 people, from October 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on the scheme is expected to be in the region of £41 million this year.  It is estimated that some 256,000 recipients will receive the £5 <Col N="1106" /> fuel allowance and some 80,000 recipients will qualify for the £3 smokeless fuel allowance.  Participants on the community employment scheme who qualified for the fuel allowance prior to participation on the scheme will retain the allowance.</P>
    <P>The period from mid-October to mid-April during which the fuel allowance applies covers the period when average temperatures are lower than normal and heating is required on a fairly continuous basis.  There are no proposals to extend the duration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The question of an increase in the rate of the fuel allowance in the light of the modest level of increase in fuel prices since the present rate was fixed is a matter for consideration in the context of the budget.  Increasing the rate of the fuel allowance by £2 per week would cost some £14.7 million.</P>

      <P>I have one special adviser, who is a civil servant.  There is one post of special adviser to the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Joan Burton, which is filled by two people on a share basis.</P>
      <P>The function of personal advisory staff is to assist me and the Minister of State in discharging our responsibilities as public representatives and holders of Government Office in a Department of State with responsibility for delivery of social welfare services to the public.</P>
      <P>My partnership programme manager is a civil servant with extensive relevant experience in the Department of Social Welfare.  Prior to her present appointment she was head of information and research at principal officer level with the Pensions Board.  The partnership programme manger assists in managing and co-ordinating the achievement of the Government's objectives which are set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The partnership programme manager provides administrative back-up to my office to assist in the achievement of these objectives and regularly reviews progress.  The estimated cost for 1994 is £110,000.  This includes civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its ongoing business, my Department engages consultancy assistance principally to assist in the development of the computer systems aimed at modernising service delivery and to provide analysis of specific organisational issues.  Most consultancies relate to technical and/or management support with projects that are designed to improve the delivery of the services of my Department.  My Department's current consultancy requirement is heavily influenced by the development and implementation of a major strategic <Col N="1110" /> project to integrate all short term social welfare schemes.  The estimated cost to my Department of consultancy for 1994 is £4.27 million.</P>

      <P>My Department's free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years of age or over as well as certain incapacitated people in receipt of social welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel at off-peak periods for eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  Those include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-state companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by private contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I favour the Deputy's suggestion that the free travel scheme be extended, on <Col N="1111" /> a reciprocal basis, to enable pensioners to travel free over the whole of Ireland. In relation to Northern Ireland, however, there are significant differences between my Department's scheme and that operated by the responsible authorities in that jurisdiction.  I am having the matter examined further in my Department to see if an acceptable basis for a reciprocal agreement can be reached.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a difficulty being experienced by Bord na Móna workers and other seasonal workers relating to the fact that seasonal income is being taken fully into account when assessing means for unemployment assistance during off-season layoffs, which will result in many families suffering significant cuts in welfare payments in the course of the off-season; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[876/94]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1992, social welfare legislation has provided for the assessment of all income from insurable employment as means for unemployment assistance purposes.  The legislation also provides for an amount of earnings to be disregarded as a work incentive.  For example, a single person entitled to assistance at the long term rate may earn up to £25.17 per day for up to three days per week &mdash; £75.51 weekly &mdash; and receive full rate assistance totalling £30.50 for the three days not worked.  A married person with a dependent spouse and two dependent children may earn up to £35.67 per day for three days per week &mdash; £106.11 weekly &mdash; and receive assistance totalling £62.00 for the three days not worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of assessment laid down by legislation is to calculate the net income, i.e. gross income less tax, PRSI. union dues and VHI payments, that the person may be expected to receive in <Col N="1112" /> the year immediately following the date of assessment, deduct the disregard in respect of each day worked and to express this on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Bord na Móna workers to which the Deputy refers, are seasonal employees and their earnings over the summer months are thus averaged over the whole year.</P>
    <P>The means assessment of any person claiming assistance may be revised at any stage, if there are grounds for believing that the existing rate of means will no longer reflect the expected income over the year ahead.  In any review the procedure is to estimate the means over the year following the review date.</P>
    <P>Most Bord na Móna workers have an entitlement to and claim unemployment benefit when unemployed.  This benefit is not means-tested and entitlement is based on their PRSI insurance record. However, some have opted to claim long term unemployment assistance as, until recently, July 1994, the long term rate of assistance was higher than the rate of unemployment benefit.  Any person who availed of this option in the past may now resume claiming benefit if this is more beneficial.</P>
    <P>Persons who do not have an entitlement to unemployment benefit, either because they do not have sufficient qualifying contributions in the relevant year or, having claimed their full entitlement to 390 days benefit, require 13 further PRSI contributions to requalify, may claim unemployment assistance, which is means-tested.  If they qualify for a reduced level of assistance but still find themselves in difficulties, they may claim supplementary welfare allowance which is paid by the health board.</P>

      <P>My Department received £5,000 in EU aid for technical assistance under the NOW initiative.  The funding was used in respect of one project only. This project, entitled WAGE, aims to provide training, information and guidance for women in trouble with the law.</P>
      <P>A feasibility study on the project was carried out in June-July 1992 and final approval issued in March 1993 through the Department of Enterprise and Employment which is responsible for the national co-ordination of the NOW programme.  The feasibility study was prepared to assist the case for funding for the project and was not intended for publication.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda manpower and resources, inform me that four mobile units are attached to Irishtown Garda Station comprising a patrol car, a detective car, a patrol van and a motorcycle. I should also say that the detective car attached to Donnybrook station patrols the Irishtown sub-district as part of its duties.  The current strength at the station is 64 gardaí which represents an increase of 13 over the manpower allocation at the end of 1992.  This includes seven additional gardaí who were assigned to the station recently and this has enabled more foot patrols to be provided in the area.  The station serves an area of about seven square kilometres and has a population of approximately 23,500.</P>

      <P>Each application for naturalisation is considered in accordance with the statutory requirements.  The time taken to process each application, therefore, is the minimum time needed to complete inquiries which are essential to ensure that the statutory requirements are satisfied.  In addition, there is a backlog of about 1,000 cases, most of which have been outstanding for over <Col N="1116" /> six months.  In these circumstances, it is difficult to determine what is an average time for processing an individual application.  However, I am informed that an examination of a small sample of cases earlier this year where certificates had issued indicated an average processing time of 14 months.</P>

      <P>In March 1990 the Government decided that local authorities should be relieved of the financial burden of providing and maintaining courthouses and that the cost should in future be borne by the Exchequer, subject to a limit to be agreed annually between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>A sum of £3.2 million was provided for this purpose in the 1991 Estimates. This provision was reduced to £1 million in the Financial Review of July 1991.  A sum of £1.65 million was provided in 1992 with £1.92 million being provided in 1993.  A sum of £6.5 million has been provided in 1994 for capital and maintenance works.  This has been allocated to capital projects in Carlow, Carrick-on-Shannon, Clonmel, Cork, Donegal and Galway.  It has also allowed for as many as 45 maintenance projects to be undertaken nationwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Government decision of 1990, major works have been undertaken and concluded in Dún Laoghaire, Letterkenny and Athlone.  A large number of other works have been approved and are under way.  At present, due to budgetary constraints no decision has been taken to fund the day-to-day running costs of the courthouses which <Col N="1118" /> remain the responsibilities of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The position remains that a number of courthouses throughout the country still require renovation.  Priorities have been established in my Department between the different premises requiring attention.  I am pleased with the progress so far and I am confident that the next few years will see substantial improvements in the standard of court accommodation throughout the country.</P>

      <P>With regard to the level of crime the Garda authorities report that they have taken special measures to combat crime in these areas.  These include extensive patrolling by both uniform and plain clothes gardaí and the targeting of known suspects, especially in those areas considered to be at greatest risk. The number of crimes reported in 1993 in Coolock show a decrease of over 25 per cent compared with the figure for 1991.  The number of reported crimes in Santry, Raheny and Clontarf have remained relatively unchanged over this period.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the four sub-districts receive an adequate number of foot patrols.  In the areas in question, one sergeant and seven gardaí at Coolock, three gardaí at Santry, one sergeant and three gardaí at Clontarf and three gardaí at Raheny are assigned full time to community policing duties.  These gardaí perform foot patrols throughout their areas of responsibility and liaise with the local community on an ongoing basis.  They also keep in constant contact with the area co-ordinators of the neighbourhood watch groups in the area and attend neighbourhood watch meetings on a regular basis.  Support is given to existing neighbourhood watch groups and every opportunity to establish new schemes is pursued.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the current policing arrangements for the four sub-districts in question are adequate to meet the policing needs of these areas.  These arrangements are kept under continuing review and any changes considered necessary will be made.</P>

      <P>On 28 March, 1994 agreement was reached at the Garda Conciliation Council which provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that unsocial hours allowances, i.e. Saturday, Sunday, public holiday and night duty allowances, would be pensionable for members of the force serving on or after 1 January, 1994.  The foregoing arrangements would also apply to members who retired or died in service in the period 1 January, 1993 to 31 December, 1993 but any consequent increase in their pension would be payable only with effect from 1 January, 1994.</P>
      <P>Members who have retired from the Garda Síochána since 1 January 1993 can expect the benefit of pensionability of unsocial hours allowances in their pension cheques dated 1 December, 1994.  These cheques will include any arrears of pension due to them.</P>
      <P>Arrears of gratuity will be paid in separate cheques which will commence to issue this week beginning with those who retired in January 1993.  It is expected that all cheques for arrears of gratuity will be issued before mid-November 1994.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal that, in the absence of any special circumstances giving rise to delay, applications being lodged with the tribunal at present are likely to be determined by a single member within 12 months of the date of lodgement.  In the event of an appeal by the applicant, the maximum waiting period for an appeal hearing is 18 months approximately.</P>
      <P>I understand that the time taken to make payment varies from case to case and that priority as regards payment is determined by the date of acceptance of the award.  In this context, the last persons to have their awards paid accepted those awards in December 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I was appointed Minister for Justice I have been conscious of the need to reduce delays in making payments under the scheme.  In this regard I indicated, when publishing the policy document entitled &ldquo;The Management <Col N="1126" /> of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo;, I intended to seek an additional sum of £7.5 million over a period of time to clear arrears of awards made by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  I am taking this matter up with the Minister for Finance in the context of my Department's Estimates for 1995 and subsequent years.  Furthermore, as I indicated in my reply to Question No. 43 on 27 April, 1994, if savings arise elsewhere in the Department of Justice Vote and it is possible for me to divert these savings towards the elimination of arrears of compensation, I shall be happy to do so.</P>

      <P>Under the Explosives Act, 1875, a licence is required to be issued by my Department for the importation of fireworks.  It is long-standing policy that such licences are issued only for organised public displays conducted by professional operators.</P>
      <P>Despite this restriction, it is clear that supplies of fireworks continue to be imported illegally into the country, particularly around this time each year. The Garda authorities are aware of the problems posed by this illegal trade and take measures to counteract these problems.  These include:&mdash; the setting up of a special Garda Unit in Dublin to combat the sale/distribution of illegally imported fireworks; the deployment of personnel to known trouble areas to deal specifically with the problem; liaison with local authorities and the fire brigade service; and warnings on the dangers connected with fires and fireworks which are broadcast on all local radio stations on the days leading up to Halloween.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Garda authorities monitor the supply and storage of fireworks.  Significant seizures are made each year as a result of their vigilance. In 1993, for example, illegally imported fireworks valued at approximately £116,000 were confiscated by the gardaí over the Halloween period, and subsequently destroyed.  Significant seizures have already been made this year.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the Garda will take all necessary measures to deal with any problem occurring this year, to ensure, as far as possible, that fireworks which are illegally imported do not find their way onto the streets, and into the hands of children in particular.</P>

My Department is currently carrying out a review of the administrative procedures relating to traffic accidents involving Garda vehicles.  The purpose of this review is to revise those procedures in order to minimise the cost of these accidents to the State and the adverse impact they can have on the members of the public whose vehicles may be damaged in accidents with official Garda vehicles.  When the revised procedures are in place it should be possible to provide the type of information sought by the Deputy.</P>

In some cases the claims are in the course of finalisation.  Costs of journeys made by the Government jet are not included in the above figures.

      <P>My Department has a consultancy contract for the provision of advice, assistance and training in relation to contacts with the media and the Department's public image generally.  The current cost of the services provided is £2,453.67 per month, inclusive of VAT.  Also, a consultant was engaged recently to act as facilitator in the preparation of the Department's statement of strategy in connection with the ongoing strategic management initiative in the public service.  The cost is estimated at £5,000.</P>
      <P>There is one special adviser in my Department who advises the Minister of State on legislative and policy matters falling within his area of responsibility. In addition, he carries out any duties which may be assigned to him from time to time by the Minister of State as appropriate to his position.  Since his appointment on 27 April, 1992 the total costs incurred in respect of recoupment of salary, superannuation contributions and travel and subsistence amounted to £97,000 approximately.</P>

In <Col N="1133" /> addition, he performs any other Departmental duties assigned to him from time to time.  The cost involved to date amounts to £5,900 approximately in respect of salary, travel and subsistence.

      <P>While it is not possible to quantify accurately the level of drug misuse, figures published by the Garda authorities in respect of drug seizures and charges for drug-related offences give an indication of the extent of the problem.  This information is contained in the Commissioner's Annual Reports on Crime, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Generally, it shows that, while there has been a large increase in drugs offences since 1989, there has been a significant reduction in the level of increase in such offences since 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> I can assure the Deputy that, as Minister for Justice, I am determined to effectively tackle the drugs problem.  I have seen to it that the drugs situation is a matter of the very highest priority for the Garda.  In this regard, I am pleased to state that a number of substantial seizures of cannabis and heroin have been made by the Garda this year. Arising from these seizures, a number of prosecutions are currently in progress.  I expect that these developments will have a positive effect on the level of drug related offences, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    <P>All members of the Garda Síochána deal with law enforcement aspects of drug misuse within their operational area and there are now gardaí specifically trained in this area in each Garda Division.  In addition, Garda drug squads have been established in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  Special drug units such as the Task Force established in the north inner-city operate in particular areas of Dublin.  These units are co-ordinated on a national basis through the National Drug Administration Office based in Garda Headquarters.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, contains provisions for the confiscation of proceeds of crime and deals with money laundering by criminals, including drug traffickers.  In represents a major initiative against drug misuse in this country.</P>
    <P>Proposals are being prepared in my Department, in consultation with the other relevant Departments and State agencies, to achieve maximum co-operation between the existing law enforcement agencies in relation to the illegal importation of drugs and to address other important aspects of law enforcement in relation to the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>As regards the wider problem of drug misuse, I would refer the Deputy to the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse which was launched by the Minister for Health in 1991, and which contains an outline of the drugs problem in this country.  This strategy sets realistic and achievable objectives for reduction <Col N="1135" /> both in the supply and the demand for drugs.</P>

    <P>As the national authority for all matters relating to the European Social Fund, my Department is directly responsible for the allocation of funding <Col N="1137" /> under the Human Resources Community Initiatives in Ireland.  Funding under the initiatives is open to all project sponsors, including the partnership boards.</P>
    <P>Guidelines for the new Human Resources Community Initiatives were published by the European Commission in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 1 July 1994.  The guidelines provide for the following initiatives in the Human Resources area &mdash; Employment NOW, Employment Horizon, Employment Youthstart and ADAPT.</P>
    <P>Employment NOW and Employment Horizon are a continuation of the existing NOW and Horizon Initiatives.  The ADAPT Initiative represents a continuation and deepening of the present Euroform Initiative.  Employment Youthstart is a new initiative which aims to promote labour market integration of young people.</P>
    <P>Operational Programmes for the initiatives will be finalised in the near future and hopefully agreed with the European Commission early next year. Subject to this time frame being adhered to, it is proposed to publicly invite project proposals in the first half of 1995.</P>
    <P>Project sponsors, who have received assistance under the current Human Resources Community Initiatives, will be eligible to apply for funding under the new initiatives, providing they are in a position to comply with the criteria for funding set out in the Operational Programmes.</P>

      <P>The European Commission technical assistance provision to my Department of £9.865 million, referenced in my written reply to the Deputy on 29 June 1994, is assigned to a number of headings, as outlined as follows.</P>
      <P>
        <i>European Social Fund Programme Evaluation Unit</i>
      </P>
      <P>The European Social Fund Programme Evaluation Unit is funded 100 per cent by the European Commission. The unit was established in January 1992 in partnership between my Department and the European Commission. Its function is to evaluate the effectiveness of all human resource development interventions supported by the European Social Fund and complementary funding provided through the European Regional Development Fund.  The unit reports to a management committee representative of my Department, the European Commission and the Department of Education.  The work programme for the unit is agreed periodically between my Department, which is the national authority for the European Social Fund, and the European Commission.</P>
      <P>By virtue of its reporting structure, all studies carried out by the European Social Fund Programme Evaluation Unit are submitted to the European Commission.  A list of evaluations completed to date is at Appendix I.  Copies of all reports are also publicly available.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Human Resources Community Initiatives &mdash; Euroform, Horizon and NOW</i>
      </P>
      <P>Preparatory Technical Assistance of £3.553 million under this heading has been made available by the European Commission.  This funding, which is fully sourced from the European Social Fund, is provided for two particular purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, allocations were made to selected sponsors of projects to enable them <Col N="1139" /> to develop their initial proposals for funding under these three Community initiatives and to ensure that they fully complied with the eligibility and funding criteria set down.  A full list of the projects which received such support is given at Appendix II.  Not all of the projects submitted were subsequently approved for operational funding under the relevant programme.</P>
    <P>Support Structure Technical Assistance is also provided, at a 100 per cent intervention rate, through the European Social Fund over the period.  This funding facilitated my Department in retaining expertise to provide full-time support and advice to participating projects on operational aspects and to ensure that they realised the programme objectives established at the outset.  An important part of this exercise also is to provide support to project sponsors, many of them in the voluntary/ community sector and having access to European Social Fund moneys for the first time, through assistance with financial management and control procedures.</P>
    <P>The support structures involved are: The NOW programme &mdash; The Council for the Status of Women; The Euroform Programme &mdash; Leargas &mdash; The Exchange Bureau, The Horizon Programme for the Disabled &mdash; The National Rehabilitation Board for the Disadvantaged &mdash; The Work Research Centre.</P>
    <P>Technical assistance provision for the purposes outlined above is focused on operational support and, although quarterly reporting on projects and the dissemination of information is an integral part of the role of the support structures, the publication/availability of studies in the sense posed in the Deputy's question is not relevant in this context.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Innovative Actions for Vocational Training and Employment</i>
    </P>
    <P>Sixteen projects are currently receiving funding under this programme through the European Social Fund <Col N="1140" /> (ESF).  The total ESF budget is £4,236 million and the intervention rate is 75 per cent of project costs.  Project details and the individual ESF allocations involved are given at Appendix III.</P>
    <P>Support to ensure that the quality, operational and financial requirements are realised has been arranged by my Department and involves an ESF technical assistance budget of £0.155 million.</P>
    <P>The support structure for this programme, which discharges an identical role to that described above and related to the Community Initiatives Support Structures, is Leargas &mdash; The Exchange Bureau.</P>
    <P>
      <i>ERDF Technical Assistance Received during 1989-1993</i>
    </P>
    <P>Over the period 1989-1993 the Department of Enterprise and Employment Industry-ERDF side received £932,000 in EU funding for technical assistance.  This amount is calculated as follows:</P>

    <P>External Evaluator: a specific condition of the Industry Operational Programme &mdash; OP &mdash; under which the assistance from the European Regional Development Fund would be provided, was that the member state, in agreement with the Commission, would contract an outside evaluator to carry out an ongoing evaluation of the operational programme.  Deloitte and Touche were engaged as external evaluators and commenced work in 1990.  Their <Col N="1141" /> first report was completed in December 1991 and submitted to the Industry Monitoring Committee.  The European Commission are members of that committee.</P>
    <P>Deloitte and Touche were re-engaged as external evaluators in mid-1992 and commenced their evaluation in November 1992.  Their second and final report was submitted to the Department in February 1994.  The report was supplied to the Commission and will be considered by the Industry Monitoring Committee at its next meeting which is scheduled for late October.  Copies of the report are available on request.  The total expenditure for the evaluation was £289,000.  That expenditure was grant-aided at 75 per cent from the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    <P>IT equipment for Agencies: to facilitate the provision of physical indicators and financial data required under the Industry OP, the IDA, SFADCo and Eolas were provided with financial support to upgrade their data processing facilities.  Expenditure of £421,795 was grant-aided at 75 per cent from the CSF technical assistance programme.  Total European Regional Development Fund received by the agencies amounted to £316,350.</P>
    <P>Funding of the Industry Evaluation Unit: in mid-1992 the European Commission agreed to fully grant-aid the operation of a full-time Evaluation Unit for the Industry OP.  The function of the unit is to carry out reviews and analyses of the measures and subprogrammes of the Industry Operational Programme.</P>
    <P>The unit reports to a Steering Group made up of officials from the relevant Government Departments, the European Commission and the Social Partners.  Copies of all studies carried out are provided to the Commission.  The question of publication of studies is to be considered by the Steering Group in the near future.</P>
    <P>Technical Assistance Subprogramme: a provision of 0.1 per cent of the European Regional Development Fund support to measures under the Industry Operational Programme was made <Col N="1142" /> available for technical assistance purposes in order to strengthen the management, co-ordination and control required for monitoring and evaluation of the programme.  Total Government expenditure under this heading for the five years amounted to £170,000.  That expenditure was grant-aided from the European Regional Development Fund at 75 per cent, i.e. £127,000.  The expenditure incurred was for upgrading the industrial data base in the Department and in ABT; information, publicity and printing relating to the launch of the Operational Programme; the engagement of consultants to report on business information centres in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Technical Assistance for PRISMA Initiative: the £40,000 European Regional Development Fund received for technical assistance under the PRISMA Initiative was for: printing of the PRISMA OP; engaging consultants in the selection of proposals process; market research study into calibration requirements in Ireland; advertising and publicity of the OP; engaging consultants to carry out an evaluation of the OP and PRISMA Awards Launch at the completion of the OP.</P>

      <P>The most recent analysis of awards made in unfair dismissal cases referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal is contained in the annual report of the tribunal for the year 1993 a copy of which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the perception, to which the Deputy refers, that the awards do not compensate for the loss of employment.</P>
      <P>Where the tribunal finds that an unfair dismissal has taken place and it is decided that payment of compensation is appropriate, all the factors relevant to that particular case are taken into consideration in the making of such a determination.</P>
      <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, provides that an award to be paid by an employer to an employee may not exceed 104 weeks remuneration and that regard must be had to the financial loss, actual or prospective, suffered by the employee.</P>
      <P>Any concerned party may appeal to the Circuit Court for a determination of the tribunal in relation to a claim for redress under the Act.</P>

      <P>The Employment Appeal Tribunal made awards of compensation to the employees concerned under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-1991.  When the employer failed to implement the decision of the tribunal, the employees made complaints to my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department wrote to the employer in June, 1994 seeking implementation of the tribunal awards and the employer responded indicating that they had appealed the tribunal's decision to the High Court and, therefore, were not in a position to make any payments to the employees until the appeal had been decided.  I am advised that this matter remains the subject of High Court proceedings and that, while this continues to be the case, I am estopped from pursuing implementation of the awards.</P>

      <P>I am well aware that licensing bodies, including IMRO, which represent copyright holders have become quite proactive in collecting their rightholders charges in all areas in recent years.</P>
      <P>As a result of this increased level of activity numerous organisations have made representations to my Department.  On foot of these representations and, in view of recent dramatic changes in technology which impact on copyright, my Department is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of all matters relating to this subject.  The point raised by the Deputy will be examined in that context.  I hope to be in a position to introduce a modernising piece of legislation to the Dáil in this very complex area in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy that as many local authority tenants as possible should have the option of purchasing their dwellings.  The 1993 tenant purchase scheme envisaged that, in principle, both local authority houses and flats could be purchased by tenants. However, as I stated in reply to previous questions, important issues have arisen in relation to the question of offering local authority flats for sale.</P>
      <P>A detailed examination of all the aspects involved in developing suitable arrangements for the sale of these flats, including the need for any changes in the law, has been carried out by my Department in consultation with the local authorities principally concerned and with the assistance of independent legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the legal advice is that any workable arrangements for the sale of local authority flats that would have due regard to the interests of all the parties involved would have to follow the same general principles that apply to the sale of private flats.  This would require the setting up of a management company to take over ownership and responsibility for the management and maintenance of each flat block from the local authority.  Each tenant purchaser <Col N="1156" /> in the block would hold a share in the company and the local authority would hold shares equivalent to the number of unsold flats in the block.  The responsibilities of the management company would have to include: the establishment of an adequate reserve fund so that moneys would be available for future refurbishment, and repair of the flat block and its facilities, obtaining buildings and public liability insurance, day to day management and maintenance of the building, grounds, common areas, services, etc. and the setting and collection of service charges from the owners of the individual flats to finance these management functions.</P>
    <P>It is fundamental to the sale of any flat that an adequate reserve fund be established to meet the cost of major structural or other works to the complex that would arise over time.  Otherwise, the flats would deteriorate and depreciate in value.  To create a reserve fund, a contribution would have to be made by each tenant-purchaser &mdash; and by the local authority for each flat not purchased &mdash; as part of the service charge they would have to pay to finance the operations of the management company.  A case study undertaken by Dublin Corporation in relation to a typical local authority flat complex &mdash; not high-rise &mdash; indicates that the repairs and refurbishment works that would be needed over a ten year period would require a contribution towards a reserve fund of almost £50 per week in respect of each flat.  As well as contributing to the reserve fund, the service charge would have to cover the cost of insurance, routine maintenance and day to day management and would be additional to the tenant-purchaser's loan repayments on the purchase money.  As a consequence, the level of the total outgoings on the flat clearly would be unaffordable and would compare very unfavourably with current rent levels.</P>
    <P>Another major difficulty would relate to insurance against public liability claims.  While a local authority, as owner, in the absence of insurance, <Col N="1157" /> could carry these liabilities themselves, a management company could not be exposed to such risks and would have to have insurance cover.  However, inquiries to the insurance industry, indicate that, because of the prevailing level of public liability claims affecting local authority flat complexes, public liability insurance would not be available, or would be available only at an unrealistic price.</P>
    <P>A further point of difficulty concerns the saleability of purchased flats.  A second-hand flat which did not have access to an adequate reserve fund and proper insurance cover would not be saleable and would not be considered a marketable security by a mortgage lender.  A situation would then arise in which tenant-purchasers or their successors would end up with a property which they no longer needed, or on which they were paying unaffordable service charges, but which they would have no prospect of selling at a realistic price.</P>
    <P>Against this general background it is clear that any decision to proceed with the sale of local authority flats ultimately would prove to be a disservice to tenant purchasers by leaving them with a liability for unaffordable service charges, flats that were unsaleable and the likelihood of declining standards of maintenance and services.  The latter would also affect tenants who had elected not to purchase.  In the circumstances, I have had to conclude that, notwithstanding any new legislative provisions that might be introduced, no practicable arrangements could be made for such sales that would prove to be satisfactory to tenant purchasers and to tenants who did not wish to buy.  I am confirmed in my view by the very unsatisfactory experience with the sale of flats by local authorities in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The local authorities concerned have now been informed that there is no option but to exclude flats from tenant purchase schemes.  Authorities have been requested to fully explain the reasons for this decision to tenants and <Col N="1158" /> to give them particulars of the other options for home ownership; these include shared ownership, the mortgage allowance scheme, the £3,000 new house grant and the local authority house purchase loans scheme.  Authorities have also been asked, where possible, to facilitate tenants wishing to transfer to an ordinary local authority house so that they can have the option of buying the house under the tenant purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>The difficulties outlined above relating to flats may not, however, apply to all local authority maisonettes, particularly those which do not have common areas which would not, as a result, require the establishment of formal management arrangements or payment of service charges.  Therefore, authorities have been asked to consider whether satisfactory arrangements can be made for the sale of maisonettes to tenants who express an interest in purchasing.</P>
    <P>To ensure that tenants of flats have the best possible quality of housing services, my Department will continue to impress on local authorities the importance of improving the standard of management and maintenance of flat blocks in accordance with the statutory statements of policy that have now been adopted by all authorities.  In this regard, the need for authorities to increase the involvement of tenants in the management process has been emphasised in order to promote community development, to give tenants a greater say in how their flat complexes are run and, as a consequence, provide them with the best possible living conditions and environment.</P>

      <P>European Commission approval of the Operational Programme on Peripherality 1989 to 1993 was conditional on the objectives quoted in the programme being quantified more explicitly, project selection procedures being elucidated and a progress monitoring system being defined.  A provision of up to 8 million ECU was included in the programme for this purpose.  Based on an expert report commissioned by the European Commission, a technical assistance <Col N="1160" /> programme to meet these objectives was agreed with the Commission and approved by the Programme Monitoring Committee in March 1991.  Implementation of that programme was overseen by a steering committee comprised of the European Commission, the external evaluator to the Operational Programme and the Government Departments concerned.</P>
      <P>At present, the final report on the implementation of the technical assistance programme is being prepared detailing all projects, studies etc., which have been undertaken.  When this report has been approved by the Programme Monitoring Committee, copies will be made generally available and a copy provided to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Studies supported by the technical assistance programme, and already published, include the Dublin Transportation Initiative and the Port Access and Eastern Relief Route Study.</P>

      <P>As stated in reply to Question No. 773 of 22 March 1994 the preliminary report for this scheme has been under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>The question of funding for this scheme, and for water services projects generally, has been considered in the context of the resources available under the National Development Plan.  The high level of existing commitments and the demands of schemes already prioritised for investment account for all finance available to the water services programme at present.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide funding for this scheme at this stage.  However, the position will be regularly reviewed during the period of the National Development Plan.</P>

      <P>The European Charter of Pedestrians' Rights is comprised in a resolution adopted by the European Parliament in 1988.  Unlike a treaty or international convention, there is no provision for its signature or ratification by EU member states but, like other resolutions passed by the Parliament, it is taken into account when formulating national policy.</P>
      <P>The Roads Acts, 1993, places an obligation on road authorities to consider the needs of all road users when performing their road construction and maintenance functions.  The final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative makes a number of specific recommendations in relation to pedestrian facilities. I have allocated grants totalling £315,000 this year to the Dublin local authorities to improve pedestrian facilities in a way which is consistent with these recommendations.</P>

As both Dublin and Limerick Corporations do not avail of all sources of local income, it was considered inappropriate to consider either of these authorities for additional financial assistance of this kind.</P>

      <P>There are no plans for the establishment of such a board.  Claims involving rent deposits may be dealt with under the small claims procedure which operates within the District Court structure under the aegis of the Department of Justice.  In addition, enforcement by local authorities of the Housing (Rent Books) Regulations, 1993, which require landlords, <i>inter-alia,</i> to supply tenants with rent books and to record in them the amount, purpose and conditions for repayment of deposits paid by tenants, should help to eliminate <Col N="1170" /> sources of difficulty in regard to rent deposits.</P>

      <P>The Greater Dublin Area is providing the focus for an innovative approach to tackling transportation problems in major urban areas.  The final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative recommends a balanced and integrated transportation strategy <Col N="1171" /> designed to provide a rightful, but not a dominant, place for the car in the urban transportation system.  The principal proposals made by DTI were endorsed by the Government in the National Development Plan.  The Community Support Framework, agreed by the Government and the European Commission, makes provision for substantial EU assistance to implement the main DTI recommendations.</P>
      <P>The review of the Cork land use and transportation study, completed in 1992, provides an integrated approach to dealing with transport problems in the greater Cork area and is being implemented with appropriate State and EU support.  The problems in the other major urban areas are on a smaller scale.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, the question relates to legal codes which are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  However, housing legislation provides separately for legal proceedings by local authorities in relation to house purchase and improvement loans advanced by them.  This legislation ensures that, in every case, an application to a court is required.  I am of the view that it would be undesirable to remove the protection of the courts from occupiers and I have no proposals to amend housing legislation in this respect.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question on 14 June, 1994 the recommendation of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission), which involved the reckoning of military service allowance for pension purposes in respect of retired personnel of the Defence Forces, has been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from this recommendation the commission considered that any further changes in the superannuation arrangements should be introduced only in the context of a fundamental revision of the Defence Forces pension schemes.  The commission recognised that such a revision would be a task of considerable <Col N="1179" /> technical complexity and would involve a fundamental re-appraisal of the existing arrangements.  The outcome of the review of the Defence Forces, which is currently being undertaken by the efficiency audit group, will also be a factor in this matter.  Detailed consultations and discussions with the representative associations will be required in due course.</P>

      <QRef>[747/94]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews) Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to the matters referred to in the letter in question is as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Spouses' and Children's Pensions</i></P>
      <P>Prior to 1978 there was no provision for the payment of pensions by the Department of Defence to the widows and children of deceased soldiers.  Such provision was first made in 1978 when a contributory pension scheme for those dependants was introduced with effect from 1 June 1977.</P>
      <P>Membership of the contributory scheme was compulsory in the case of soldiers enlisting after the 31 January, 1978 and optional in the case of soldiers who served at any time between 1 June 1977 and 31 January 1978.  Payment of benefit under this scheme is dependent upon the soldiers having become a member of it and having paid the appropriate contributions as required by its terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concurrently with the introduction of the contributory scheme, a special <i>ex-gratia</i> scheme was introduced to cover the dependants of soldiers who had either died in service, or had retired on pension prior to 1 June 1977 and to whom the contributory scheme did not apply.  Initially, the rates of benefit under the <i>ex-gratia</i> scheme were half <Col N="1180" /> the relevant rates under the contributory scheme but over the years the rates have been brought up to full parity.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Special increment for service in excess of 21 years</i></P>
    <P>The Defence Forces pension schemes provide for the payment of a special increment (currently £3.51 a week) in addition to the basic pension to a soldier for each year of pensionable service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years.  As a general rule, this special increment is payable until the soldier pensioner becomes entitled to a social welfare retirement pension (at age 65) or to a contributory old age pension (at age 66).  The personal rate of either social welfare pension is considerably greater than the maximum special increment.  Exceptionally, the increment continues to be payable up to 70 years of age in the case of a pensioner who was discharged prior to 1 August 1978, provided he is not in receipt of a social welfare retirement pension.</P>
    <P>The arrangements in place are in accordance with the principle of co-ordinating occupational pensions in the public sector with social welfare pensions in the case of employees who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  Soldiers are so insured.</P>
    <P>This matter was examined by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission).  The commission did not recommend any change in the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Pensionability of military service allowance (MSA)</i></P>
    <P>This allowance was introduced in 1979 as compensation for the special disadvantages associated with military life.  In its report dated 31 July 1990 the Gleeson Commission recommended that the allowance should be made pensionable.  On foot of this recommendation, an addition to pension in respect of MSA was introduced and applies, subject to certain conditions, to personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990, <Col N="1181" /> i.e. the day following publication of the Gleeson report.</P>
    <P>However, having regard to established superannuation practice in other areas of the public service, including the cost involved, it is regretted that the extension of the measure to other retired personnel cannot be undertaken.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Increase in pensions</i></P>
    <P>Agreement was recorded on 20 September 1994 with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Permanent Defence Force regarding the application to enlisted personnel of the terms of the pay agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> On foot of this agreement, pensions fall to be increased by 2 per cent from 1 June 1994 in the case of retired enlisted personnel and the necessary arrangements for payment are being made.  Discussions are still on-going under the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme regarding the application of the terms of the pay agreement to the commissioned ranks represented by RACO.  The question of an increase in the pensions applicable to those ranks will be considered in the light of the outcome of the discussions.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question of 29 June this year, two research projects received funding under the Community Support Framework (CSF) for Fish Processing and Marketing.  Under the CSF up to 1 per cent of total funding may be spent on technical assistance.</P>
      <P>The projects which received assistance were:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) A consultancy study commissioned by an Bord Iascaigh Mhara <Col N="1186" /> on guidelines for best practice in relation to the location and design parameters of shore based facilities for the handling and depuration of shellfish.  The cost of the study was £46,827 attracting CSF funding of £21,072.</P>
    <P>The need for the study arose from the requirements of certain Council Directives in relation to the operation of the shellfish industry.  The Directives set out health conditions for the production and placing on the market of live bi-valve molluscs which will require the creation of numerous covered dispatch and purification centres.</P>
    <P>The resultant guidelines will assist local authorities and An Bord Pleanála in deciding on planning permission approvals in these cases.  The guidelines will also be of considerable assistance to producers in preparing proposals for such facilities.</P>
    <P>(b) A research and development project was undertaken by Chamco Seafoods Limited, a private company, into improved product shelf life, marketing, packaging and other production factors and enabled the recruitment of five staff at the company's on site laboratory.  The research will underpin the development of new product lines and the improvement of existing products. CSF assistance for the project amounted to £85,500.</P>
    <P>Copies of both studies have been forwarded to the European Commission. Members of the public requiring copies of the reports should contact Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Crofton Road, Dún Laoghaire or Chamco Seafoods, The Food Centre, Raheen, County Limerick.</P>

      <P>The ESB gave notice to the Department under the Electricity Acts in January 1992 of their intention to erect a high tension cable from Inishnakillew, via Moneybeg, serving Clynish Island, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The section of the overhead line over the main navigable channel between Moneybeg and Clynish islands was subsequently replaced with an under water cable in line with the Department's advice and following representations from local interested parties.  The fatal accident on 21 August occurred outside the main navigable channel between Moneybeg and Inishnakillew.</P>
      <P>A report by the Marine Survey Office into the accident recommended the immediate erection of warning signs at the location.  This has been acted upon by the ESB.  The report also recommended an urgent review of safety standards and hazard warning procedures of overhead powerlines in the vicinity of all waterways and to offshore islands.  A comprehensive review of all the relevant issues is currently being finalised by a joint working group of the Department, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the ESB.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine's major development scheme currently underway at Kilmore Quay, County Wexford, involves underpinning the existing pier, the dredging and deepening of the harbour, the provision of a new quay and slipway at the north end of the harbour and the reinstatement of the east breakwater.  This project which will cost in the region of £2 million, represents a considerable investment by both the Department of the Marine and Wexford County Council.  There are no plans to undertake any additional works.</P>

      <P>It is expected that the EU Transport Operational Programme will be adopted by the end of October 1994.</P>
      <P>This programme will set out the detailed allocations and criteria on the basis of which specific port projects proposals will be assessed.</P>
      <P>The proposals advanced by Dundalk Harbour Commissioners and other harbour authorities will be addressed within that framework.  In this regard, it is hoped to be in a position by the end of this year to set priorities for EU aid over the period 1994 to 1999.</P>
      <P>Dundalk is an important regional port with bulk trade of 270,000 tonnes in 1993 principally in grain, coal, peat and gas oil.</P>
      <P>This port will continue in this role into the future and its status will be enhanced through the granting to it of commercial semi-State body status under this new harbours legislation.</P>

      <P>Under the Abattoirs Act, 1988, all abattoirs engaged in the supply of meat to the domestic market are required to be licensed annually and to meet the standards laid down in the regulations made under the Act.</P>
      <P>To facilitate abattoir owners, provision was made in the Act for upgrading to the prescribed standard to be carried out over a five year period commencing 1 September 1989.</P>
      <P>The abattoir for which details were supplied does not meet the minimum standards prescribed by regulations and it is considered that it would not be possible to upgrade it to the necessary standards.  As the statutory limitation of five years for ugrading abattoirs expired on 1 September 1994, I regret that no further concessions can be made in this case and that slaughtering at this premises cannot be continued.  It should be possible for the owner concerned to have his animals slaughtered at other approved premises in the Dublin area. There are no funds available to me out of which domestic abattoirs can be grant aided.</P>

    <P>In 1992, 233 cattle originating in Northern Ireland were exported to other EU member states from Rosslare.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the economic implications of the live export trade.  For this reason it is my policy to encourage the export of beef rather than live animals. In pursuit of that policy, generous State assistance is available for investment in plant and machinery, for research and for market promotion by the beef processing sector and every effort is made to ensure that EU support mechanisms provide effective support for the export of beef.  The relative market prices of live animals and beef are, of course, a major factor determining the proportions of our cattle that are exported live and dead.  Under EU rules, it is not <Col N="1200" /> legally possible to introduce export restrictions.</P>

      <P>The retention periods of two months for cattle on which disadvantaged areas headage grants and EU special beef premium grants have been claimed have been set in accordance with EU regulations. Retention periods under the schemes expired in August and animals entered for the two schemes could have been sold after their retention periods ended. I do not accept therefore, that the retention periods are the cause of any over-supply of cattle on the market in the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year I announced a £4.8 million investment to develop and upgrade computer facilities and other resources particularly in local offices of my Department <Col N="1201" /> with the objective of achieving the optimum delivery of my Department's services to farmers and with special emphasis on the timely payment of headage and premia grants.</P>
      <P>A new computerised on-line payment system has now been put in place in local offices.  The payments system in the special beef unit of my Department has also been upgraded.  In addition, extra staffing resources have been put in place in local offices and Portlaoise for 1994.  Some 30 staff have been recruited for the new centralised area aid unit of my Department so as to process 1994 area aid applications more quickly and to relieve the local offices of this work.  These new arrangements and additional resources should ensure a much speedier throughput of payments in 1994.</P>
      <P>I have always made clear my objective of ensuring the earliest delivery of premium and headage payments to farmers.  Since becoming Minister, record levels of direct payments have been made to farmers in both 1992 and 1993 when £349 million and £377 million respectively were paid.  Indeed a total of over £491 million has now been paid out on foot of 1993 schemes.</P>
      <P>Already this year some £335 million has been paid to farmers under premium and headage schemes.  Close to £80 million of payments made this year relate to 1994 ewe premium and deseasonalisation slaughter premium schemes where 98 per cent and 92 per cent respectively of eligible applicants have already received payments, a performance second to none in the EU.  Very significant levels of further 1994 payments will be commencing in a few weeks when EU regulations permit special beef premium and suckler cow premium advances to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the very substantial increase in the volume of applications since 1992 and the new integrated control system introduced under EU regulations.  I believe that the record levels of payments achieved speak for themselves. The additional resources which I have obtained from the Government will <Col N="1202" /> result in an even higher level of payments in 1994 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>The position is that payment of the first and second instalment of 1994 ewe premium commenced on 26 July shortly after the regulations fixing the amounts of the instalments had been made by the EU Commission.  At the end of August up to 45,500 applicants or just over 95 per cent of all likely eligible applicants had been paid a total of £65 million.  The position at present is that 98 per cent of all likely eligible applicants have been paid a total of almost £68 million and it is expected that any remaining eligible applicants will be paid shortly.</P>
      <P>Ireland's performance in delivering 1994 ewe premium payments compares very favourably with that of other member states.</P>

      <P>As not all of the shareholders in this commonage wish to have it divided, it can only be divided using compulsory procedures. The extent of the Land Commission involvement in this commonage to date has been to receive the application for the division and to conduct a preliminary examination of the commonage to ascertain what a division of the commonage would entail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission is still awaiting the final result of an appeal to the High Court against a decision of the Lay Commissioners confirming a scheme to divide another commonage in County Mayo using compulsory procedures.  In 1992 the court directed that certain matters in the Mayo case, including the question of compliance with planning legislation, should be clarified before the case was returned to the court.  The matter was referred to An Bord Pleanála, and the decision of An Bord Pleanála, which was delivered last year, was appealed to the High Court.  This second appeal must be concluded before the original appeal is resolved.  This is the first time that the legislation used in the compulsory division of commonages has been referred to the High Court and the Land Commission will reassess the procedures it uses in these cases in the light of the judgment of the court.  In the meantime <Col N="1209" /> if the shareholders reach agreement on the question of division they may apply to their local Land Commission office for assistance in dividing the commonage using voluntary procedures.</P>

      <P>The person in question applied on 83 cows in November 1993 under the 1993 suckler cow scheme.  At an inspection carried out in May 1994 at least 12 of the cows presented were deemed to be of friesian breed but were declared at application to have been of Hereford breed.

      <P>In relation to both of the above matters there is indication of intentional false declaration.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> Under the recently launched control of farm pollution scheme, participants in the scheme must not spread farm waste, including slurry, between 1 November and 31 January each year and must undertake to empty their storage tanks by 31 October each year.  These requirements are aimed at reducing pollution problems of slurry spreading to a minimum.  Also farmers in the new rural environmental protection scheme (REPS) are required to have an environmentally satisfactory waste management plan prepared for their farm. This of course would cover the proper application rates and spreading time of slurry.</P>
    <P>There is an environmental pollution control regime provided for in the Air and Water Pollution Acts, which the local authorities operate under the aegis of the Department of the Environment.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 358 and 363 together.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, provides a budget of no more than £7 million in European Regional Development Fund aid for the selective hotel accommodation improvement scheme.</P>
      <P>The programme indicates that in very limited circumstances, support will be available for certain improvements to existing small and medium-sized hotels with a current capacity of up to 100 bedrooms and graded up to and including three star.  Assistance will be considered in exceptional cases:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;where it is clear that improvements are necessary to bring the premises <Col N="1234" /> up to modern international standards in a new or developing tourist area;</P>
    <P>&mdash;where accommodation needs cannot otherwise be met; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;where the proprietors are able to provide satisfactory evidence that they will cater for new tourist business to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The main metropolitan areas of Dublin city and county as well as the urban areas of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford are explicitly excluded from assistance under this provision as are any works eligible for tax incentives in all special designated areas.  The overall investment on eligible works under this heading must be a minimum of £250,000, and a maximum grant aid rate of 25 per cent will apply.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to change these criteria.  In line with the provisions of the Community Support Framework, 1994 to 1999, it is envisaged that applications for grant assistance of less than £50,000 will be eligible for assistance under other EU-supported programmes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 366 and 370 together.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated to the House that the broad thrust of the individual transport investment listed in the National Development Plan, which includes £200 million for the development of a light rail system in Dublin, would be dealt with in the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999. The programme has been finalised and I expect that it will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>The basic light rail system recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative is for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely (via the Harcourt Street line) and Ballymun and would cost approximately £300 million to implement. Possibilities for further extensions to the basic network will also be reported on in the final report of the DTI which will be published shortly.  The basic network cannot be constructed within the EU and other resources totalling £200 million set out in the National Plan. Moreover, a longer time frame than that of the plan will be needed to complete the basic DTI network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is engaged in detailed work to advise on the optimum combination of light rail links, based on the recommendation of the DTI, to be constructed over the planned period. All of the bodies involved in the planning and provision of transportation in the Dublin area are co-operating with my Department in this work.  The Government's decision on the choice of light rail links will be influenced by major factors such as financial viability, congestion alleviation, levels of peak <Col N="1237" /> and off peak demand, social need and ease of construction.  I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on these issues in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 367 and 380 together.</P>
      <P>The present Government and previous administrations have, for many years, been seeking the closure of the Sellafield Reprocessing Plant and a halt to expansion plans there.  This culminated in two very detailed and wideranging submissions sent to the British authorities in 1993 by the Irish Government.  Despite the concerns of the Government outlined in these submissions and at various international fora, the British Government decided on 15 December, 1993 to grant the discharge authorisations to British Nuclear Fuels to allow the THORP plant to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> Following the decision of the British authorities to proceed with THORP, I requested the RPII to monitor the effects of discharges from Sellafield with particular emphasis on discharges from the THORP reprocessing plant.  In this context, the institute has expanded its marine monitoring programme to obtain further data on the radionuclides which will be discharged in greater quantities under the new Sellafield discharge authorisations.  The RPII, in its report entitled &ldquo;Radioactivity Monitoring of the Irish Marine Environment, 1991 and 1992&rdquo;, estimated that the radiation doses due to the consumption of fish and shellfish landed at north-east ports were calculated to be 1.1 and 0.74 microsieverts (mSv) to the typical consumer and 5.2 and 3.6 mSv to a heavy consumer of seafood in 1991 and 1992 respectively.  The results for 1993 and early 1994 were similar.  It has been estimated that if discharges to the Irish Sea from Sellafield were made at the new authorised limits, then the dose for the heavy consumer would be about 11-12 microsieverts.  These doses represent only a fraction of 1 per cent of the average annual dose of about 3000 mSv received by members of the Irish public from all sources of radiation, most of which arises from naturally occurring sources.  These results indicate that there is not likely to be a significant risk to the health of the people of Ireland. Nevertheless, radioactive contamination of the Irish marine environment continues to occur as a consequence of activities at Sellafield and I have asked the institute to monitor the situation on an on-going basis.</P>
    <P>I would add that concerns have been expressed about the quantities of Krypton-85 which will be discharged to the atmosphere from the THORP reprocessing plant.  Its discharge could be ten times greater than the existing discharge once THORP is fully operational.  In view of this, the RPII has installed facilities at its laboratories in Clonskeagh in Dublin to sample Krypton-85 in the atmosphere.  Measurements began in late 1993 and results indicate that the <Col N="1239" /> level of Krypton-85 is in line with that expected in temperate latitudes of the northern hemisphere.  The radiological significance of Krypton-85 is relatively low and is not likely to result in a significant health hazard.  In conclusion, as in the past, I and my officials will maintain international and diplomatic pressure in every appropriate forum and at every possible opportunity to highlight our concerns and to request the cessation of Sellafield's reprocessing facilities.  Our opposition to Sellafield has already been raised at EC level, in the International Atomic Energy Agency, at the OECD/Nuclear Energy Agency meetings and at the Paris Commission and the London Dumping Convention.  In addition, at Energy and Environmental Councils of the EU, responsible Ministers have persistently raised Ireland's concerns about the dangers arising from Sellafield's discharges and operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389, 390, 391 and 392 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's National Report for the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women was drawn up by a committee representing relevant Government Departments, the Employment Equality Agency and non-governmental organisations.  It will be published this week.  The report contains contributions from a number of non-governmental organisations.  In addition, I intend to publish, in advance of the World Conference, other contributions from NGOs so that the broadest possible range of views can be expressed on the subject matter of the conference.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, departmental estimates for next year have yet to be determined but I will avail of appropriate opportunities to highlight the importance of this conference and I am aware that relevant NGOs intend to do likewise.</P>

      <P>I am in the process of drafting legislation to amend many of the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, including those sections which specify penalties for breaches of the legislation.  The Wildlife Act is not, however, the appropriate legislation to deal specifically with the problem of cruelty to animals.  This matter is more appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the Heritage Council Bill, 1994, which I recently introduced in the Seanad, the Wildlife Advisory Council will be replaced by a Standing Committee on Wildlife of the Heritage Council.</P>
      <P>While there is no specific funding provision for the Wildlife Advisory Council, administrative costs arising from the operation of the council are met from the allocation for the National Heritage Council and staffing and office requirements are provided by my Department.</P>

    <P>Members are appointed to the Wildlife Advisory Council in a personal capacity rather than as representatives of any particular organisation and it is not the intention to alter this position.

      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the possibility of including this condition as one of the specified illnesses under the long term illness scheme.  The long term <Col N="1267" /> illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illnesses and there are no plans at present to extend the number of illnesses covered by the scheme.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses (general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc.) due to a long term medical condition such as that described by the Deputy, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an on-going medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which cater for people who are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.</P>
      <P>Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 for use in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from long term medical conditions.</P>

      <P>The patient concerned is on the in-patient waiting list for surgery at Merlin Park Hospital but it is not possible to give an admission date at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of hospital admission is a matter for the consultant concerned and each patient is assessed to determine medical priority.  Should the patient feel that his condition has deteriorated he should return to his general practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of his case directly to the consultant.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the Waiting List Initiative 1994 a total of £850,000 was allocated to the Western Health Board for the provision of 1,222 additional procedures, including 109 orthopaedic procedures.  This should help to reduce the overall waiting time for patients in the specialties targeted.</P>
      <P>In addition, development funds of £400,000 were provided to the board this year for the expansion of orthopaedic services at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  As a result, approval has issued to the Western Health Board to recruit a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and a consultant anaesthetist together with necessary support staff.</P>

      <Quest>the numbers on the waiting lists in the Mater Hospital, Dublin 7, for the various categories of cardiac operations; if the waiting list has increased in size over the last 12 months; and if he will make a statement on reports that the 1994 funds have been exhausted.</Quest>

      <P>The number of people awaiting cardiac surgery operations at the Mater Hospital at the end of September 1994 was 1,460, which represented an increase of 162 over the figure of 1,298 at the end of September 1993.  The compilation of the waiting list at the Mater Hospital does not give a breakdown of the various categories of cardiac surgery operations.</P>
      <P>In 1993, I allocated a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital, to increase the annual throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000 &mdash; an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994, I have provided capital funds which will facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have allocated in excess of £2 million in 1994 to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.  The development, which was completed recently, includes additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency <Col N="1275" /> facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme.  These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced.</P>
    <P>The developments at the Mater Hospital, together with the developments in progress for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital, will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.</P>

The decision to allocate resources within the overall budget for the health board is the responsibility of the chief executive officer.

      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 for use in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board. Health boards endeavour to make refunds as quickly as possible and I have been informed by the North Eastern Health Board that the average waiting period under this scheme is six to eight weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme was introduced to cater specifically for <Col N="1278" /> people who have a long term medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  The scheme was designed to overcome difficulties experienced by such persons who were incurring on-going expenses on medicines and were left out of pocket while awaiting payment of their refund.</P>
    <P>Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme are not required to spend more than £32 in any month for prescribed medication.  In order to qualify for this scheme persons must be certified by a medical practitioner on an individual basis.</P>

      <Quest>the legal position which exists in this State regarding the administering of electric shock treatment (ECT) to mentally disturbed patients; if the medical profession has any guidelines in relation to the use of ECT; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this treatment is banned by law in some countries; and if he will consider introducing similar laws in the Republic of Ireland.</Quest>

      <P>The administration of electro-convulsive therapy is governed by guidelines laid down by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and must also comply with the Ethical Code of Medical Practitioners. It must be prescribed by the consultant psychiatrist in charge of the patient and must satisfy certain clinical criteria.  The Royal College may withdraw recognition of a consultant training programme if these guidelines are not met.</P>
      <P>The Inspector of Mental Hospitals, in the course of his inspections of psychiatric hospitals examines ECT procedures, equipment and premises to ensure that they are of an appropriate standard paying particular attention to rights, privacy and feelings of patients.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on Mental Health published in 1992, proposed new legal safeguards for detained mentally disordered persons in respect of consent to treatment.  These proposals were based on the UN Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Paper proposed that treatment such as electro-convulsive therapy could only be given to a patient who cannot or will not give consent if the need for the treatment is supported by an independent second medical opinion. The person providing the second medical opinion would have to be satisfied that the patient lacked the capacity to give or withhold informed consent or that having regard to the patient's own <Col N="1282" /> safety or the safety of others, the patient was unreasonably withholding such consent.  He or she would also have to be satisfied that the treatment was in the best interest of the patient's health. These proposals were welcomed by respondents to the Green Paper.  My Department is currently drafting a White Paper on mental health legislation which will set out the Government's decisions in relation to new mental health law.  I have made a commitment to publish the White Paper before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The preparation Premarin, which has been granted product authorisation under the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations 1984-1993, contains conjugated oestrogens prepared according to the United States Pharmacopoeia formulation which allows for a natural source derived from equine urine.  The product is primarily indicated for use in menopausal and postmenopausal oestrogen replacement therapy.  The extraction of the substance is not carried out in this country and it is, therefore, something over which I have no control. However, I am advised that all animal handling is done in accordance with strict animal welfare guidelines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dental Health Action Plan provides for the setting of oral health goals and the improvement of oral health promotion and preventive programmes including substantial capital investment <Col N="1284" /> in the national fluoridation programme; a significant enhancement of the public dental services through a more clearly defined role for health board dentists concentrating to a large extent on oral health care and services for children. There will be a significant increase in manpower; the extension of eligibility to children under 16 years of age; the improvement of secondary care orthodontic services through the recruitment of additional consultant orthodontists and support staff; the expansion of hospital based oral surgery services through the appointment of additional consultant oral surgeons and support staff; the introduction of new arrangements for the provision of adult dental services with the participation of private dental practitioners.  Health board dentists will be entitled to participate in these arrangements.  The provision of services for adults will be phased in on the basis of age cohorts commencing with the over 65s; a programme commencing shortly to provide full dentures to medical card holders over 65 who require them; an emergency service will be available to all medical card holders on demand and a new Dublin dental hospital and school.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in implementing the 1994 phase of the action plan as follows: legislation to enable me to extend eligibility to children under 16 is now in place.  I propose to extend eligibility to those under 14 years of age later this year; in excess of £1.5 million has been provided to health boards for the development of children's dental services; £1 million has been provided to health boards for the development of orthodontic services; funding has now been provided to the Mid-Western and the Western Health Boards to establish consultant oral surgery services in their regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following complex negotiations between my Department and the dental profession on the proposed new dental scheme for eligible adults both sides have accepted the scheme.  Under the proposed new dental scheme for eligible adults the services to be provided will <Col N="1285" /> include routine items of treatment plus an emergency service and the provision of dentures for the elderly.  In the initial phasing the over 65s have been identified as the first priority group.  Private dental practitioners under contract to the health boards will be major providers of services.</P>
    <P>At the outset emergency treatment will be available to all adults while routine treatment will be phased-in for the identifiable priority groups within the eligible populations over the period of the plan.  The scheme will be introduced from 1 November 1994.  Additional funding will be provided to health boards to enable them to introduce the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government has provided the following additional funds to health boards for the development of dental services since 1993.  These funds are additional to the moneys spent by health boards on providing dental services from my Department's annual allocation to health boards.</P>

      <Col N="1295" /> Under EC regulations, all persons, including returned emigrants and non-nationals, who are in receipt of a social security pension from another EC member state may qualify for a medical card regardless of the amount of their income.  This will apply in cases where they are not covered by an Irish Social Welfare pension &mdash; as either a recipient or a dependant &mdash; and are not in employment or self-employed.</P>
    <P>All other persons, including returned emigrants and non-nationals, who are not covered by EC regulations, are, on taking up residence in Ireland, eligible to apply for health services in Ireland on the same basis as all Irish residents i.e. on means.</P>
    <P>Such persons may qualify for a medical card if they meet the criteria set out in the first two paragraphs.  Health boards regard persons as being ordinarily resident in Ireland if satisfied of their intention to reside in Ireland for at least one year.  Such persons will be eligible for health services from the date they take up residence in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations the United Kingdom is liable for the cost of providing health care in Ireland to persons who are UK residents who avail of services while visiting this country, UK pensioners and dependants resident in Ireland, and persons who reside in Ireland who are dependants of UK workers.  The arrangement is reciprocal in that Ireland has a liability in respect <Col N="1296" /> of Irish pensioners and dependants resident in the UK, and Irish residents who avail of services while visiting the UK.</P>
      <P>These mutual liabilities are calculated using a methodology approved by the EU Commission, and result in a net liability for the UK.  The estimated receipts from the UK for 1994 under this arrangement amount to £50 million and is accounted for as an Approrpration-in-Aid in the Health Vote.  This supplements the Exchequer grant approved by the Oireachtas.  The receipts from the UK are part of the overall funding available to the health services, from which the health board allocations are made.  In determining the allocations for each board, the Department takes into account the cost of the totality of services provided, which includes the cost of providing services to persons for whom the UK authorities are liable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mobility trips such as those referred to by the Deputy are undertaken as part of the overall behaviour modification programmes pursued in the young offender centres.  Participation in such <Col N="1297" /> trips is based on a rating or merit system through which good behaviour is encouraged and rewarded.  Each case is assessed on an individual basis before permission is granted.  Such trips can include participation in a range of outdoor pursuits, attendance at sporting or entertainment events, visits to shops etc. In all such situations, arrangements regarding trips are planned in advance and the children are accompained by care staff.</P>
    <P>The concert to which the Deputy refers was attended by three boys from Oberstown Boys Centre.  The boys were accompanied by two members of the centre's care staff.  The cost of the five tickets involved was £117.50.  The boys in question contributed £35.50 towards this cost.</P>
    <P>In the case of the world cup qualifying matches, I can confirm that in respect of each of the four home games during 1993, two boys attended each game and were accompanied by two care staff on each occasion.  The total cost of attendance at these events was £192.</P>
    <P>The residential nature of young offender centres requires expenditure across a broad range of headings.  Total expenditure on non-pay operating costs in 1993 was £1,579,209.  This would embrace normal utility costs as well as the costs involved in providing clothing, footwear, toiletries, meals, bedding etc. It would also include a sum of £158,000 approximately in respect of expenditure on recreational equipment and activities, including mobility trips.  A small weekly allowance is paid to each child for the purchase of items for personal consumption.  However, cigarette smoking is not encouraged and is only permitted in designated locations within the centres.  Smoking only takes place under close supervision and children are strictly prohibited from having possession of lighters or matches.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 456 and 457 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for five custodial facilities.  Three of these facilities are certified reformatory schools which receive referrals from the courts either on short term remand or on long-stay placement.  The remaining two facilities are industrial schools which cater for referrals from the courts and also voluntary referrals from the health boards.  The five facilities in question normally have an overall capacity to accommodate a total of 210 boys and 16 girls.  However, in the case of boys, this capacity has been temporarily reduced by ten places because of a recent fire in Trinity House Reformatory School which reduced the capacity of that school from 30 places to 20 places.  Urgent action is being taken to bring these places back into service.</P>
      <P>The actual number of children accommodated in these centres varies from day to day, depending on court decisions, release dates etc.  On 6 October 1994, a total of 162 boys and 13 girls were accommodated.  It should be noted that not all children accommodated in these centres have been convicted of breaches of the law.  Voluntary placements in industrial schools are arranged through the health boards and children may be on remand pending a hearing of their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where committal on foot of an actual offence is involved, the nature of the offence would be such that, if committed by an adult, it would have resulted in the imposition of a term of imprisonment.  Such offences would span a wide <Col N="1299" /> range of activity including larceny, damage to property, assault etc.  In many instances a variety of offences may have been committed by one individual.  In addition, committal to an industrial school can arise from breaches of the School Attendance Acts.</P>
    <P>Based on the level of accommodation provided in the centres, the cost to the State per place is as follows:</P>

      <P>A major programme of substance abuse education for post-primary schools has been developed jointly by the Departments of Education and Health in conjunction with the Mater Dei Counselling Centre, Clonliffe Road, Dublin 3, with support from the Commission of the EU.  This programme will be disseminated, as a resource, on a phased basis, to post-primary schools generally after 18 October next.  The programme will be available to all post-primary schools having a teacher(s) who has (have) training in participatory methods appropriate to social, personal and health education. Training programmes have been held during the last school year at 15 locations throughout the country in preparation for this dissemination and will be continued during the current school year.  The programme has been evaluated externally with positive outcomes.</P>
      <P>In addition to this major initiative, general programmes in social, personal and health education have been developed and are being implemented in both primary and post-primary schools with support from certain of the regional health boards.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 471 and 472 together.</P>
      <P>The official in question was attached to my Department's special education section for a short period in 1987-88 and was involved in supervising the operation of the young offender centres. During this period, concerns arose regarding a series of apparent shortcomings in the operation of the Finglas centre.  As a result, an audit was carried out and a series of internal control weaknesses were identified at the centre.  It is regrettably the case that the necessary follow up action was not pursued at that time.  This was due to staff shortages in the section concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991 my Department undertook a comprehensive internal audit evaluation of its control procedures in relation to the special schools.  As a result of this exercise a comprehensive audit programme for the special schools was initiated.  As part of this programme, a detailed audit of the Finglas centre was carried out in February, 1992 and measures were put in place to correct deficiencies and improve financial and management controls.  To date, detailed audits have been conducted in four of the five special schools and an audit of <Col N="1307" /> the remaining school, Oberstown Girls Centre, is currently taking place.  In each case, deficiencies identified have been corrected and improved control procedures have been put in place.  The schools compliance with the revised procedures is being monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that corrective measures ar being fully adhered to.</P>
    <P>As a further measure aimed at ensuring the adequacy of procedures within the special schools, my Department has engaged independent consultants to conduct an evaluation of the financial and management control systems now in place.</P>

Factors taken into account included the number of first year pupils within a school (i) whose parents are in receipt of either unemployment assistance or benefit; (ii) living in rented local authority housing or non-permanent accommodation; (iii) from a rural deprived background; (iv) whose parents hold a medical card; (v) living with lone parents; (vi) with significant literacy and numeracy difficulties and (vii) who drop out of school without any formal educational qualifications.</P>
      <P>Schools were ranked in order of merit and the posts were allocated accordingly.  The ranking of this school was not sufficiently high to qualify for the allocation of a post on this occasion.</P>
      <P>All of the available posts have been allocated for the 1994-95 school year.  In the event of further disadvantaged posts becoming available for allocation in the future, the position of this school will be considered.</P>

      <P>The role of my Department in remedial teacher allocations is concerned with the selection of schools for receipt of such posts on the basis of priority of need.  Arrangements relating to the appointment of individual teachers to fill such posts are a matter for the authorities of the schools concerned and it would not be appropriate for me to name the individuals in question.</P>
      <P>Details of the schools in question are set out in the following list.</P>

      <P>My attention has not been drawn to any particular concerns or desires of parents to have an alternative provided to physical education classes.  It may be helpful if I set out for the Deputy's information the position in relation to physical education at primary and post-primary level.  Physical and health education is an integral part of the national primary school curriculum and is therefore compulsory in all primary schools.</P>
      <P>The present physical and health education syllabus, as set down in the 1971 primary school curriculum, is a flexible programme which allows teachers the freedom to use their professional judgment to choose appropriate activities suitable to the particular needs and abilities of their pupils, taking into account the facilities which are available locally.  The entire primary school curriculum is under review at present, through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, and I will be deciding on an appropriate curriculum for primary schools following on the NCCA's advice on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> At post-primary level physical education is not a compulsory subject. However, the &ldquo;Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools&rdquo; state that physical education should form part of the curriculum and the programme should be based on the approved syllabus. Generally, where physical education is available on the curriculum, the school requires that every student participates in the physical education programme, unless there are special circumstances which do not allow for this.  In such an instance, the matter may be considered in the context of the school policy.</P>
    <P>The subject physical education is under review at present by a course committee under the aegis of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  This review will consider the status of physical education at second level.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in the detail requested.  The total number of students in receipt of higher education grants for the years 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94 was 15,211, 18,664 and 21,696 respectively. All these students received full or part fees at least.  Under the higher education grants scheme for the 1992-93 academic year, the most recent year for which the breakdown of figures is available, a total of 16,924 students were in <Col N="1319" /> receipt of full fees plus full or part maintenance while 1,740 were in receipt of full or part fees.</P>

      <P>Any reliable estimate of the costs and numbers sought by the Deputy requires very detailed information and data not all of which are readily available in my Department.  In the absence of the complete data it is very tentatively estimated that the extra costs at the end of a degree cycle of increasing the reckonable income limits by £1,000, £2,000, £3,000 and £4,000 would be approximately £6 million, £12 million, £17 million and £23 million.

      <P>I have no plans to base eligibility for third level grants on net income.  Net income is the result of personal financial decisions.  Two taxpayers with the same gross income can, therefore, have markedly different net income if, for instance, one decided to rent a house and the other decides to take on a mortgage to buy a house.  To avoid discrimination on the basis of what are personal financial decisions gross income will continue to be the basis on which the assessment of eligibility for third level grants will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has received a number of representations from students' unions and individuals concerning the level of maintenance paid to independent mature students living away from home.  There are four common rates of maintenance grant payable to all categories of higher education grant holders, whether dependent mature, independent mature or otherwise viz. (i) full maintenance at the non-adjacent rate, (ii) full maintenance at the adjacent rate, (iii) part maintenance at the non adjacent rate, (iv) part maintenance at the adjacent rate.</P>
      <P>There is no distinction between the rates of maintenance grants payable to mature students and other students who are holders of higher education grants. Whether a grant holder is eligible for full maintenance or part maintenance is determined by the means assessment operated in accordance with the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme the adjacent rate of maintenance is payable in the case of every grant-holder whose normal family residence is less than 15 miles from the college attended.  It is also payable in the case of any grant-holder whose normal family residence is 15 miles or more from the college attended who could reasonably be expected, in the light of distance and the convenience of local public transport services, to travel daily.  The non adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable <Col N="1321" /> in all other cases.  I have no plans at present to review the criteria relating to the adjacent and non adjacent rate of maintenance grant.</P>

      <Quest>if she has received a request to amend Section 2.1 C of the LINGUA action Ireland scheme to reduce the duration of the exchange in view of the difficulties which the 14 days minimum is posing for teachers and schools in disadvantaged areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The LINGUA programme was adopted by a decision of the Council of Ministers of the European Community in July, 1989.  The main aim of the scheme is to promote a qualitative and quantitative improvement in the learning of LINGUA languages throughout the European Union.</P>
      <P>Under the relevant action to which the Deputy refers, the Council decision specifies a minimum of 14 days duration for the exchange, to include travel time. It is considered that this is the minimum time necessary for a meaningful cultural and education experience in the partner country.  A shorter period would lead to a superficial contact with the local culture and language and prevent any meaningful process-orientated work on the type of joint educational project envisaged under LINGUA.  It is not open to member states to unilaterally alter the duration of the exchanges.</P>
      <P>On the question of disadvantaged areas, financial support to exchanges under the relevant LINGUA action is normally no more than 50 per cent of the overall cost.  However, in cases where economic, social or regional disadvantages is substantiated by the principal of the school, up to 75 per cent may be made available.</P>

      <P>I hope to allocate additional resource teachers to primary schools in the near future and, as already indicated to the school in question, their needs will be considered in the context of this development.  In relation to caretaking and clerical services the position is that St. Fergal's senior national school shares a caretaker and clerk typist with St. Fergal's junior national school.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provided for the introduction of a phased programme to expand the provision of caretaking and clerical services to all national schools with 100 pupils upwards.  My current priority is to direct the expanded provision in the first instance to schools which have no provision.  The position of schools such as St. Fergals, which already have a sharing arrangement, will be examined in the context of whatever improvements are put in place in the later stages of the phased programme agreed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that St. Fergal's senior national school has applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme. Schools are selected for inclusion in this scheme on the basis of priority of need <Col N="1328" /> as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators.  Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned.  Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>In the current year, a total of 54 primary schools were added to the disadvantaged areas scheme with effect from September, 1994.  I regret that St. Fergal's senior national school did not rate high enough on the priority list among primary schools seeking disadvantaged status to warrant its inclusion in the scheme on this occasion.</P>

These appointments were made following the collection of data from the schools by my Department's primary inspectorate.  I will be keeping the question of further need in this area under review and the needs of all schools, including Coolfancy national school, will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>An additional 54 schools have been included in the disadvantaged areas scheme with effect from September 1994.

      <P>I have been made aware of some cases such as the Deputy refers to, and I have arranged for my Department to assist in their resolution.  My Department has issued guidelines to both primary and post primary schools encouraging a positive policy on behaviour and discipline within schools.  These guidelines request each school authority to draw up a code of behaviour for its school.</P>
      <P>The position in the case of primary schools is that no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron, and only where alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.  I regard this provision as a very effective safeguard.</P>
      <P>While there is no similar requirement in the case of post primary schools the guidelines emphasise that expulsion should be resorted to only in the most extreme cases of indiscipline, only after every effort at rehabilitation has failed and where all other possible sanctions have been exhausted.</P>
      <P>Parents who feel aggrieved with a decision of school management to expel a pupil may bring the matter to the attention of my Department.  My Department can arrange for appropriate investigation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 507 and 508 together.</P>
      <P>Under the special school transport scheme operated by Bus Éireann as agents of my Department, approximately 8,500 children with disabilities are carried daily to special schools and classes throughout the country.  This operation involves a national network of 500 routes.</P>
      <P>To date, the level of escort cover on these services has been limited and I am very much aware of the concerns of bodies such as those mentioned by the Deputy in this regard.  Where such cover is in place, it operates on the basis of travel passes issued to voluntary escorts by my Department, or as part of the role of special needs assistants attached to particular schools, or as a result of voluntary initiatives taken at local level. Precise data on the number of escorts currently involved under these various arrangements is not readily available.</P>
      <P>While not all children with disabilities will require an escort service, I am very conscious of the need for improvement in this area.  It is for this reason that I have allocated a sum of £100,000 in the current year to facilitate the introduction of an escort scheme for certain children with special needs.  The objective will be to facilitate the provision of escorts on the basis of priority of need. My Department is currently finalising details of the scheme and will shortly be in touch with the relevant school authorities, including those in the Cork area, with a view to making the necessary arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> I consider that the initiative which I am now taking will make a major contribution towards allaying the concerns to which the Deputy refers.  I will be keeping the operation of this new scheme under close review to ensure that needs in this area are adequately catered for.</P>

      <P>There are three post primary schools in Portlaoise town, i.e., (i) CBS secondary school, boys; (ii) Presentation secondary school, girls; (iii) vocational school, Co-Ed.</P>
      <P>My Department considers that the most appropriate arrangement for the future provision of second level education in Portlaoise would be the development of a single school in the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At meetings held locally in 1991 the managements of the three post primary schools in question agreed also that a single school development would best meet the future post primary needs of the area.  They further agreed that the <Col N="1338" /> single school would be a community college under the aegis of County Laois Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>Opposition to a single school development as proposed was expressed by some of the parents and teachers in the secondary schools on the basis that a single school was too large a unit and that a community college management was not acceptable.  In the light of the opposition it was not possible to progress the matter further at the time.  My Department is presently reviewing the position in Portlaoise with regard to the future development of post primary education facilities.</P>
