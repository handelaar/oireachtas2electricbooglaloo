      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that the Dáil should sit tomorrow to discuss the ESRI report which has condemned the Government's national development plan as inadequate and seriously flawed.  This is confirming what the European Commission and this party have said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have ciúnas. It is important to point out to the House that the negotiations on our National Development Plan are drawing to a successful conclusion despite what some people opposite may think.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If we continue on this route, and there is no reason to believe otherwise, we will be the second country to conclude negotiations on our National Development Plan.  Agreement has been reached on practically all aspects at this stage.  If Deputy Bruton cares to read that report in full he will see that for the first time this agency is projecting a serious drop in unemployment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should allow the Chair to proceed.  In respect of the proposal that the House on its rising tonight shall adjourn until Tuesday, 12 April, the amendment proposed by Deputy John Bruton is, I regret to say, a direct negative.  It will have the same effect by his opposing the proposal. I shall put the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach clarify the position in relation to the Finance Bill?  Proposals were circulated indicating that the Bill would be published on 6 April but now it is to be published on 11 April.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether there will be two Finance Bills this year? It is rumoured that the tensions and differences are so great that they cannot be resolved by 11 April.  It was proposed that Second Stage would be debated on 12 April, the day after publication.  Will the Second Stage debate be deferred for a further week so that we can have some time to consider these proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wishful thinking by Deputy Yates if he is talking about two Finance Bills.  I know he would like if that were the case but I am sorry for his troubles.  We indicated some time ago that the Bill would be published around 6 April.  I indicated it would be published during the Easter recess and it will be published during the recess, on Monday, 11 April.</P>

      <P>When the Dáil resumes on 12 April, it will be four months since the peace declaration was signed.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1782" /> during that four months the Republican movement has not accepted the declaration.  All the questions on the North from Opposition parties were ruled out this week and I should like to know if the Taoiseach will agree to a debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney, I am very sorry.  The Chair is reluctant to rule out of order questions raised by the spokespersons and leaders of the various parties in Opposition but they ought to be relevant.  The matter referred to by the Deputy is not relevant to the Order of Business.  She will have to raise it in another fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

      <P>In regard to promised legislation, I wish to ask the Taoiseach if the promise by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Joan Burton, in Killarney last night to abolish the tax on unemployment benefit is a Government promise?

      <P>I am delighted that the long overdue museum in Cork will be opened in the near future.  I agree with Deputy Nealon's comments that there is great scope for opening further museums around the country.  If we do not take every possible step to preserve our heritage it will have serious repercussions for future generations.  The Bill must be flexible.  It makes no provision for those who are interested in exploring sites with a metal detector.  It is disgraceful that those who like to go out with a metal detector will not now have the opportunity to unearth archaeological objects throughout the country.  Will the Minister amend the Bill to allow these people to pursue their hobby unhindered?  People exploring with a metal detector should be given a concession to work on ploughed land, beaches and building sites, but adequate sanctions must be applied when they step out of line.</P>
      <P>No finds of any consequence would be registered were it not for the fact that people pursuing their hobby found them.  The Minister must concede that they should be allowed to continue.  A great deal of hidden treasure is under water. Divers who are interested in discovering this treasure must not be hindered in pursuing their hobby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the long overdue museum in Cork will be of immense benefit. We need to establish local museums throughout the country.  Other countries place great emphasis on their archaeological and historical artefacts and it is only fitting that Ireland, a country rich in heritage, should preserve and develop that heritage.  The Bill affords the Minister an opportunity once and for all to ensure that his Department is fully behind the preservation and development of our heritage.  The Department must co-operate with the Office of Public Works in preserving our heritage.  The Office of Public Works is hindered by a lack of finance and is muzzled by its lack of authority to implement what is envisaged in the Bill.  It is detrimental to the nation when two State bodies are pulling against each other and it will have a <Col N="1795" /> serious impact on the implementation of the Bill's provisions.  There should be the fullest possible co-operation with the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a golden opportunity to remove all the obstacles that have hindered the Office of Public Works from fulfilling its role.  The Office of Public Works needs power to carry out its role in unearthing objects of historic importance. Let me emphasise in no uncertain fashion that if the Department fails to co-operate with the Office of Public Works the Bill will be worthless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I will ensure that our national monuments and heritage will be preserved.  Increasingly, heritage is becoming a major tourism attraction and it is especially important in inland areas which have no other attractions.  A recent survey shows that 40 per cent of visitors to Ireland are interested in heritage.  That certainly gives those responsible for the promotion of tourism food for thought.</P>
      <P>In our rush to enter the modern world after the war a great deal of damage was done to our holy wells, ring forts and historic buildings.  Old values were discarded and when land was being reclaimed some ring forts were destroyed. Domestic rates were so high that some buildings were demolished.  One example that comes to mind is Rossmore Castle in Monaghan.  It is as important to preserve what we have as it is to unearth buried treasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Monaghan County Council was the first local authority to establish a county museum and this was due principally to the foresight and vision of the then county manager.  Many other local authorities have since followed this example. Funding for the development of this museum came from the Structural Funds and the international funds for Ireland, with the county council funding its maintenance. In 1980 our museum won the Council of Europe prize for the best small museum in Europe.  I was a member of the delegation to the Council of Europe at that time.  An extension has been built <Col N="1796" /> to accommodate displays or artistic works and it is used widely for book launches and poetry readings.  This is a great local attraction.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure the return of local artefacts from the National Museum. They should be returned to the local county museums or to the very fine museums that have been set up by local groups.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the International Fund for Ireland for funding two projects at Inniskeen in the south of the county and Clones in the north west.  Clones, which has gone through a tough period economically because of its proximity to the Border, was formerly an ecclesiastic centre and has much to offer.  It can boast that it has a 75-foot round tower which is in a good state of repair; a High Cross, which was moved from the churchyard to The Diamond and dates from the 10th century; a monastery which dates from the 6th century, St. Tighernach's Shrine which is in the shape of a house carved in stone, and an abbey which dates from the 12th century.  There is an active development committee in the town which has major plans not alone to preserve buildings of historical interest but to restore a portion of the Ulster Canal.</P>
    <P>Inniskeen can also boast that it has a round tower which marks the site of a monastery dating back to the 6th century. It has an active Patrick Kavanagh Committee which is in the process of reconstructing an old church as a museum and literary centre to honour one of Ireland's greatest poets.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to empower the Commissioners of Public Works to establish a record of national monuments and of sites where they believe national monuments may be located so that every known national monument in the country will be given the cloak of a basic protection and in such a way as also fully respects the rights of landowners.</P>
    <P>It is important that we protect the rights of landowners.  The booklet <i>Guide to National Monuments</i> lists the monuments <Col N="1797" /> of note in each county.  Under the heading &ldquo;Access&rdquo; reference is made to the fact that in order to gain access to some monuments one has to cross a fence or pass through a stile, that it is not sometimes possible to obtain the keys and that monuments are not properly signposted. Much remains to be done in this regard. The only people who are in a position to do anything are local development committees. Under the terms of this Bill such committees will be allowed greater access to national monuments.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that people have an inherent right to be allowed visit without unnecessary hindrance the most significant physical manifestations of our national heritage.  Rights of way have been the source of serious disputes.  It has been stated that some solicitors derive their main source of income from such disputes. We should ensure that an amicable arrangement is reached with landowners to guarantee free access to monuments of historical interest.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with holy wells. I had occasion to contact the Office of Public Works to ask it to ensure that the public would have access to a particular holy well.  The dispute eventually led to litigation.  Many holy wells are of local historical importance; many people believe that the water in these holy wells is a cure.</P>
    <P>One monument which is rarely mentioned is the Blace Pig's Dyke, an earthen structure &mdash; it has almost vanished &mdash; in a series of banks and ditches which runs from County Louth, through the counties of Monaghan, Cavan and Leitrim to Donegal.  A portion of this earthen monument is to be found in the townland of Aghreagh West, Scotshouse, near Clones.  In 1982, when it was excavated by Monaghan County Museum evidence of a wooden palisade was discovered as well as some charcoal remains.  It was claimed at the time that there was data which suggested that the structure was built 500 years before the birth of Christ, in the Celtic Iron Age.  There is also a view that it marked an ancient Ulster boundary or some other territorial perimeter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> In his book <i>Death of a Town</i> John Healy mentioned that in America an object 100 years old was considerd to be an antique.  He compared these with house doors in Charlestown which are 105 years old and argued that we had not tapped the potential of the store of national heritage.  This is a very valuable asset.  The Office of Public Works has indicated that it is its intention to put the necessary structures in place to ensure the public can gain access to national monuments and at the same time protect the rights of landowners.  I welcome enshrining in legislation the protection to which those monuments and archaeological artefacts are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Having made my maiden speech on the 1987 Bill and having contributed on that same Bill in the Seanad, I am familiar with the recent legislation relating to the preservation of our monuments.  The central provision of this Bill is to make a clear statement regarding the right of ownership of archaeological objects found.  These will be deemed to be the property of the State where there is no known owner and such finds will have to be reported to the Director of the National Museum.  The possession, sale and acquisition of archaeological objects will be prohibited after the enactment of this Bill unless the State has waived its rights to ownership.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the debate on the 1987 Bill I looked at other legislation.  I notice similarities between this and the Swedish legislation where all monuments are State owned.  The Swedish were ahead of the rest of the world in providing legislation to protect their monuments as far back as 1666 when Charles XI introduced comprehensive legislation which gave Sweden a head start on heritage preservation.  The Bill moves us closer to that ideal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to empower the Commissioners of Public Works to establish a record of national monuments and sites where they believe national monuments may be located so that every known national monument in the country <Col N="1799" /> will be afforded basic protection.  That is welcome because, despite having more monuments and artfacts than most other countries in western Europe, our record of preservation and conservation has been dismal, and we have been guilty of wide ranging destruction and general carelessness.  It was no surprise when it came to light that we were losing artefacts to treasure hunters &mdash; and some of our monuments &mdash; as the Acts of 1930 and 1954 were never fully enforced because of lack of personnel.</P>
    <P>Indeed there is concern that there is no provision in this Bill for extra personnel to enforce its provisions, and unless they are provided and there is a general awareness by the public about this legislation it will be useless.  I am a member of the Kerry Monuments Advisory Committee which receives continuous reports about interference with and even removal of standing stones, ring forts and other field monuments.  This has been going on since the 1987 Act came into effect, and nothing is being done about it.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of our legislation must be questioned.  This Bill is a start in relation to objects found.  However, it contains several loopholes and I fear for its effectiveness.  Despite being fortunate to have one of the densest concentrations of surviving archaeological field monuments of any country in western Europe, in recent years thousands have been lost, particularly since we joined the EU, and most of this destruction was carried out with the help of EU and Government-sponsored grant schemes.  It sickens me to see the EU now introducing a scheme to preserve old buildings and archaeological remains on farms when they were the major contributors to the destruction of so many monuments.  The same applies to Government schemes for land reclamation.  In fairness to farmers, they were not aware of what they had on their land and they were given <i>carte blanche</i> to remove, in the name of progress, whatever earthworks were in their way.  It has taken until now for the EU to realise the folly of their money being <Col N="1800" /> used to destroy the heritage of its member states.</P>
    <P>Until recently only a small number of all known monuments were specifically protected under the National Monuments Acts of 1930 and 1954.  In most cases the Commissioners of Public Works had neither the manpower nor the financial resources to administer these Acts vigorously and effectively.  The same could be said of the 1987 Act.  I have given examples of that in relation to Kerry. Denmark, a country half the size of Ireland with about 25,000 prehistoric monuments in State care, shows what can be done by effective legislation.  Here, the limited number of professional archaeologists employed by the State to protect its archaeological heritage means that the destruction of archaeological earthworks, which can be removed in half a day, can be carried out with almost certain immunity.  This is happening on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>In a recent Ph.D thesis Barrett found that in the Dingle area of Kerry 44 per cent of all known ring forts had been removed since 1841.  As there are still about 2,000 field monuments left in the Dingle peninsula it means that nearly 2,000 field monuments have been removed.  Also, the Department of Archaeology in UCC found that 66 per cent of the ring forts mapped in the 1840s in the Cork Harbour area have been destroyed.  This has probably increased to at least 75 per cent in the five or six years since that study was carried out.  A survey by Cahill of the 455 ring forts in the middle third of County Tipperary revealed a destruction rate of 31.5 per cent.  I was alarmed to see the destruction rate of mediaeval moated sites, rectangular earthworks, mainly of the 13th and 14th centuries.  In the early 1970s, calculating for the four counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary and Wexford, Barry found that in total 52 per cent of all well known moated sites had either been completely removed or greatly modified since the 1840s.  Although most farmers are aware of the existence of ring forts on their land, if only as fairy forts, this is not necessarily so in the case of <Col N="1801" /> other earthworks.  Out of a total of 750, approximately 20 moated sites are protected by current legislation.  Three of those were levelled in the past ten years but, needless to say, there were no prosecutions.  That puts into perspective the problem.</P>
    <P>In regard to portable monuments, last August the Cromdubh Monument in Clahene, Castlegregory, was stolen.  That monument, the head of a pagan God, is unique but there was not a national outcry about its disappearance.  Efforts to highlight the robbery were not heeded and the monument has not been found. Stone crosses and other valuable standing stones should be taken into local churches or museums and replicas erected in their place.  Over time many of those stone crosses and standing stones will become weathered because they are made from limestone and people would understand that in order to preserve the real object it must be taken into care. Will the Minister address that matter in his reply?</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to marine archaeology. In my contribution on the 1987 Bill I expressed concern about the destruction of the Blasket site off the Dingle coast and requested tighter controls on underwater diving in search of treasure.  I referred extensively to our underwater heritage.  I received a communication from concerned divers in regard to this legislation and I would like the Minister to address those concerns.  Those divers are concerned in particular about section 7 (1) (b) which empowers the Garda to seize and detain without warrant, time limit or subsequent charge any diving equipment which they believe is about to be used in water protected by an underwater heritage order, a power unrelated to any offence in the Principal Act. According to those divers that provision is unusual and anti-diver.  They believe it is wrong to seize equipment prior to an activity in the belief that an illegal act may take place.</P>
    <P>The number of piers and harbours here is limited, but sports divers must depart from a pier several miles from a diving site.  If their departure point is close to an <Col N="1802" /> underwater heritage area &mdash; even though they do not intend diving in that area &mdash; their equipment can be seized.  The 1588 <i>Armada</i> wreck, the <i>San Marcos,</i> lies off Quilty Pier in County Clare as does Mutton Island and associated reefs of scenic interest.  As divers depart from such areas, could their equipment be seized under the provision of this legislation? Sports divers have assisted the Office of Public Works and the National Museum in underwater archaeological work at potential heritage sites.  Such activity will now be illegal even though no sports diver has ever been charged with an infringement of the National Monuments Act, 1930.  The proposed wide and arbitrary powers, based on an individual's objective belief, are draconian in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Divers believe that power to be discriminatory and unwarranted.  Will the Minister examine the restrictions on diving here?  In Kerry local diving clubs are preparing for a special dive to examine the <i>Santa Marie Del Roso</i>.  As we do not have the resources to pay people to carry out this work we should allow volunteers to carry it out in a professional manner under supervision.</P>
    <P>The <i>Santa Marie Del Roso</i> was discovered in 110 feet of water near the Blaskets in 1968 by a team of divers led by Sydney Wignell.  Many items were salvaged from the wreck, some of which were of immense value.  Mr. Wignell promised that a maritime museum would be established in Dingle to display the artefacts, but that did not happen.  The Minister stated recently that he intends establishing a maritime museum in Galway to display all the artefacts and remains of the <i>Spanish Armada</i> which foundered off the west coast.  Will the Minister reconsider that proposal and instead display artefacts discovered off the Dingle coast in the fine heritage centre which will be officially opened in Dunquin next Wednesday?  Similarly, artefacts from ships which sank off the Clare and Sligo coasts should be displayed in museums in those areas.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (2) refers to the appointment of designated persons and places, but it <Col N="1803" /> is regrettable that county museums are not specifically mentioned.  Operating as part of the National Museum network they would offer a real chance of making this Bill effective, as the only hope of implementing many of its provisions is at local rather than national level.  Designating county museums would also alleviate some of the pressures on the staff and facilities of the National Museum as well as giving it a wider branch network.  This was a missed opportunity.  To be effective this legislation must have a major local input.  Local community watch groups should be set up to ensure that monuments are not damaged and that when objects are discovered they are reported immediately to the authorities.  That can only be done at local level.  By the time the Director of the National Museum receives the information those valuable objects could be thousands of miles away.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (2) refers to inspection and excavation by the Director of the National Museum.  The right of the Director to nominate a person to enter any and all lands and undertake everything necessary to preserve or excavate a site in danger of destruction or decay is an important facet of this legislation. However, where a qualified archaeologist is on the staff of a local authority, those functions should be passed on to that official.  That would enable the provisions of the Bill to be implemented locally in an effective manner.  An archaeologist is employed in the county museum in Tralee, County Kerry.  The Bill would be more effective if that archaeologist were given similar powers to those of the Director of the National Museum.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 9 deal with power to take possession of an archaeological object.  It would be more practical if that power was also conferred on local archaeologists and county museum curators who act in co-operation with and on behalf of the National Museum and the State as information on objects is often more accessible locally. Objects deemed by the director not to be of a significant archaeological or historical <Col N="1804" /> interest nationally should be retained locally by the State as they may be of great interest to county museums. Local museums should have an input in deciding on the location of objects found.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the acquisition of national monuments, etc., by the Commissioners.  The Schedule dealing with the compulsory acquisition of land fails to address the legal complexities of rights of way and, more importantly, public liability insurance cover, which has resulted in many landowners refusing access to visitors to cross their land to national monument sites.  Those issues should be addressed.  I introduced a Private Members' Bill last year that would have resolved those problems but, unfortunately, it was rejected by the Government despite its support by several members of the Fianna Fáil Party. That legislation was clear-cut and it would have resolved landowners' difficulties regarding access to their property. Large areas of land on which national monuments are sited will be closed to tourists and there is a great deal of concern in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (3) deals with work carried out by the landowner on land at or relating to a recorded monument and requires written notice of such work two months in advance.  Lack of information available to the landowner regarding monuments on his or her property and legal obligations in respect of such sites pose problems and could be resolved by local campaigns assisted by the land agencies. Farm organisations could disseminate such information.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill must be implemented.  We have a bad record on the conservation and preservation of many field monuments.  Buildings are not covered under the Bill, but hopefully such legislation will be introduced shortly.  Despite the lipservice paid to this Bill and other measures we are destroying our heritage and we must act in a serious and effective way if we are to preserve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister and Minister <Col N="1805" /> for State on introducing it.  I welcome the retention of archaeological objects by the State.  The Bill establishes the State's right to those objects in cases where the owner is not known.  The establishment of autonomous boards for the National Museum and National Library is also welcome. The National Museum has the added responsibility of implementing the legislation and I hope it is allocated necessary funding to carry out that work. The preservation of our heritage has been neglected during the years and other priorities took precedence but now that we have a Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht I hope that area will no longer be a Cinderella.  There are many national monuments in Gaeltacht areas that should be preserved and the Minister is committed in that regard.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, for his work in this area, particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s. Funding was provided for remedial works on buildings in a bad state of repair. Remedial works were carried out to the National Gallery, the National Museum, the Seanad Chamber and other buildings. National lottery funding was provided for these remedial works and I hope such funding will continue.  As well as developing new areas through the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, buildings in a bad state of repair must be preserved.  I pay tribute to the director of the National Museum, Dr. Pat Wallace, and the director of the National Library, Dr. Pat Donlon, for their assistance in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts some years ago the committee visited the National Museum, the National Library and the Genealogical Office.  I pay tribute to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the then Chairman, Deputy Gay Mitchell, for their initiative in examining those buildings to ascertain the remedial work involved.  We had a high profile Committee of Public Accounts under the chairmanship of Deputy Gay Mitchell, as we do now under the chairmanship of Deputy Jim Mitchell.  The Committee of Public Accounts addressed problems of <Col N="1806" /> storage and maintenance of artefacts and I hope national lottery funding will help resolve those problems.  The work in progress in the National Museum, the National Library and the Genealogical Office is excellent.</P>
    <P>There is also a regional aspect to national monuments and our heritage.  I was impressed by the development at Ferrycarrig in County Wexford.  The design and building of the interpretative centre at Aughrim near Ballinasloe was not the subject of controversy.  The first sod was turned by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, in February 1991 and President Robinson will officially open the building next July.  That interpretative centre was funded by EU money and local funds.  Galway County Council provided the site.  Now that the interpretative centre has been built I hope the work on facilities around the centre will be completed, such as the car park.  There is no area for the parking of cars or buses around the battlefield site.  It is a tribute to the late Martin Joyce that the interpretative centre has been built and artefacts he collected will be displayed there.  The centre will provide a representation of the Battle of Aughrim, one of the turning points in Irish history.  It is important to have viewing stands around the battlefield site and access to those sites.  I hope those matters can be resolved.  Difficulties have arisen regarding access to property and I hope the Government will be able to resolve some of those issues, particularly those raised by Deputy Deenihan.</P>
    <P>In the area of Aughrim a 13th century church on the Kilconnell Road should be signposted.  The work carried out in Aughrim is a recognition of the work of the late Martin Joyce and the struggle of the local people to have Aughrim recognised as the site of an event which changed the course of Irish history.  I hope this will be recognised by way of funding from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>This area is also a tourism promotion area and cultural tourism is growing.  For example students come from Europe each year to see the heritage of east Galway.  In Aughrim people from the <Col N="1807" /> Catholic and Protestant traditions live side by side, without bitterness or conflict and the Battle of Aughrim was a fundamental and important link in the process which led to the Downing Street Joint Declaration.  In the area, apart from the abbey in Kilconnell, there is the Clontuskert Abbey and the Church of Saint Brendan of Clonfert so there are many important cultural links here.</P>
    <P>I hope that the work done by the Bishops in the west in their publication &ldquo;A Crusade for Survival&rdquo; will be taken on board.  They referred to the importance of tourism to the development of the economy in the west.</P>
    <P>I support the points made by other speakers on behalf of the Irish Underwater Council which is concerned about the powers being given to the Garda under section 7 to seize diving equipment. As there is only one Garda sub-aqua unit diving and sub-aqua clubs work voluntarily with the Garda, the National Museum and the Department in helping to find people and to recover items of archaeological value.  I hope that the powers under section 7 will be reconsidered so that divers will not be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>I received representations on this matter from the Metal Detecting Society of Ireland who made a submission to the Select Committee on Social Affairs who will be dealing with this Bill at a later stage.  It pointed out that there could be a presumption of guilt with regard to a person using a metal detector, even where the person is involved in a harmless exercise such as coin searching.  The Metal Detecting Society of Ireland assist the National Museum and archaeologists in finding artefacts and coins.  When the Office of Public Works was developing the River Suck into the town of Ballinasloe the society assisted in finding many artefacts relating to the Battle of Aughrim on that stretch of river.  It was also involved in the discovery of a Cromwellian fort in County Galway. These people have done much important work in the non-archaeological area and should not be accused of wrong doing <Col N="1808" /> when they are engaged in their work. Many ancient villages have been discovered by the society and the Office of Public Works acted very quickly to put preservation orders on these deserted villages.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that in putting name plates on monuments the Irish version of the name is not always included.  I recently noticed that the Irish version of name places is being shortened on signposts in our towns and villages.  For example, the village of Castleblakeney where I live would normally be translated to Gallach Uí Cheallaigh.  It is named after the O'Kelly family, the Chieftains of Hymany who were known as Fáilte Uí Cheallaigh, the Kelly's of a thousand welcomes.  It is disappointing that this name has been shortened from Gallach Uí Cheallaigh to Gallach.  Similarly the Irish version of Gort, County Galway, is shortened from Gort Inse Guaire to Gort.</P>
    <P>The Department and local authorities should ensure that Irish place names are not shortened as it does away with much of the history and folklore surrounding the names of our towns and villages.  In many instances, the meaning of the name of a town or village can be found from the Irish version of the name which gives the history behind the place.  We cannot allow Irish place names to be shortened for economic reasons.  That would be deplorable and I hope the Department will consider that matter under the legislation.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much, a Chathaoirligh.  The aspirations in this Bill are indeed laudable.  However, substantial additional duties are being given to the Office of Public Works without additional funds being provided.  It is <Col N="1809" /> regrettable that the Bill does not show a financial commitment in this area.  Particularly in the United Kingdom advantage has been taken of archaeological interest in the western world, and tourist trails and monuments have been developed around the country.  This helps to attract extensive overseas interest.  It is important that the Minister makes available substantial funds to promote our national monuments.</P>
      <P>In my constituency Shannon Development has helped to create greater awareness of the importance of archaeological sites and monuments in the country, particularly in the Burren.  There is a perception that this Bill is the second round in the interpretative centre battle between the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  Deputy Higgins, who is a native of my constituency, seems to be losing the battle.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on the Government to firmly establish its position on interpretative centres and their future and to introduce legislation which will be of assistance in developing the areas in which these centres are located.  If the Government wants to retain some power in this area it should provide for that power in legislation.  The stand-off position now adopted on interpretative centres and the decision of the Supreme Court in this matter have been of little help in encouraging private investment in centres in County Clare, a concept mooted at the time the Mullaghmore centre was proposed.  Regardless of whether the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, or the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, wins the argument, there is an onus on the Government to resolve this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the row over the Mullaghmore interpretative centre, landowners have become very concerned about the use of their land by the public to gain access to monuments.  In this connection, occupier's liability has become a major issue. On Monday night at a meeting in Ennis <Col N="1810" /> I was told by members of the IFA that a motion proposing that landowners should erect signs advising people that they cannot use their land to gain access to monuments would be put before its national meeting today.  Such a move will have an adverse effect on the tourism industry in County Clare.  Farmers are very irate at the delay in the introduction of legislation dealing with occupier's liability; they are very aggrieved that this legislation has been put on the long finger.  There are so many Departments involved in the development of a policy on national monuments &mdash; this is evident from the Bill &mdash; that the possibility of the occupier's liability question being resolved is becoming more and more remote.</P>
    <P>In one case the monument on a farmer's land is under the care of the Office of Public Works.  Yet this farmer has been told by the Office of Public Works that he has no insurance cover.  Is this farmer supposed to allow people free access over his land to a declared national monument which is under the care of the Office of Public Works?  If he decides to erect a sign informing people that they cannot use his land to gain access to this monument there will be protests.  This man has a young family and he has a responsibility to them.  If a person is seriously injured on his land this farmer will feel very aggrieved.  There is an onus on the Department to resolve some of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will contact the IFA directly to discuss the views expressed by its members at the meeting in Ennis on Monday night.  The national monuments in County Clare are very valuable from the point of view of tourism and some effort should be made to resolve these difficulties.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has responsibility for bringing forward the legislation on occupier's liability. Landowners are very frustrated at the Government's failure to bring forward this legislation.  The Minister should use his good offices to ensure that this legislation is brought forward as soon as possible in order to allay people's fears.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> In regard to the National Museum, I very much welcome the Collins Barracks project.  The Government has made a very good decision in this regard. However, I am somewhat confused about all the advice being given about the development of Collins Barracks.  Why is it necessary for the Minister to receive advice from the interim board, the interdepartmental committee, the board of visitors and a number of other advisers? Would it not have been more efficient for him to receive advice from one source only, say, the interim board?  Is it the case that the Minister is disappointed with the make-up of the interim board?  I do not understand the need for all this advice.</P>
    <P>There is no real reference in the Bill to resources for the Collins Barracks project. This is a major problem.  People are campaigning for the opening up of museums in areas outside Dublin.  The people of County Clare are disappointed that no museum will be sited in Ennis or some other area in the county.  The number of artefacts and national monuments in County Clare is as high as that in any other county.  The county also has a strong cultural and musical heritage and the siting of a museum in Ennis would be of benefit in properly promoting these aspects.  I understand it is proposed to open a chain of museums along the west coast.  Yet it is decided to leap-frog, so to speak, over County Clare.  I very much regret this decision. The Minister, a Clare man, should reexamine this decision and consider encouraging someone to promote the opening of a museum in Ennis.</P>
    <P>I have been very parochial in my remarks while other speakers have dealt with the wider national issue.  I am sure Deputy Deasy will give us a dissertation about the Ring forts at Ring in County Waterford.  The Minister should look again at the archaeological reserves in County Clare and consider using the resources accumulated by SFADCo, which has promoted the development of archaeological sites in County Clare, to promote further this aspect of Irish life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I want to join with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputies in wishing Deputy Carey well after his unfortunate accident.</P>
      <P>As the Bill will have an impact on every county all Deputies will obviously have an interest in its implementation.  It is timely that the Minister should introduce such a Bill.  It is now acknowledged that the discovery of the Derrynaflan hoard in February 1980 by Michael Webb and the subsequent Supreme Court case were the catalysts behind the introduction of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Those events were an indication of how unprepared the State was in dealing with a 20th century problem using outdated legislation, even though it was partly updated in the 1980s.  The ruling by the Supreme Court, outlined in this landmark judgment, was a clear signal to the State to provide a statutory basis for its claim to ownership of objects of archaeological interest and of their national importance.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to give statutory expression to the central ruling of the Supreme Court to legislate for the ownership of treasure trove thereby ensuring it is not lost to the public at large.  There are widespread rumours of finds by individuals which were not reported to the National Museum and the Garda authorities.  This Bill will ensure that anyone who makes a find, the ownership of which cannot be confirmed, must report it to the authorities.  It is timely that the Government has introduced this legislation which puts the onus on individuals to report to the Director of the National Museum the findings of objects which may be of archaeological interest.  The Bill also requires a person in possession of such an object or objects to report to the Director of the National Museum the whereabouts of such items. Penalties for non-compliance with these provisions are also included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of tourism is well documented and perhaps an area overlooked by the Government and the State agencies is the importance of our history and heritage to the tourism industry.  A <Col N="1813" /> report was published some days ago which outlined the underdeveloped state of our tourism industry.  More than 40 million Americans can trace some form of Irish roots and we have been told by various Government Ministers on return from trips to the United States that this is a source of great potential for our tourism industry.  The State agencies, voluntary organisations and the various Government Departments should co-ordinate a programme to tap into this wealth.</P>
    <P>Many of our historical sites require the protection of legislation and I am happy that this Bill proposes to empower the Commissioners of Public Works to establish a record of national monuments and sites, where it believes national monuments may be located, so that every known national monument or site will be afforded basic protection.  In doing so the rights of the landowners on whose sites these monuments are located will be fully respected.  We can all identify areas where this protection is needed and I welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>While local authorities have acted as guardians of some of our national monuments &mdash; the Commissioners of Public Works also have an input to this area &mdash; the lack of resources has ensured that proper protection in many cases has not been provided for these sites.  This new legislation should ensure a clear distinction as to the responsibilities for the protection of our archaeological heritage.</P>
    <P>I should mention the role of the National Museum because since its establishment in 1877 it has experienced particular problems throughout the years when more finds were made and more items of interest sent to it and it did not have the facilities or resources to display them all.  We should acknowledge the role the National Museum and its staff have played through the years.  It has provided a showcase for many generations and enabled them to have a glimpse of our history.  It was worked under difficult circumstances in that the physical layout of its premises meant that many of the national treasures, which could not be displayed, remained for <Col N="1814" /> years in the cellars of the museum.  The new proposals in relation to the National Museum and its relocation are welcome and I am happy that plans for this are well advanced.</P>
    <P>We should not forget the role played by many smaller town and county museums which have developed in the past 20 years, very few counties do not have such a museum.  They have an important part to play and perhaps in the restructuring and relocation of the National Museum, items which may not be of particular interest to it might be relocated to the area where they were originally discovered and displayed in the town or county museums where they would be of interest locally.  This has occurred in some cases where the National Museum may not have had a particular interest in certain items and they were given to local museums for display.  The National Museum has provided a source to enhance the collections and exhibitions of these smaller museums.</P>
    <P>We should pay tribute also to the individuals involved in the running and organisation of these small local museums.  In the main they are run by voluntary organisations which have benefited mainly over the past few years, from the social employment schemes. One of the benefits of voluntary organisations is that local self-appointed historians are happy to outline the history and folklore of various areas to anyone who is interested.  They have provided a great source of information for many people, particularly visitors from overseas, but also to those from other counties who want information about the history of their families.  Those self-appointed historians have been of great assistance in ensuring that people are told the history of their families.</P>
    <P>A major problem in the 1980s was the use by individuals of metal detectors. People went onto archaeological sites on many occasions without the permission of the landowners, the local authorities or the Office of Public Works, who should have been informed.  This led to the introduction of legislation in the late 1980s which provided some control over <Col N="1815" /> their use.  The fact that the provisions of this Bill will be enacted shortly is not sufficient because, with ongoing improvements in technology, all this legislation should be reviewed regularly, every two to three years, so that amendments can be made to take account of new developments, not alone in regard to metal detectors but within the overall technology area.</P>
    <P>The role of local authorities should not be forgotten because, even though they have not had the necessary resources, they played an important part in ensuring some form of protection of our heritage sites.  They co-ordinated many schemes which led to their improvement or prevented sites of archaeological interest from falling into disrepair.  Apart from climatic conditions which have affected many of our heritage sites there is the problem of vandalism, particularly when a heritage site is located in an urban area. Over the years we have encountered the problem of large scale, professional criminals who have identified a niche market for the sale of items of archaeological interest, which I understand is a growth sector.  The Garda are to be complimented on their work over the past ten years in locating and returning items of archaeological interest plundered from some of our national sites. There should not be so much criticism of their work because always I have found them to be, in the main, a professional, well organised force.  I find it nauseating that they do not receive the support of the general public, in some cases but, more importantly, Members should not criticise them.  If they do not have the support of legislators, what effect will that have on the morale of a very fine force?</P>
    <P>I welcome the restrictive provisions of this Bill with regard to the possession, sale, exchange and disposal of archaeological objects found within this State. For example, there will be a complete prohibition on transactions in objects found after the enactment of the provisions of this Bill unless the Minister or the relevant authorities waive their rights <Col N="1816" /> to ownership of such items.  At present the Director of the National Museum does not have statutory power to delegate some of his duties, such as the approval of locations, apart from the National Museum, for the storage of such items whereas, under the provisions of this Bill, he will be able to identify and delegate power for their safe storage or exhibition. In that context the Director can give permission for items to be sent to smaller museums around the country where they can be exhibited, a very welcome provision.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  I ask merely that they be kept under constant review since technological developments appear to be surpassing the rate at which we can introduce legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome certain provisions of this Bill.  It is a pity that it has not been sponsored jointly by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Dempsey, since its provisions are under the aegis of both Departments.  That would have been a gesture of their joint determination to protect our national monuments nationwide. Indeed there have been unseemly public squabbles between the two within the past year.  While the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is sponsoring the Bill it appears that the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Dempsey, will have to administer its provisions in that he has the requisite staff and resources so to do.  I do not believe the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, has spoken on this Bill.  Since he has a considerable involvement in the implementation of its provisions I hope he will tell us how his Department will operate those provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reservations about the provisions of this Bill; probably I would be at odds with many Members of this House on some.  For example, the concept that people with metal detectors <Col N="1817" /> should be banned from archaeological sites is going too far and people who dive as a leisure activity, in other words for sport, should not be prohibited from inspecting wrecks of archaeological importance.  We must recognise we are now moving from circumstances in which we have had almost no protection of our national monuments to those in which it would appear we will be over-protective so that people genuinely enjoying themselves will be prevented from engaging in leisure activities.  A balance must be struck.  We must remember that a provision in legislation is generally interpreted literally.  While we may not mean to prevent people from enjoying themselves, or engaging in such leisure activities or hobbies, probably that is what will happen.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why people criticised Mr. Michael Webb of Clonmel and his son for entering an archaeological site, as far as I can recollect, a ruined church in Derrynaflan, County Tipperary because if they had not done so, the Derrynaflan Chalice would have remained buried in a bog in the middle of County Tipperary and would not be on display in the National Museum for the benefit of the general public and tourists; we would not even have known that it existed.  How people could be so churlish as to criticise people who did us a national service in finding such a treasure is beyond me.  We must strike a happy medium which would allow people with a genuine interest in seeking treasure trove, not for personal gain but for the excitement of the achievement, to do so under licence.  Nobody will convince me that, within the Office of Public Works, there is the expertise and personnel capable of scouring the country for treasure troves and works of art which cannot readily be detected without the help of people who engage in this type of activity as a pastime.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, tell us how he intends to discover these works of art and what staff and scientific methods he has at his disposal for this purpose?  I am of the opinion that such resources are very thin indeed, that unless he has the co-operation <Col N="1818" /> of the general public, particularly by people who have this type of equipment at their disposal, many valuable treasures will remain undiscovered. There is a need for flexibility and a need to grant to people the right to search archaeological sites under licence.  The legislation would make it incumbent on those people to hand up any treasure discoverd.  I do not see anything wrong with that.</P>
    <P>I have been approached by a number of divers who dive purely for the pleasure of the sport.  They dive to wrecks to explore them and it is obviously a very exciting activity.  They feel they are being discriminated against under the terms of this Bill because they have no intention of stealing treasures from those wrecks. They want the right to look at items which are part of our national heritage.  They do not want to destroy or damage them. Have we the resources to police literally dozens of wrecks from the Spanish Armada around the coast, some of which have yet to be explored?  Others unfortunately have been explored and plundered by unscrupulous individuals. Honest decent people who dive for pleasure should not be lumped with those who have been diving for personal gain. Plundered treasures generally end up not in great houses or museums in Ireland but in private collections or in museums, particularly, in Britain or in the United States.  Let us have a happy medium and allow people who have enjoyed legitimate activities for many years continue to do so.  Let us congratulate and thank the Webb family for discovering a great work of art and let us not be petty and say people should not be allowed to operate metal detectors on archaeological sites.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the general listing of national monuments to be supervised by the Office of Public Works. The Office of Public Works has very few personnel country wide.  In my county the number of operatives, including directors and staff most of whom are administrative staff could be counted on the fingers of two hands.  The Office of Public Works should do this work in conjunction with the planning departments of local <Col N="1819" /> authorities because they have the resources to identify the national monuments within their areas.  Who is better equipped to do this type of work than the local authority?  The planning officer and his assistants in co-operation with the engineering staff, the overseers, the gangers and the road workers form an invaluable network in locating treasures and monuments.</P>
    <P>The Bill is incomplete and it will not have the desired result because the work is being left in the hands of a small number of people who are trying to do it mainly by remote control from the Office of Public Works in St. Stephen's Green, Dublin.  Subsidiary workers are few and many of them are involved in arterial drainage which is a totally different activity from identifying and protecting national monuments.</P>
    <P>During the past 20 or 30 years a great many of our national monuments have been demolished.  I doubt whether there is one Member of this House from a rural area who does not remember a number of ring forts and monuments which no longer exist because they were bulldozed into the ground.  Apparently there was no prohibition order and no way to stop that demolition.  National monuments have been demolished for years without any action being taken against the people concerned.  The number of ring forts destroyed during the past 30 years probably runs into thousands.  We have no trace of those ring forts, many of which probably contained archaeological artefacts and treasures.  Part of our heritage has gone with the bulldozing of those monuments.</P>
    <P>We need a much greater network to safeguard existing monuments and to identify those which may not have been identified and the Bill as drafted does not cover that.  However, people who use metal detectors and who dive to investigate wrecks at the bottom of the sea should not be penalised so long as they are doing so in good faith.</P>
    <P>On access to national monuments and the problems of landowners on whose lands such monuments are located the <Col N="1820" /> law as it stands creates a serious problem for both the landowner and occupier because of the insurance difficulties if somebody is injured while going to or from monuments.  We urgently need a public liability Bill to cover landowners in such situations.  The Fine Gael Party introduced such a Bill over a year ago and it was voted down by the Government on the pretext that it would bring in its own Bill very shortly.  As late as yesterday, the Taoiseach in reply to a question on that aspect said we are still waiting for a report from the Law Reform Commission. How often does the Law Reform Commission meet?  Does it have a daily, an annual, a monthly or a weekly meeting? Surely this matter is of such urgency that it should have been resolved within a matter of months of our Bill being voted down.  Every landowner is perplexed at the thought that he may be liable for compensation which may financially cripple him and his family for ever more as a result of an injury sustained by somebody crossing his land.  It is inconceivable that we can allow such an important matter to drift.  Can we be given some indication as to when the legislation will be introduced? Will it be this year, next year or in ten years?  It is not fair to the people involved.  I referred to the way in which our heritage has been destroyed and wrecks which contained valuable arterfacts and treasure looted.  I mentioned the Spanish Armada wrecks and others such as the <i>Lusitania</i> which lies ten miles off the Old Head of Kinsale.  That has been looted <i>ad nauseum</i> and no one has been able to stop it.  We do not know where the treasure from that ship ended up.  Divers from various countries have recovered treasures which have not been brought back to this country.  Items from wrecks are priceless.  We do not have the facilities to monitor what is happening. Dealers sell these artefacts and people come across them in museums in other countries.</P>
    <P>The national monument in my constituency is the Viking settlement in Waterford city.  The archaeological services and the National Museum have done imaginative work in uncovering all <Col N="1821" /> the settlement.  It is probably the most intact Viking site in the country, including Wood Quay.  The artefacts and treasures have been catalogued and retained.  The outline and more intricate details of the settlement are there to be seen.  It was a tremendous achievement. This is the type of work we need to do and those involved are to be complimented.</P>
    <P>Leinster House is a national museum and should be preserved as such.  Politicians are not good at withstanding public criticism but we need a modern parliament building.  There are some great buildings abroad.  We need new Houses of the Oireachtas.  This House is outdated.  It would make a magnificent national monument but it does not serve the needs of people working in the 20th century, never mind the 21st century. One can see the dilapidated working conditions some of the staff have to put up with.  They are very quiet people.  The stores office is overcrowded.  It is located in a bit of a cul-de-sac and was never intended to be a stores.  I would hate to think what facilities are like downstairs in the Library.  The editorial offices located on the right towards the entrance of the House were originally a passageway.</P>
    <P>We have a magnificent building going back 270 years but it is not fit for modern parliamentary activity.  As more staff are appointed, whether programme managers, spin doctors or groupies, the building becomes more inadequate.  The central heating seems to come on in the middle of summer and air conditioning in the winter so it is not just the politicians who blow hot and cold.  This Chamber is beautiful but the House is general does not lend itself to the working conditions which staff in this day and age desire.</P>
    <P>We need to think about moving the parliament to a green field site and provide proper working and recreational facilities.  The House is a decidedly unhealthy atmosphere in which to work. We need something comparable to the head office of a major company.  We run the country and surely we are entitled to not necessarily the best but reasonably good working conditions, as are the staff <Col N="1822" /> who are working in bad conditions at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Donegal South-West):</i> I thank Deputies for their welcoming remarks on the Bill and on the creation and role of the Department.  Many Deputies correctly identified the central importance of the Bill in giving statutory expression to the right of the people to their culture and heritage and the physical manifestations thereof.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Creed on his appointment as spokesperson for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and wish him well in his new brief.  He was concerned at the 14 year delay in bringing these proposals forward.  The Supreme Court decision on the Derrynaflan Chalice case was not available until the end of 1987. Prior to that the Oireachtas proceeded to enact the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987 which included action on many areas not affected by the judgment. The Minister referred to the fundamental importance of that judgment in his speech.  My admiration for the cogency and clarity of Mr. Justice Finlay's conclusions bears repeating but the task of giving statutory expression to the principles established was a complex and painstaking one and it took some years before the Bill could be brought before the Oireachtas.  I assure the Deputy that since the Minister's appointment he has regarded the introduction of this Bill as a priority.</P>
      <P>Deputies Creed and Quill referred to the resources available to the museum and I accept that it is and has for some time been grossly under-resourced in terms of staff and space.  This matter, which is separate from the Bill, is being addressed by the Minister who is the person with responsibility for the National Museum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the provisions of the Bill will not of themselves significantly increase the burden on the Director and his staff but if I am wrong in this belief I will not hesitate to consult my colleague, the Minister for Finance, with a view to <Col N="1823" /> securing extra resources.  I can readily associate with Deputy Creed's remarks on the importance of education instilling an understanding and appreciation of our culture and nurturing of our heritage. With the legislative proposals providing for an autonomous board for the National Museum it is hoped to create a structure that will allow the museum to realise its full potential in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputies Leonard, Deenihan and Michael Kitt echoed cogently the suggestion to allow local museums to keep artefacts which would be required by the National Museum.  This can be examined at administrative level as future structures are developed.  Already some important artefacts have been lent to county museums by the Director where he is satisfied with the facilities and the security of the museum in question.  I do not believe any area has a special right to an object of national or international importance even when the object has been found in the area.  I return to Mr. Justice Finlay's conclusions in stressing that this country's heritage belongs to all the people of Ireland and it is not proposed to preside over the destruction of the integrity of the national collection just to satisfy a sense of parochial pride.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed referred to the Collins Barracks national museum project.  I assure him that there should be no difficulty in convincing Cabinet colleagues of the value of this development.  The allocation to this development of £10 million from the Exchequer, as announced in the budget, is proof positive of this support.  On its own, this demonstration of the Government's commitment to the National Museum should be sufficient to refute Deputy Connor's suggestion that the Book of Estimates indicates there is a lack of resolve to address the long-standing problems of the National Museum or to monitor the ongoing task of preserving monuments. I advise Deputy Connor that the figures in the Book of Estimates for 1994 in respect of funds for cultural projects and institutions, including the National Museum, represent a substantial increase <Col N="1824" /> on last year's allocation.  This arises specifically as the 1994 figure has been shown as two separate allocations, the cumulative total of which amounts to £5.6 million which represents an overall increase of approximately 5 per cent over 1993.  The funding for the National Museum for 1994 has been increased by 20 per cent to £600,000 within the broad categories set out in the Estimates. The sum of £455,000 mentioned by the Deputy represents money expected to be generated by each of the cultural institutions concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy, and others, referred to section 7.  This section does not attempt to target responsible divers whose good work in this area is readily acknowledged. I reassure the House that no such inference should be drawn.  I stress again that this provision relates only to equipment found in an area already protected by an underwater heritage order.  There is only one such order in existence and none in respect of an area in the open sea.  This is hardly a draconian reduction in the freedom of divers.  It will be a matter for the courts &mdash; and only the courts &mdash; to decide whether equipment seized under this provision is to be permanently confiscated.  Sites requiring the protection of an underwater heritage order would be of such importance that their immediate and effective protection from threat would be imperative.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the proposed amendments on Committee Stage and I will give them the most careful consideration, particularly any suggestion that would dispel the notion that divers are being specifically targeted.  However, I remind Deputies that we are responsible for preserving priceless and irreplaceable parts of our heritage for the people of the State from both deliberate and accidental destruction or harm.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill referred to the debate in the Seanad where Senator Dardis called for compensation for farmers whose land he considered might be damaged in the course of an excavation by the Director of the National Museum.  The amendment to section 8 introduced in the Seanad confining the Director's right of <Col N="1825" /> entry to cases where there is an immediate threat to the site of the find is in my view the most realistic way of dealing with Senator Dardis's concerns.  I wish to draw attention to the assurances given in this House by the Minister in his introductory speech on the proposed operation of section 8.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan stated that most finds are the result of the work of metal detectors. This is not so; the major discoveries in recent years, with few exceptions, have come from the work of licensed archaeologists. The discovery of the largest Neolithic landscape in Europe in the Céide Fields resulted from the dedicated work of Dr. Séamus Caulfield over a period of 20 years or so.</P>

      <P>With regard to the prohibition generally on the use of metal detectors on sites recorded under section 11, this is simply an extension of the existing protection given to national monument sites under the National Monuments Act, 1987.  I am not suggesting that all or even most of those who use metal detectors have criminal intent but it has to be appreciated that the use of such devices led in the 1980s to widespread considerable damage and loss and we must continue to be extremely vigilant to preserve what is left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Deasy's remarks, I have no desire to inhibit people's enjoyment and had it been feasible to discipline the use of these devices without recourse to any additional controls I would have been only too pleased to be accommodating.  The threat to historic sites from the use of such devices is continuing.  The threat is real and should <Col N="1826" /> not be underestimated.  My primary duty in this regard must be to ensure that historic sites are effectively protected.  In the strict confines which I feel bound to keep, I acknowledge the important point made by Deputy Gallagher of Laoighis-Offaly, that the State authorities should not simply resort to penal provisions as their chief way of protecting monument sites but that the State should look for positive ways whereby metal detecting enthusiasts could co-operate with the State.  He gave some interesting examples of such co-operation.  I will explore with the Office of Public Works and the Director of the National Museum ways and means by which the provisions of the Acts may be administered to render such co-operation possible.</P>
    <P>The question of owners' liability which many Deputies raised in commenting on section 12 is a major issue and falls outside the scope of the Bill.  It does not arise in respect of property acquired by the Office of Public Works.  The provision under which the Office of Public Works will have the power to buy easements and rights of way will facilitate the process of amicably resolving any problems with the landowners concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies Quill, de Valera, Kemmy, Brendan Smith and others stressed the importance of a regional dimension to the policy on national cultural institutions.  I am committed to this concept and do not see this as a battle between Dublin and the other regions, that one part of the country has to be starved to provide facilities in another.  I agree with Deputy Gallagher that, significant as the Collins Barracks project is, it should not become the sole repository of all items of national significance.  I am also sympathetic to Deputy Kemmy's suggestion that a centre of excellence should be established in Limerick.  With reference to Deputy Carey's comments, the interim board on the museum will be advising the Minister on the Collins Barracks project and on how best in practice to achieve a substantial regional dimension to policies. The legislative proposals will take cognisance of the role of the board of visitors to the museum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1827" /> With regard to Deputy Smith's comments about the proposed museum in Cavan, I will see if anything is possible in relation to the mace which is now in Belfast and which the Deputy would like to see placed in the proposed museum. As the item is located outside the State it will only be possible to take action at diplomatic level.  The issue has to be seen in the broader context of how to deal with cultural objects kept in museums outside their precise place of origin.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell voiced concerns about whether more modern approaches to the display of national treasures could be adopted in museum exhibitions.  The staff of the museum, given proper resources which I intend to deliver, have inventive and exciting ideas to capture the imagination.  The Minister hopes to open a major exhibition on our pre-historic past in mid-April at the museum, while early next year there will be a most important exhibition of material relating to the Viking period.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of restoration rather than conservation.  He rightly said that there are two schools of thought on this matter and that what is required is a balanced approach, in other words, the conservation of selected monuments with the proper restoration of others.  It is important that some monuments be kept in their pure state and not be subject to conjectural restoration so that architectural historians and students can see the work of the original builders. Provision is made in the Structural Fund programme for a number of restoration projects, for instance, Ardfert Cathedral and Portumna Castle.  The National Development Plan includes a significant provision to provide proper access and information at national monuments and it is envisaged that during the next few years adequate information will be available at all monuments in State care.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy Nealon's call for a board with real powers.  As the Minister mentioned, he is bringing forward legislative proposals for such an autonomous board and in the short term an interim board <Col N="1828" /> has been established to give advice on the way ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell made some positive comments regarding the responsibilities and duties of property owners with respect to the physical manifestations of our culture and heritage.  He went straight to the heart of what it is the Minister is attempting to achieve with the provisions of the Bill.  In a nutshell the Minister is attempting to strike a reasonable balance or partnership between the rights of property and the rights of the people to their heritage and culture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith made a persuasive case for the acquisition by the State of the monuments on Trinity Island in Lough Oughter.  I will take up this matter with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon referred to Knocknashee Hill Fort in County Sligo.  This monument has been entered in the register of historic monuments.  I am aware of the interest of the Knocknashee heritage group and I am informed that the Office of Public Works hopes to arrange a meeting with the group to see how it can help to achieve its objectives.  With regard to the Armada wrecks at Streedagh, this matter is the subject of High Court proceedings and judgment is still awaited.  It would be improper to make any comments on the matter while it is <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    <P>I welcome the remarks made by Deputy Leonard about the need to protect the rights of those who wish to visit national monuments and those of landowners. This Bill seeks to strike a balance between both sets of rights.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan referred to the stone head that was stolen last year.  Powers are being given to the Director of the National Museum to require the reporting of possession of all objects found in the State since 1930.  This will be of assistance in the task of recovering this important artefact.  The 1987 Act contains heavy penalties for contravention of the law relating to national monuments which will be invoked by the courts if the person or persons are caught.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that all standing stones should be placed under cover and <Col N="1829" /> replaced on site by replicas.  Some progress has been made in this matter.  For instance, recently the Cross of the Scriptures and other crosses at Clonmacnoise have been placed in the new visitors centre and replaced on site by replicas. To do this for all high crosses and grave slabs would be an enormous undertaking and not everyone would be happy if they were left with mere replicas.  I agree with the Deputy that, as resources permit, we should progressively extend protection in this way to the most valuable and vulnerable objects.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned that thousands of monuments have been destroyed, many since the passing of the 1987 Act.  That Act extended protection on to those monuments which were registered under section 5 of the Act, about 4,000 in all.  This Bill extends protection to all monuments which have been recorded; in other words, all 150,000 monuments should be protected within a short time following the passage of this legislation.  As the Deputy said, we are approaching the ideal position which applies in Sweden.  I am sure he is aware that under our Constitution there can be no question of the State assuming ownership of all monuments in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Kitt referred to the work done by divers in the River Suck when the National Museum, the Office of Public Works and the diving fraternity co-operated in an extremely satisfactory manner.  This is how I would like to see things happen in the future with the divers assisting the authorities in locating objects and ensuring that they are recovered scientifically.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey raised the question of the owner of a monument in the case of the State who is concerned about public liability in respect of visitors to the monument. Without having the details of the case it is difficult to say what the owner should do.  However, if the owner negotiates with the Office of Public Works I am sure they would be willing to provide a proper access and take responsibility for public liability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan urged that our monuments and our history should be used <Col N="1830" /> to a greater extent in the promotion of tourism.  There is provision for £139 million in the National Plan under the tourism operations programme for cultural tourism.  This is a clear indication of the Government's resolve to utilise our heritage to the greatest extent in promoting tourism and creating employment.  I also assure the Deputy that both my Department and the Office of Public Works are represented on the Tourism Council which was recently appointed by the Minister for Tourism and Trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy asked what scientific expertise the State has at its disposal to discover archaeological objects.  I refer him to the discovery programme being implemented by my Department in co-operation with the Office of Public Works.  An annual budget of £500,000 has been provided for this programme and the equipment being utilised is the most advanced in Europe.  The Deputy asked that metal detector users should be allowed to operate on archaeological sites under licence.  This legislation provides for the use of metal detectors in such places under licence, but it is essential that experienced archaeologists should be in charge of operations to ensure that the knowledge and objects to be obtained are not lost to the State.  The Deputy states also that it should be for the Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works to implement this information.  This is only partially the case.  Most of the provisions in the Bill are for the National Museum to implement, while some will be implemented by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered all the points raised by the Deputies.  I thank them most sincerely for their contributions and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate, with amendments, the law relating to the taking of a referendum.  When enacted, the Bill will provide a comprehensive procedure for conducting a referendum, extending from the appointment of the polling day through the taking of the poll and the counting of the votes to the possibility of questioning the result by means of a referendum petition.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents a continuation of the programme of electoral law reform which commenced a few years ago.  The programme has already resulted in the amendment and consolidation of the Dáil electoral law in the Electoral Act, 1992 and similar treatment of the law relating to presidential elections in the Presidential Elections Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>The existing law on the taking of a referendum is contained in eight enactments, the principal of these being the referendum Act, 1942.  It is interesting to note that the 1942 Act was not used at all during the first 16 years after its enactment.  The first referendum on a proposal to amend the Constitution was not held until 1959.  In the 25 years since 1959, 16 referenda have been held.  On average, therefore, there has been a referendum virtually once in every 18 months over the past quarter century.  It is not, of course, possible to say whether this relatively high incidence will continue in the future.  What can be said is that the referendum code is relevant and important and should be maintained in an up-to-date and fully operational condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the 16 referenda held to date, 11 of the proposals were approved <Col N="1832" /> by the people and five were rejected.  In addition to the 11 amendments to the Constitution effected by referendum, two amendments took place during the transitional period allowed for in Article 51, within which the Constitution could be amended by ordinary law without a referendum.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we have adopted the same approach as in the Presidential Elections Act, 1993.  The provisions relating to Dáil elections, set out in the Electoral Act, 1992, which are common to all polls, are applied with necessary modifications. These provisions include the rules relating to postal and special voting, polling on islands, procedures in polling stations as well as arrangements for counting the votes and electoral offences.  These core provisions will, as far as practicable, be identical for all elections and referenda, and will be supplemented by provisions unique to each individual code.  In this way it is hoped to eliminate minor, and occasionally irritating, procedural differences that have crept into the different codes over the years.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces a number of worth-while improvements in referendum law. For example, under existing law a recount of votes at a referendum may be demanded in individual constituencies but there is no provision for a complete recount of all the votes cast.  At a referendum voting might appear clear-cut in individual constituencies but the overall vote, when aggregated, could be very close.  In that situation the only recourse for a person wishing to question the accuracy of the count is by means of a referendum petition to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses this situation and includes a provision to enable the referendum returning officer to order a complete re-examination and recount of the votes cast in every constituency, if he or she considers it necessary.  This procedure will be in addition to the existing right of any agent present at the count in an individual constituency to demand a recount of the votes in that constituency. The new provision could be an important mechanism in certain circumstances and would obviate the necessity for a referendum <Col N="1833" /> petition, with its associated delay, inconvenience and expense.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeats the requirement in existing law that the proposal which is the subject of the referendum must be stated on the ballot paper by citing, by its short title, the Bill containing the proposal. The Bill will enable the Minister for the Environment to provide, by order, for the entry on the ballot paper of a descriptive heading to indicate the subject matter of the proposal.  Where two or more referenda are taken on the same polling day this arrangement would assist electors in distinguishing between the separate ballot papers which would otherwise look very similar.  Descriptive headings were included on referendum ballot papers in 1978 and again in 1992 when a number of referenda were taken on the same polling day.  On each occasion, special legislation was enacted to provide for the inclusion of the headings on the ballot papers.  An order providing for headings on ballot papers, pursuant to this Bill, will require approval in draft by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is envisaged that an order would be considered only when two or more referenda are being taken together.</P>
    <P>Under existing referendum law, an elector who is unable to vote at his or her normal polling station because of employment by the local returning officer, may be authorised to vote at another polling station in the same constituency. The provision restricting the exercise of this facility to the constituency for which the elector is registerd will be removed by the Bill.  It will be possible to authorise an elector, employed by a local returning officer, to vote in the constituency in which he or she is so employed.  This will bring the referendum law into line with the Presidential Elections Act in this respect.</P>
    <P>The law in relation to the questioning of a referendum by means of petition is being tightened up.  Under existing law, leave of the High Court to present a petition must be sought within ten days of the publication of the provisional result; under the Bill this is reduced to seven <Col N="1834" /> days.  The period allowed in the Bill for the presentation of a petition after the grant of leave by the High Court is three days; under existing law a petition may be presented within 21 days of publication of the provisional result.  The objective of those changes is to provide adequate opportunity for challenging the result of a referendum while, at the same time, ensuring that the coming into force of a constitutional change, which may be urgent, is not unduly delayed.</P>
    <P>The Bill effects a number of changes which, while minor in themselves, together constitute worth-while improvement in referendum law.  An example of the kind of change involved is that the consent of the Minister will no longer be required for the appointment of a deputy local returning officer or for the selection of a counting centre which is outside the constituency concerned.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Constitution provides for two types of referendum. Article 46 provides that every proposal for an amendment of the Constitution, having been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, shall be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people.</P>
    <P>Article 27 provides for the reference of a Bill, other than a constitution amendment Bill, to the people by referendum. This is referred to as an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; referendum, even though in practice, such an event would be quite out of the ordinary and no such referendum has yet taken place.  Under that article, a majority of the Members of the Seanad and no less than one-third of the Members of the Dáil may jointly petition the President to decline to sign and promulgate as law any Bill which is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, on the grounds that it contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people on the Bill ought to be ascertained.  The President may, after consultation with the Council of State, decline to sign the Bill unless and until the proposal has been approved by the people at a referendum or by a resolution of the Dáil following a general election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> Although the circumstances contemplated in Article 27 appear remote, the procedures in the present Bill will apply to &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; as well as constitutional referenda.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, this Bill represents a further instalment in the continuing programme of electoral law reform.  The objective of the programme is to update each of the separate electoral codes and, as far as practicable, consolidate each code in a single statute.  The opportunity is taken to effect desirable amendments and, as far as practicable, to bring procedures in each code into line with one another.</P>
    <P>This is a worthwhile exercise, given particularly, the special importance of electoral law and its direct relevance to each citizen.  I hope that the Oireachtas will enact the measure as soon as possible. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation principally replaces the Referendum Act, 1942, and as half a century has passed since then it is time to reconsider the question of referenda.  This Bill deals with constitutional referenda as well as those held pursuant to Article 27 of the Constitution.  I hope we have learned from one mistakes in regard to the wording and presentation of referenda.</P>
      <P>I welcome the inclusion of a number of clauses in the legislation, particularly the provision for a recount in the case of a close result.  That is important as, in general, referenda generate more enthusiasm, controversy and intense campaigning than ordinary elections. The electorate get very worked up about referenda, particularly those which propose changes to our Constitution.  As a result of the Programme for Government agreed by the two parties in Government we will face a number of referenda in the lifetime of this Dáil.  For that reason I welcome the provision for a recount in the event of a close result in an election. One can no longer anticipate anything in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the legislation the Minister may provide an order for the inclusion of a <Col N="1836" /> descriptive heading on a ballot paper where it is considered necessary, but the wording of that section should be stronger. Will the Minister consider substituting the words &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;must&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;?  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The Bill repeats the requirement in existing law that the proposal which is the subject of the referendum must be stated on the ballot paper by citing, by its short title, the Bill containing the proposal.  The Bill will enable the Minister for the Environment to provide, by order, for the entry on the ballot paper of a descriptive heading to indicate the subject matter of the proposal.</P>
    <P>When two or more referenda are held on the same day will the Minister have to include a descriptive heading on the ballot paper?  That is why I suggested the wording of that section should be stronger.</P>
    <P>The November 1992 referenda on the right to travel and information is still causing confusion, partly because the heading on the ballot paper was not properly defined.  People want the wording on ballot papers in referenda to be simple and uncomplicated.  In other words, what the people are being asked to vote on should be clearly spelt out.  For example, if the Government put to the people a referendum on rejection or acceptance of abortion I know what they will decide. The objective of any referendum dealing with constitutional change should be to have a clear descriptive definition on the ballot paper.  The matter on which the people are asked to vote should be set out in clear, unambiguous and precise terms, particularly if it involves changes to our Constitution, which could have serious repercussions for many years.  I welcome the Bill if it provides for that.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the electorate deciding by way of referenda to allow a change in our Constitution if what they are voting on is clearly spelt out.  The Minister should be required to include a descriptive heading on the ballot paper in the case of referenda dealing with a change in our Constitution.  Section 34 of the Bill refers to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported to the Dáil on 16 December last on the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 10 and 11 December 1993, I stated that the European Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment received a unanimous welcome from the Council.  This endorsement of the White Paper by the Council, which I obviously share, was reflected in the adoption by the Council of an action plan based on the prescriptions set out in the White Paper.  As stated in the Council conclusions the action plan includes specific measures at the levels of the EU and of the member states directed at, in the short-term, reversing the rising unemployment trend and then, by the end of the century, significantly reducing the number of unemployed, at present standing at the unacceptable level of 17 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At EU level the emphasis in both the White Paper and the action plan is primarily on the full use of the potential of the single market with particular reference to small and medium sized enterprises and development of trans-European networks and of the new information and communication technologies. In regard to the trans-European networks and the new technologies two expert groups representative of the 12 member states have been established to <Col N="1838" /> chart the way in which the full potential of these can be realised throughout Europe.  In addition implementation at Community level is being followed up by the various responsible ministerial councils. Ireland is participating fully in the follow-up at EU level.</P>
    <P>Measures to be adopted domestically by member states as recommended by the White Paper and the action plan include the following: improving education and training systems for young people and the unemployed: better use of public funds set aside for combating unemployment and targeted reductions in the indirect cost of labour particularly in regard to less-skilled work.</P>
    <P>Those national measures are all to be undertaken within a stable and coherent economic and monetary framework while ensuring a continued high level of social protection.</P>
    <P>Government policy is and will remain fully consistent with the recommendations for domestic action set out in the White Paper.  The <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> both have employment as their key aim.  They include significant provision for measures targeted at unemployment, in particular long-term unemployment and for action aimed at improving education and training for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>At a more specific level the recent budget and the forthcoming Finance Bill have action on employment and on education and training as key objectives.  The 1994 budget specifically targeted lower paid employment through tax concessions, relief in the burden of employers' social security contributions and exemption from the health and employment training levies.  The budget also contained a number of other incentives aimed at promoting investment and job creation especially in small and medium sized enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the chapters dealing with employment, does the Taoiseach accept the Commission's recommendation that we should cut taxes and social insurance on labour to achieve a <Col N="1839" /> target of 1 per cent to 2 per cent of GDP which would be equivalent to 2 per cent to 4 per cent of wage costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach noted the conclusion in the Commission's document that models show that if employers' social security contributions were cut by 1 per cent of GDP unemployment rates would fall by 2.5 per cent over four years which in Irish terms would be equivalent to a decrease in unemployment of 33,000 over four years? Would he agree that figure is far higher than the projected reduction in unemployment under the national plan? Would he also agree it is a critical target set by the EU which should be implemented as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the ESRI predicts the impact of the plan at the end of its term, which is the end of the decade, will result in a reduction in unemployment of 262,000. That would be a big step forward.  World economic conditions will have a big impact on the number of jobs that can be created as 70 per cent of our output is sold on foreign markets.  Demand within the Irish economy has a limited effect on job creation and we rely to a large extent on world economic conditions.  Now that the GATT negotiations have been completed and the graph in respect of world trade moving upwards it is expected that there will be significant economic activity in the years ahead.  The growth rate this year will be between 4 to 5 per cent and the Central Bank, normally conservative in its forecasts, predicts a growth rate of 4 per cent, a big increase on our growth rate some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recognise that the ESRI's projection of a decrease in unemployment of 26,000 does not result from the plan but will <Col N="1840" /> occur during the period of the plan?  In contrast the EU Commmission's proposal that a restructuring of our tax code would reduce unemployment by 33,000 is evidence that this should be the subject of specific Government policy initiative. It would yield rich returns in terms of a reduction in unemployment.  Will he reconsider prioritising it?  Does the Taoiseach recall the finding in relation to Ireland in the chapter which shows that Ireland had the highest growth in taxes on labour of all EU countries, excluding Spain, and that in contrast to the UK our burden of taxes on labour has grown by 150 per cent at a time when there was no growth in such taxes in the UK?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy considers the true comparison between social costs of unemployment here and other EU member states he will agree that we are near the bottom of the scale.  There is a big gap between Ireland and other member states.

The decline in population is estimated on an annual basis but these figures cannot be relied upon as being totally accurate.  Many different issues have to be taken into account.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the new transatlantic arrangements will have a positive effect on the two airports, particularly Shannon.  A number of people, particularly those in SRS and Aer Turas, are concerned about the matter referred to in his reply.  They find it difficult to believe that these arrangements could have a positive impact on their livelihood, particularly as it was not part of the original Cahill plan to sell off these companies.  Will the Minister give a guarantee that the US pre-immigration facility will remain at Shannon? Is the Minister satisfied with Aer Lingus projections that there will be sufficient Ireland-US traffic to justify a daily Dublin-New York service and a daily Shannon-New York service during the off season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before replying I would like to welcome Deputy Hogan to the Front Bench of Fine Gael and I look forward to constructive tussels with him over the months and years ahead.</P>
      <P>The disposal of non-core assets is an integral part of the Cahill plan.  As part of the recovery process the question of equity injection, cost reduction and disposal of non-core assets is part of an integrated plan that is necessary to bring viability to the company.  Pre-immigration inspection facilities are available at Shannon having been negotiated successfully by officials in my Department. Similar facilities are now available in Dublin.  This will play a part in boosting transatlantic traffic, particularly from UK regional airports to Dublin and on to New York.  The dynamics of the situation have changed considerably from this time last year.  I was in the United States recently and was informed by the Aer Lingus North American operation in New York servicing North America, that as a result of improved and increased marketing opportunities for which funding has been made available, there is the prospect of a 21 per cent increase in traffic this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance that the pre-immigration <Col N="1854" /> facility at Shanon will remain there?  Will he also answer the question on the service during the off season?  A report was prepared by the Shannon Task Force in respect of the Shannon area as part of the ongoing deliberations on Aer Lingus and I should like the Minister to give some indication of the contents of that report and whether he proposes to publish it so that we can have some idea of what the task force had in mind for the area.  Will the Minister indicate if there will be increased business for the Shannon area <i>vis-à-vis</i> Aeroflot, who have proposals in respect of that airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the off season, I can give an assurance that, based on commercial decisions, all year round flights are proposed for Shannon.  The Airbus A330's have a larger cargo facility than the present transatlantic fleet and, therefore, it is economic, by reason of the cargo issue alone, notwithstanding the increased passengers, to provide an all year round service to Shannon.  That was widely welcomed and it underpinned my commitment to ensure we achieved a solution which took account of all the stake holders in the aviation business and in the airports affected.  I stated that we have successfully negotiated, despite great difficulty and some threat, the retention of the pre-immigration facility for Shannon and a similar facility for Dublin.</P>
      <P>The question of the Shannon Task Force is a separate issue.  I have the report and I am considering a response and putting forward policy options.  The central thrust of the report &mdash; I am grateful to the task force for its excellent work &mdash; is that it is up to all the interests in the Shannon region, tourism, travel and aviation interests, to come together in a coherent and integrated fashion to maximise the potential of the airport and the spin-off activity that will emanate from such an effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aeroflot, is a customer in Shannon. Any proposals by that company will be considered by my Department and if any opportunities which are consistent with <Col N="1855" /> our aviation policy arise we can pursue them.</P>

      <P>We must get the terminology right.  As I stated in this House previously, a proposal was received from Cable and Wireless and I immediately issued a directive to Telecom Éireann.  I am adopting a pragmatic and practical approach to this issue.  In an upfront and open way I want the range of options studied by the board in the first instance, the people with responsibility for setting out the future prospects of this company, and, once that has been done, they will report to me within six months.  That length of time is required for them to undertake that full range of consideration to decide what is in the strategic interests of the company.  There will be no preemption or decision in relation to that matter until such time as I hear from the company.</P>

      <Quest>the total financial allocation under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, as originally drafted for areas for which he has responsibility; the allocation following the overall cut of 8.5 per cent announced by the Government on 3 March 1994; the way in which this will be applied to the projects for which he has responsibility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The total allocation proposed for EU co-financing assistance in the National Development Plan, for the areas within my Department's responsibility, was approximately £650 million at 1993 prices.  Over 18 per cent of this expenditure was submitted for co-financing assistance from the Cohesion Fund.  This means that a significant proportion of the investment programme will not be affected by the pro rata adjustments put forward by Government in relation to the Structural Funds elements of the National Plan.  Approximately £302 million of the aid allocation was to be provided directly from Structural Funds.  Pro rata adjustments will result in a reduction as of now of less than 5 per cent of the original total allocation in the National Development Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards projects, I refer to the statement by the Minister of Finance in the debate on a Private Member's motion on the National Development Plan on 1 March last, which gave details of the different planning and negotiating stages in the Structural Funds process, involving the National Plan, the Community Support Framework and the Operational Programmes.  In many cases, the selection of individual projects for EU assistance is a further phase in the process <Col N="1858" /> which will follow the approval of the Operational Programmes.  Since negotiations on the plan as a whole are ongoing, as are talks on the two Operational Programmes particular to my Department, it is not possible at this stage to give details at project level of likely Structural Fund assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has sought to diminish the amount of money he will actually lose in respect of the National Development Plan.  That plan, published last October, indicated many projects for his Department would be commenced and completed within its duration.  Will the Minister confirm that those specific projects will go ahead, namely, a peat-fired power station in his constituency in the midlands, a light rail system for Dublin under the Dublin Transportation Initiative, the main line programme, the DART extension to Greystones and an extension of the natural gas grid to Shannon, these being but some examples of projects included in the plan?  Will the Minister comment on them individually?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to these projects in the National Development Plan which it would be our hope and intention to pursue, many sources of funding, not simply Structural Funding will be required to enable these projects to get on the road.  In relation to the peat-fired power station, I refer the Deputy to the National Development Plan where it is said that, on the basis of its being economically feasible, we will proceed with that project.  Part of that feasibility study covers European Union funding towards the capital costs and negotiations are ongoing in relation to that matter.  I must await the outcome of those negotiations until then, I am not prepared to say what will happen other than to say that I am generally supportive of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to LRT, the extension of the DART and so on, these are all part of an integrated package resulting from the Dublin Transportation Initiative which examined initial investments over a six-year period and investments beyond that period, seeking to provide an integrated <Col N="1859" /> long-term solution to the ever increasing traffic congestion in this city. Some of those projects will attract European Union funding and are being negotiated at present.  When those negotiations have been completed and the operational programmes published, we can discuss them in detail.  Over the period of the plan there will be investment, and there will be investment beyond the duration of the plan, to complete the Dublin Transporatation Initiative. It is not envisaged that the whole transportation initiative will be completed within the period of the National Development Plan.  It comprises a long term solution and entails a very detailed, considered and consultative process on the issues in relation to traffic congestion in this city.  Action must be taken in a co-ordinated way, not merely in relation to light rail or the DART but in relation to busways, a whole integrated system.  The Structural Funds negotiations will provide us with a major boost for public transport, not alone in this city but also on main line rail, over the ensuing six years against a background, particularly in relation to main line rail, of historic under-investment.  It has been my determination throughout these negotiations to ensure that modern public transport modes are safeguarded, that we maximise the allocations so that we can phase in these projects.  I cannot be more specific at this stage.  Generally that is where we are in relation to those specific projects but there are many more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister engaged in a very robust defence of the allocation he was to receive, but obviously has failed. I suggest he will have to accept a substantial reduction of up to 15 per cent in the allocation he was due to receive during the six years of the plan.  The fact that he is not in a position to give us categoric assurances that between 1994 and 1999 various projects specifically outlined in the plan will go ahead&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said in my earlier reply, and as the Taoiseach has outlined, we are finalising negotiations with the Commission in relation to Structural Funding.  We will be the second member state to have completed that process &mdash; a piece of good news to report to the House.  I suggest that Deputy Hogan is not totally <i>au fait</i> with the configuration of the funding available for the Department of Transport, Energy and Comunications under the plan.  Over 18 per cent of expenditure was submitted for co-financing assistance from the Cohesion Fund.  The Cohesion Fund is not affected by the changes that have had to be made to accommodate the £7.2 billion ceiling inserted until the review comes up in two years' time, so he should take that out of the equation.  In terms of investment in our electricity and communications services, one will see that the amount of money in respect of which we have sought European Union co-financing is 5 per cent, 6 per cent or 7 per cent only of total capital requirements in expenditure terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;over the period of the plan.  It is not a case of its not having been got.  It is a case of making sure that we use our commercial semi-State bodies, who have their resources and plans in place quite apart from Structural Funding, so that they can go ahead and ensure, for example, in areas like public transport, where there is not the same possibility of &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; allocation, that we attract maximum Cohesion Funding where the intervention rates are far higher, and Structural Funding.  We are succeeding in that and those negotiations are coming to a conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 12 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preliminary contacts between Cable and Wireless and the Government go back for some time but developed into exploratory discussions without commitment between the company and Telecom Éireann 12 months ago.  In a press <Col N="1862" /> statement dated 24 May 1993, I stated that an approach was made to the Department by Cable and Wireless with a view to exploring the possibility of links with Telecom Éireann, that I had asked Telecom Éireann for their views and that preliminary discussions, without commitment, were entered into between Telecom Éireann and Cable and Wireless. This accords with the statement attributed to the chief executive to the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.</P>
    <P>The Telecom Éireann Corporate Plan 1994-1999 indicates that in addition to these discussions, Telecom Éireann have had preliminary discussions with several other potential formal allies.  In its informal day-to-day contacts with players in the telecommunications market, my Department is also generally aware of a degree of interest in possible alliances with Telecom Éireann.  However, the only formal proposal made to either Telecom Éireann or to me is the one recently made by Cable and Wireless.  My attitude to this proposal and other possible similar proposals is as I stated on 3 March on the Adjournment of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister has finally acknowledged that the initial contact from Cable and Wireless was made to the Government who then introduced Cable and Wireless to Telecom Éireann.

      <P>The facts are as follows. A formal proposal came to my Department in March, of which I did not have notice.  When it arrived I immediately gave a directive to Telecom Éireann in which I said: &ldquo;This is the first formal proposal we have received.  Please seek out a full range of options and report to me as shareholder and advise me from your perspective what is in the strategic interests of this company&rdquo;.  We will take our decisions based on that information and other expertise from consultancies which we may seek at that stage.  Those are the facts and everything else is superfluous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is also aware that Telecom Éireann had been considering other options in relation to strategic alliances.  Why did the Minister wait until Cable and Wireless put a formal proposal on the table before asking Telecom Éireann to evaluate the various options?  Why did he not ask Telecom Éireann to carry out that evaluation 12 months ago when he knew that these discussions were underway between Telecom and various companies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my statement of 24 May 1993.  The discussions were exploratory and preliminary in nature.  There were no formal proposals put to me.  I am not interested in expressions of interest; I am interested in formal proposals.  I have taken a practical and pragmatic approach to this issue.  I refer the Deputy to my statement to the other House in early March 1994. The bottom line is that this country must have efficient, wide-ranging and competitive telecommunications services as the crucial element in economic development and job creation, both directly and indirectly.  Both Culliton and Moriarty point to that fact.</P>
      <P>The Government will consider the full range of options that will emanate from the directive I gave to the company last week, which was the first indication of any formal interest whatever and which I outlined in detail in Dáil Éireann.  I am determined to ensure that we make a conscious strategic decision after appropriate analysis and consideration.  We cannot afford the consequences of policy drift in this area, neither should we look exclusively at the first offer that is made. The procedures I have outlined and put in place are a pragmatic and realistic approach to ensure, in a changing world, that the interests of Telecom Éireann, its staff, customers and the public &mdash; as owners of the company &mdash; are best served by the solutions which will emerge.  That is the agenda; there is no other agenda.</P>

Practical and pragmatic may be the terms the Minister uses to describe his position but I put it to him that his considerations are political. The Minister has teed up a privatisation of part of Telecom Éireann and postponed it for six months, until after the European elections on 9 June 1994, to avoid political embarrassment for him and his parties in Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 10, 32, 72 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>Normally, matters such as those raised in today's questions and in the questions on the same topic tabled on 17 February 1994, would fall within the day-to-day administration of the State body concerned. However, in view of the widespread public concern about the quality of the postal service arising from An Post's new arrangements, I have felt it appropriate to get a report from An Post in the matter.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to question No. 3 on 17 February 1994, An Post implemented a programme of changes in the arrangements for distribution and delivery of mail in the Dublin area.  These changes were introduced on 17 January 1994 and were part of An Post's recovery measures to reduce costs and improve profitability.</P>
      <P>The changes introduced gave rise initially to two main problems.  First of all there was the question of next day deliveries and secondly there was the question of delivery times in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1867" /> With regard to next day deliveries, in the week the Dublin Mails Centre was opened next day deliveries for letter post nationwide, as sampled by an independent market research company, fell to 68 per cent compared to results of over 90 per cent in each of the last four years. By the week commencing 14 February this figure had risen to 85 per cent and based on this improvement I was assured by An Post that next day deliveries were back to normal.  However, this did not materialise and next day deliveries slipped in the weeks commencing 21 and 28 February.  Things improved again in the following weeks and the most recent data available, which covers items posted during March, show an average 93 per cent next day delivery nationwide.  I have spoken to An Post and I am assured that the company will be able to maintain this level of performance regarding next day deliveries in the future.</P>
    <P>The figure of 93 per cent is based on postings Dublin to Dublin, provinces to Dublin, Dublin to provinces and provinces to provinces.  An Post have informed me that Dublin to Dublin, Dublin to provinces and provinces to provinces next day deliveries for March are 91 per cent, 91 per cent and 99 per cent respectively.  The exception to this good performance is provinces to Dublin post which shows 84 per cent next day deliveries.  I have stressed to An Post the necessity for getting the provinces to Dublin performance back to the national average at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with An Post I inquired about the operations of the optical character recognition equipment installed in the Dublin Mails Centre.  I was assured that the equipment is performing satisfactorily and is already processing 80 per cent of Dublin mails.  I also understand that An Post will be advising their customers again about the best preparation and addressing of mail to optimise the use of the new equipment.</P>
    <P>In fact the problems of the last three months relate not so much to the performance of the new equipment as to the organisational and logistical difficulties <Col N="1868" /> of implementing major changes simultaneously. The organisational problems derived from the need to embark on a massive re-training exercise, an exercise which An Post admit they underestimated. The logistical problems arose from the need to handle some mails outside the Dublin Mails Centre during its transition to full capacity processing thus creating a volume of mail which was not ready in time for the morning delivery.</P>
    <P>This led to the second main problem I referred to earlier, namely the delivery times for customers in Dublin, particularly the key business areas of the city. An Post have informed me that, in consultation with the trades unions, after my meeting with them management is reexamining the arrangements for deliveries in these business areas and that they are aiming to effect significant improvements which will begin to show in the next couple of weeks.  I have told the company that I expect such improvements to be seen within that time frame.</P>
    <P>We must all keep in mind the fact that what is being attempted in An Post is a massive overhaul and reorganisation of practices and the introdution of up-to-the-minute technology in an area that was without change for so long.  The company, in making these changes, has set out to effect significant cost savings in operations while maintaining the quality of service the public has come to expect.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to An Post, however, that I am concerned that the new arrangements are taking so long to become fully effective but they have assured me that both managment and staff ar doing all they can to return to the pre-January 1994 standards.  That this is taking longer than anticipated is a matter for regret but I am prepared to give all concerned a further short breathing space to allow the new arrangements to measure up to what the public requires and is entitled to receive.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Hogan for the assiduous way in which he pursued this issue.  Did the Minister look behind the statistics?  The current level of provinces to Dublin post is 84 per cent next <Col N="1869" /> day deliveries but is he aware that An Post reject 50 per cent of letters as wrongly addressed and these letters are not used in this percentage?  Is he aware that there are particular problems in the Dublin 1 and 2 areas?  They receive their post many hours later than is the norm. Was there an element of mismanagement in the way this was done, particularly at a time when An Post laid off 100 part-time workers and have plans to lay them all off?  Would he agree that something went wrong when we have people on the dole and a hopeless system?</P>

      <P>This has come about as a result of the most comprehensive overhaul in the delivery of the postal services in the history of An Post in order to ensure its viability and competitiveness. Sincere and detailed negotiations were carried on.  There are difficulties but these are being tackled.  The company is a commercial semi-State body and has to make its way in the world.  We want to ensure that we provide a quality service that is competitive.  That is the mission given to the company and it is carrying it out reasonably successfully.  I acknowledge there are difficulties and I discussed these issues with management.  They are being addressed.  Specific measures are being taken in the problem areas that exist.  In mid-April we will have the usual high standard of service we have come to expect from this company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's optimism that in two or three weeks time everything will be all right and we will be back to the pre-Christmas 1993 service.  That commitment was given by An Post management three months ago and we are still waiting for a good service. The amount spent on improving this service was £20 million but we have a worse service.  That is unacceptable and something should be done about it.  It is gross mismanagement.  Will the Minister ask An Post for clarification about the problem of incorrectly addressed envelopes and the technological difficulties in dealing with this and handwritten envelopes? I understand there is a major problem with the new technology.  Business is suffering. Many companies get post in the morning rather than the afternoon.  Costs have risen and jobs are at risk.  Will the Minister have a hands-on approach to ensure that the commitments given will be honoured at the earliest opportunity?</P>

These arrangements emanated not only from discussions with me but from staff who are anxious to ensure the quality of the service.

      <P>It is.  I accept there are outstanding areas which are causing problems.  When we look at the level of change which has been implemented in An Post to the credit of all concerned who are interested in providing the quality of service which not only we but they as a professional company aspire to, we must acknowledge there will be teething problems. The outstanding issues are being <Col N="1871" /> addressed and it should be left to the management and staff of An Post to do so.  Following my discussions, I am confident that we will get back to the pre-Christmas service we had and that the company's competitiveness will ensure them a viable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that prior to the coming into being of the reorganised postal system many members of the public expressed concern to An Post that the new system would not be efficient and An Post dismissed these concerns?  Did he inquire as to why they did not anticipate the difficulties which have arisen, why they did not make the appropriate arrangements regarding the training of staff, have a trial of the equipment and so on?  Why have we ended up with this mitigated disaster where one in every six letters posted outside Dublin does not arrive on time and one in every ten letters posted in Dublin does not arrive in time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The changes in work practices which will make the company more competitive have been agreed and negotiated by management and staff in good faith.  The change from Sheriff Street to the mail centre was a major move which had to be done in one go.  That was negotiated and agreed.  In fairness we must allow that the judgment of those involved in this matter will be better than ours. They acknowledged that some of the difficulties they anticipated are more prolonged than expected.  They are addressing the issues.  The upfront way that was reported and the fact that we have external audits from the MRBI as to the position is an indication that An Post is anxious to have satisfied customers, not dissatisfied ones.</P>

      <P>The Minister will forgive me for mentioning a personal experience I had with the new postal delivery system. A letter posted in Andrew Street Post Office, less than half a mile away, on 13 February last was delivered to me in Leinster House five weeks later.  On the envelope my name was written in English and the address was as follows, Leinster House, Dáil Éireann, Baile Átha Cliath. The new optical reading system seems to have difficulty sorting addresses in two languages.  Will the Minister give an undertaking that the new optical reading equipment, is a computer based system, will be able to deal with Irish as well as English?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has given one example.  I am not disputing the incident but in the context of the number of letters being delivered in the city and throughout the country it represents only .000001 per cent.  What is required is that we acknowledge the issue, address the problems and do what is necessary to resolve them.</P>
      <P>As a result of meetings with An Post, and between management and staff the work is in train and they should be allowed to get on with solving the problems.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be willing to take questions again after the next survey has been conducted by MRBI?  Will he ensure that the next MRBI survey includes a question on satisfaction rating by customers and that it refers to what happens to letters posted and not just the letters An Post deems to be correctly addressed and on which they are measuring their performance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will accept the MRBI surveys are scientific and independent. The convulsions on the Opposition benches when they heard they were on 17 per cent in the opinion polls would indicate they believe the MRBI surveys.</P>

      <P>I am trying to return the flippancy of the earlier remark.  Deputy Bruton is not known for his emotion and it is not correct to say there is mayhem in the system.  There are difficulties, but they are being dealt with.  The present situation is not satisfactory and will not be from the company or staffs point of view until they have achieved 95 per cent first day deliveries.  They are heading towards that and the surveys show that steady improvement.  However, it is taking longer than anticipated and extra measures are being taken to resolve the difficulties.  I hope that by the next time I answer questions, the matter will have been resolved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 13, 25, 29 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>In December 1992, Coopers &amp; Lybrand reported on proposals to restructure the electricity industry.  This report contains information of a commercially sensitive nature, and I do not consider it appropriate to publish it.</P>
      <P>In May 1993, the Government decided on the restructuring of the ESB, and I am now in the process of selecting consultants to advise me regarding the detailed implementation of this decision. In broad terms, this will include the new regulatory arrangements, drafting of licences and agreements, requirement for new legislation and advice on the arrangements for the future control and monitoring of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also recently announced a cost and competitiveness review of the ESB, to be carried out by the ESB management and trade unions, assisted by consultants. Officials in my Department will participate in the management of this review, and will obtain independent expert advice as required.  This review will examine how ESB operations compare with best international practice, and <Col N="1875" /> will serve to inform the Government in its assessment of the need for a price increase and on the appropriateness of the ESB's proposed capital expenditure programme.</P>
    <P>The international management consultants, McKinseys, who are thoroughly familiar with the company, will undertake the bulk of the work.  Other consultants are being selected to advise on certain technical matters.  I expect that the review will be completed by the middle of the year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of additional generating capacity, options in this area are under review, and is a matter for decision by the Government in the light of future generation requirements. The ESB does not have a monopoly on the generation of electricity, and there are numerous private generators of electricity. However, the ESB does have a monopoly on the sale of electricity to consumers, and, as part of the restructuring of the electricity sector, the Government has decided that this monopoly should end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate what discussions are taking place between management, unions and the Department on the future of electricity generation and distribution?  As there is 33 per cent over capacity in the generation of electricity, will the Minister indicate if he is open to suggestions of a strategic alliance or partial privatisation of the generation and distribution of electricity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's last point is not an issue.  The cost and competitiveness review group began its deliberations in the past week or two.  We have agreed to participate in the joint management of a review of the ESB's cost and the study will be carried out by a cost review working group, comprising ESB management and trade unions assisted by McKinseys, who are already very familiar with the company.  The selection of consultants to advise the Department's officials on matters that <Col N="1876" /> may arise in the course of the review is under way.  The Department's participation in the management of the review will enable me to reassure the Government that the cost review has examined all relevant matters in an impartial and objective manner and that its conclusions are soundly based.</P>
      <P>The ESB management and group of unions have agreed to examine all aspects of the ESB's operations including the utilisation of existing assets, a capital investment programme, operating expenditure, financial charges and social levies.  The Government has been informed of the co-operative approach being taken in this review which should greatly facilitate the implementation of any improvements that are identified. This approach is in line with the recommendations of the committee on the review of relationships in the ESB chaired by Mr. Peter Cassells, General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is expected that the review will be completed by the middle of the year.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that he has had on his desk for almost two years an application from the ESB for an increase in prices of about 3.5 per cent per annum?  Is the cost effectiveness study which has commenced an excuse to postpone the increase in ESB prices until after the European election and an excuse on which to hang the dismantling of the ESB arising from the liberalisation of the market by the European Union?</P>

Perhaps Deputy Gilmore is disappointed that there is full recognition in all sections of the company to have the cost and competitiveness review to fulfil its mission statement and everybody is facilitating it.  It is simply an exercise in social partnership with which I concur. The issue of selling part of the ESB does not arise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Culliton report, the Moriarty report and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> highlight the need to minimise the cost of energy to create the maximum number of jobs in the economy.  This has <Col N="1878" /> been acknowledged by everyone involved in the electricity generating industry, if not by the Deputy.  We have to consider all the options.

Shortly we will commence the tendering process for a contract to supply 75 megawatts of electricity using renewable energy sources. As the Deputy said, these are environmentally friendly.  While they will never take over from traditional sources they will have a role in electricity generation. This matter is of interest to the European Commission.</P>

      <P>There are two private notice questions to the Minister for Finance on the Government's intentions to tax unemployment benefit. I understand the Minister proposes to take them together.  I call on the Members concerned to put their questions in the following order: Deputy Allen and Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance in view of the fact that taxation of short-term unemployment benefit becomes operational on 6 April 1994 if he will make a statement on the comments <Col N="1879" /> of the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare that the Government is reconsidering the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the position regarding the proposal to tax unemployment benefit from next week in view of the reported statement of the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare that the matter was being reviewed; if it is intended to proceed with this measure from 6 April 1994; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these questions together. I thank the Deputies for giving me an opportunity to deal with this matter. Detailed arrangements are in course of finalisation for making unemployment benefit payments reckonable as income for tax purposes.  A number of categories of persons are in receipt of unemployment benefit.  While the principle of making such payments reckonable for tax purposes will apply equally to all concerned, the various groups will be affected in different ways in terms of the timing and the method of application. This aspect is under review in the finalisation of the arrangements so that no undue hardship arises.</P>
      <P>Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1992, provided for the treatment as income for tax purposes of certain short-term social welfare benefits.  These are disability benefit, injury benefit, unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit.  The section can come into operation generally or in relation to specific benefits or categories of recipients of benefits on such day or days as may be fixed by the Minister for Finance by order.  Prior to such an order being made it is required that a draft of the order be laid before Dáil Éireann and a resolution approving of the draft be passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>A commencement order of 10 March 1993, brought the section into operation with effect from 6 April 1993, in respect of disability benefit and injury benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> As I announced in the Budget Statement, I intend to bring the section into operation with effect from 6 April 1994, in respect of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit.  An order to this effect was approved in the Dáil on 2 February 1994.</P>
    <P>Making these benefits reckonable as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  The reason for treating unemployment and pay-related benefit as income for tax purposes is merely to treat people in similar circumstances, with similar amounts of incomes in a tax year, in the same way.  It is to ensure that for two people in similar circumstances having the same level of income, one does not pay less tax than the other simply because one person's income contains unemployment benefit and the other person's does not.</P>
    <P>The extent to which taxation will actually arise in a given case as a result of this change will, of course, depend essentially on the amount of other income that the recipient of unemployment benefit or the recipient's spouse has in the same tax year.  I again draw attention, in this context, to a paper entitled <i>Income Tax and Welfare Reforms</i> published by the ESRI in 1991.  As I indicated when the commencement order on the taxation of disability benefit was being discussed last year, the ESRI paper demonstrated the flaw in the argument that taxation of short-term social welfare benefits would impact unfairly on those on low income. The study found that most of the benefit from the non-taxation of certain short term benefits, including unemployment benefit, went to those on higher incomes. In particular it found that 70 per cent of those tax units affected by the taxation of short-term benefits are in the upper half of the income distribution range and that in removing the exemption less than one in ten of those affected would be in the lower income ranges.  These figures are based on a study carried out in 1987; the increases in the income tax exemption limits since then and the introduction of substantial child additions to them should mean that the effect on the lower income groups would be even less now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" /> The change to making short-term social welfare benefits, including unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit, reckonable as income for tax purposes has been recommended by a number of groups, including the Commission on Taxation, the Commission on Social Welfare, the National Economic and Social Council, and the Industrial Policy Review Group, that is Culliton.  The change now being made should ensure that persons are not better off because a portion of their annual income arises from unemployment benefit than they would be if the same overall income arose from being employed.</P>
    <P>A number of other PRSI benefits are already reckonable as income for tax purposes. These include, for example, invalidity pensions, disability benefit, injury benefit, retirement pensions, widows pensions and old age pensions.</P>
    <P>An interim taxation arrangement will be operated by the Revenue Commissioners. The interim system will involve the Department of Social Welfare continuing to pay unemployment and pay-related benefit gross, that is, without deduction of income tax.  Any tax due in respect of the benefit will be collected essentially through Revenue restricting tax refunds to take account of any unemployment and pay-related benefit received.</P>
    <P>I will indicate how the proposed arrangements will operate in practice in some situations.  Where a person ceases work during the tax year and goes on unemployment benefit, he or she will continue to claim refunds of tax previously paid in the tax year from Revenue at four-weekly intervals as at present. However, Revenue will take the same amount of unemployment and pay-related benefit which the person has received into account in computing the amount of any refund due.  If the person's weekly receipt of benefit is less than the weekly tax free allowance, some tax refund, but at a reduced level, will still be due.  If the benefit received is greater than the person's weekly tax free allowance, no tax refund would be due in <Col N="1882" /> future.  If a person has paid no tax since the beginning of the tax year the question of a refund would not arise.</P>
    <P>When a person resumes employment, or takes up employment for the first time during the tax year having been on unemployment benefit, the following arrangement will apply: where the person's unemployment and pay-related benefit is less than the weekly tax free allowance, Revenue will instruct that the cumulative basis of PAYE will be operated in the employment with the unemployment and pay-related benefit being taken into account.  The operation of the cumulative basis will give the employee immediate benefit of any unused tax free allowances for the period of unemployment in the tax year which are not required to cover the unemployment and pay-related benefit. Where the person's unemployment and pay-related benefit is greater than the weekly tax free allowance, the benefit received will not be taken into account on resuming or taking up employment for the first time in the tax year. However, the employer will be instructed by Revenue to operate the non-cumulative basis of PAYE which is generally known to workers as the week one basis, in respect of the person's further taxation. Normal cumulative PAYE takes account of the employee's cumulative tax position from the beginning of the tax year to the pay week being dealt with. The week one non-cumulative PAYE, on the other hand, looks only at the employee's tax position in the week being dealt with.  In this instance week one will, to prevent possible hardship to the employee, prevent collection of the undercharge which has arisen because the benefit was greater than the tax free allowance.  It will also deny the person any access to the tax free allowances for the period of unemployment, thereby preserving such tax free allowances to be offset against any tax due on the unemployment and pay-related benefit received.</P>
    <P>The arrangements I have outlined are those which will apply in the great majority of straightforward cases.  In non-straightforward cases, where the <Col N="1883" /> employee does not permanently cease work with the employer but is in receipt of benefit, for example, where there are systematic short-time workers, alternative arrangements will be adopted and although the principle of making unemployment benefit payments reckonable for tax purposes will apply equally to all concerned, it will be appreciated in the light of the foregoing that the various groups will be affected in different ways in terms of the timing and method of application.  This aspect is under review in the finalisation of the arrangements in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this matter was clearly indicated by him over a year ago during the debate on the Finance Bill and that this provision was pushed through the House by a vote of Fianna Fáil and Labour just two months ago?  Will the Minister explain why Minister Burton is at this late hour attempting to mislead the workers in Killarney and throughout the country on this issue? Will he also agree that this provision is a serious financial jolt to tens of thousands of families?  Was it not the case that in addressing the workers in Pretty Polly in Killarney last night the Minister was getting herself out of a tight situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to give the House a detailed reply about what has been worked out since the order was passed in February.  Deputy Allen is correct in saying that this matter was debated last year, that the order was passed in the budget and that the order to implement it was passed a few days after the budget in a separate debate.  That was done to avoid confusion.  Because this was such an important item it was taken in isolation from the budget and passed by resolution.  The Deputy is not correct in saying it was pushed through.  You will recall, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I spoke at length because there were not enough speakers to keep the debate going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that people, regardless of whether they get their week's income from employment, a combination of welfare and employment, or from welfare alone, will pay equal tax. This equity measure has been recommended and has the full support of all parties in this House.  At least three parties supported it on the last vote some weeks ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister now make it clear that taxation on unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit remains in place and that the £30 million which the Minister expects to take in a full year will now still be taken from unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit?  Will he agree it is unfair and unjust that the sick and the unemployed are now paying as much tax as the farming community &mdash; about £50 million a year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Deputy De Rossa's first and second questions is yes, but the answer to his third question is no.  Any anomalies will be carefully dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare.  In the Revenue Commissioners what is under examination is how that will be done as the system is implemented. Deputy De Rossa would agree that it is unfair that a person who works a full week may be only marginally better off <Col N="1885" /> than a person on social welfare.  That is a matter of equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree he is selectively implementing one key provision of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare while ignoring other key provisions on minimum payment to the unemployed and the sick?  Will he guarantee to address those issues soon because about 80,000 people will be affected by this measure on 6 April?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer for the Minister for Social Welfare.  However, I am sure the Deputy will agree that the Government has gone a long way towards implementing the minimum rates of social welfare outlined in the commission's report together with other innovative measures, such as payments to widowers.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's replies, it is obvious why Minister Burton is in hiding; she does not want to face the music after her attempt to mislead people last night on the taxation of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit.  The Minister said that people will not be worse off.  Will he explain in what respects they will not be worse off?  Does he not agree that people who are unemployed, or who become unemployed, will now be paying tax on their unemployment benefit where they previously did not and, therefore, inevitably they will be worse off, and that the people Minister Burton attempted to mislead last night, who are, in the main, short-time or part-time workers, will be particularly worse off because they will now be paying tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>People will not pay tax on their social welfare benefits if they or their spouses are not earning another income and the Deputy is well aware of <Col N="1886" /> that.  He raised this matter on a number of occasions.  In many cases people receiving welfare payments for three days and working for the remainder of the week earn a similar amount to those who work a full week.  Regardless of how income is earned, people will be taxed on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided one is a PAYE worker, the rest get an amnesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If people are employed for five days a week they will pay tax under the PAYE system.  If they are employed for three days and receive welfare payments for the remainder of the week or receive only welfare payments they will be treated equitably.  This House has called for equity in that regard for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As this matter is being debated as a result of comments by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, will the Minister accept it is a classic example of the partners in Government heading in different directions?  The Labour Party vote one way in the House and speak in a different manner in Killarney and elsewhere.  Has the Minister taken steps to clear up the confusion as a result of the remarks by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton?  Did he speak to her since she made those remarks or endeavour to contact her today with a view to making a statement on the matter?  Will the Minister admit that there has been no discussion at Government or Cabinet level regarding a change in focus on this matter and that taxation of short term benefits will proceed per the budget?</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, spoke in the debate passing this resolution and her views are <Col N="1887" /> on the record.  I spoke to the Minister for Social Welfare this morning regarding this matter and the views of both Ministers are in line with what they stated in the House a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>The Government discussed this matter at length on a number of occasions and was careful to take into account the hardships that may be caused in some cases. Tax free allowances will be adjusted, refunds will be made and collection methods altered to avoid undue hardship. As in the case of disability benefit last year, in conjunction with various interest groups the Government will continue to monitor the anomalies which may lead to undue hardship in the early weeks of the new system.  We will endeavour to deal with such anomalies, if they arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this measure will have particular adverse effects in a county such as Kerry which depends so much on the tourism industry?  More than 7,000 people are seasonally employed in that industry and more than 1,000 people are on short term work in two of the largest factories there, Pretty Polly and Stelrad in Listowel.  Will the Minister agree this measure will be a major disincentive for people working in the tourism industry when their spouses are working in other jobs?  It may lead to a scarcity of people to service the tourism industry next summer.  That is the information I am receiving from tourist centres in County Kerry.</P>

All income will <Col N="1888" /> be taxable regardless of how it is obtained and the various anomalies that may arise were examined and outlined in detail today.  Many part-time workers have been in contact with Revenue during the past number of weeks and have received their tax free allowances.  This is a follow on to the number of changes which have been made in the past few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked about treating everybody equally.  This regulation will come into effect on 6 April and will take in revenue of £36 million while the concession in the budget in respect of the carer's allowance, which will cost only a few hundred thousand pounds to implement, will not come into effect until the end of July.  Does the Minister consider it equitable to take in revenue but not to pay it out to a deserving area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While this measure has upset some Members, it will ensure that in the case of two people earning a similar <Col N="1889" /> level of income one will not pay less tax than the other simply because one income comprises unemployment benefit.

      <P>The Minister is talking utter nonsense.  On the one hand, he is arguing for the treatment of all income in the same way, but all income is not treated in a similar fashion.  The income I receive as a Deputy is not treated in the same way as a similar income earned by a person outside this House.  Different allowances and rules apply to our tax.  Also, the self-employed and farmers are treated in a different fashion.  There is also the case of the tax amnesty, where income was earned but no tax paid.  For the Minister to argue that he is being fair by being unfair to the unemployed is a gross distortion of reality.  He already admits that at least 10 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The Minister conceded that where two or more referenda are held on the same day the heading of the referendum will be inserted on the ballot paper.  In the past confusion has arisen where more than one referendum has been held on the same day.</P>
    <P>On 25 November 1992 three referenda were put to the people, namely, the Twelfth Amendment, the Thirteenth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1992, and a general election.  Four ballot papers were handed to people on that day.  It is important that in future referenda the subject of the referendum should be clearly stated on the ballot paper.  That is why I am anxious that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be replaced by the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. The wording on the polling card sent to each elector before that election stated:</P>
    <P>You may vote at the Referenda on three proposals:</P>
    <P>White Ballot Paper &mdash; Right to Life</P>
    <P>The Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992 proposes to amend Article 40 of the Constitution by the addition of the text here following to subsection 3º of section 3 thereof:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The white ballot paper contained similar wording to that on the polling card.  The heading on that ballot paper caused confusion for the electorate.  The holding of three referenda and a general election on the same day also gave rise to confusion. There were three different ballot papers, namely, a white ballot paper for the Twelfth Amendment, a green paper for <Col N="1930" /> the Thirteenth Amendment and a pink paper for the Fourteenth Amendment. When votes were counted for the white ballot paper the total number of votes cast in favour of the proposal was 572,177 and against 1,079,297 &mdash; the proposal was lost by a 2:1 majority.  People who campaigned for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on that occasion were diametrically opposed in their objectives.  The unclear heading and explanation on the white ballot paper was partly responsible for the result in that case.</P>
    <P>The November 1992 referenda on the amendments to the Constitution were held because the Government of the day did not get matters right in 1983.  Following the X case in 1992 there was a rushed referendum and because matters were not spelt out the Government got matters wrong.  The 1993 amendment to the Constitution was an attempt to prohibit unlawful abortion as set out in the 1861 Act.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of west Galway the votes in respect of the referendum on the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1992, resulted in 15,557 voting in favour and 31,337 voting against it &mdash; a 2:1 majority against it &mdash; the highest vote recorded.</P>
    <P>The highest percentage of votes was in Longford-Roscommon, the Taoiseach's constituency, where 16,155 people voted in favour of the proposal and 25,701 voted against it.  The highest recorded spoiled vote, 3,390 in that constituency and the second highest 3,163 in my constituency was simply because people, either deliberately or due to failure to understand the ballot paper, refused to vote or spoiled it.  The Minister should clearly spell out on Committee Stage what exactly will be put on the ballot paper.  On the occasion to which I referred people were not clear as to what they were voting on, as was evidenced by the result of that election.  On that day the vote on the green paper was carried by 1,035,308 as against 624,000 and the vote on the pink paper was carried by 992,000 as against 665,000.  It is clear that there was much confusion in that referendum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> There is provision for the transfer of votes.  A person employed by a local returning officer may be authorised to vote at the polling station at which he or she is employed, even if that is outside his or her constituency.  That is a welcome provision for a referendum because people working at polling booths outside their voting areas were always deprived of the opportunity to vote in a referendum. I welcome the provision on eligibility of invalids or people in wheel-chairs to vote at polling booths other than their local polling booths.  This is very sensible because very often people were discriminated against due to lack of access to polling stations.</P>
    <P>I will table amendments on Committee Stage.  This Bill is generally a tidying up measure and concern about referenda, particularly on amendments to the Constitution, should be dealt with, and in so far as this Bill is a step in that direction, I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for an opportunity to speak on this Bill which tidies up legislation that has stood the test of time, in some respects for the best part of half a century.  Deputy McCormack made a significant point about the statement for the information of voters issued at the time of a constitutional referendum as under section 23 of this Bill. I voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the referendum on what was called the substantive issue and Deputy McCormack, from his public utterances on the matter, probably voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; also, but from a different perspective. I agree with Deputy McCormack that the information furnished to voters on that day caused considerable confusion on both sides so that it probably did not make a great difference to the outcome of the vote which was decisive. However, it raises the issue of whether it is open to a majority in both Houses of this Parliament to issue to the people a statement about the effect of a proposed amendment to the Constitution, which is manifestly false or so propagandist and distorting of the issues in question as to be gravely misleading.  I <Col N="1932" /> note that in this Bill one might think one of the grounds for a referendum petition was that the Houses of the Oireachtas in issuing a statement to the voters had misled them and that 51 per cent of each House of the Oireachtas had put before the electorate a deeply misleading account of what the referendum was about and the effect of the proposed change.</P>
      <P>The Tolerance for the West Referendum held in 1968 was couched in terms of tolerance.  People from the east may think there was nothing tolerant about it, that it was just a blatant effort to water down the principle of one person, one vote.  However, I envisage a circumstance in which 51 per cent of Deputies decided to put a blatantly propagandist and extremely argumentative statement for the information of voters into circulation which was misleading to voters and which created false fears or expectations of a referendum. There should be provision for that issue to be the subject matter of petition after the election so that there is some sanction on a majority not to change the Constitution in an underhand or misleading way, or alternatively, the terms of the section 23 notice should be capable of being reviewed as, for instance, in the case of the validity of a nomination in a presidential election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In presidential elections a judge appointed by the President of the High Court, or perhaps the President of the High Court, must adjudicate on the validity of nominations for the position of President.  There should be provision for a significant number of Members of this House &mdash; perhaps ten or 15 &mdash; to rule on the validity of nominations in the context of a referendum and to argue that the statement of information is misleading. A preliminary ruling should be made by a person independent of the majority in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I accept, as Deputy McCormack said, that it would be possible for 51 per cent of the people in this House and in the Seanad to compile a deeply misleading but apparently authoritative statement in which the argument is seriously distorted and the issues <Col N="1933" /> implicit in a constitutional amendment completely ignored.</P>
    <P>In so far as these statements are made, they should be relatively neutral, seen to be neutral and capable of being reviewed before the result if someone points to an aspect of the referendum and says there is potential for serious misrepresentation because of the choice of wording agreed by a majority of each House of the Oireachtas under section 23.</P>
    <P>Section 23 states that a statement on the subject of the referendum will be for the information of voters.  However, as we all know information is one thing while argumentation is another.  In that context some mechanism should be built into our law to prevent information turning into misinformation or propaganda and to prevent this being circulated at the expense of the State with a view to creating a false impression in the minds of voters.  After all, one would assume that the State is, generally speaking, supposed to be neutral when it comes to the sovereign power, the people, deciding the Constitution of the State, that the State is not entitled to be blatantly partisan in a referendum and that a majority in this House and the Seanad are not entitled to distort the argument for their own ends.</P>
    <P>My next point is probably somewhat obtuse, nonetheless it should be raised. It relates to the provisions in sections 11 and 12 in respect of an ordinary referendum. Most people forget that under Article 27 of the Constitution it is permissible for a majority in the Seanad to petition the President to have a Bill enacted against the wishes of the Seanad referred to the people for their judgment. Article 27.6 states that in every case in which the President decides that a Bill, the subject matter of a petition from the Seanad which is supported by a significant minority of the Dáil and a majority of the Seanad, contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people in regard to it should be ascertained, he or she is obliged to inform the Taoiseach and the chairman of each House accordingly and to decline to sign the Bill or promulgate <Col N="1934" /> it until such time as the will of the people has been ascertained by what is termed in the Bill as an ordinary referendum. Alternatively, a general election may take place within a period of 18 months and the matter will then be decided by a resolution of a majority of the Dáil, thereby obviating the need to have a special referendum on the issue.</P>
    <P>Having looked at Articles 27 and 47 of the Constitution I can find no authority for the proposal in section 12 &mdash; I am not certain I am correct &mdash; that where the Taoiseach is informed in accordance with Article 27 of the Constitution that the President has decided that a Bill to which that Article applies contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained and &mdash; this is the curious proposal &mdash; the Government determines that a referendum for the purposes of ascertaining the will of the people on the proposal shall be taken, the Minister shall appoint the day on which the referendum will be held.  I cannot see in the Constitution &mdash; I will be glad to be enlightened if I am wrong &mdash; any role for the Government in deciding whether the matter should be put to the people.  The Bill could be a Private Members' Bill which has been put through against the wishes of the Government.  I cannot see anything in the Constitution to suggest that the Government should be the deciding body on the holding of a referendum. I suspect it should not.  If I am wrong I will be glad to be enlightened, but I do not understand why the Government is being given this statutory role.  I wonder if it is wise for this House to surrender to the Government the decision as to whether a referendum should be held in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>This issue is highly unlikely to cause major controversy because the chances of the Seanad holding a different view from this House are very remote. However, if the Seanad was to petition the President who decided that a Bill should not be signed without putting the matter to the people by way of a referendum, it should not be a matter for the Government thereafter, under the <Col N="1935" /> Constitution at any rate, to decide whether the matter should be put to a referendum: I imagine it is primarily a matter for both Houses of the Oireachtas rather than the Government which may be hostile to a Bill.  Will the Minister say why the Government is given a role under section 12 (1) (b) in deciding whether a matter should be put to a referendum? Section 12 (3) states: &ldquo;whenever the Government determines that an ordinary referendum shall be taken ...&rdquo;.  I do not see any justification for confining this matter to the Government.</P>
    <P>On the wider point that this raises, namely, the relationship of the Seanad to this House and the reality &mdash; or unreality &mdash; of the section 27 ordinary referendum proceedings, on occasion some people seem to forget just how unlikely it is, under our constitutional scheme of things, that the Seanad will ever be at variance with the membership of this House for a prolonged period.  This is for the very simple reason that a majority of the Members of this House can determine the manner in which the Seanad is elected &mdash; largely speaking, this is left to law &mdash; and that government would, in the normal course of events, become virtually impossible if the Seanad was hostile to the Government of the day.  If a majority in the Seanad was hostile to the Government, the making of a simple regulation under the Road Traffic Acts, which requires the approval of both Houses, and annulling regulations would become impossible.</P>
    <P>Whereas some people have argued in favour of a bicameral legislature, based on the need to have some kind of constitutional check on an all powerful majority in the Dáil, since the Dáil determines the manner in which the Seanad is elected and which in any event, because of our system of government, is determined largely by delegated legislation through statutory instrument, it is vital to the day to day existence of any Government that it has a majority in the Seanad.  In that context the reality of the section 27 petition procedure for an ordinary referendum is largely theoretical. <Col N="1936" /> It is undemocratic that in most cases delegated legislation requires, under statute, the approval of the Seanad.  As I understand the Constitution, even if the Seanad disagrees with us we are free to legislate against its wishes after a certain period of time unless it can invoke the President's power under Article 27 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>On delegated legislation, the pre-eminent role of this House is not recognised: its role is reduced to an equal role to that of the Seanad and each House is given the right to cancel any regulation and to refuse to revoke any legislation.  From a purely democratic point of view, I wonder in the case of a divergence in view of a lasting and serious kind between this House and the Seanad if it would be proper to permit the Seanad to effectively obstruct the governing of the country.</P>
    <P>I have probably digressed from the terms of this Bill but since it deals with ordinary referenda and there has never been one, I was tempted to be slightly irrelevant by commenting on the reason there has never been an ordinary referendum, that is, the Seanad must, of necessity, be kept under the political control of the Government of the day.  Otherwise there would be, as Lord Denning said in a different context, an appalling vista from the point of view of governing the country.</P>
    <P>A second issue that arises in this Bill is the entitlement of people to vote in referenda.  I am pleased that at long last some sense is beginning to trickle into the debate as to who may vote in an election.  For decades if one's name disappeared from the register for no good reason and through no fault of one's own, that was just too bad.  Now, within a specified period of the calling of an election or a referendum, one can prove one's name ought to be on the register and that one lived in a place which would entitle one to a vote at the requisite time.  That is a great improvement.</P>
    <P>Citizens who are abroad are, in certain circumstances, afforded a vote.  Military personnel on UN duty and members of the Garda are afforded postal votes in general elections and referenda.  Diplomats, <Col N="1937" /> I understand, are afforded a similar concession but citizens who are abroad, generally speaking, are not entitled to vote in referenda.  I wonder why somebody who is a citizen of this State and who, according to the Constitution, has certain duties by virtue of that, is deprived of his or her right to vote in a referendum of great significance to that State.</P>
    <P>We should remind ourselves that fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental political duties of all citizens.  That is not a geographical concept; it is laid out in Article 9.2 of the Constitution.  I do not see why the State commands the loyalty and demands the fidelity of somebody who is temporarily or, for a number of years, absent abroad while, at the same time, when it comes to changing the nature of the State by a constitutional referendum, changing its Government or electing a president, that person may have no say.  Why do we regard citizens' obligations to the State as enduring, irrespective of whether they reside within the State for any given period but, at the same time, regard the analogous entitlement to a say in how a democracy is operated, suspended by reason of their absence from the State?</P>
    <P>Deputy McCormack would agree many people who work all week in England come home when they can afford to, by aeroplane to Knock Airport, to other areas in the west of Ireland, and to Dublin, at the weekends.  Because of our practice of holding referenda and elections on Wednesdays and Thursdays, those people never get an opportunity to vote.  It is unreasonable to suggest they must spend several hundred pounds to return to Ireland and to their workplace. It is also unreasonable to require them to travel, having arrived in Knock Airport, for another hour or two to get to a polling station.  That is quite impractical.</P>
    <P>People who are entitled to be considered as resident here at weekends, if not ordinarily resident during the working week, should be accommodated in our voting system.  Likewise, someone who works abroad for periods of six months or one year at a time, or somebody <Col N="1938" /> who, for instance, has decided to do voluntary work overseas with one of the voluntary agencies, should not be expected to cash in his democratic chips when he leaves this country simply because it is too much trouble to allow him to vote.</P>
    <P>The Constitution states that seats must be apportioned in accordance with population. Two issues apply here.  That requirement does not necessarily apply in presidential elections and in referenda because in those circumstances, the fact that people hail from one part of the country or another is utterly immaterial. If one is a citizen I see no reason why one cannot vote for the President or in a referendum to amend the Constitution, regardless of where one is in the world.  I suppose an ordinary referendum would be governed by the same principle.</P>
    <P>There is a worthwhile distinction to be drawn between what people believe the Constitution says and what it actually says about the apportionment of seats. All it requires is that seats should be distributed fairly and evenly in accordance with the Constitution.  It does not say that necessarily has any clear and unambiguous connection with the number of voters per Dáil seat.  In the west of Ireland where there is much emigration and fewer families for instance, the number of voters per Dáil seat is higher than in somewhere like Deputy Harney's constituency of Dublin West, where many young families are included for the purposes of handing out seats but cannot express a view because they are not 18 years of age on polling day.  There is no direct and unbreakable link between the number of people who can vote in an election and the number of seats in the constituency.  There is only a necessary constitutional linkage between the population of that constituency, as determined by a census, and the number of seats which can be filled for it.  In that context, those who say there is some constitutional problem with affording people overseas a right to vote miss the point that there is already an in-built flexibility in the way in which we allocate seats at the moment, that there is not a necessity <Col N="1939" /> to allocate Dáil seats strictly by reference to the number of votes that can be cast and that it applies to population only.</P>
    <P>When one takes the view that population is the determinant of entitlement to Dáil seats, one does not have to say that numbers of voters is the entitlement. It is perfectly reasonable, therefore, for emigrants or citizens abroad to cast their ballot in a Mayo election, if they originate from Mayo, without breaching the spirit of the Constitution or, indeed, its letter. I say that in the context of Dáil elections, because people have challenged the capacity of the Oireachtas to confer the franchise on citizens who live abroad. There is such a right, and some day citizens who live abroad will bring an action in our courts &mdash; I am not looking for the case &mdash; to say they are unfairly deprived of their right to vote in Irish elections on grounds of so-called theory when in fact what we are dealing with is practicality. In this electronic age, it should be possible for people to vote without too much difficulty in Dáil elections and referenda, if they are Irish citizens and are otherwise entitled to vote, irrespective of where they may be in the world on election day.</P>
    <P>I know some people take the view &mdash; no taxation without representation and no representation without taxation, but I do not think that is fair if the State demands of all its citizens fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.  If the very nature of the State itself can change by way of a constitutional referendum, it seems to me that the idea of owing it loyalty, without having a right to be consulted about it, is inherently self-contradictory.</P>
    <P>Having being around the Houses on those two issues, of course my party has no objection to this Bill and supports the codification and modernisation of the referendum procedure.  One tiny, last footnote that annoyed me was the provision in the three constitutional referenda on the pro-life issue, or whatever one wants to call it &mdash; right to information, right to travel and what was termed the substantive issue &mdash; each referendum <Col N="1940" /> involving Acts to change the Constitution having a sequential number, so that we had the Eleventh, Twelfth and Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Acts.  One of them, refused by the people, dropped out of the order so that we were left with the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution without the Twelfth; there never has been a Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution.  This means we have the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution but not the Twelfth.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the next time we put three separate referenda to the people to amend the Constitution they should carry an internal mechanism so that, if any is not passed, we will close up the numbers.  In fact, this is not the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution but the thirteenth because the Twelfth Amendment failed.  As I said, the next time we approach this issue, whoever decides these matters, should insert a mechanism so that if a series of referenda is held on the same day, and one is not passed the numbers will slip back to make sense rather than have the little vacuum that now exists in our constitutional history.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is about consolidating and updating the law on referenda and is generally welcomed.  It comprises part of the revised electoral programme; we had the Presidential Elections Act, 1993, and in 1992 the Electoral Act, which appear to be part of the Department's overall programme of updating the electoral laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister record the number of referenda held since 1942 &mdash; I think he said the first was held in 1959, when the Constitution was relatively new and there was no public or political demand for any changes within its first 20-odd years.  Since then there have been 16 referenda held over the past <Col N="1941" /> 25 years, the Minister holding that that represented one every 18 months.  That makes it appear rather a lot but, when one remembers that at least three were held on the same day the impression that one is held every 18 months is not valid; they are much less frequent.</P>
    <P>Sometimes people appear to suggest that we should abolish the holding of referenda and draft a totally new Constitution. I am against that theory.  It is better to settle for what we have, even with its imperfections, altering it only in accordance with public demand.</P>
    <P>Many provisions of this Bill represent an endeavour to eliminate procedural differences, leading to a certain co-ordination of the various electoral Acts.  To date, I found it strange that a returning officer could not call for a recount in all constituencies unless some agent or representative on the ground so demanded.  Most electoral results have been fairly clear-cut but the aggregate figure might not necessarily be so clear. I welcome that provision.</P>
    <P>When I first heard about the introduction of this Bill there was mention of the word &ldquo;petition&rdquo; from which I must admit I took the wrong meaning.  I thought we were introducing some sort of procedure where the public could request a referendum.  However, I accept that I was misled by my interpretation of the word &ldquo;petition&rdquo;.  There is no mention of public input in the provisions of this Bill, which is rather surprising because, in many respects, a referendum represents the ultimate in democracy, that is the direct voice of the people.  In many countries there is a procedure laid down by which the public can demand that a referendum be held on a particular issue.  I am not recommending that we hold one every second Sunday like the Swiss; whether that perception be correct or not, it would appear that the Swiss hold quite a lot of them.  I do not recommend that practice.  Nonetheless, I was surprised to hear mention of the word &ldquo;petition&rdquo; because I thought that was the direction in which we were moving.  After all, we pride ourselves on our democratic system, yet our politicians, now and in <Col N="1942" /> the past, appear to zealously guard not merely the right to hold a referendum but the right to select the actual wording, to decide everything about the referendum, including the decision whether to take it on board.  Even when it has been decided to hold a referendum it appears that political parties do not leave it to the people but rather endeavour to influence its whole direction.</P>
    <P>Traditionally Governments appear to have been wary of holding referenda, probably for the same reason, while Oppositions appear to favour holding them, perhaps endeavouring to trip up the Government of the day.  Why is it that Governments or political parties feel they must adopt a line on any referendum that arises?  Why do they feel they must be identified with it, that they must be seen to be pushing for or against it?  Why can we not just put referenda to the people?  By all means impart the relevant information in a fair manner and let the people decide whether to support it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we should allow that here first and then let the people outside do so.</P>
      <P>To date, whenever a referendum has been held, it would appear that the Government of the day have felt compelled to push it through; if they win, regarding it almost as an endorsement of their policy, not merely on that matter, but of their general economic, social, whatever policy, whereas the Opposition of the day tends to jump on the bandwagon if the Government is defeated in such a referendum.  If the Government is defeated it is regarded as the voice of the people speaking against everything that Government will have done over the preceding two years.  I wish Governments would just hold referenda and let the people decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could talk about the divorce referendum which has been mentioned recently.  For example, there has been talk about some politicians being nervous about it, sensing that the public might <Col N="1943" /> not be as definite in their views as they were some time ago.  Why should there be nervousness one way or the other since the Fianna Fáil-Labour Programme for Government indicated that a referendum on divorce would be held?  I have no problem with that since it represents an expression of the democratic voice of the people but can we not distinguish between holding a referendum and being compelled to convert it into Government policy, encouraging and cajoling the public into voting for or against it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event it would cost money.  I do not know the reason for Governments historically adopting a strong pro-referenda attitude while the Opposition take the opposite view.  I support the idea of holding a referendum &mdash; not merely on the issue of divorce &mdash; whenever a sizeable number want it.  I do not know how we can judge a sizeable number, perhaps it can be done through opinion polls.  Obviously, at present many people want a referendum on divorce and a number would like another referendum on abortion to return to the 1983 position.  Probably a number of people would like a referendum on bail laws and on several other items.  I am not suggesting that we hold a referendum when 100 people or 10 per cent of the population request it but if it is evident that a sizeable number &mdash; 35 per cent to 40 per cent &mdash; want a referendum there should be a procedure whereby Governments allow it to take place.</P>
      <P>In a way it is political arrogance that politicians and Governments feel that the people should decide what is put to them. I am taken aback at that point of view. As I said before I would like to see a system where Governments did not have such a strong view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCormack referred to the wording on the ballot paper.  Certainly there was confusion in 1992 and probably at other times in the past.  The pro-life <Col N="1944" /> people thought there was no confusion surrounding the referendum in 1983, yet ten years later they are told the decision of the people was the opposite to what they thought.  The wording on the ballot paper should always be clear and definite and if it is not it is a reflection on the Government of the day.  I do not know whether some people foresaw fears or dangers down the road but, if so, that was not the general public perception. The people voted in a certain manner believing they were expressing their point of view in a democratic manner.  It is strange that ten years later they are told that when they voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, they should have voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That issue certainly warrants another referendum.  It is clear, therefore, that it is not sufficient to give a summary of the short title on the ballot paper.  The wording of any referendum must be crystal clear so that nobody is confused.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the returning officer.  Those working for the returning officer should be allowed to vote even if they are outside the constituency in which they have a vote.  That facility should be extended to agents authorised by the returning officer to be at the polling station on the day in question.  If the returning officer is making arrangements for his own staff he could also make arrangements for the duly authorised officers.</P>

Bhí gá le athruithe agus tagaim go mór leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Teachta McDowell nuair a d'fháiltigh sé roimh na hathruithe ó thaobh na dtoghchán de.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cinnte, ba dhearmad mór sa chóras toghchánaíochta seo againne gan a bheith in ann vótáil go dtí tar éis an chéad mhí Aibreáin eile muna raibh tú ar an liosta vótála i mí Aibreáin cheana féin.  Dá bhfaighfeá amach i mí na Samhna, mar shampla, nach raibh tú ar an liosta ní raibh rud ar bith go bhféadfá a dhéanamh faoi sin go dtí an bhliain dar gcionn.  Is ioma duine nach raibh in ann vótáil i <Col N="1945" /> dtoghchán mar nach raibh sé ar an liosta vótála ar chúis amháin nó ar chúis eile.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an fhadhb seo á cheartú.  Bhí mé sa Úcráin le seachtain ag breathnú ar thoghcháin ansin.  Is aisteach an rud le rá é go raibh córas anéifeachtach acu siúd le breathnú i ndiaidh na ceiste seo.  Bhí na cláir thoghcháin suas chun dáta acu agus chinntigh sé sin go raibh deis ag gach duine den phobal vótáil sna toghcháin sa tír sin.  Is maith an rud é go bhfuilimidne ag teacht i líne leis an gcineál sin ruda anois.</P>
    <P>Freisin, fáiltím roimh an fhoráil gur féidir le duine ata i mbun bosca vótála, vótáil i mbosca nach bhfuil fiú sa dáilcheantar ina bhfuil siad.  Mar, ar ndóigh, is rud náisiúnta é reifreann cosúil le toghchán Uachtaránachta.  Mar sin cuireann sé áthas orm go bhfuil an soláthar sin sa Bhille.  Tá córas an reifrinn thar a bheith tábhachtach agus ba cheart dúinn é a chaomhnú agus a chosaint mar go bhfuil an daonlathas bunaithe ar an gcóras sin.</P>
    <P>The system of referendum, of referring fundamental decisions to the people, is a pillar of democracy.  Many politicians resist this system, they find it cumbersome and feel it would be better to leave all decisions to parliament.  I am not one of them.  One of the most precious democratic rights of the people is the right to decide fundamental matters of policy by virtue of the fact that all constitutional change has to be referred to them.  Such decisions should not be made by a small elected group of people.</P>
    <P>We have always used a referendum in the context of constitutional change but there is provision in the Constitution, under Article 27, to use the referendum in the case where not less than one-third of the Members of this House and a majority of the Members of Seanad Éireann want to petition the President to have a referendum on a Bill they consider as being of national importance.  As Deputy Ahern stated I see no reason we should be afraid of the people's judgment because we are here to serve them.  This provision of the Constitution could be used to ascertain what the people consider important on any particular subject. <Col N="1946" /> There are subjects which are considered to be of national importance and there are matters of great public concern.  It is good that the people can be consulted on such issues.</P>
    <P>As regards constitutional change, the history of the various referenda show that people know their own minds in these matters.  The result of the first referendum in 1959 showed that the people were able to make what they thought was a discerning decision in that they voted in one direction in the presidential election but refused the advice of the candidate in question in the referendum on the same day.  The minimum number of people who voted in two opposing directions was 133,000 which shows a significant maturity on the part of the populace at large in expressing their will.</P>
    <P>We should not be shy about putting constitutional change to the people.  If the House feels a Bill should be passed but there is a constitutional problem in doing so, the people should be consulted about the matter.  We have often heard it said, particularly in relation to clauses concerning private property on which the courts gave rather strange decisions, that something could not be done because of constitutional difficulties.  This was so regarding compensation in planning cases, etc.  In spite of there being no constitutional change some constitutional problems have disappeared which leaves me in wonderment at the legal mind.  If there was a constitutional problem I cannot understand why constitutional change was not proposed at that time.</P>
    <P>We have had 16 referenda and the people saw fit to reject five.  This shows a mature electorate which knows its own mind.  We should trust the people and accept their verdict.  There was one case where the issue was muddied but, in general, so long as issues are clear the people know their mind and make rational decisions.  When it comes to divorce, if we believe times have changed and the people have changed their minds there is no harm asking them but if, in their wisdom, they give the same answer, we should accept that with good grace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> As a democrat, I am opposed to the concept that we know better than the people when it comes to the Constitution and that if we could only throw away the burden of the Constitution we could do much better for the people.  That is arrogant in the extreme.  If Members do not like Articles in the Constitution they should have the courage to put them before the people one by one.  I am not a person who, for practical rather than sentimental reasons, would favour throwing out one Constitution and replacing it with another.  If such an event occurred all the case law based on constitutional decisions would be set at nought as would the rights secured through Supreme Court interpretations of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not detect any great desire among the people for wholesale change of the Constitution, although there may be clauses in it which people might like to decide on.  Many people cherish the fundamental control imposed on Government and the administration by the Constitution.  There will be a reluctance to make any fundamental change.  If change is being proposed in the future people would prefer if the issues were put before them one by one rather than in a package so that they could give their verdict separately in each case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The fact that it brings into line the various codes of practice in elections is very important as is the fact that we will have a more up to date electoral system.  Any anomalies in the law between the various types of election will be eliminated.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to emigrant voting.  It is technically a more simple matter in the case of presidential elections and referenda.  We would have to look carefully at whether people would vote at polling stations or have a postal vote.  We must ensure that the proportion of postal votes at any time is small in relation to the total number of votes in any election.  I accept that the nature of society has changed and people have greater mobility.  It is more difficult now to define one's place of residence because <Col N="1948" /> there are families where one person is working abroad but comes home at weekends.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the right of people to have a vote in their home place.  People who grew up in rural areas but are domiciled in cities and return every weekend to their home place would prefer to have the option of voting in their home place than in the place where they work and are resident for most of the week.</P>
    <P>As regards Sunday or weekend voting there could be problems with minority religious groups if such change were made.  In summertime there might be serious difficulties with Sunday voting because people like to attend sports events and so on on that day.  It might be worth considering Saturday voting as people would have more opportunity to be at home than on a Wednesday or Thursday.  The tradition of mid-week voting definitely causes problems for people studying away from home.  We should look afresh at setting the day for elections to see if we can come up with a solution that favours the majority.</P>
    <P>The thrust of election legislation should ensure the security of the election from malpractice or cheating and balance that security with providing all citizens with the greatest possible opportunity to vote.  Those two criteria must always be to the forefront when considering election legislation.</P>
    <P>This is one of a series of related Bills which move in that direction.  I welcome it and wish it a speedy passage.  I hope we will continue to see the right of reference to the people as one of our most fundamental democratic rights &mdash; something many other States do not have but would dearly love to have &mdash; as the cornerstone of our people-led open democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Deputies for their contributions and for extending a welcome to this Bill which consolidates existing referendum law.  Deputies raised a number of questions and put forward suggestions and I will try to deal with <Col N="1949" /> them.  Deputies McDowell and McCormack raised questions on section 24, which enables the Minister, with the prior approval of both Houses, to provide for the inclusion of a descriptive heading on referendum ballot papers.  The intention is that such headings could be included where two or more referenda are held on the same day.  The purpose of the headings will simply be to assist electors in distinguishing between the ballot papers.</P>
      <P>The decision on whether to include headings would be ultimately for the Oireachtas on each occasion.  It could not be made obligatory, as Deputy McCormack suggests, because we cannot tell a future Oireachtas what it must do, but the question may be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In a referendum people are voting on the Constitution Bill as passed by both Houses.  The ballot paper must, therefore, present the question quite starkly, and it would be wrong from the constitutional viewpoint, to include any paraphrase or explanatory material on the ballot paper.  The purpose of the heading would simply be to distinguish one paper from the other and it could not attempt to explain the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal formal means of informing electors of the subject matter of the referendum is the statement for the information of voters, referred to in section 23.  Such a statement has been issued at each referendum in the past and it is envisaged that this would continue.  The official methods of informing voters about a proposal to amend the Constitution are: copies of the Bill would be made available free of charge for inspection at every post office and for purchase at a very nominal fee; a statement prescribed by both Houses is put on the polling card and sent to every elector and it is printed on the posters displayed in every polling station.  Deputy Michael McDowell's suggestion that the Houses of the Oireachtas may prescribe a misleading statement is, a bit far fetched and I hope that would not be the case.  In the past such statements have been fully <Col N="1950" /> agreed by all sides in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The question of voting, by emigrants has been debated in this House on at least eight occasions. The political parties have taken different views: from giving full voting rights to emigrants to Fine Gael's suggestion of appointing a Senator to represent emigrants and so on.</P>
      <P>Article 47.3 of the Constitution provides that:</P>
      <P>Every citizen who has the right to vote at an election for Members of Dáil Éireann shall have the right to vote at a Referendum.</P>
      <P>That means that to have a vote in a referendum one must first be entitled to vote in Dáil elections.  It would not be possible in this Bill to extend the vote to any citizen who does not have a vote in elections to the Dáil.  As already indicated on a number of occasions, the legal advice to the Government is that under present constitutional provisions there is only limited scope to grant voting rights to those temporarily absent from the country.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government accepted in principle that there should be constitutional change to give voting rights to emigrants and this issue is being examined and decisions will have to be taken as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of fundamental questions which must be addressed in developing proposals for voting by emigrants.  First there is the question of fairness to resident electors.  Deputy McDowell raised questions on this in his speech.  By almost any test, the standing in relation to the State and its Government of a person living outside the country is different from that of a permanent resident.  This is often referred to as the &ldquo;representation-taxation&rdquo; issue but it is a much wider issue.  Emigrants' circumstances &mdash; jobs, wages, housing, health, welfare and environment are <Col N="1951" /> determined by the laws of the host country, not by ours.  Justice would require that this difference should be reflected in some way in the nature of the representation afforded to emigrants.</P>
    <P>We must make adequate arrangements for the secrecy and security of the ballot if emigrants had a vote.  To permit voting by large numbers of persons, particularly those outside the State, without adequate safeguards could open the way for electoral abuse which could affect the composition of future Dála and Governments.  Suggestions in the Programme for a Partnership Government are being examined by the Department of the Environment along with suggestions by Members and I will report back as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell drew attention to the fact that we now have the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendment to the Constitution but there is no Twelfth amendment. This is a matter to be sorted out by the Attorney General.  I do not know the answer.  Deputy McDowell's solution that some mechanism to deal with that should be included in future Constitutional Amendment Bills may not be possible having regard to article 46.4 which provides that:</P>
    <P>A Bill containing a proposal or proposals for the amendment of this Constitution shall not contain any other proposal.</P>
    <P>I will ask the Attorney General to comment on Deputy McDowell's views but I am not sure we will get an answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern suggested that there should be a procedure whereby non-contentious proposals could be put to the people at the request of a number of electors and that the Government should take a neutral line on the question. I think what he has in mind is a <Col N="1952" /> proposal for Constitutional change.  An initiative along these lines was contained in the 1922 Constitution but it was never used and it was probably inoperable. Fianna Fáil attempted to operate that provision in the 1920s and the Government of the day repealed the provision.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Deputy Ó Cuív mentioned the possibility of Sunday voting.  The Electoral Act, 1992, removed the statutory barrier to voting on a Sunday.  There is no statutory reason an election or referendum should not be held on a Sunday.  It is a matter for decision on each occasion which day should be appointed as polling day.  As the Deputy mentioned, some minority churches would have a difficulty with the concept of voting on a Sunday on the grounds of conscience and the position of these churches must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also mentioned the possibility of Saturday voting.  That would create difficulties for the Jewish community, for instance.  The question of weekend voting can be considered in the future.  I have covered most issues raised and on Committee Stage we can tease out some of the suggestions.</P>

    <Title>Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1994: From the Seanads.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>SECTION 2: In page 3, paragraph (b), lines 14 and 15, &ldquo;or omission&rdquo;, deleted.</P>
      <P>This is a purely technical amendment. On Report Stage we amended section 2 (b) of the Bill in response to an important point raised by Deputy McDowell. This point arose at the last minute and the draftsman had only a short time to prepare the amendment.  At the end of the Report Stage debate Deputy McDowell drew attention to a possible drafting flaw in the 1987 Act and I undertook to look at the matter.</P>
      <P>Since then, the matter has been looked at carefully and discussed with the draftsman and there is a drafting inconsistency which the draftsman considers should be rectified.  Section 2 (b) of the Bill inserts a new subsection (3) (a) in section 3 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987.  In this new subsection (3) (a) as amended on Report Stage reference is made to the act or omission constituting the offence.  Because offences can be, on occasion, committed by an omission, it is standard drafting practice to include a reference to omission.  However, section 1 (2) of the 1987 Act already provides: &ldquo;References in this Act to an act include references to an omission and references to the doing of an act include references to the making of an omission.&rdquo;  As a result, there is no need for the words &ldquo;or omission&rdquo; to be included in subsection (3) (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it now stands the provision, in effect, results in duplication of the reference to omission.  If it is retained in its present form it will result in drafting inconsistencies in the 1987 Act as, for example, the definition of a serious <Col N="1954" /> offence in section 1 of that Act refers to the act constituting the offence without any specific reference to the words &ldquo;or omission&rdquo;.  To avoid such drafting inconsistencies, and as the point is already covered by section 1 (2) of the 1987 Act, the amendment introduced in Seanad Éireann proposes to delete the words &ldquo;or omission&rdquo; from lines 14 and 15 on page 3 of the Bill.</P>

A piece of drafting of mine got such a going over from the Tánaiste last night in the House that I think we should, on occasion, be more considerate about what either side of the House puts before it.  As I will not get into tonight's debate on that Bill, I would say that it was not drafted on the back of an envelope but took a long time to prepare and much hard work to get it right for Private Members' time.

      <P>The irresponsible and divisive nature of sections of the Tánaiste's speech last evening was not helpful to the divorce debate.  A successful referendum campaign, as indicated by recent opinion polls, will require the support of all parties in this House.  To allege that Opposition parties are playing politics with the divorce issue and to threaten them with responsibility for the consequences is not only contemptible in terms of veracity, but helps to create an atmosphere of <Col N="1955" /> recrimination and ill will which, if allowed to continue, will seriously harm the divorce process.  The Tánaiste's speech has credibility only on the basis that the opposition to which he referred was the opposition from his own benches, particularly among Fianna Fáil Deputies none of whom even bothered to come in to listen to his speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
      <P>The introduction of divorce was promised in the Programme for Government and every Government Deputy is committed to it.  Fine Gael is a responsible Opposition and has always been responsible on this issue.  We will do our job as a responsible Opposition and we do not need lessons from anybody.  We will always put the interests of the people above party politics and, whatever the temptation or justification, we will not be drawn into a rancorous divisive point scoring debate which can only do harm to a resolution of this grave problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the Tánaiste's lengthy speech yesterday evening in which he detailed steps the Government intends to take, it was only in one of this morning's newspapers that we learned of the intention of the Department of Equality and Law Reform to spend £500,000 on a major publicity campaign to &ldquo;try to ensure the carrying of the referendum&rdquo;. The Tánaiste did not mention that yesterday evening.  Why not?  This is public money and its expenditure must be carefully scrutinised.  In recent times there have been many publicised examples of wasteful expenditure by PR companies. What safeguards will there be to ensure it will not happen again?  Who will control the direction and thrust of this advertising? If Opposition parties are expected to contribute to the success of the referendum campaign and, as the Tánaiste inferred, be blamed by the Government if it is not successful, should we not be entitled to some say in the formulation <Col N="1956" /> of that advertising?  I will reserve my position on that proposed advertising campaign until I know more about it.</P>
    <P>There was an arrogance in the Tánaiste's speech which I found distasteful and worrying.  We are told that a former Minister for Foreign Affairs insisted on being called Gerard Collins; are we now to have Richard Spring inflicted on us?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange that the Government benches show no further interest in and are trying to collapse this debate because it shows a contempt for this House, its procedures and for what is at hand.  When the Matrimonial Home Bill was introduced in this House, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, stated it was an integral part of the approach of the Government to the divorce issue and a major preparatory step in the process which would lead to a referendum on divorce.  Last night, devoid of political honesty, the Tánaiste said there was no connection between the two; he went so far as to say the two issues were separate &mdash; to coin a phrase, that they were divorced.  He criticised the Opposition for seeing a linkage between the two; when it was the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who sought to create a linkage between the two Bills.</P>
      <P>In many respects this House has been fooled by Government rhetoric on this matter.  We have been asked to believe the Government has a programme of law reform relating to marriage of which the Matrimonial Home Bill was one part and the divorce legislation and the Family Law (Property) Bill was another.</P>
      <P>I regard the Tánaiste's speech last night as not only arrogant, as Deputy Currie stated, but nasty and vindictive in tone. It was devoid of any constructive positive content, it was aimed at point scoring, destructive intent and was couched in terms which were offensive, futile and devoid of legal content.  His remarks were waspish and devoid of legal, political or constitutional import.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is designed to make spouses' non-financial contributions reckonable <Col N="1957" /> by a court in determining who owns the family home and its contents.  As the Tánaiste pointed out in his shallow and rather shabby speech, it would be desirable to achieve that end by legislation and not in the context of a court hearing but, unfortunately, the Supreme Court has ruled on the matter and the question is whether this House will establish rights for stay-at-home spouses who contribute to home-making to have an equitable interest in the family home or this House walks away from that issue.  I have nothing but obloquy and scorn for the miserable attitude adopted by the Tánaiste last night.  His remarks were surprising and disappointing but, as Deputy Harney said in a statement today, they exhibited a level of legal ignorance and political malice which this House has not seen for some time.  Deputy Spring is a lawyer and I will deal with the &ldquo;legal points&rdquo; he tried to make last night.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Bill is a modest measure designed to allow the courts to recognise non-financial contributions by stay-at-home spouses who decided to make their contribution to a family by home-making.  In the majority of cases we are dealing with wives but now, increasingly, we find ourselves dealing with husbands who are in the same position.  Marriage is a partnership and given the economic circumstances of the day there must be some specialisation of function.  One person must stay in the house because it is so difficult to find remunerative employment for one or both spouses.</P>
    <P>In the L <i>v.</i> L case in the High Court, Mr. Justice Barr attempted to recognise that a spouse who, by staying at home and by contributing to the welfare of the family, and by contributing services to the other spouse, the children of the family and the household, created some right in the economic wealth which that family developed in the course of the marriage.  Could anything be more humane or more admirable as a change in our Law?  Mr. Justice Barr made that judgement by reference to the Constitution. He thought there was ample reference in the Constitution to the contribution <Col N="1958" /> of spouses at home.  Notwithstanding the somewhat sexist language of the Constitution he thought there was constitutional recognition for the proposition that at least one of the partners in a family had a function in the home which deserved constitutional legal protection, recognition and validation. When that case came to the Supreme Court it, by a unanimous decision, decided that this was a matter for this House and not for the High Court or the Supreme Court to decide.  If non-financial contributions were to be recognised in developing the concept of joint ownership in equity of a family home, the Supreme Court said that was a matter for this House to decide and it should not be done by judges alone.  That is a perfectly reasonable attitude for the Supreme Court to take.  In the language used by the Supreme Court in the L <i>v.</i> L case there was more than passive acceptance that this House might, in time, grant recognition to non-financial contributions to the ownership of the family home but there was some positive encouragement in the House to introduce legislation to achieve that end.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice in his judgement in the L <i>v.</i> L case stated:</P>
    <P>After careful consideration and with a reluctance arising from the desirable objective and I emphasise the words &ldquo;desirable objective&rdquo; which the principle outlined in the judgement Barr J. would achieve, I conclude that to identify this right in the circumstances set out in this case is not to develop any known principle of the common law, but is rather to identify a brand new right and to secure it to the plaintiff. Unless that is something clearly and unambiguously warranted by the Constitution or made necessary for the protection of either a specified or unspecified right under it, it must constitute legislation and be a usurpation by the courts of the function of the legislature.</P>
    <P>The first thing to note from the Chief Justice's quotation was that the Supreme Court stated it was a desirable objective <Col N="1959" /> and that the second was that they said it was a matter for this Legislature to deal with.  Since that time the Matrimonial Home Bill has been introduced, the only legislation introduced in this area.  When that Bill failed before the Supreme Court the attitude taken by the media, the Government and others was that they had made an effort, they had tried their best, they had tried to bring about a legislative formula which had failed and been rejected by the courts and that was the end of the matter.  This party and Deputies on this side do not accept that proposition and are unanimously of the view that, even in the decision of the Supreme Court on the Matrimonial Home Bill there is plenty of room for improvement and for the advancement of the position of people who contribute to the development of family wealth in a non-financial way.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats' Bill has been characterised in its explanatory memorandum and by the Tánaiste in one of his speeches as a modest measure; in another section he allowed himself the contradictory sentiment that it was neither modest nor protective.  I get the impression that two word processors met somewhere between the Department of Equality and Law Reform and Merrion Street and gave rise to a contradictory and stitched together speech last night but the malice was in both sections and it dripped from both even at the point where they were stitched together.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a modest measure to allow the courts to recognise non-financial contributions by stay-at-home spouses who are home-makers.  At present the only situation in which spouses can hope for relief in relation to the family home asset, from which they are excluded by legal title, is in the context of a judicial separation or by proving that the home-making spouse has made a cash contribution to a family kitty which has been used to meet mortgage repayments, etc.</P>
    <P>It should have been apparent to the Tanaiste, who at one stage in his career was a junior barrister in the Law Library, even with his limited experience of the <Col N="1960" /> law, that there are many other circumstances apart from judicial separation in which a wife might wish to establish equity in the family home.  What are these circumstances?  One is in the context of a succession Act dispute.  A spouse may make the point that by staying at home and allowing her husband to go to work, she is entitled to a share, as of right, in the family home independent of the legal share conferred upon her under the Succession Act.  She might make the point that if she is entitled to a legal share of one-third or one-half, depending on the circumstances, in her husband's estate, half of the home should be attributed to her before that process started.  That is one circumstance in which this Bill would make a significant improvement.</P>
    <P>In many cases individual members of a family, other than husbands and wives, make contributions towards the cost of a family home.  For example, an unmarried son or daughter living in the family home who makes weekly contributions to the mortgage repayments, may make a claim on the family home by virtue of such a contribution.  In those circumstances a wife might say she had made a contribution by staying at home for 25 years to create the circumstances in which the family stayed together, prospered together, and purchased the family home.  It is just and proper for the mother to say that her contribution should be valued by the courts in equity as the cash contributions of one of the children who contributed to the mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>Those are two instances the Tánaiste chose to ignore as if they are exiguous and had no value in this matter.  A person with a legal background who accuses the Opposition of putting forward a Bill, described in choleric and bitter terms as being drafted on the back of an envelope should have thought more deeply about the issue before expressing his intemperate and arrogant views.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said that the existence of a right for a woman or a man to claim an equitable right in the home by virtue of their non-financial contributions would only lead families into litigation.  That is <Col N="1961" /> a false, vacuous and foolish assertion for somebody in his position to make.  If a spouse had to go to court, it would only be because an injustice was being done to that spouse and that he or she was being wrongly denied their fair share in the family assets by reason of the failure of the Legislature to do what the courts invited it to do in the L <i>v.</i> L case, that is, to recognise that there is such a thing as an equity based on family-making contributions of a non-financial kind to the acquisition of family assets.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste was not content with that foolishness.  He went on to say that giving recognition to non-financial contributions could give rise to conveyancing problems but, because he did not have enough time to think about it, he was not in a position to work out what those problems might be.  Anybody who had experience of conveyancing problems would know that too was a hollow and vacuous point because the moment every spouse who has made a financial contribution is entitled, under the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, to go to court and have that right established and vindicated and have the result declared in her favour.  It does not create one problem to conveyancing that such a right exists in relation to financial contributions; it would not add one complication to accord such a right to people who, because they have specialised in family function to a different degree, have made all their contributions in a non-financial way.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats' Bill is a direct response to the implied invitation by the Judiciary in the Supreme Court to alter the law to recognise non-financial contributions.  This is not some whim of ours; the Supreme Court said publicly that a desirable social objective falls to this House to be vindicated and suggested that legislation is the way to achieve this end.  The Labour Party and Fianna Fáil in particular produced one Bill and when it failed because of unanticipated constitutional difficulties they turned their back on the entire project and left the non-financially contributing spouse with nothing.  Having failed with that <Col N="1962" /> approach in the Matrimonial Home Bill, the Government, particularly the Labour Party, has apparently given up attempting to achieve what the Chief Justice referred to as a desirable objective in the context of the L <i>v.</i> L case.</P>
    <P>It was stated here yesterday that this Bill is short and general.  That sounds like a clever point made by somebody who might hold the view that any worthwhile arrangement or change in the law should be long and complex, but a simple idea is best expressed in short terms and general language if it is capable of being implemented.  Of course, the Progressive Democrats' Bill is short.  A general principle does not need to be, and would be ill-served by, a long and detailed legislative measure to implement it.  The Bill proposes to give spouses a right which they can, if necessary, vindicate by litigation. In the vast majority of cases once a light is established, sensible people will, by compromise and by sharing and by a positive attitude towards each other, give effect to it.  What this party says, and what all Opposition parties say, is that non-financial contributions by stay at home spouses who engage in family-making ought to be recognised by the law, and this measure is designed to give them that recognition.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste stated that the present law and the anticipated changes in the Family Law Bill will give that right in cases of separation, but what about other cases?  I mentioned the spouse of a deceased husband or wife who wishes to avail of this principle.  I also mentioned the possibility of conflicting rights among members of the family who were not spouses in which it would be important that the stay-at-home spouse had some protection, but none of these points seem to have lodged in the Tánaiste's mind; quite the reverse.  All these points seem to have escaped him.  I wonder why.</P>
    <P>As a party we would have preferred the formula which was implicit in the Matrimonial Home Bill, that is, that as a matter of law and of legislative rule, every spouse had an entitlement in the family home but once that principle was cast down by the Supreme Court, in the <Col N="1963" /> circumstances of this case, it does not mean the issue is dead; even though the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil give up on it we will not do so.  It is noteworthy that not a single member of Fianna Fáil attended this debate, contributed to it or intends to contribute to it.</P>
    <P>In the context that the Supreme Court has rejected the formula of legislative prescription for families, it follows as a matter of necessity that any other formulation must be general and flexible. Therefore, all the attacks launched by the Tánaiste on this measure last night were missing the point because the virtue of the Bill is that it is flexible and general in its terms.  The question for this House is whether we wish to face up to the issue or whether, as the Tánaiste has done, we should throw our hat at it and fail to legislate in any way within constitutional constraints for what the Chief Justice termed a &ldquo;desirable objective&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Last night the Tánaiste told the House that if the Government was of the view that a ready alternative to the Matrimonial Home Bill was possible it would only be too happy to promote or support such an alternative but the fact was, uncomfortable though it may be, that no such ready alternative existed.  That view is entirely wrong, misconceived, arrogant, selfish and ignorant of the legal possibilities open to this House.</P>
    <P>At one point in his rambling and defensive speech the Tánaiste said that the Bill was neither modest nor protective, while at a later stage he said the Bill was a very modest proposal.  It is not true to suggest that the right to establish an equitable interest in respect of non-financial contributions to the family home would lead to litigation and family breakdown.  In many cases the existence of such a right would encourage spouses to be reasonable with each other.  Such a jurisdiction already exists for financial contributions and it has never, in that context, led to an explosion in litigation.</P>
    <P>He gave a list of silly objections to the Bill, most of which are beneath criticism and a good few of which are beneath contempt.  He asserted that giving the <Col N="1964" /> courts jurisdiction to declare a wife entitled to an equitable share in the family home by virtue of her non-financial contributions could be unconstitutional. That suggestion shows a deep and apparently ingrained difficulty on the part of the Tánaiste to grasp the basics of constitutional law, not to speak of coming to terms with what the Judiciary has said on this subject.</P>
    <P>This Bill is short and simple but it is not as simplistic as the formula of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform turned out to be.  This Bill respects property and family rights, recognises constitutional realities and applies to more than judicial separations and, therefore, deserves consideration.  If the Bill is given a Second Reading it may well be improved upon on later stages.  The Bill is much better than nothing, which is what the Tánaiste has offered this House thus far.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the detailed criticisms of the Bill set out by the Tánaiste in what he aptly termed his contribution to the debate.  He said that this measure would be of very limited use, if any, in a normal marriage.  It is accepted that the Bill will be of less use than the proposals in the Matrimonial Home Bill because it will not apply to every marriage.  In view of the Supreme Court ruling, we still have to deal with the principle of in law a non-financially contributing spouse is entitled to some equitable return on her efforts in building up the family and its assets.</P>
    <P>He went on to suggest &mdash; this may worry Members who place some credence on the legal views expressed by him &mdash; that one of the fundamental problems with the Bill is that it proposes court intervention as the only way in which a spouse who works within the home can obtain a beneficial interest in that home. That is not the case.  The Bill merely says that just as in the case of financial contributions, which the court may declare exist, the court may also declare that non-financial contributions exist. The Bill will merely put in place a background against which most people will judge their behaviour.  Most solicitors advising a couple who have differences <Col N="1965" /> will say, &ldquo;your wife or husband has an interest in the family home even though he or she has not contributed to it and this is something a court will determine for you if push comes to shove&rdquo;.  The suggestion that this Bill invites litigation is entirely false.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said that a striking absence from the Bill was any expressed mention of the main circumstance which presumably gave rise to it, namely, the recognition which should be given to spouses who work by looking after the home or caring for the family.  It was not necessary to do that because the Bill is a carefully crafted legal measure which does not have to engage in florid rhetoric of a legal kind.  He said it could be argued that the Bill as it stands would conflict with the test laid down by the Supreme Court on the Matrimonial Home Bill regarding disproportionate interference. With the greatest of respect, that statement is silly beyond belief.  The only rights which can be declared under this Bill are those declared by members of the Judiciary who, by definition, will not engage in disproportionate interference in family affairs.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste suggested that before any interest could be established expensive court action might be necessary.  That applies to present financial contributions and it is not the cause of any major difficulty. He went on to say that the Bill would only be of relevance where spouses could not agree on such ownership. Spouses will agree on ownership if the law reflects the reality and the justice of the situation.  He criticised the Bill on the grounds that it was short on detail and said it might draw a distinction between different spouses in different situations. He said that a spouse who came to a marriage with the home would not be caught by the terms of this Bill.  Unfortunately, that is part and parcel of the Supreme Court decision on the Matrimonial Home Bill: if a spouse comes to a marriage with an asset already in his or her pocket, so to speak, then one cannot by legislative interference take it from them merely because they have married. He suggested that there would be a difference <Col N="1966" /> in such circumstances between a person who remortgaged their house and someone who never got a mortgage. There would be a difference if one of the spouses was staying at home to allow the other to finance the mortgage on the home.</P>
    <P>He asked if the criteria set out in section 4 were vague.  They are general but they are not vague.  He suggested that there might be discrimination between spouses depending on the length of time they were married.  Of course, there would have to be discrimination by anybody in these circumstances between spouses who were married a week and those who were married a month unless one includes the formula set out in the Minister for Equality and Law Reform's failed Bill, that is, on marriage everyone automatically gets a 50 per cent share in the home.  If one was talking about earning an equitable share by way of contribution, which is what we have been driven to by the Supreme Court decision, the length of the marriage and the extent of the contribution must be taken into account and the court must be given leeway to distinguish between one circumstance and another.  He also made the ludicrous suggestion that the number of children involved might vary the decision in some sense.  I do not believe it would, and anyone who read the L. <i>v.</i> L. case could not have come to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste suggested that in present circumstances the Bill might allow a series of claims to be made in respect of the same matrimonial home.  Under existing law on financial contributions such claims can be made in respect of the same matrimonial home.  People are not as foolish or stupid as the Tánaiste thinks. People do not litigate unnecessarily in these circumstances.  If financial contributions give rise to litigable rights and successive actions can be taken in those circumstances then the same applies to non-financial contributions.</P>
    <P>The measures we have proposed are simple, short, specific, general in application, flexible and adaptable to individual family circumstances.  We <Col N="1967" /> repudiate completely the criticisms offered by the Tánaiste yesterday.  These criticisms were motivated more by a desire to camouflage by a smokescreen his retreat from a worthwhile legislative principle than by any genuinely held and bona fide entertained belief that there is any shortcoming in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>On 7 July 1993 the Minister for Equality and Law Reform came into this House to fulfil a promise.  He stated:</P>
      <P>As the law stands, where the matrimonial home is in the legal ownership of one spouse, the other spouse may acquire an equitable share in its ownership through direct monetary contributions made towards its purchase ... No share of the ownership is earned by non-pecuniary contributions, such as looking after the house and family.  This position was confirmed by the Supreme Court in the case of L <i>v.</i> L, (1992), <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly,</i> page 115.</P>
      <P>This alone is the issue that is being tabled today.  The Minister failed to meet the objectives he set himself.  Spouses, and women in particular, are still at a disadvantage when it comes to ownership of the family home.  It has now fallen to the Opposition to take up the cause on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill proposed.  It is significant that it is being put forward by an Opposition party rather than by the Government.  We must ask why that is the case.  The Joint Programme for Government states clearly that the Government is committed to introducing changes in the short term to enhance women's rights.  Included in those changes promised in the short term is legislation to give each spouse an equal share in the family home and household belongings.  The Government's Matrimonial Home Bill set out to meet this particular proposal.  It introduced the concept of 50-50 ownership as of right to spouses and the Bill was the subject of considerable debate in the Dáil.  I recall <Col N="1968" /> sitting here through many hot days in July debating the minutiae of legal points and putting forward propositions to test them against the proposed legislation. Whatever one can say about that Bill it certainly was not short in general.</P>
    <P>If a woman murdered her husband, for example, did she lose her right of ownership?  If a woman was coerced by her husband to sign over her rights, how would she regain them?  All types of propositions were put forward and debated. The Government and Opposition parties eventually passed the Matrimonial Home Bill and there was general support for it. As we all know, however, as soon as it was tested in the Supreme Court the Bill fell apart, not just a particular clause in it but its fundamental proposition was found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>How can a Government with all the panoply of legal advisers, programme managers, special advisers, the services of the Attorney General and, I am sure, the services of private consultants, as they are needed, get matters so wrong? The debacle of the Matrimonial Home Bill undermined public credibility in the judgement of this Government.  It undermined confidence in its capability to deliver on promises made and that the public accepted in good faith.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Bill to be passed into law was seen rightly as the fault of the Government.  It was seen as a failure to wrestle with the realities of our Constitution in a way that would bring about progress for spouses, and for women in particular.  The print was barely dry on the text when the Bill was thrown out lock, stock and barrel, and the Government ended up with egg on its face. Embarrassment for the Government, however, is of little consequence when compared to the loss experienced by women.</P>
    <P>When the Matrimonial Home Bill was presented to this House the Minister made statements which highlighted its importance.  During Second Stage on 7 July 1993 he stated: &ldquo;This Bill is based on the view that marriage is a partnership which each spouse has an equal role and interest in promoting, enhancing and <Col N="1969" /> safeguarding.  It gives statutory recognition to the contribution that each partner to a marriage can and does make towards the maintenance of the family unit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill was welcomed by Opposition Members who spoke at length on the importance of recognising the contribution made by women in the home.  It followed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown which devoted considerable space to that issue in its 1985 report.  That report stated: &ldquo;A woman working in the home does not become entitled to any interest in the family home simply by reason of the work which she carried out therein as a wife, looking after the home and the family&rdquo;.  It further stated: &ldquo;While the 1976 Act has introduced some element of protection, that protection is by no means complete&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report concluded, &ldquo;that the present system of dealing with matrimonial property is extremely unsatisfactory and effectively discriminates against women since in most marriages the wife is obliged to give up work outside the home&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the Report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, a whole section is devoted to the issue of community property.  The commission clearly recommended joint ownership of the family home but it also extended that principle to joint entitlement of all income, a legal right share of one half of the estate when the other spouse dies intestate, and many other provisions that would protect spouses and ensure equality within the marriage relationship.</P>
    <P>The Government specifically requested the commission to pay special attention to the needs of women in the home.  The commission report pointed out that almost half of all women aged 15 years and over were engaged in home duties and that during the past 20 years the overall proportion of women in the labour force has risen very little.</P>
    <P>While there is a trend among married women to work outside the home there is still a large percentage of women who see their primary role as working in the home.  It must be stated, however, that <Col N="1970" /> working in the home, while perceived by the person who does it as having fundamental importance, is not recognised or acknowledged as having anything but the lowest of status by society at large. One submission to the commission made this point.  It stated:</P>
    <P>What is the full-time housewife categorised as by the State?  A dependant, a type of non-person with absolutely no rights at all.  The full-time housewife has no identity, no self-esteem, and often no money.  Is her work of any value?</P>
    <P>That is the fundamental question that women want answered in the affirmative by this Government.  Is the work of women in the home of any value?</P>
    <P>I followed in disbelief the speech made here by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, last night.  He exposed the real nature of this Government.  He peeled away all the weasel words, the cosy assertions and the pious aspirations.  He came into this House and proceeded to sell out women. In particular, he sold out women in the home.</P>
    <P>He did so by rubbishing an opportunity that is being presented in this Bill which is, in the words of it proposer, a modest proposal, but one that begins to answer the question: is the work of women in the home of any value?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste insulted the genuine desire among women who have kept this country going by their work in the home. He did it with arrogance, with ignorance, and with a cynicism that is hard to stomach from a man who made his reputation out of integrity and a commitment to the principle of equality.  Last night he smashed down the veneer of commitment that the Labour Party has carefully constructed over the years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> The Tánaiste last night talked about divorce.  He began by making the point that this Bill is not directly related to divorce &mdash; in that I agree with him and I believe all Members agree with him.  He went on, however, to speak at length about divorce and the proposed referendum. He stated on a number of occasions that the Government is entirely united behind the divorce referendum. He said the whole Government is united behind &ldquo;that plan&rdquo;&mdash; that plan being the one on course for the referendum.</P>
    <P>I do not believe him.  Nobody believes that the whole Government is united behind the plan that, as has been stated publicy, is leading to the divorce referendum. I do not believe that all the Members on the Government side of the House are in favour of a referendum or the provision of divorce as a civil right. Any Member who can come into this House and try to convince us of that is guilty either of self delusion or is trying to delude the rest of us.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Government is not united, it is split on the issue of divorce and this should be publicly stated.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs turned on the Opposition and tried to blame it for playing politics with the divorce issue, a tactic worthy of the cowardly and the weak. The Tánaiste is getting more support at present from the Opposition Parties on the divorce referendum than from his own side.  To blame the Opposition for the faults of Government is the last resort of the politically bankrupt; when conviction fails and impotence reigns blame the Opposition.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been introduced because of Government bungling.  Those of us who recognise that divorce is a civil right are concerned that the Government is not capable of providing clear leadership through what we all agree will be a difficult referendum.  What is required is clarity of purpose and vision and there was no evidence of either in the Tánaiste's contribution.  I see a man frightened of the difficulties ahead in the <Col N="1972" /> divorce referendum, in particular, the difficulties of the Government's making.</P>
    <P>To have undermined public confidence so easily by making a botch of the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993, is something from which the Tánaiste and his Minister for Equality and Law Reform will not recover easily.  If the Tánaiste had had the wit and imagination to accept the Family Law (Property) Bill he would have done much to repair the damage. Instead of the siege mentality he displayed last evening, he could and should have shown openness.  He should have recognised that women in the home are discriminated against, held in low esteem and not rewarded for their commitment, work and endurance.  If he had it would have gone a long way towards redressing the offence.  However, instead of openness we got retrenchment; instead of enthusiasm we got vitriol; instead of intelligence we got stupidity, and I make no apologies for using the word &ldquo;stupidity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste came into the House last evening and made untrue statements.  For example, he said that a measure like this is of very limited use in a normal marriage. At least he was sufficiently wise not to endeavour to define precisely what &ldquo;normal marriage&rdquo; means.  The explanatory memorandum states that the Supreme Court could not uphold a High Court finding, that the courts could extend the ordinary principles regarding indirect contributions to include non-financial contributions.  There is no ambiguity about that judgement.  The Chief Justice in the L <i>v.</i> L case indicated that he was reluctant to take such a decision because he recognised the desirable objective attached to the principle decided by the High Court but he also made it clear that to find in favour of the High Court decision would be to identify a brand new right, that this was not warranted by the Constitution and, therefore, it would be a usurpation by the courts of the function of the Legislature. Implicit in that statement is a signal to the legislators to bring into law the principle that a wife's contribution should be recognised where it is not financial but <Col N="1973" /> has substance and value of a different kind.  If for no other reason, it enables the husband to go out and make money.</P>
    <P>When the Supreme Court signals a difficulty in this way and a failure of the legislators to deal with providing for a principle the Tánaiste should have jumped at the opportunity to put things right.  He did not, he reacted defensively and out of ignorance.  He quoted section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, but he does not appear to be aware of the Supreme Court decision.  He then went on to compound the error by saying that such a measure is clearly of very limited use, if any, in a normal marriage.</P>
    <P>A women's right to recognition of her contribution is important regardless of whether the marriage is &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.  Marriage is a partnership largely dependent on negotiation.  If the ground rules are that one partner is always at a disadvantage, always having to struggle for equality, then, even in the best marriages, it causes grief, yet the Tanaiste maintained that this measure is of very limited use.  He also said that the Bill does little to address the ordinary needs of a couple whose marriage is stable.  If the provisions of this Bill were implemented they would set the context within which many marriages could flourish and, when they broke down, could put to right some of the wrongs at present perpetrated against women.  The Tánaiste displayed a fundamentally reactionary view.  I thought the Labour Party was all about change, making progress, equality and law reform, empowering women and enabling them to take their rightful place in society.  The Tánaiste also said that a fundamental problem with this Bill is that it proposes court intervention as the only way in which a spouse who works within the home can obtain a beneficial interest in it.  That is the point, at present that is the only way the Government seems to be capable of handling the matter since the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993, whose provisions sought to give that interest as a right, has gone down the plug hole.</P>
    <P>The option proposed by Democratic Left clearly is far too radical and effective <Col N="1974" /> for this Government to even contemplate. We argued for a constitutional amendment to be put to the people when it became clear that the Government had made a mess of things.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said he believed that the Matrimonial Home Bill had nothing to do with the divorce referendum.  Would that that were so but the two have become so intertwined in the public mind the failure of one might well affect the success of the other.  The question that remains to be addressed is the rights of women in the home.  Mr. Tom Cooney, law lecturer, said recently:</P>
    <P>Security for vulnerable dependent spouses who have no rights in the family home is an absolute imperative. During the last referendum on divorce, anti-divorce campaigners exploded the proposal to accommodate the human right to remarry by igniting panic among dependent spouses on this very issue as well as the issue of income maintenance.</P>
    <P>AIM, the family law information, mediation and counselling group called on the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to take urgent action to enact much needed legislation when the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993, fell.  The Minister responded by saying that the Government was determined to enshrine in law the principle of the Bill, to provide security in the family home for both spouses, but he has not done so.</P>
    <P>After days of speculation as to what the Cabinet intended to do to resolve the difficulty created by the Supreme Court decision the Taoiseach stated that nothing would be done.  He said this was a Cabinet decision and the Cabinet certainly seemed quite happy to jettison a fundamental commitment in the Joint Programme for Government.  The obvious question is if it is so easy to jettison this commitment in the joint programme, what other parts of the joint programme will be dropped overboard from the ship of State when the weather becomes more stormy and the crew more restless as we near the date of the divorce referendum?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> I am sickened at the response of the Government to this Bill.  It is not a Bill that Democratic Left believes will meet the case of spouses who work in the home but, at least, it breaches the wall of discrimination against them; it is an effort to make progress towards equality.  As Mikhail Gorbachev said &mdash; we may all be groping in the dark.  At least the Opposition is groping to find a solution.  On the other hand, the Tánaiste is clearly rendered nervous by the dark and has given no indication of how the Government intends to face up to its obligations. He refuses to consider a constitutional amendment.  He refuses to consider a very modest proposal from the Progressive Democrats.  Rather like the Republican Party in America of whom President Bill Clinton complained recently, Dick Spring's response is to say: &ldquo;no, no, no&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste's response was &ldquo;No, no, no&rdquo;.  It is not as if the Labour Party do not understand what needs to be done.  Deputy Penrose understands what needs to be done.  Speaking on the Second Stage of the Matrimonial Home Bill on 7 July 1993, as reported in the Official Report, at column 1609, he spelt it out clearly when he said, in reference to the Supreme Court decision overturning the High Court decision:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Judiciary decided that under the separation of powers, it could not embark upon that process.  They certainly gave a clear indication to the Oireachtas that it could legislate for the result of that High Court decision. Many people have waited patiently for <Col N="1976" /> the past 18 months for this legislative void to be filled.</P>
    <P>The void is still there and I wonder how Deputy Penrose will vote when this Bill is voted on.</P>

      <P>Will any of them speak? The void is echoing with silence.  Deputy Penrose knows there is a way through the dark and that there is an obligation on the Oireachtas to take account of what the Judiciary is indicating to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes lawyers get it right.  I am no fan of lawyers.  It is an indication of the lack of leadership that exists within his party that his leader can come into this House and reject with such disdain what is a logical outcome of that judgement of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Instead, the Taoiseach talks about marital breakdown and lists the property adjustment provisions that have been made in two years as a result of judicial separation.  That is to simply miss the point.  Whether a marriage has broken down or whether it is still in good shape, the principle is unchanged.  The principle is that a woman's work in the home must be recognised as having value.  The Joint Committee on Women's Rights is considering the distribution of personal wealth in Ireland and women's participation in that distribution.  The findings so far have serious implications. While the research is not up to date, there is evidence that in 1991 the share of women in the total of personal wealth had actually decreased from 28 per cent to 26 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that when we talk of women and ownership &mdash; even though we are talking about half the population &mdash; we are talking about a group in the population who do not as a norm own either wealth or property. Where they do own property it is often <Col N="1977" /> through inheritance.  There are, of course, historical reasons for this.  It is not unique to this country.  In the UK, the United States and Sweden there is still an imbalance, but in many of those countries there are indications that that imbalance is being righted.  Here there is no clear evidence that there is a perceptible trend towards greater equality. We have yet to see that shift in Ireland. I am not arguing that legislation of this type will change the essential inequity but it will put another building block in the foundation on which true equality can be built.</P>
    <P>If we seize every opportunity to tip the balance more equitably we can make progress.  If we refuse, as the Tánaiste refused yesterday, to take an opportunity that lands in his lap and instead expresses the obstinance of blind and ill-informed prejudice, then there is little chance that we will succeed as women in winning our rightful place.</P>
    <P>I am sure this Bill is deficient in many ways.  I am sure many amendments could be made to improve it but that is not the issue.  The issue is whether the Government will avail of the opportunity being offered to put right a wrong that is being done not just to women, but primarily to women, who have waited patiently for many years and believed in the promise offered them in the Joint Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Many years ago, the writer, Thornton Wilder, said: &ldquo;Marriage is a bribe to make a housekeeper think that she is a householder&rdquo;.  Is that what we will see: marriage being simply a bribe to make a housekeeper think she is a householder. Is it not time the housekeepers also became householders?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It is amazing that we have such an empty House to hear a debate on such an important Bill, especially on the Government side we have silent partners on this very important topic.  Reference has already been made to the Tánaiste's speech which I was surprised to hear. While in Opposition he made many attacks on the Government but in <Col N="1978" /> Government he is very touchy.  He would not tolerate half of what he said himself when in Opposition.  To refer to the Bill produced by the Progressive Democrats as giving the impression that it was written on the back of an envelope is an exaggeration.  Whatever else one may say about the Progressive Democrats they have political expertise on their side.  The Tánaiste would lose that battle before it started.</P>
      <P>Following the failure of the Matrimonial Home Bill it is important that something be done about rights to the family home.  We were criticised last night by the Tánaiste for daring to show any responsibility when he said:</P>
      <P>I think the Opposition would do well to recall that if they choose to play politics with the divorce issue, they will have to take responsibility for the consequences.</P>
      <P>The Government should take responsibility for the divorce issue and let the Opposition deal with it.  If we knew what was going on we could be responsible.  It also appears that the Government does not know what it is doing.  It may be that the Tánaiste meant his remarks to travel to the Fianna Fáil Party and others who are doubtful, as well as to his back-benchers. It is absurd to tell the Opposition to be responsible about something of which we have no knowledge.  We do not know whether there will be a referendum in the autumn.  The Tánaiste should have answered that question as there is considerable doubt about it.  I will have no difficulty in being responsible when I see a divorce Bill before us but I do not want to hear anything about being responsible in advance.  The responsibility lies with the Government. The Government is there to lead and to give us a Bill to discuss.  If the Opposition behave irresponsibly the Government can tell us.  In the meantime it is outrageous to tell us how to behave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the home is very important for people who have spent their life building up a home in a non-financial way.  It is politically correct to talk about househusbands and wives but <Col N="1979" /> from my point of view 95 per cent of the time we talk about wives.  Many wives give up successful careers to give full-time attention to the rearing of children and they must be admired for doing that. Obviously, they do it willingly but they take on the role of child bearing and child rearing.  It is a full-time and responsible job and one we should appreciate.  A mother who is full-time in the home has to do a great deal of work: she has to do the housekeeping and the cooking; hungry mouths have to be fed.  She has to balance the budget, sometimes against the odds; if she is lucky she has a husband who hands over his wages.  She has to act as nurse when children come home ill or with injuries.</P>
    <P>Wives who go out to work have a double role.  Frequently when they return home they have to do the housework.  It is almost impossible to put a value on that work but absurd financial figures have been suggested.  It is absurd that a wife who put all her energy and time into keeping a family and home together would have no claim on the property. The issue poses real problems.</P>
    <P>I had a case a few weeks ago where a wife was bullied by a husband into leaving the family home.  She not only contributed through her work but also in a financial way to the upkeep of the home. She did not think she had any rights.  We tried to get free legal aid but there was a long delay and I asked a solicitor friend of mine to help.  When I discussed the fee with him he said there would be no charge.  We heard so much about solicitors and lawyers scooping all the money in one case, which I will not refer to in case I am brought up before some body or other, it created the impression that everyone in the legal profession earned the same amount but that is not true.  It is to their credit that they give free help to people in certain circumstances. As a result of the solicitor's advice to the woman she is still in her home.</P>
    <P>In discussing the Bill we are not just preparing the way for a divorce referendum. The wife working in the home <Col N="1980" /> should feel she is protected and cannot be turfed out at the whim of anyone.  This would be a major advance in guaranteeing her that protection.</P>
    <P>In lacerating us last night the Tánaiste said:</P>
    <P>In summary, this Government has a detailed plan of action leading to the divorce referendum.  It has already invested enormous work in putting that plan into place and will continue to do so.  That plan is on course for the referendum.  The whole Government is united behind that plan, and it is very much to be hoped that the Opposition can have the grace to recognise that, and to support what is our common objective, mainly to lift the absolute constitutional bar on the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>The Government should put the plan on the table and tell us what it is talking about.  The first leg of that plan seemed to fall off when the Matrimonial Home Bill was found to be unconstitutional. The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>If the Government were of the view that a ready alternative to the Matrimonial Home Bill were possible the Government would be only too happy to promote or support such an alternative.</P>
    <P>It is a dreadful sign of weakness to think there is no alternative to a Bill that has failed.  Why have we legal advisers?  I will not mention any specific one.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I must pick my language carefully.  It is outrageous to say there is no alternative to the Matrimonial Home Bill and we cannot protect the partners in a marriage. It looks as if the Government has given up on this issue and yet we are lectured on how to behave when the plan is presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1981" /> The Tánaiste also stated:</P>
    <P>The idea of automatic co-ownership of the family home first emerged in the report of the First Commission on the Status of Women as far back as 1972. And after 21 years of waiting, after reports from the Law Reform Commission, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, and the Second Commission on the Status of Women, it was this Government which finally introduced the Matrimonial Home Bill and saw it through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It saw the Bill through after 21 years and still did not have the proper legal wording.  In a silly attack on the Progressive Democrats he said:</P>
    <P>Sometime between then and now the issue has become, in his and his party's mind, a measure that is so urgent that only one day's notice of it can be given to the Government.</P>
    <P>That is a reference to Deputy McDowell. If we had been waiting 21 years for something to be implemented it is hard to know how this could be seen as a rush of blood.  It might have been a sign of frustration.  The Minister could have been grateful and said that the Progressive Democrats had come to their aid and introduced a Bill which they would examine.  He overshot the mark last night by blaming the Progressive Democrats for introducing the Bill.</P>
    <P>In general, Opposition Bills are treated with scorn.  I accept Deputy Shatter got through the maze.  It is outrageous that such Bills are not accepted.  My party introduced a Bill on the liability for trespass and the Government would not accept it because it was bringing in its own Bill but it looks now as if that will never happen.  Governments should accept that Opposition Deputies have just as much ability as members of the Government.  Those in Opposition today whose Bills are being rejected might easily be in Government within a short time.  If so I hope they will adopt a sensible approach and realise that all 166 Deputies might be able to contribute just <Col N="1982" /> as well as those who are hand picked to be in Government.  There is something outrageous in belittling Bills introduced by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>This Government has the luxury of having so many advisers it does not know which one to listen to.  Even so it still manages to get the wording wrong.  The least it could do is accept Opposition Bills, take them through Second Stage and amend them on Committee Stage. It could then thank the Opposition and acknowledge it could not have got that far without its help.</P>
    <P>It is customary to word the provisions in a Bill in a certain way.  Sometimes the words would not be found in old dictionaries.  Opposition Bills tend to be worded in a different way.  This Bill was described as being short and general.  If it clearly outlines what it is about why should it be couched in words nobody understands?  I compliment the Progressive Democrats for introducing the Bill and would like to think the Government will treat it seriously and not rubbish it as the Minister did last night.</P>
    <P>If the Government has sense it will accept and amend the Bill and make an effort to ensure that those who give of their time working in the home who may not contribute financially will certainly be regarded as major contributors to it. That is the least we might do to protect them and show our appreciation of the wonderful work done by those who stay at home to look after their family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I delayed because I had hoped the Government would offer some speakers on this debate.  The manner in which the Government is treating this legislation is an absolute disgrace, it turned down two Government slots to contribute to the debate.  It is offensive to those who went to the bother of preparing the legislation &mdash; and considerable work went into its preparation &mdash; as there was consultation with those concerned about the rights of women.  The Tánaiste promised to put justice into economics and trust into politics, but the manner in which the Labour Party, in particular, and the Government in general treated <Col N="1983" /> this debate speaks volumes for their commitment to put trust into politics and justice into economics.</P>
      <P>Earlier today the Government parties sought to suspend indefinitely the workings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Government would prefer if there was no accountability and if that committee did not exist because its active members from the Opposition parties, from the excellent Chairman to the excellent members of the Opposition parties work very hard, ask difficult questions, try to make sure there is accountability and that we get value for public money.  I know the Government would prefer if those questions were not asked. They trooped into the committee this morning and again this afternoon and had the committee meeting suspended for at least three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Durkan asked relevant questions to which he was refused answers and Minister after Minister responded that people are not entitled to know.  Yet it was because Ministers did not answer parliamentary questions that an expensive tribunal was set up to inquire into the difficulties that arose in the beef industry.  Deputy Durkan's questions were simple and relevant.  He and every other Deputy has a right to the answers to those questions.  The Government &mdash; with an unprecedented majority in the history of the State &mdash; failed to take this debate seriously.  When it was formed I said that the one really bad thing about it was the size of its majority. I predicted it would make the Government arrogant and complacent, which it has.  It could not care less.  The Government would prefer if the Dáil did not exist as it does not value democracy.  It refuses to hold by-elections and if European elections on 9 June were not mandatory they probably would not be held either.  It is really sad when there are so many problems and in particular when so many women are told that the legislation will be gender proofed&mdash;the Programme for Government stated that all legislation and every Government decision would be gender proofed.  I wonder who gender <Col N="1984" /> proofed the speech of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs last night.  I wonder if all the advisers on the desirability of making this speech were male.  I wonder what the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald or the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, thought about this speech. For every woman in the Government parties, that speech represents a total and utter denial of a basic right &mdash; particularly a right of stay at home women who have worked long and hard to provide the circumstances that allow their husbands to acquire the resources, as Deputy Keogh said last evening and as Deputy McDowell said this evening, to purchase a family home and continue to pay the mortgage on it.  They make a home and rear their children but are not supposed to get anything in spite of the noble words of the Constitution which states in Article 41:</P>
    <P>2.1º In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>2º The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>3.1º The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>Many Members including the Tánaiste, referred to the fact that this is a short Bill.  However, its detail and the length of the explanatory memorandum should suggest to him, if nothing else does, that it was not written on the back of an envelope.  At one point in his speech the Tánaiste said it was not a modest proposal but later in the same speech he said <Col N="1985" /> it was.  Obviously two word processors, one from the Department of Equality and Law Reform and the other from the Tánaiste's special office met at Iveagh House and that is why the speech was confused.</P>
    <P>My party gets an opportunity only every six weeks to table a matter of concern during Private Members' time.  As a woman leader of a political party I was shattered when the Supreme Court struck down the Matrimonial Home Bill because my party and I supported it. Other Deputies and I spent a great deal of time during the summer discussing the Bill at committee meetings where we went through its fine detail.  I would have preferred if the Matrimonial Home Bill had not been found unconstitutional, but it was.  I went to the bother of reading the judgment on the Bill because I thought we might as well give up but on reading it I found that the the court was not totally striking down the principle, what annoyed it was the mandatory nature of the provisions.  I looked with hope to the Government as I felt there was a way out and that a more modest proposal would be constitutional.  I asked the Taoiseach if the Government would not reconsider its earlier contention that it had to walk away from the Matrimonial Home Bill and he told me it could not be done. When I insisted it could the Minister for Equality and Law Reform said a few days later that he would ask the Attorney General to again look at it.  It was only when the Taoiseach reiterated that the Government would do nothing about the Matrimonial Home Bill that my party decided this was not good enough and that we could not wait another six weeks &mdash; which would bring us to June &mdash; before the matter could be again raised.  We would then be involved in an election campaign and perhaps we would be accused of electioneering.  If we did not decide to table the proposal now we would be told the divorce referendum was underway and it would not be helpful. That is why we have chosen this time to table this Bill.  I believe it is the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>As someone very committed to the <Col N="1986" /> principle of divorce and as a pluralist, I believe divorce is a civil right and that those whose marriages have tragically broken down should be given the legal option of having them dissolved and the option to remarry if they wish.  If this legislation is not accepted by the Government and if we have an approach like that of last night from the Tánaiste, there is no hope of the divorce referendum being carried.  The Tánaiste accused the Opposition parties of playing politics.  I was one of the Opposition party leaders who went to see the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  He thanked me for the helpful contribution I had made, not only at that meeting but subsequently, and he contrasted it with other advice he had been given by Deputies.  I have spoken to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on many occasions about the proposed divorce referendum because I am concerned and I do not believe what the Tánaiste said last night that there is a commitment from everybody in the Government.  I do not accept that, I wait to see every member of the Cabinet endorsing the need for the referendum and supporting the concept of divorce but I very much doubt if that support is there.</P>
    <P>Because I was concerned that support for the concept of divorce was declining I asked the Taoiseach if he would agree to meet with the party leaders so that a co-ordinated approach could be adopted but he said he was not interested.  Ten days before polling day when there is chaos everybody will be called in but at a time when we could be of help the Government does not want to know because it has a 35 seat majority.  Why should it bother about the Opposition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for giving me this opportunity to raise this issue.  The deaths and injuries caused by land-mines is now one of the most serious problems facing a range of developing countries which are in or have just emerged from conflicts.  Yet, it is an issue which has received scant attention in this part of the world.</P>
      <P>Like many other Members it was a problem on which I had little knowledge until I attended a press conference yesterday organised by Pax Christi Ireland. &ldquo;Shocking&rdquo; is a word over-used by politicians but there is no other word that can adequately describe what I and other Members of the House saw and heard at that press conference yesterday.  No words can ever convey the horror of the broken bodies, severed limbs and maimed children which we saw on the slides shown by Pax Christi.</P>
      <P>The scale of the problem is almost unimaginable.  Nobody knows how many land-mines have been planted but it is believed that there are approximately 100 million mines still scattered around the world taking their terrible toll.  In the last 15 years there have been 1.5 million casualties, the majority of whom were civilians.  Seventy-five per cent of survivors require amputations while approximately 200 people die and many more are injured by land-mines each week.  Sixty-two countries are affected by land-mines.  Africa is the most mined continent with between 18 million and 30 million mines scattered throughout 18 countries.</P>
      <P>There is a severe problem in countries such as Cambodia which has the unfortunate designation of amputee capital of the world.  Of Cambodia's population of approximately 8.5 million some 30,000 people have lost a limb after stepping on a land-mine.  This represents one out of every 236 of the population.  In 1990, land mines in Cambodia caused 6,000 amputations and approximately 12,000 deaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1988" /> The land-mine is the most indiscriminate of weapons.  It acknowledges no ceasefire and remains a killer long after hostilities have ceased.  Invariably laid by military personnel its most frequent victims are civilians.  The land-mine does not differentiate between combatant and non-combatant.  It responds in the same lethal way to the pressure of the bare foot of a child as to the wheel of an armoured personnel carrier.</P>
    <P>Apart from the death and the human suffering, land-mines are wreaking a terrible economic toll on developing countries which can least afford the additional burden.  Entire areas are taken out of production because of the dangers posed by land-mines, thus affecting food production and adding to malnutrition.  They kill and maim workers upon whom rural economies depend to sustain themselves. The cost of treating and caring for victims is very high as land-mine victims require more attention, money and nursing than other war victims.</P>
    <P>Action is required on two fronts: more assistance from developed countries to remove existing mines and measures to seek the eventual phasing out and banning of these weapons.  Ireland can play a role in both.  There are particular problems in detecting and defusing mines, especially as the majority of modern mines are made from plastic and do not show up on detectors.  A high level of technical expertise is required to deal with them which is not always available in the countries most affected.</P>
    <P>Members of our own Defence Forces have experience of dealing with land-mines from their service with the United Nations in the Lebanon and elsewhere.  I hope the Government will consider ways in which this technical knowledge could be made available to those countries which can benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Ireland should also take a leading position in seeking to ban these weapons. I understand that our Defence Forces purchase land-mines from the Swedish manufacturer, Bofors, which is one of the major profiteers from this evil trade. I cannot see any military circumstances which would require our Defence Forces <Col N="1989" /> to have land-mines.  We should give an example to the international community by announcing that we will buy no more.</P>
    <P>I hope that Ireland will also give a lead to the rest of the world by ratifying the UN Convention on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects, flawed and inadequate as this Convention may be.  I understand that discussions are under way to identify means of improving the Convention but Ireland is not a party to these discussions.  I hope Ireland will join these discussions, that it will consider sponsoring motions at the United Nations seeking to end this trade and to make producers of land-mines responsible for the devastation they cause and for the cost of rehabilitation and mine clearance.</P>
    <P>Nothing can be done to restore the lives lost and only a certain amount can be done for those who have lost limbs but we must now begin to take steps to ensure that there will be no more victims. Let me give one graphic example.  One of the slides showed a child with part of his foot missing sitting in bed with his mother.  As the father has disappeared, the mother must go out at night through the land-mines to find food to feed the child.  The presenter for Pax Christi made the point that this child will almost certainly die as one night his mother will not return and he will not know why.  He will did from starvation and gangrene.  That is how serious the problem is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to reply to the remarks made by the Deputy on this important matter.  The Government shares the Deputy's concern at the death and suffering caused to civilians by anti-personnel mines, which are widespread throughout the countryside in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia and Mozambique, to name but a few of the countries affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estimates of the number of anti-personnel mines planted during conflicts in <Col N="1990" /> countries around the world range up to 100 million, and their toll on civilians is intolerable: it is estimated that up to 200 people are killed or maimed every week by these devices.  Anti-personnel mines, especially unmarked and undetectable ones, also pose considerable problems for peacekeeping forces.</P>
    <P>The devastation which is caused by mines is enormous.  Until they have been cleared vast areas of fertile land are unusable and become a real danger to humans &mdash; particularly children &mdash; and animals who wander on to them.  The development, rehabilitation and reconstruction of a country cannot begin properly until the terrible blight of mines can be removed.  Nowhere is this more evident than in a country like Cambodia where the process of mine clearance is vital in a reasonable livelihood is to be provided to the thousands of refugees who have now returned.</P>
    <P>I have decided to allocate IR£300,000 from the bilateral aid fund for a demining programme in Pursat Province in Cambodia. This will be carried out by Concern in conjunction with the Halo Trust beginning next August and continuing to December 1995.  The funds to be provided will be used both for the clearance of mines by experts and to train local people to locate and dispose safely of any mines which may be moved by the rains to previously cleared areas.</P>
    <P>The cost of demining is estimated to be one hundred times the cost of laying mines; measures are needed to prevent the laying of mines.  Where mines are laid, it is important to ensure that no company which profits from the manufacture of mines is involved in demining projects.  Ireland does not manufacture or permit the export of anti-personnel mines.  It is noted that the US government has implemented a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel mines and we hope that other mine producers will follow this lead.</P>
    <P>A United Nations Convention on &ldquo;prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects&rdquo;, <Col N="1991" /> commonly known as the Inhumane Weapons Convention, was opened for signature in 1981.  Ireland is an original signatory of the Convention and the Government strongly support its provisions while recognising that the Convention needs to be updated to remove certain loopholes.  The Convention prohibits the indiscriminate use of mines, in particular in areas where there is a high concentration of civilians.</P>
    <P>A review conference on the Convention will take place in 1995 and Ireland recently participated as a signatory state at the Preparatory Commission in Geneva which is preparing for the review conference.</P>
    <P>The Government view the problem of dealing with the proliferation of land mines as falling within the wider question of restraint in the manufacture, possession, transfer and sale of all conventional weapons.  Together with our EU partners and Japan, Ireland sponsored the introduction of a United Nations Register of Armaments to include information on international transfers of certain categories of conventional weapons.  The register is now in place and the first returns were made in April 1993 in respect of transfers in 1992.  Now that the register is fully operational, we are examining the possible extension of its scope to include further categories of armaments, and Ireland and the other sponsors of the register are seriously considering the inclusion of anti-personnel mines.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position on the question of anti-personnel mines was made clear in the UN General Assembly in 1993, where we co-sponsored all three resolutions on the issue: (i) General Assembly Resolution 48/7, an initiative of the European Union, adopted unanimously by the Plenary of the General Assembly on 19 October 1993.  This highlighted the importance of UN co-ordination of activities related to mine clearing, and called on the Secretary General to submit a comprehensive report on the problems caused by mines and other unexploded devices; (ii) Resolution 48/75K, which <Col N="1992" /> called on all states to introduce a moratorium on the export of land mines; and (iii) Resolution 48/79, which supported the convening of a review conference to strengthen the &ldquo;Inhumane Weapons Convention&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also been active in this area at the United Nations in our promotion of a &ldquo;Code of Conduct&rdquo; for restraint in transfers of conventional weapons.  We want to ensure that our troops who serve abroad, particularly with the United Nations, are familiar with these mines and the placement of these mines.  To that end we have imported a number of these strictly for training purposes to ensure that when our troops go abroad on these missions they are properly equipped and capable of dealing with this serious problem and that Ireland plays, and continues to play, a major role in dealing with this very serious problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of the mushroom industry has been one of the success stories in agriculture and rural development over the past five years. Last week the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry told me that there are 556 growers involved in mushroom production of which 274 are located in Ulster, 154 in Leinster, 119 in Connaught and nine in Munster.  In a five year period employment has come from a virtual zero base to 443 full time and 2,069 part time employees in Ulster; 249 full time and 1,163 part time employees in Leinster; 192 full time and 898 part time employees in Connaught; and 15 full time and 68 part time employees in Munster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth and development of the mushroom industry was greatly facilitated and encouraged by the 10 per cent tax rate.  Its development has been particularly significant in the west and in the Border counties, a fact which merited special mention in the recent report commissioned by the western Bishops.  The potential of the industry to expand and generate worth-while employment in <Col N="1993" /> rural areas received special mention in the report.</P>
    <P>Much of the recent growth in mushroom production has come from growers who have formed limited companies which have reinvested earnings in additional production units.  It is extremely doubtful if such expansion would have occurred if those companies were subjected to 40 per cent tax on their profits.  The additional borrowings that would have been necessary under the 40 per cent tax regime might not be available and would be unlikely to be undertaken due to lack of incentives.  It is ironic, therefore, that at a time when the Government is setting up a task force to see how the west can be developed, it should at the same time remove the incentive that has encouraged the development of the most promising rural enterprise that has been established in this country in decades.</P>
    <P>It now appears that the increase in the tax rate from 10 per cent to 40 per cent came in response to lobbying in Brussels by British mushroom interests which are liable for 25 per cent corporation tax.  I urge the Minister to resist this and not to be dragged along in the slipstream of British expectations that the Irish Government or the European Union will do or be guided by British bidding or succumb to British pressure.</P>
    <P>It should be made abundantly clear to the British that any such tax advantage enjoyed by Irish growers is more than outweighted by the additional transport costs on a daily basis to the UK market incurred by the Irish industry and in particular by growers in the west.  It is hardly conceivable that our Government should obligingly respond to any such pressure by placing Irish growers on an even higher corporation tax than their British counterparts.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase the corporation tax on the Irish mushroom industry has been taken without full appreciation of the detrimental effect which the move will have on the industry. It will undoubtedly curtail the development of the industry in the west and along the Border counties of Monaghan, Cavan <Col N="1994" /> and Donegal where it has succeeded in creating substantial employment since it was established in 1988-89 with the potential for further job increases.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to retain the 10 per cent tax status for the Irish mushroom industry to allow it to develop to its full potential as a major contributor to the creation of jobs, substantial revenue for the country and to rural development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficultues which have arisen in relation to the corporation tax treatment of mushroom cultivation stem from a recent investigation into the measure by the European Commission. The application of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to mushroom cultivation had its origins in the fact that mushroom cultivation qualified for export sales relief.  Export sales relief terminated for new companies in 1980 and was replaced by the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  When legislation to bring mushroom cultivation within the scope of the 10 per cent scheme was proposed in 1981, the approval of the EC was sought under the competition provisions of the EC Treaty. At the time, the European Commission indicated that it did not have any comment to make but reserved the right to examine the measure in the future.  The Commission opened an investigation into the application of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to mushroom cultivation in early 1991 as part of an ongoing review of aid schemes under Article 93 (1) of the EC Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is acutely aware of the important role the mushroom industry plays in the economic life of rural Ireland and the important contribution the industry makes to rural development. Between full and part time jobs, the industry gives employment to some 5,000 people.  Much of this employment is located in areas where other sources of employment are scarce and the industry also provides additional income to small family farm enterprises.  The 10 per cent rate of corporation tax has been an important factor in encouraging the remarkable growth of the industry and <Col N="1995" /> its outstanding export performance.  In the light of these circumstances the Government did not need to be persuaded of the necessity of making as strong a case as possible to the European Commission for the retention of the 10 per cent rate for the sector.  The Government stressed to the Commission, in the clearest possible terms, the opportunities which mushroom production provides for the small farmer to diversify into an area where there are plentiful outlets on the open market and which reduces the producer's dependence on market support mechanisms such as intervention.</P>
    <P>The Government also pointed out to the Commission that the 10 per cent rate provided a clearly focused incentive to the development of a sector of business which is making an important contribution to the development of some of the most disadvantaged areas in Ireland, and that the continued progress towards economic development in these regions depended in part upon the favourable tax treatment of the mushroom industry.</P>
    <P>The Commission concluded its investigation early this year and, notwithstanding the strong case which the Government put forward in favour of retention of the 10 per cent rate found the application of the 10 per cent rate to mushroom cultivation to be incompatible with the Common Market and, as a consequence, called on Ireland to remove mushroom cultivation from the 10 per cent scheme.  A formal procedure against Ireland on this matter, under Article 93 (2) of the EC Treaty, commenced earlier this year and it is expected that a notice to this effect will be published shortly in the Official Journal of the European Union.  In the light of the Commission's findings on this matter, and the opening of the formal procedure, Ireland is obliged, as a member state of the European Union, to comply with the Commission's call to remove mushroom cultivation from within the scope of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax. Accordingly, the forthcoming Finance Bill will contain measures to delete the special provisions under which mushroom <Col N="1996" /> cultivation benefits from the 10 per cent rate of tax.</P>
    <P>While the Government regrets that it has become necessary on foot of our EU obligations, to remove mushroom cultivation from the 10 per cent scheme, the Government would hope that the healthy and vibrant nature of the mushroom sector would assist the industry in dealing with the challenge which the tax change represents.</P>
    <P>In particular I would like to emphasise the relatively limited effect of this change on the primary producers of mushrooms. I must be remembered that this change will only have a direct effect on those elements of the mushroom sector which are incorporated.  The bulk of the 5,000 jobs in the mushroom sector are based at the 550 mushroom farms around the country with approximately 700 people employed in the marketing and compost production sectors.  It is estimated that less than 5 per cent of growers are incorporated and, although such growers tend to be the larger producers, they account for less than 10 per cent of total employment at grower level.  Consequently, by far the largest part of the mushroom industry, in employment terms, will not be directly affected by the change in corporation tax treatment because they are taxed under income tax rather than corporation tax.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that the mushroom industry benefits from a number of other supports aside from the reduced rate of corporation tax.  Over the past three years mushroom production has qualified for grant assistance under a number of schemes operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, including the farm improvement programme, the operational programme for rural development and the International Fund for Ireland.  Under these schemes various projects in the mushroom sector have qualified, depending on the nature of the development, for assistance of anything between 15 per cent and 50 per cent of approved investments. Assistance will continue to be available to the mushroom sector under the farm improvement programme and <Col N="1997" /> the 1994-99 programme for rural development.  The mushroom sector also qualifies under the BES investment scheme.</P>
    <P>The speculation concerning the possible effects of the tax change on the mushroom industry has taken place in advance of publication of the relevant provisions in the Finance Bill.  While understandable, speculation with regard to the possible effects of a tax change, the details of which have not yet been published, is not in the best interests of the industry and encourages the type of instability which we should all act to prevent in the current circumstances.  I would therefore urge Deputies to await the publication of the Finance Bill and to assess the likely effects of the change in the light of the provisions of the Bill which will be published in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members would agree that it would be preferable if this change in the corporation tax treatment of mushroom cultivation did not have to take place.  Nevertheless, we must recognise that the obligations which we entererd into as a member state of the European Union oblige us to abide by the provisions of European law on these matters and notwithstanding our strong reservations on the matter, we must comply with the provisions of the EEC Treaty and remove mushroom cultivation from the scope of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  While no sector of the economy wishes to be faced with a higher level of taxation, it would be a gross exaggeration to claim that up to 5,000 jobs are at risk.  I have every confidence that the resilience and flexibility of the industry which have permitted it to thrive in the most competitive of market environments will also allow it to meet this new challenge successfully, overcome this setback and return in the longer term to a path of resumed growth and prosperity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to listen to my <Col N="1998" /> contribution.  The ESRI report published in today's newspapers, which states that more money needs to be spent on our roads, is an indication of the views of others, apart from those in Cavan and Monaghan.  It is interesting that the ESRI suggests that more money needs to be spent on roads and less on railways and the Dublin transport system.</P>
      <P>At recent meetings of Monaghan County Council which dealt with the distribution of moneys available for county roads, it was indicated that work will not be done on 50 per cent of the roads needing repairs in 1994.  That statement was made at a time when £10 million was allocated by the Minister for Finance for the refurbishment of Dublin Castle, not to mention all the money spent on the beef tribunal.  I understand £200 million will be spent on national primary roads this year, which accounts for 5 per cent of our road network, and approximately £100 million &mdash; depending on how much we receive from the European Union &mdash; on the other 95 per cent, regional and county roads.  Government funding will amount to less than £180 million when EU moneys are taken into account.  That amounts to 14 per cent of the £1.3 billion that vehicle owners pay in direct and indirect taxes to keep their vehicles on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 70 per cent of our poultry is produced in County Monaghan and a similar percentage of mushrooms is produced there, but the future of those industries will depend on whether the 40 per cent corporation tax rate is introduced. Dairying and beef production are also important in that area which is also the home of quality furniture.  Those sectors create a great deal of employment in the area and they need good roads and an efficient means of transport.  In the past five years £550 million was spent on railways and buses, but none of that was spent in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  A total of £15.5 million was spent on regional airports but again none of that was spent in the Cavan-Monaghan area. Very little foreign industry located in the area and £4.3 million lottery funds was allocated in 1993, but not one penny of <Col N="1999" /> it went to sports or other facilities in the region.</P>
    <P>According to engineers' projections, £48 million is required in Monaghan alone to bring roads up to a reasonable standard or approximately £9 million per annum over ten years.  In real terms we are receiving about one-third of what we received in 1977.  That is why our roads are in such a disastrous condition.  In 1977 there were 309 workers working on our roads, and today the figure is 125.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the power to do something about the roads in Cavan and Monaghan and something must be done quickly if industry and jobs there are to survive.  Most of the jobs in the area are based on the pig, mushroom and poultry industries and general farming and many small factories are located along country roads which are becoming impassable. I acknowledge that the Minister visited those counties early last year but one of the worst roads along which he travelled is not even on the list for repair this year.</P>
    <P>The people who live in that area are very depressed about this matter.  A producer, who produces eggs for breeding purposes, telephoned me today to say that Contard Lane is not on the list for repair works this year and that a large percentage of the eggs arriving at the hatchery are cracked after being transported on this road.</P>
    <P>The condition of the roads results in expense to farmers, industry and people travelling to work.  Today we heard the villages in Monaghan and Cavan are dying and if essential repair works are not carried out immediately to the regional and county roads in those two counties the position will deteriorate further. Those counties may be receiving a fair share of money per mile of road or slightly more than the national average, but they do not receive an allocation in respect of railroads or airports.  I ask the Minister to give us a break and an opportunity to create jobs and develop industry.</P>

I have been asked to suspend expenditure on the railway system and to divert it to the road network, primarily to county and regional roads.  As Deputy Crawford is aware, production in Cavan and Monaghan is mainly for export and access is needed to sea and airports.  I am sure the Deputy agrees that comparisons of expenditure on national and primary roads will not stand up because the Central Bank, the task force on employment and the Moriarty Committee, all recommended investment in the national arteries to encourage tourism and facilitate exports.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me the opportunity to raise a <Col N="2002" /> serious issue that should be brought to the attention of the Minister for Health. The possible closure of the sexual assault treatment unit in the Rotunda Hospital due to a lack of resources is a shameful indictment on society.  It is unthinkable that any question should arise as to the future of a centre, which has given such tremendous service to women, particularly at a time when there is a greater call on its services than at any time previously. Since 1986 the number of doctors working there has decreased from ten to four, no training is provided for doctors or nurses in the centre and the 24 hour service is no longer guaranteed.</P>
      <P>More than 260 cases are dealt with by the centre annually, even in its present restricted operation.  The gardaí regularly rely on its service for forensic evidence in the prosecution of cases.  I cannot overstress the vital nature of the services provided by that unit and I do not understand why an extra £40,000 to £50,000 cannot be allocated to enable their continuation.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to immediately take the necessary measures to provide resources for staff, staff training and ancillary facilities without delay.  There should be no question mark over that unit, which has provided sterling service for the victims &mdash; mainly women and children &mdash; of sexual abuse, due to lack of funding at a time when people, particularly women, are focusing their attention on necessary services.  I ask the Minister to take the necessary steps to ensure the unit's future, I hope he will confirm that tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure there is no threat to the sexual assault treatment unit at the Rotunda Hospital.  There is certainly no threat from me or my Department to close the unit, neither is there a threat from the Rotunda Hospital to close it. The reverse is true.  Both the Rotunda Hospital and my Department are very anxious to ensure that not only does this very important service continue but that it is enhanced.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant moneys I made available for services in the treatment of rape victims. <Col N="2003" /> I will announce this year's allocation during the coming weeks which will be a significant increase on that of last year and will represent a greater spread of resources across the board.</P>
      <P>I will outline some of the background to the unit.  It was established in 1985 for the forensic examination, medical examination and treatment of sexual assault and rape victims.</P>
      <P>The service provided by the unit has recently been the subject of a detailed review by my Department and the Rotunda Hospital.  That review sought views from a range of organisations involved in the area of sexual assault. The organisations consulted included the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Garda Sochána, the Eastern Health Board and the Forensic Science Laboratory.  There was a strong wish among all the parties consulted that duplication be avoided and that a co-ordinated approach be adopted which would integrate all the various service elements now provided. That would ensure that each organisation knows the role which it is expected to perform.  Each organisation can then get on with the business of providing a high quality and effective service in the area assigned to it.  It is in this type of situation that the person receiving the service is provided with the best possible arrangements and supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is considered that the sexual assault treatment unit should concentrate its work on providing a frontline acute service to deal with cases of sexual assault <Col N="2004" /> and/or rape of recent occurrence and provide those cases with a high quality service for forensic examination.  Arising out of the review a framework document setting out the principles which should govern the future development of the unit was sent last week to the Rotunda Hospital by my Department.</P>
    <P>As part of the review, the remuneration of the general practitioners who work in the unit was dealt with.  In a letter of 25 March 1994 to the Master of the Rotunda Hospital from my Department, sanction was given for an increase in the rates of remuneration of 36 per cent for standby rate, 33 per cent for Saturday, Sunday and bank holiday standby rate and 36 per cent for first call-in fee with an increase of 70 per cent for a subsequent visit.</P>
    <P>It is also envisaged that a consultant gynaecologist would be appointed to the unit to broaden the level of professional medical expertise available to it and to ensure that all the services of the Rotunda Hospital are fully at the disposal of persons attending the unit.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report that these proposals for the enhancement of the service at the unit have been sanctioned.  I cannot let this occasion pass, however, without expressing my disappointment at the way in which misleading information has been circulated in a manner which can only undermine a most important service. However, I am happy to have the opportunity to put the record straight.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 38, 39, 41, 42 and 80 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the valuable contribution that the existing railway network makes to balanced regional development.  In keeping with the Government's strong commitment to the railway network, the National Development Plan includes provision for an EU assisted investment programme of £185 million on the upgrading of the existing <Col N="1892" /> mainline railway network.  In addition, a further £90 million approximately of uncofinanced investment is proposed over the period subject to the resources available to CIE.  The investment programme which covers all the major lines on the inter-urban network will include expenditure on track renewal, new signalling systems and modern rolling stock.</P>
    <P>These proposals are under discussion at present with the European Commission in the context of the draft Operational Programme on Transport.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Dublin to Westport/Ballina line, I have received requests for meetings from commercial and community groups from the catchment area served by the line including the Western Region of the Chamber of Commerce.  Local concern may stem from the fact that some lines including the Dublin-Westport/Ballina line have been included for development under the National Development Plan on the basis of noncofinanced expenditure.  I wish to emphasise however that all major lines have been included for development under the plan and there is therefore no question of the Dublin-Westport/Ballina railway line or any other line in the network being downgraded.  In these circumstances, I felt that no useful purpose would be served by arranging a meeting with commercial or community groups about the line in question.  The allocation by CIE of capital resources in 1994 for the Dublin-Westport/Ballina line is a matter for the CIE Group entirely.  Similarly, the allocation of Exchequer support for services among the various lines is also a matter for the CIE Group.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals in the National Development Plan for the upgrading of the Cork-Cobh railway line.  This does not mean, however, that services on that line or indeed other local services and branch lines will not be improved by Iarnród Éireann as and when resources permit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy asked me about Iarnród Éireann's financial performance.  The report and accounts of CIE and the operating subsidiaries for the last full year for which figures have been published, <Col N="1893" /> that is 1992, have already been presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  For the information of the Deputy, Iarnród Éireann recorded a surplus of £4.6 million in 1992 after State grant of £90.4 million.</P>

      <P>The administration of the bond of a failed travel agent is governed by the provisions of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982 and Regulations made under that Act.  The question of travel vouchers is covered under Regulation 15 of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982 (Claims by Customers) Regulations, 1983 (S.I. No. 104 of 1983) which states that:</P>
      <P>Where a customer of a tour operator or travel agent holds a voucher, trading stamp or similar token furnished to him by the tour operator or travel agent, being a voucher, trading stamp or similar token which is exchangeable as payment or part payment for services provided or to be provided by the tour operator or travel agent, but which has not been so exchanged, no reimbursement shall fall due to that customer in respect of any sum represented by that voucher, trading stamp or similar token.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This means that customers of a failed travel agent who have received vouchers which have not been exchanged for a specific holiday booking are not entitled to a refund for the value of the voucher. Similarly, purchasers of such vouchers <Col N="1894" /> are not entitled to a refund under the bond.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The question of a strategic alliance for Aer Lingus was one of the issues dealt with in the document on Irish aviation policy which was published by my Department in February of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in that document, the current global trends in aviation are towards strategic alliances among existing carriers to achieve the economies of scale and cost reductions necessary to compete in increasingly competitive international markets.  Some alliances are also designed to provide carriers with access to private capital for development purposes. There is also an increasing trend <Col N="1897" /> towards the licensing of new airlines and the privatisation or part-privatisation of national airlines.</P>
    <P>With the progressive liberalisation of the airline industry worldwide, many airlines with relatively small domestic markets have sought alliances with stronger carriers or groups of carriers.  In some cases, these involve cross shareholdings while, in others, alliances are confined to marketing arrangements.  In so far as Aer Lingus is concerned, while the proposed form of such an alliance is a matter in the first instance for the board of the company, the Government, as shareholder, will seriously consider on their merits all proposals from Aer Lingus for such alliances.  These could include cross shareholding agreements and additional equity investments, if these are judged to be in the best interests of the airline and the economic development of the country.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to comment on discussions Aer Lingus has with any specific air carrier. However, the Government will continue to encourage Aer Lingus to seek appropriate strategic alliances with other airlines as part of its overall development strategy.  In order to interest potential strategic partners, Aer Lingus in the first instance has to achieve the objectives set out in its restructuring programme, Strategy for the Future, so as to demonstrate sustainable commercial viability.</P>

There are no plans at present to increase or dispose of any of the stock at Whiddy.  Retention of the stock is necessary to ensure that Ireland complies with European Union and International Energy Agency obligations in relation to the holding of strategic oil stocks.  In the medium term it is the Government's objective to secure an investor who <Col N="1901" /> would be interested in reactivating the terminal for commercial purposes.</P>

      <P>The farm electrification grants scheme, FEGS, was introduced in 1990 and is a carry-over of the EC funded FEOGA Western Package which was discontinued due to the exhaustion of its financial funding.  The scheme is designed to subsidise the cost of installation of electricity to supply to farms without supply or with inadequate supply in order to increase farm output in disadvantaged regions of the country. Grant aid is only allowable to applicants engaged in traditional farming activities which include dairy farming, livestock production, the cultivation of grass and tillage crops, etc.  Because of the limited funding available it is not possible to extend the scheme to cover non-traditional <Col N="1902" /> farming activities such as the development of facilities for horses.</P>

      <P>The treatment of cohabiting couples under Social Welfare provisions arises out of the 1989 Supreme Court decision in the Hyland case.  This decision found that the Social Welfare provisions in question in that case were unconstitutional in that they treated a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried cohabiting couple. The Social Welfare provisions now in <Col N="1904" /> operation explicitly give cohabiting couples the same treatment as married couples in determining the level of entitlement to benefits.  The effect of the provisions, therefore, is to preclude cohabiting couples from receiving better treatment than married couples.</P>
      <P>The treatment of cohabiting couples for income tax purposes now in operation arose out of the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i> Attorney General (1980) in which it was held that a situation in which a married couple might pay more tax than two single persons living together would be repugnant to the Constitution.  Thus a married couple is entitled to double tax free allowances and bands whereas a cohabiting couple are each entitled only to the single person's allowances and bands.  The Deputy will appreciate that the tax law should, in principle, follow and reflect the general law relating to marriage.</P>

      <P>In this case the person named stated on the 22 month special beef premium scheme application lodged in June 1993 that the ten animals applied on were born in December 1991 and January 1992 &mdash; they were only 18 to 19 months at most in June 1993, therefore, and so were not eligible for 22 month premium.  He was advised to apply on them in November 1993 when they would be 21 months old at date of application and so eligible for 22 month premium on age grounds.  The fact that he sold them before the application period and before they qualified on age grounds for 22 month premium was the choice of the person named and was outside my Department's control.  The animals could have been submitted for 22 month premium, of course, by their new owner(s) and it is possible that they paid the person named higher prices for the animals concerned in view of this consideration &mdash; thus giving him some benefit from the 22 month premium even though he himself could not claim it.</P>

      <P>Applications were received from 17,150 farmers claiming payments under the arable aid scheme.  It was, of course, necessary for my Department to make inquiries and carry out on-the-spot inspections in order <Col N="1914" /> to ensure compliance with EU regulations before payment could be made.</P>
      <P>Some 25 per cent of the applications received were the subject of inquiries. Most of these queries were carried out by telephone or by writing to the farmer.</P>
      <P>In a small number of cases it was necessary to carry out checks to ensure compliance with EU regulations.  The regulations stipulated that holdings could not be split after 30 June 1992 for the purposes of avoiding set-aside.  Where suspect cases were identified it was open to farmers to provide the requisite evidence to support applications.  Invoices for farm inputs and receipts for sale of grain were accepted as evidence that the holding had operated separately prior to June 1992.  The existence of a separate bank account could also indicate separate farming operations.  Farmers were not required to furnish details of their bank accounts or loans.</P>

Our Department, in consultation with the ESB, is developing a competitive scheme to ensure that such supplies are available before 1997 from independent producers.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann is involved in regular transport of four dangerous substances by rail through Dublin viz. acrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, anhydrous ammonia and certain petroleum products.  Acrylonitrile is carried by rail between Dublin and Ballina on four trains each week, with one tank container of methyl acrylate on two of these trains.  Information relating to quantity and value of products carried cannot be supplied for reasons of commercial confidentiality.  Methyl acrylate and acrylonitrile are classed as being potentially explosive in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trains involved in the transportation of these substances are operated generally in accordance with the provisions of regulations concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by rail, RID.  The tank containers and tankers comply with International Union of Railways, UIC, specifications and appropriate information notices and hazard labels are carried.  Maximum speeds are restricted and all persons concerned <Col N="1922" /> in these operations are given special training.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements for the transport of these substances by rail are safe, having regard to the special equipment and procedures in use and the emergency plans which exist to deal with any incident involving these operations.  I have no function in relation to the consideration of alternative transport modes or routes for these goods.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to comment on the details of particular cases regarding the payment of health contributions, as my Department does not have access to the Revenue or Social Welfare records.  I can state, however, that under the present arrangements, where an employee holds a medical card the payment of the health contribution is the responsibility of the employer.  If an employee is due a refund of the health contribution, the responsibility for making such a refund lies with the employer.</P>
      <P>In the 1994 budget the Minister for Finance announced that, following the recommendation of the Expert Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems, he proposed to remove the obligation on employers to pay the health levy and the youth employment levy in respect of employees with medical cards.  The arrangements regarding the youth employment levy are, of course, a matter for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard rate of allowance payable to foster parents in respect of each child placed with them by a health board is £41.80 per week.  An enhanced fostering allowance of £51.80 per week is payable in respect of a child over 16 years of age.</P>
      <P>The fostering allowance is a payment to foster parents towards the cost incurred by them in bringing up the child in their own home.  Children in the care of health boards may be placed with foster parents in accordance with the provisions of the Boarding Out of Children Regulations.</P>
      <P>In this context, I would like to clarify that in the case referred to by the Deputy the three children are not in the care of the South Eastern Health Board.  They are in fact in the care and custody of their father and are minded during the day while he is at work.  The three children attend national school and the South Eastern Health Board is providing support to the family in the form of a weekly contribution to the cost of the child-minding arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of speech therapy services is primarily a matter for the Southern Health Board.  I am informed by the board that they are currently drawing up a development plan for speech therapy services in their area and are due to submit this plan in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the inadequacy of speech therapy services in certain areas of the country and I regard the expansion of such services as a priority.  In 1993, almost £200,000 of the £1.5 million additional allocation for services for people with a physical disability was devoted to this service.  Two additional speech therapy posts were approved for the Southern Health Board area in 1993. A further £1.5 million has been made available this year for services for people with a physical handicap and I expect that a proportion of this will be devoted to improving and expanding community-based therapy services, including speech therapy.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the inadequacy of the speech therapy services is the lack of sufficient numbers of trained speech therapists.  My Department has taken steps to remedy the situation by arranging for six extra training places to be provided at the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies, Trinity College Dublin commencing in the 1992-93 academic year.  The total student body will increase in phases from 80 students in 1992 to 104 students in 1995-96.  The increased level of graduate output resulting from this important development should ease difficulties in the area of speech and language therapy in the medium to long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the child referred to in the Deputy's question, I understand that her treatment resumed last month and is continuing. She is receiving two to three speech therapy sessions a week and is <Col N="1925" /> also attending the Brothers of Charity service one morning a week.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy has not previously been brought to this Department's attention.</P>
      <P>The educational needs of children who present with a serious specific learning disability are catered for in three special schools, two in Dublin and one in Cork. The schools in Dublin are: Catherine McAuley, National School, Baggot Street, Dublin 2, and St. Oliver Plunkett National School, Monkstown, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>In order to be considered for enrolment in one of these schools, a referral from a child guidance centre or a psychologist is required.  An up-to-date psychological assessment is also required and this can be arranged through the local director of community care or privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> Applications for enrolment should be made to the principal of the school in question.</P>
    <P>If the child's parent wishes to enrol him in one of these schools she should proceed on the basis set out above.  Should she encounter any difficulties in this regard, she should bring the matter to the immediate attention of my Department.</P>

      <P>Where an extra classroom is warranted due to the appointment of an additional teacher, it is my Department's general policy to grant-aid a pre-fabricated structure.  Grant-aid will be made available in respect of Ballygowan national school on this basis.</P>
      <P>However, it is open to the school management, if it so wishes, to offset this grant against the cost of a permanent classroom, with the additional cost being a local liability.</P>
