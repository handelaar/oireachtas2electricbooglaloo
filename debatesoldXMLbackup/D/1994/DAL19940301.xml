      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will accede to the request of Comhdh·il Oile·in na h…ireann that inhabited offshore islands be included as a designated area in the new local development initiative programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has decided on the areas to be included in the local development programme and a statement to this effect issued on 9 February 1994.</P>
      <P>The areas were chosen following detailed assessment involving objective and measurable indicators of disadvantage, feasible operational boundaries and viability in terms of size and economic base.  It is not proposed to add to the areas already announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the area based approach is to enable local communities to become involved in bringing about socio-economic development in their own areas.  In this context, the development of island communities is closely associated with the mainland areas to <Col N="902" /> which they relate.  Island communities will, therefore, be fully involved in the local development programme in the relevant designated areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the economy of these islands and their economic and social development is largely influenced by the remoteness of their location and peripherality?  As Comhdh·il Oile·in na h…ireann was established to represent all the islands, will the Taoiseach and the Government reconsider the decision and agree to recognise the inhabited islands off our shores as a distinct unit under this programme? Surely it is accepted that special assistance is needed to provide for the economic and social development prospects one would expect nowadays for islanders?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will agree it would be an unnecessarily complicated structure to have, for instance, Aranmore and Tory islands in a separate area from Donegal.  We decided to link islands with the hinterland closest to them as the most practical way of dealing with this.  Islands included in this programme are Achill, Clare, Inishturk, Inishbiggle, Inishbofin and the three Aran islands and off the Donegal coast, Tory, Aran and Inishfree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that previous Governments recognised the need for a unified organisation to represent the inhabitants of our offshore islands and encouraged and welcomed the establishment of Comhdh·il Oile·in na h…ireann set up specifically for that purpose with full Government support? Will the Taoiseach also accept it will be a major disappointment to the islands that the Government does not recognise this need by not agreeing to give the islands a separate, distinct status under this local development initiative programme in view of the unique and special difficulties that exist for people living on islands?</P>

      <P>The Government has not set out to disadvantage the island community any more that it is disadvantaged at present.  I recognise they are at a disadvantage.  We had to consider if it would be better to keep the islands together or to link them to their own hinterlands.  The committee examining this issue decided that the islands would fare better if linked to their own hinterlands.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that previous Governments saw no difficulty in agreeing to a Leader programme for the Gaeltacht areas which were equally dispersed throughout the west, just like the islands?

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the British Prime Minister and I agreed at our meeting on 19 February that the setting of a <Col N="905" /> fixed deadline for a definitive response to the declaration would not be helpful. This still remains the position.  However, repeated opinion polls have shown beyond doubt that there is, throughout this island an overwhelming and unprecedented desire among the Irish people for a just and lasting peace, following on the Joint Declaration.  There is consequently a public expectation that an early decision will be taken on a complete cessation of violence, so as to open the way to the next stage of the peace process set out in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the declaration.  At the same time, however, the British Prime Minister and I have expressed our determination that the two Governments will not allow any party to exercise a veto on political progress.</P>
    <P>To this end, we commited ourselves at our meeting ten days ago to give fresh impetus to a resumption of the three-stranded talks process, and work towards this objective is already under way.  It has been made clear by both Governments that this process of political dialogue will remain anchored in the principles of the Joint Declaration, and the framework for the talks will be on the basis of the 26 March 1991 statement.  The Irish Government will not entertain a one-sided approach that downgrades the Irish dimension and makes any discussion of it contingent on the prior achievement of an internal settlement, and that is totally contrary to the framework and the spirit of the declaration.  I find it somewhat ironic, given that such deep significance was attributed by certain parties to the difference between two verbs in the autumn of 1992, that the Ulster Unionist party sets out its position on an Irish dimension in <i>A Blueprint for Stability</i> in the following way: &ldquo;An improved future relationship between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could be developed within the terms of the Blueprint&rdquo;.  A &ldquo;would&rdquo; was the very minimum that one might have expected.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland belongs equally to both communities and we must do justice to both traditions.  As the Joint Declaration states, agreement must be &ldquo;based on full respect for the rights and <Col N="906" /> identities of both traditions in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  Given that for the present a majority wishes to retain the constitutional link with Britain, there must at the least also be North-South institutions and structures which reflect the Irish identity, strongly felt by a substantial proportion of the population.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement in part meets that need and it will remain until something at least equally satisfactory is offered in its place. In the context of our commitment to proceed jointly towards a comprehensive political settlement achieved by agreement, it would have been helpful, if a clear understanding of Sinn FÈin's intentions had emerged from the party's weekend ard-fheis.  I have noted both positive and negative statements made on that occasion, but I had said all along that I did not expect a full formal response at the ard-fheis to the Joint Declaration.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by Sinn FÈin have already been extensively clarified in my public statements on the declaration and also in private correspondence transmitted to Mr. Adams.  While I do not propose to repeat the clarifications already given, it may be useful to emphasise again the following points:</P>
    <P>First, as I have said on a number of occasions, the declaration can be clarified authoritatively by either Government. None of the clarifications which I have publicly provided has been repudiated by the British Government.  In fact, quite the opposite has been the case.  Prime Minister Major's <i>Irish News</i> article on Friday last, Sir Patrick Mayhew's recent speeches and Mr. Douglas Hurd's speech on Wednesday last all harmonise with my own statements on the declaration, and should go a long way towards redressing the Nationalist perception that the British Government did not recognise their nightmare of injustice, fear and suspicion.</P>
    <P>Second, as I said in my address to the Association of European Journalists on Thursday, it is not true to claim that Unionists have been given a veto on British Government policy in the declaration. The declaration does not prohibit the present or a future British <Col N="907" /> Government from adopting a united Ireland as a long term policy aim, should they so decide.  Sir Patrick Mayhew, on behalf of the present British Government, stated on Wednesday last: &ldquo;If the people of Ireland, North and South, do agree that a united Ireland should happen, then the British Government is bound to introduce the legislation necessary to give effect to that wish&rdquo;.  Where does the veto come into play in that situation to prevent the British Government from taking such action?</P>
    <P>The requirement of consent is an obligation on both Governments under a binding international agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  That obligation is separate from the British statutory constitutional guarantee, enshrined in their legislation since 1949, and in which, of course, the Irish Government is not involved.  As I have stated previously, acceptance of the principle of consent to constitutional change in article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement has been found by the Supreme Court in 1990 to be fully consistent with Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  The exercise of self-determination concurrently is not some external disabling condition improperly imposed by the British Government. Acceptance of the necessity of consent is inherent in the position of all democratic Nationalists on this island.  It is the way that a majority of the Irish people, through their elected representatives in Nationalist parties North and South, have already freely decided without external impediment that our national right to self-determination should be exercised.  What is important for us is not any British constitutional doctrine, to which by definition we do not subscribe, but the manner in which the Irish people's acknowledged right of self-determination is to be freely exercised, without external impediment, as underwritten by the British Government in the Peace Declaration.  The Joint Declaration accepts that Irish unity would be achieved only by those who favour this outcome persuading those who do not, peacefully and without coercion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> I welcome confirmation by Sinn FÈin given over the weekend, in response to a speech of mine last Thursday, that it is their view as well that the present Protestant and Unionist majority in Northern Ireland cannot or should not be coerced into a united Ireland.  At this stage, therefore, it is recognised by virtually everyone that a forced unity without majority consent in Northern Ireland is neither practicable, learning from the experience of Northern Ireland itself, on the basis of the Taoiseach's position set out in paragraph 5 of the Peace Declaration.  In the light of that and of my analysis here this afternoon, it does not seem to me that a continued abstract insistence on the principle of self-determination by the Irish people as a whole voting as a single unit any longer represents a justifiable obstacle standing in the way of acceptance of the Joint Peace Declaration and of bringing the violence and killing to an end.</P>
    <P>Reasonable grounds still exist, I believe, to hope that a positive response to the peace process may yet be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Se·n Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say before I hear the Deputies concerned that 30 minutes only are provided for dealing with questions to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  Does he not accept that things have moved on from the &ldquo;theological&rdquo; debate on the issue of self determination and that a new strategy is necessary to deal with the bleak scenario in Northern Ireland?  Does he agree that the continued non-acceptance of the Downing Street Declaration by Sinn FÈin-IRA is a postponement of the golden opportunity for peace and in the absence of that peace dividend the Ulster Unionist Party's proposal for an internal settlement is clearly a retreat to a political <i>cul de sac</i>?  Would he agree that the situation might be different if the Ulster Unionists had been treated a little better when they came to Dublin in a different frame of mind a year and a half ago to discuss North-South relations?  In seeking <Col N="909" /> a cessation of violence and realistic proposals from all parties for a political settlement in the North, does he see the need for his Government to pursue a new strategy and spell out detailed political proposals for a settlement?  Does he genuinely believe there is a realistic prospect of the three-strand talks process getting under way in the short term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised a number of questions.  I reiterate that the British Prime Minister and I agreed in Downing Street last Saturday week that the three-strand talks process would be the vehicle for the resumption of talks between all the parties and that the framework of the Peace Declaration would be the starting point.  It is regrettable that the Official Unionist Party has taken the view that it should seek an internal settlement.  I do not have to explain to anybody in this House that this was a dismal failure in the past.  In the last week or so Sir Patrick Mayhew stated: &ldquo;We cannot revert to a system of government in Northern Ireland with which only part of the community can readily identify&rdquo;.  I agree with the Deputy that that is the road to nowhere in trying to find a solution to the problems in Northern Ireland; in political terms, it is a <i>Cul de Sac</i>.  I have no doubt that the British Government will reassess its position on the talks with the political leaders and parties.  The Government is totally committed to a resumption of the three strand talks process and it will not accept an internal settlement.  The only way to proceed is on the basis of the three strand talks process.  We are waiting to hear from the British Government as to its views on the current situation.  We hope in due course there will be a positive response to the Downing Street Declaration from the Republican movement which will ultimately lead to a permanent cessation of violence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is obvious from statements made at the ard-fheis during the weekend that Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and Sinn FÈin are incapable of delivering <Col N="910" /> an IRA ceasefire, that they are deaf to logic or reason or even to democratic wishes of the vast majority of the people on this island and that it is time both Governments acted decisively to get the three strand talks process underway?  In that context will he adopt the same detailed and patient approach that he has adopted so far towards the IRA in ensuring that the Official Unionist Party takes part in the three strand talks process and is not cut adrift?  It is of the utmost importance that all democratic parties, whatever our differences, should sit down and talk about how we can build a new future for Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the statement made by the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, in the <i>Irish News</i> last week.  It was the first time such a statement had been made by a British Prime Minister.  Only a short time ago this would have been hailed as a tremendous achievement in the development of relationships between our two countries.  That statement was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to do that but I would like to put the statement on the record.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the British Prime Minister, who said that it was not the policy of his Government to dictate to the Irish people as to where their future lies?  Does the Taoiseach agree that this includes the Unionist-Protestant people of Northern Ireland and that those of us who claim that Republicanism, going back as far as Wolfe Tone, forms part of our heritage would strongly resist any attempt to coerce any section of the people and that true Republicans ought to remember this?  I agree with the Taoiseach that the same patience should be shown to the Unionists.  Does he agree that they do not always know what is in their best interests but that they should be able to work this out for themselves in consultation with the rest of us?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the British Prime Minister's statement was most helpful.  I took the opportunity during our meeting in Downing Street the previous Saturday to bring to his notice &mdash; the T·naiste did likewise in his meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew &mdash; that there were genuine fears and suspicions among the Nationalist community that the British Government was not fully committed to the implementation <Col N="913" /> of the principles enshrined in the Peace Declaration.  I asked the Prime Minister to take every opportunity to allay those fears.  He readily replied that he and his Ministers would.  He also said that he had received an invitation to write an article in the Nationalist newspaper in Northern Ireland and that he would make this clear in that article.  Similar statements have been made not alone by Sir Patrick Mayhew but also by Douglas Hurd.  These statements should go a long way towards allaying genuine fears and suspicions among the Nationalist community. I have described this as the Nationalist nightmare.  This conflict has gone on for centuries.  It beats me that people are being so impatient and think we can settle it once and for all in a matter of weeks.  This cannot be done.</P>

In the light of the courageous stand taken by Ulster Unionists after the Downing Street Declaration, has the Taoiseach any thoughts on how he might encourage them back to the talks process even if he has in mind an interregnum until after 9 June for that purpose?

During my visit to the United States I will take every opportunity to ensure that the American people are fully aware that Sinn FÈin/IRA have no mandate from the Irish people for violence.  We have said that repeatedly and will continue to do so.  It is clear where the American administration stand.  It delivered a clear message to Gerry Adams and Sinn FÈin at the end of his visit to the US that it fully supports the Peace Declaration and called on Sinn FÈin and everybody else to support it. There is, therefore, no doubt in anybody's mind where the American administration stands on the problems of Northern Ireland.  As recently as last <Col N="915" /> night President Clinton, during a visit by the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, reaffirmed that position of full support for the Peace Declaration. Despite the wishes of some people that we should declare the declaration dead, our statement from Downing Street last Saturday week was clear: the declaration is here to stay and the principles enshrined therein will form the basis of the next round of talks.</P>

      <P>I am not precluding any internal arrangements that may arise in the three-stranded talks process.  I should not need to remind Deputy De Rossa that the last time this was put to the Irish people was at the time of the treaty. We know that the intentions behind the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, were not fulfilled.  If the intentions expressed then in the House of Commons and in the Explanatory Memorandum of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, had been pursued we would be in a different position today.  However, they were not. Is the Deputy seriously suggesting that we again go over the course that has been tried and failed?  The Government has no intention of travelling that road again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy McGrath to the Front Bench as Education Spokesperson. Although we may differ on Education matters, we share a common concern about the problems.</P>
      <P>Where a decision has to be taken on the type of management structure to be applied to a new post-primary school erected in an area which previously did not have such a school the features of each particular case are taken into account.</P>
      <P>The wishes of parents of the area in question form one such feature for consideration. Their views will normally be communicated to me, as Minister, through a local committee of parents and education bodies such as the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>Where there are conflicting views on what represents the best and most appropriate type of management for a green-field school it rests with me as Minister to take the final decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main criteria which I and my Department use in deciding on the management structures for green-field second-level schools are:&mdash; the requirement <Col N="918" /> that the school be capable of providing a comprehensive curriculum with suitable subject choices for a wide range of pupil aptitudes, abilities and choices; the need for the school to be open to all the children of the community and to be capable of gaining the support of a wide spectrum of the community it proposes to serve, irrespective of religious denomination, social class or financial means; the desirability that the board of management should, as far as possible, be fully representative of educational, religious, parent and teacher interests; the requirement that, given the considerable expenditure of public moneys on the capital and current costs of a green-field school, I, as Minister, must be satisfied that those involved in running the school are ultimately accountable to me through my Department as regards expenditure of State funds and for the implementation of educational policy in the widest sense; the need for a green-field school, catering as it does for rapidly developing urban areas, to be flexible in its ability to adapt to changing needs in the educational area and to respond to community needs as regards, for example, the provision of an adult education programme; the desirability that such a school should, subject to the overriding claims of the school itself, be available for community use outside school hours.</P>

      <P>On the Minister's reply, is it Government policy, as stated on radio by her colleague, Deputy Brian Fitzgerald, that any new second level school will be a community college?  Will the Minister give a straight &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to that question?</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister is not prepared to say whether it is Government policy that any new second level school will be a community college.  She is fudging the issue.  Surely the Minister can say whether that is Government policy.  Did the officials in the Minister's Department agree that a voluntary secondary school could be built in Dunboyne, County Meath?  The Minister indicated that the wishes of the parents in any locality were very important in any future decision about a school. What consultations did she have with the parents in the Dunboyne area in deciding that a community college should be built there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that the decision at the end of the day rests with me.  To put in context the history of voluntary secondary schools, the last time a voluntary secondary school was erected on a green field site was in 1981 and that was in Celbridge under the Salesian Order.  Since then two community colleges have been erected in County Kildare.  The opinions of parents and the report of the vocational education committee are important in making a decision.  In regard to the area to which the Deputy referred, at all times the main concern was to have a school erected.  I was told that the body we are putting in charge is a secondary issue.  Parents are also concerned that first year students should be able to attend the school in September 1994, prior to the completion of the school.  The lobby for a school in Dunboyne was met with an announcement in regard to a number of school building programmes which included a community college for Dunboyne.  My officials and I are examining the possibility of providing classes for first year pupils in Dunboyne in September 1994 and members of the Meath Vocational Education Committee are holding talks with officials of my Department so that we can respond to the strong demand in <Col N="920" /> the area, first, for the construction of a school and, second to allow first year pupils to register prior to the completion of the building.</P>

      <P>The Department asked for the opinion of a professor of orthopaedic surgery to advise on the validity and reliability of claims about the suitability of an anticrouch device as a preventive and/or corrective measure.</P>
      <P>The professor's conclusion in the report is &ldquo;that there is no evidence to associate increased incidence of significant problems with neck, back or posture by using a flat desk&rdquo;.  He also says that &ldquo;in general terms it is probably better to have a slanting writing surface rather than to be crouched over the flat surface&rdquo;. He concludes, &ldquo;As I say there is absolutely no scientific indication that children's health is impaired by writing on a flat desk....

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I am disappointed that no notice is being taken of our young people, who do not have the best start in life, because they must spend 14 years crouched over a flat desk. Their lordosis should be in a different position from that which applies when bent over a flat desk.  I disagree with the evidence to which the Minister referred. Will she set up an expert review group &mdash; one more will not make much more difference &mdash; to consider the matter? Children's mental development is only part of their education, their physical development is equally important.  I understood from the Minister's reply that her expert adviser decided that bending over a flat desk has a negative effect.</P>

If he does I will ensure that they respond in a positive way to any new information.  In the light of available information and in response to advice sought, we learned there is no evidence <Col N="924" /> to associate increased incidence of significant problems with neck, back or posture as a result of using a flat desk.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Minister knows that doctors differ and patients die.  An expert from whom I received treatment told me that children may suffer back injury from sitting at a certain type of desk.  In the old days children had to sit up straight with their backs in a proper position and they were able to write.  That is not the case today as children spend 14 years bending over a desk, which has an adverse effect.  Will the Minister set up a review group to obtain different views on the matter?  The Minister has been given one view but I have been given another.  As a practising teacher for over 30 years I realise why my old teachers had sloping desks in the classroom and asked the pupils to sit up straight.  I thought at the time they were being contrary, but now I realise it was an important factor in education.  I hope the Minister will be enlightened and will deal with this matter.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department.</P>
      <P>I accept that despite very significant investment, of the order of £200 million in the five years 1989-93, the condition of many primary and post-primary schools still needs to be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the sub-standard accommodation is prefabricated and has reached, or is nearing, the end of its useful life.  My objective is to replace such accommodation with permanent buildings where future long term requirements justify such a course.  The programme for Government states: We will allocate an <Col N="925" /> increased amount in each of the next five years to implement a planned programme of replacing or refurbishing sub-standard school buildings.</P>
    <P>In regard to the primary section, my Department is about to launch a comprehensive national survey of the existing stock of primary school buildings.  This survey will provide detailed information on the accommodation in each national school.  It will also enable the Department to target funding for projects on a more equitable basis throughout the country.</P>
    <P>An initial pilot study of approximately 20 representative schools is now being undertaken by the Department's professional advisers.  It is intended that the national survey will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Following the good start already made in 1993 in honouring the Government commitment to replace or refurbish sub-standard school buildings, I am confident that the increased level of expenditure, provided for in the Programme for Government will eliminate, to a very significant extent, the outstanding cases of sub-standard accommodation in the primary and post primary school sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the increased allocation for school buildings this year.  Regrettably, expenditure is at almost the same level as in 1986.  There has been a huge &mdash; badly needed &mdash; loss of expenditure on schools in the interim period.  The Minister should save the money she would expend on a survey and use it for school buildings. An excellent survey has been carried out by the INTO, I am sure the Minister has a copy in her Department, which highlights sub-standard primary schools.  Is the Minister prepared to draw up a three year programme for the replacement of school prefabs as terrible prefab villages are attached to many of our schools?  Will she prepare a list of schools which require replacement of prefabs giving priority to the schools according to the conditions of the prefabs? People will be able to see what schools are on the list and their placing. <Col N="926" /> Such a list would avoid political patronage at election time and there would be no need to tell people that prefab replacements for particular schools will be provided this year or next.  People are left dangling on a string waiting for replacement of prefabs.  Will the Minister draw up a rolling over three year programme that will provide transparency in respect of the allocation of the replacement of school prefabs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a five year commitment to increase and invest money in the school building programme. The Deputy will recognise that we have made good inroads to that programme during the period of the last two budgets.  There are four reasons for using school prefabs in the national school programme, in cases of temporary increased enrolments, newly established Gaelscoileanna or multi-denominational schools, where additional teachers are appointed, or to replace sub-standard prefabs.  It would not be possible to eliminate the use of prefabs in national schools.  There are short term reasons for their use.  There are three reasons for using prefabs in second level schools where demographics challenge the Department's resources in respect of available school buildings.  They would be used in cases where additional urgent accommodation is required, where there is a short term increase in enrolment and for the addition and replacement of buildings where current finance does not provide for permanent buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will always be a need for school prefabs.  However, there are good prefabs as well as eyesores.  When I visit schools it is mainly the eyesores I am asked to inspect.  I am determined that with investment over a number of years we will be able to replace unsuitable accommodation.  Next week I hope to launch the Department's building programme guidelines.  They will enable us move from the suggestion that there may have been political patronage in a grant to school buildings.  There are clear guidelines involved in providing school buildings and I must be satisfied that the <Col N="927" /> boards of management and the school management are aware of the stages of an application, the different levels of contact and steps that must be taken.  I will make that information available in booklet form to the primary schools sector.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Deputy's suggestion that the recommendations in the INTO survey should be addressed in an effort to replace school prefabs, I have a copy of the survey and I will take its findings on board.  I intend to have a fair, open and transparent policy on school buildings. The Department should have its itinerary in respect of the order in which school buildings should be replaced. When I negotiate annual funding with the Department of Finance in respect of the Department it would be useful to have a list of priorities to ensure that where moneys are available they are directed to those most in need.  In the light of the INTO survey and the guidelines that will be presented shortly any whiff of political patronage will be removed from my policy in respect of school buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister agrees with my proposal.  She talked about transparency and said she is not in favour of political patronage.  I take it she will draw up a three year list and make it available to us.  If a new prefab is needed or a special case is made for a school, I have no difficulty in having that added to the list, but there must be transparency. I taught in a prefab in my early days and I know what it is like &mdash; they are draughty and damp and generally you are removed from the school building and have to cross the yard to use the toilet.  Perhaps if the Minister had taken action before now it might not have been agreed to hold a strike next week in Ballinagh, County Cavan, as a result of school conditions. It is proposed to hold a similar strike next week in Woodbrook, County Roscommon, due to school conditions there.  I would ask the Minister to draw up a priority list for schools to ensure they are maintained in reasonable condition.</P>

      <P>Money was made available in this year's budget to refurbish the school at Ballinagh.  Very late in the day it was indicated to the Department that rather than agreeing to a refurbished school, the parents and management of that school were seeking a new school.  I was satisfied that the proposals for refurbishment would meet the needs of the school and, considering the budgetary restraints, I was not in a position to make provision for a new school.</P>
      <P>I do not have a closed mind on these matters, as I indicated to the INTO representative in Monaghan on a recent visit there, but there is not much money remaining in the 1994 purse.  When I announced the 72 projects for 1994, they did not include a new school for Ballinagh. Discussions are still ongoing on this matter.  The Deputy also referred to another dispute.  It would be useful for the Department to have an itinerary so that we could, in an ordered way, ensure that schools are refurbished, prefabs replaced and sanitation facilities provided &mdash; 200 schools will benefit in that regard.  This work should be done in an orderly way so that the needs of the community are met.</P>

      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 10, 26, 46 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1993 the expert advisory group on third level student support was asked (a) to recommend appropriate criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means, with reference to equity and the financial capacity of parents and applicants to pay and (b) to examine and make recommendations for the most effective organisational arrangements for the administration of the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently received the group's report and further to the recommendations contained therein I have brought a number of major proposals to Government to improve the conditions and administration in the third level student support schemes.  As a result the Government has agreed already to implement the following improvements: The establishment of a central agency to process grant applications and payments, and thereby dramatically improve the service to students &mdash; this will take effect for the 1995-96 academic year; the abolition of the separate attainments for eligibility for a grant &mdash; this will ensure that all students who have secured a college place will <Col N="930" /> now qualify for a grant subject to their meeting the means test; the introduction of new rules for second chance cases &mdash; this is to ensure students who did not complete their initial studies will be eligible to apply for grants for second chance courses after five years; the provision of a discretionary budget in 1994 so as to set up a hardship fund with the third level institutions and an increase in the income limits in line with the average industrial wage and in maintenance grants in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>A more streamlined system centred on the local authority offices will be put in place in 1994.  The local authority will act as &ldquo;a one stop shop&rdquo;, to facilitate students in submitting their applications for a grant under the existing three schemes. It is intended that local authorities will provide students with information, advice and the appropriate forms for the three schemes in 1994.  In 1995 their role in advising students will continue and each authority will, through the use of specific officials, have priority access to CAO on behalf of the students.</P>
    <P>The Government is continuing its study of the other significant findings in the report, and will be in a position to put forward a range of additional measures designed to ensure greater equity in the operation of the schemes and to improve access to third-level education.  I am committed to publishing the report and will do so.  However, I do not propose to do so until the Government has completed its deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that she undertook in this House last December to publish the report in February.  I put it to her that the reason she has not published it is that it recommends significant changes in the method by which means are calculated for grant purposes, which would deal with the unfairness at present experienced by the children of PAYE workers who do not qualify for grants on grounds of means. Very often the children of well-off self-employed people and farmers qualify because of the way in which they manage their tax affairs.</P>

      <P>I announced to the House the dramatic changes that would be put in place in response to the need for more effective organisational arrangements for administration of the schemes.  I am satisfied that these administrative changes will result in great improvements in terms of accessibility to the system.  The three schemes will be amalgamated into one which will be administered by one agency and the maintenance and fee element will be index linked.  It was recommended that appropriate criteria be put in place for assessment of eligibility on the grounds of means, with reference to equity and the financial capacity of parents and applicants to pay.  On the administrative aspect, having brought this matter before the House, I was able to put in place the recommendations of the report.  Similarly, in this area when the Government has considered the recommendations I will publish the report and bring it before the House.</P>

Why does this report somehow constitute a State secret &mdash; it cannot be published in advance of the Government making a decision on it?  We should have the kind of openness in Government which the Minister has been so keen to expound. In regard to the assessment of means, does the report recommend a change in the way means are assessed and income is calculated for the purposes of student grants so that the wealth and assets, rather than taxable income, of the self-employed and farmers will be assessed for the purposes of student grants?</P>

      <P>I take objection to the Deputy's suggestion that the easy part of the job has been done.  I would refer Deputies to the welcome given by people outside this Chamber to the dramatic improvements which have been put in place &mdash; the establishment of a central agency, the abolition of certain attainment requirements, the establishment of second chance places, the allocation of a discretionary budget for hardship cases, increases in the income limits with the average industrial wage and increases in maintenance grants in line with inflation. To rubbish that sort of package is not fair to the students who will submit their applications this year and, more importantly, next year, and whom I am sure the Deputy hopes to represent.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to publish this report as promised.  There is a difference between publishing the report and the Government acting on the recommendations in that report.  Why will the Minister not publish the report so that we can discuss it and talk to her about it?  The Minister can then bring forward her proposals.  What discussions did the Minister have with county councils and vocational education committees concerning the changes she proposes to implement in third level grants and in the processing of same?  I am sure the Minister is aware that there is much expertise in local authorities in regard to the processing of grant applications.  Will local authorities lose staff as a result of the transfer of this process from them to the CAO office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect local authorities to lose staff as a result of this transfer.  I know this expertise exists within local authorities and that is why I am very happy to leave responsibility for the latter part of the process with them. All of us know officials who, from their dealings with the three schemes and answering the multiplicity of queries which arise, have developed an expertise in this area.  This expertise can be utilised. <Col N="936" /> Information on problems raised by students who have passed this hurdle and who are now part of the system is of more benefit to students who come on stream in later years.  The recommendation for a one stop shop is to ensure that such expertise is and continues to be available to students, although the central processing office would now be located with the CAO.  The expert committee invited people to give their views about the administration of the scheme and I have now asked the Department to communicate with the local authorities regarding their role.  This year is slightly different in that we continue to administer three schemes.</P>
      <P>As I said in the House last December, we are bringing forward the schemes to May which will relieve some of the burden.  Because of the lateness of the schemes and the different choices being made by students, the schemes have been a great burden on local councils.  In the streamlined scheme it will be much easier for students to tap into the available expertise.  Information will be provided not only at the form stage; we will be asking each of the councils to identify one or two officials to the CAO so that they can gain access to the CAO on behalf of their students.  That would be a priority access over the individual queries that would be handled by the CAO.</P>

      <P>There are two problems facing people requesting grants, one of which relates to administration.  I have given lengthy replies here which indicate that people on incomes up to £20,000 and over &mdash; depending on the size of the <Col N="937" /> family &mdash; qualify for these grants.  Prior to my coming into office in 1992 generous increases were made in that year to the scheme.  In the announcement that I made this year, we have linked the maintenance and fee elements to increases in inflation.  As Minister for Education I have a responsibility to ensure that access to third level education is available to more students and I can assure this House that that is my main concern.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of capitation grant paid in respect of each pupil in secondary school; the date on which the capitation grant was last increased; the amount the grant would now be if it had been increased in line with annual inflation increases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The capitation grant payable in the case of secondary schools is £150 per pupil.  This rate has been in operation since 1990.</P>
      <P>The provision this year is being increased by £2.768 million, which represents an increase of 9 per cent.  The increased provision will be distributed with particular emphasis on disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>The details of the disbursement are being finalised and I will be making an announcement on the matter shortly. Had the rate of grant been increased in line with inflation since 1990, when it was last increased, it would now be £161.40, an increase of 7.6 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that no organisation, institution or individual would accept a pay freeze for four years, which is the present position?  The capitation grant is all that is available to schools to assist them with the running costs, heating and maintenance of the schools.  It has been proven in a survey carried out by the Department of Education that there is massive discrimination against voluntary secondary schools when one considers that they <Col N="940" /> receive £150 per capita for each student, whereas a vocational school receives £295 and a community comprehensive receives £258 per student.  Why has the voluntary secondary system been discriminated against so heavily?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the level of capitation grant and that is why in this year's budget I announced an increase of £2.768 million in the area of capitation.  We have had many lively debates in this Chamber on the unit costs facing the various types of school.  There are three groups of schools involved.  The voluntary secondary schools receive £150 per pupil.  The Protestant schools do not receive any capitation grant but are in receipt of a block grant.  In addition there are now in place the caretaking and clerical services that would have been included in the unit costs study.  There is clerical assistance in the case of schools with 200 pupils or more.  Then we move on to the different ways in which we fund students of the community comprehensive schools and Vocational Education Committee schools.  I am conscious that different payments apply.  I am sure Deputy Jim Higgins, having listened to me on previous occasions in this House, is aware that there is not a flat per capita grant because, under the various headings, there are different subheads.  I have sought an increase in the Departmental budget because the capitation grant, not alone in secondary schools but in others, has not been increased since 1990.  This was an increase that probably was overdue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, while there are many categories of grants available to schools, we have insufficient money for their payment? Does she realise that the most important committee within any school is that which raises funds for essential overheads, such as heating, telephone charges and office facilities?  Would she not agree that, resulting from the lack of an adequate capitation grant, free secondary <Col N="941" /> education is a myth, with her Department expecting schools to be run on a shoestring?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that more money would be made available for disadvantaged schools, which I welcome. Since the average will be 9 per cent, will she indicate the range of increases for schools, indicating the lowest and highest percentage increases?  Since there are many disadvantaged pupils attending schools which would not be classified as disadvantaged, does she intend to make any provision to enhance the capitation grants to those schools that may have significant numbers of disadvantaged pupils but where the schools themselves may not qualify for disadvantaged status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I am engaged in calculating the sums in respect of the range of increases I have not got the figure for the House at present.  When I announced at budget time the increase in capitation grants, which affects not only secondary schools but also second-level students, I said we would be making specific arrangements to target some additional payment to schools deemed to be disadvantaged under the criteria used by my Department.  That was something we put in place at primary level last year which was generally welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Gilmore's supplementary question about disadvantaged pupils in schools that are not classified as disadvantaged, all schools will qualify for an increase in capitation grant.  There are schools where the number of disadvantaged pupils would be such that they would meet the criteria for a payment over and above that paid to other schools.  We are monitoring the number of schools that qualify as disadvantaged under the relevant criteria. We are also examining the criteria used in deciding what is &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo;.  I promised the managerial bodies that I would inform them when we had decided <Col N="942" /> on the amounts of money involved.  The slowness arises from the fact that there are different kinds of schools at second level which must be taken into account. It will be seen that it is much easier to announce a figure in respect of primary schools on budget day.  I want to be able to make an announcement covering the range of schools and be satisfied that the money targeted at schools qualifying for disadvantage will benefit whole communities, where schools have suffered because there has not been an increase in capitation grants since 1990.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When the new capitation rates have been struck, will the Minister guarantee that those rates will be index-linked, so that the yawning gap of £20 billion between the actual cost of running schools and the rate of capitation grants will never recur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be foolish to give the House any such undertaking. However, I would hope there would be support right across the House not only for the index-linked improvements which will be effected but also for the assurance that more moneys will be made available. I am conscious of the needs of second level schools and I sought an increase in my Department budget.  Without the support of the boards of management, parents and teachers, the task of funding second level education would be even more difficult.  I hope I have the agreement of the House that there are communities who need more funds than others and that we will be in a position to announce the increases, specifying a special increase for schools that qualify for disadvantaged status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of examining the criteria for deciding on disadvantaged status the Minister is aware that there are a considerable number of anomalies.  One school will be deemed disadvantaged, while a school across the road will not.  When does the Minister expect to have a report available into these criteria?  This is absolutely critical in some areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keogh is correct in that in one case a boys' school qualified whereas the girls' school did not, generally the pupils coming from the same families.  There are questions to be posed about the enthusiasm with which the boards of management reply to invitations from my Department to declare their needs in this area.  The local inspectorate plays an important role.  I am hoping to have preliminary recommendations on the usage of such criteria available by May next.  I will make those recommendations known to Members of the House so that everybody, both within and without this House, will be informed of the ground rules to be applied when departmental funds become available.</P>
      <P>There was a commitment in the Programme for Government, in the interests of access to and equality of educational opportunity, to target resources to communities not benefiting as much as others in that respect.  I take on board Deputy Keogh's points.  Members on both sides of the House have brought to my attention some interesting deviations, even within parishes, sometimes even within the same school complex where, say, at one end the boys' section qualifies whereas the girls do not, particularly in the case of brothers and sisters within the same families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>My final supplementary relates to the point Deputy Keogh made with regard to disadvantage about which there is much disquiet, particularly in relation to its assessment.  Surely we should be examining educational disadvantage which applies in every small parish nationwide not merely in urban areas, although it may be easier to identify there.  Many people in rural schools consider they are discriminated against merely because they happen to live in such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Three criteria have been used to give an overall picture of any given community a particular school may serve, for example, the number of children of medical card holders, the number from local authority housing and <Col N="944" /> those coming from homes without any employment.  I take the point the Deputy made about rural deprivation.  Probably the urban scene springs to mind glaringly because in such areas, not alone in Dublin but also in parts of Cork and Limerick, there might be whole communities in which 90 per cent of the parents of children attending school would qualify under the headings I have mentioned. However, I am having these criteria examined.  I want to be satisfied that equity is ensured in this respect because we do not have sufficient moneys to target everybody.  We must ensure that we target the most needy.  While not committing myself in print or otherwise I hope that, by May next, the preliminary results of our examination of those criteria will be available to me.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 25 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>Guidelines were issued to vocational education commitees, who make recommendations to me on appointments to governing bodies, to ensure that a minimum representation of 40 per cent of both men and women would be achieved on governing bodies for regional technical colleges from 1 January 1994.</P>
      <P>Not all the vocational education committees have submitted complete lists of recommendations.  Of the five vocational education committees who have submitted a full list of recommendations, none have reached the required gender balance.  Of the five vocational education committees who have submitted a partial list of recommendations only one has exceeded 40 per cent female representation. One vocational education committee has as yet to submit its list of recommendations.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the recommendations I have received to date.  The Deputies will be aware that I have returned their recommendations to most vocational education committees requesting them to reconsider them in light of the inadequacy of the proposed representation of women.</P>
      <P>While I am anxious to appoint governing bodies as soon as possible I am very unhappy with the present proposals from the vocational education committees given my statutory obligation to ensure gender balance and the clearly set out policy of Government on this matter.</P>
      <P>I am actively considering the most appropriate way to proceed at this stage and I will shortly be making an announcement.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to section 6 (5) of the <Col N="946" /> Act which specifies that the Minister shall have regard to the extent to which each sex is represented and shall ensure an appropriate gender balance is determined from time to time.  In this regard attention is drawn to a Government decision to have a minimum representation of 40 per cent of both men and women on State boards within four years from March 1993.  The vocational education committees must ensure that Government policy is adhered to in making recommendations for appointments to the new governing bodies.  I have returned the recommendations to the vocational education committees and have drawn their attention to the section. However, the response of some colleges has not been to submit recommendations meeting the gender quota but rather to advise me that there may be a legal case pending against me.  It is a lively issue and one on which I shall make an announcement shortly.</P>

      <P>I assure the House I will not let the matter drift.  There are different options open to me.

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Carlow County Council has 20 members, two of whom are women.  This represents 10 per cent.  Only one woman on the vocational education committee retired. Is it fair that Carlow Regional College should be left without a management board because a woman cannot be appointed?  It might make more sense if the Minister had waited until after the next election when perhaps there would be a greater number of women members.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that as a logical plea.  Carlow has 19 nominations and two are women.  This represents 11 per cent of the total.  It is within the power of the vocational education committee to make appointments.  We are talking about 17 ordinary members, six nominated by the vocational education committee, two members of the academic staff, one member of the nonacademic staff, two registered students of the college and one member nominated by ICTU.  It is within the power of any vocational education committee to invite not only elected members but other members.  Unless everyone considers the matter in this light things will not change and I am determined that they will change.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies are probably aware a substantial expansion of the scheme was announced recently in the context of the budget.</P>
      <P>The period of employment necessary to be eligible for participation in the scheme has also been reduced recently from 12 to six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July last year the eligibility requirements for the scheme were amended to provide that up to 10 per cent of places on the scheme would be reserved for lone parents and other categories, including those for whom adult dependent social welfare allowances are payable.  This amendment will mainly benefit women. In 1991-92 prior to this amendment, information available showed that 35 per cent of VTOS participants were women. This compares with the figure of 13 per cent for the percentage of women among <Col N="949" /> the long term unemployed.  Information available since the amendment would indicate that the proportion of women on the scheme is now substantially greater. The question of child-care facilities in the case of the VTOS is under consideration at present.</P>
    <P>I will be keeping the representation of women on VTOS under review in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare, and everything possible will be done to ensure that the level of participation of women on the scheme is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Discussions are underway currently with the European Commission on the <i>National Development Plan 1994-1999</i> with a view to agreeing the Community Support Framework, which will set out the broad national and sectoral strategies for the use of EU Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, they could learn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national authorities decide their development strategy and on the basis of this put forward their proposals for expenditure in the structural area, including the use of the Structural Funds and <Col N="951" /> domestic resources, in the development plan.  The plan is then discussed with the European Commission and on foot of those discussions the Community Support Framework is agreed.  The Community Support Framework will set out, <i>inter alia,</i> the development objectives, the priorities adopted for Community assistance and the indicative financing plan.  Following adoption of the Community Support Framework, the operational programmes are approved.  These set out in more detail the objectives and measures for each of the main sectors. The programmes are the legal basis for the commitment of EC aid.</P>
    <P>In addition to expenditure proposals which will be aided under the Community Support Framework, Ireland's plan includes investments to be aided by the Cohesion Fund, to be aided under Structural Funds Community initiative programmes and to be aided under the EFTA Cohesion Fund in the 1994-99 period.  These are governed by different administrative procedures from the Community Support Framework and are not part of the current negotiations.  The plan also includes eligible national structural expenditure not proposed for EU aid and 1993 expenditure, including 1993 EU aid.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the allocation of resources to Ireland agreed by the Commission in July 1993 falls within the range 8.1 to 9.3 billion ECU in 1992 prices.  Converting to Irish pounds and to 1994 prices, this is equivalent to a range of £6.9 billion to £8 billion.</P>
    <P>In October 1993, the Commission decided the amounts on which it would negotiate Community Support Frameworks (CSFs) for the disbursement of the Structural Funds in the period 1994-99. These amounts do not cover all the resources in the range because 1993 Structural Fund resources were already allocated and Community initiatives and Cohesion Fund resources are dealt with separately.</P>
    <P>Community Support Frameworks are broad statements of priorities and commitments and the indicative amounts of Community assistance contained in them <Col N="952" /> may be subject to adjustment during the implementation period.  For Ireland, the CSF amount expressed in 1994 prices is 5.62 billion ECU or IR£4.54 billion.  As regards Community initiatives no allocations to member states have yet been made.  The Government considers that Ireland will receive at least IR£400 million in aid under the initiatives in the period 1994 to 1999.  Cohesion Fund resources over the period 1994-99 are expected to be in line with the figure included in the National Development Plan.  The Government is confident that it will prove possible to draw down the full £7.84 billion EC aid on which the National Development Plan was based in the period up to 1999.</P>
    <P>Since the plan was submitted in October there have been extensive discussions between the various Government Departments involved and the Commission services.  These have been on an informal basis until recently as the Commission services were still engaged in internal consultations before arriving at an overall Commission approach to the Community Support Framework.  The discussions have now moved into a more formal phase with the first formal meeting in Dublin on 18 February 1994. Exactly the same process is being gone through in the other member states. There is nothing unique to Ireland about all this.</P>
    <P>Naturally, there are issues on which the Commission require clarification and there are areas where they have suggestions for adjustments to improve the overall effectiveness of the measures proposed in the plan.  This is not an adversarial process; we view it rather as a constructive one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>To the extent that the discussions between the Government Departments and the Commission services can refine and improve the measures in the plan it is all to the good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> Thus there may be adjustments to be made to the plan but we would expect these to be largely at the margins or within particular expenditure areas, with the Community Support Framework reflecting the overall strategies and priorities identified in the plan.</P>
    <P>The Commission services are of course concerned to ensure that the best return is obtained from the Community funding. This view is shared fully by the Government.</P>
    <P>A large number of evaluations have been carried out on behalf of Departments in relation to previous Community Support Framework and operational programmes.  It should be noted that the results of these evaluations have been generally positive.  A high priority will continue to be given on an ongoing basis to evaluation and streamlining the operation of the funds.</P>
    <P>The discussions with the Commission are being conducted at official level.  To a large extent they are of a technical nature.  They are being overseen by the Ministers and the Commissioners responsible for Structural Funds.  Ministers and Commissioners will keep in touch with each other as necessary.</P>
    <P>In the light of the discussions with the Commission, the Government will be considering the investment to be included in the Community Support Framework consistent with the Commission decision on the EU aid currently available for Ireland's Community Support Framework. The Government is confident that, over the full period of the plan up to 1999, it will prove possible to undertake all the investment in the plan and to draw down the full £7.84 billion EC aid on which the plan was based, taking account of the mid-term review which will take place in 1996.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to get involved in commenting on any of the details of the discussions as they progress.  This would be neither helpful nor appropriate.  It could indeed give rise to distortions with relatively minor issues being blown out of proportion.  The Community Support Framework when agreed will be published.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> There is no delay in the discussions on the Community Support Framework.  At this stage only one Community Support Framework, that for Portugal, has been approved.  In that case the development plan was submitted in July 1993.  The discussions on the Irish Community Support Framework are well advanced by reference to progress on the Community Support Frameworks generally, and I expect them to be concluded over the next month or so.  Discussions on the operational programmes are proceeding in parallel with those on the Community Support Framework with a view to having the programmes approved at the same time as or shortly after adoption of the Community Support Framework.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer is in the same order of deception as the original plan.  We have 1992 money and 1993 and 1994 prices but the important thing is that for the first time the Minister has admitted that policy has to be decided first and the money is decided afterwards. He is now telling us, in as near to plain language as he ever gets, that the Taoiseach and the T·naiste have been deceiving the Irish public and this House since November 1992.</P>

The Minister has made it quite clear again <Col N="955" /> that the figure of £5.355 billion in the National Plan for the Community Support Framework was wrong.  He has told us that the figure is now £4.5 billion, £800 million less than the figure in this rag of a document that was produced.  Is the Minister aware that the T·naiste last night grudgingly admitted that the Government will have to look to its own resources to make up this plan?  Is the Minister aware that the only resource the Government has is what it extracts from taxpayers and what it can borrow?  Is he not now facing the reality that programmes that do not qualify for European Union funding, for example health, apart from Tallaght hospital, local authority housing, education security and emergency services will have to be cut if this bunch of Ministers are to have any hope of covering their backsides against the retribution they deserve for what they have been involved in up to now?</P>

      <P>Corporation or local authority housing, security services or payment for army duty was never covered by EU aid.  Regarding what the T·naiste said last night, the aid available in the earlier years will be less than projected in the plan and we will have to make some adjustments for that.  That position has been recognised since last autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The aid figure in the plan is not the figure that was approved in October.  The shortfall as far as the Government is concerned will have to be made up, the majority of it I hope in the <Col N="956" /> mid-term review in 1996.  Already this year we took up some of the shortfall in 1994 by the addition of Exchequer aid. Deputy Dukes is right in that that is an option for the Government and the decision will be made in the light of annual estimates as usual.</P>

      <P>We have managed over the last ten years or so to secure extra Structural Funding by maximising our various programmes, particularly our community initiative programmes.  We can do that successfully again.  A large part of the National Plan relates to the private sector and it would be prudent of the Government to maximise the elements of the National Plan that will benefit both the State and the private sector.  We will negotiate on the basis that we will achieve as much as possible of the overall figure and we hope to get fairly near the total.</P>

Is it not a fact that the Minister insulted the intelligence of the Irish people time and time again by telling them that the figure was £8 billion and that the Taoiseach said the figure was as near to £8 billion as made no difference, when the real figure was £7.2 billion?  Did not the Minister again insult this House right up to last week by stonewalling and saying that there is no problem about that £8 billion?  Did the Minister not insult two of Ireland's best friends in Europe, Commissioner Millan and President Delors, and literally bite the hand that feeds us?  When we are talking about £800 million, we are not talking about trimmings or money on the margins but about the deletion of substantial projects.  What are those projects?</P>

      <P>It would be foolish of us to delete projects from the National Plan before negotiations on the Community Support Framework, when we can take account of the priorities and the aspirations of the Commission.  We have our objectives and the Commission has its.  In the normal course of the cut and thrust of negotiations, we have to reach an understanding on that.  We have to align ourselves for a mid-term review in less than two years' time and we have to take into account the best way of spending Exchequer money if we have any.  It would be ludicrous to start eliminating projects which last autumn we felt were worth putting into the plan five years before the end of the plan.  The Government has no intention of doing this.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister is confused, but perhaps I could help him in his confusion.  When this plan was published on 10 October 1993 the presumption was that we would get £8 billion, ten days later the Minister was told of a decision by the European Union 17 member Commission that we would only get £7.2 billion. In the simplest arithmetic that is £800 million less.  Why has the Minister for Finance and his Government colleagues continued, with bluff and bluster, in their attempt to mislead the Irish people into thinking we will get more than that?  Will he tell the Irish public that in subsequent years Spain, Portugal or Greece will not again be in the position where they are unable to draw down their full share and that we will not benefit from such a bonus again?  Will he confirm that his officials will present revised proposals <Col N="958" /> for the plan to the European Commission on this Thursday?  Will he give a commitment that the taxpayer will not be asked to pick up the tab for £800 million, the shortfall resulting from the Minister's bungling and ineptitude?</P>

      <P>On the same day the European Commission ratified the Irish financial prospectus for 1994-99, it stated categorically that there will be a mid-term review.  President Delors and Commissioner Millan have stated on several occasions that they would expect, and even hope, that Ireland would achieve a substantial increase in the mid-term review.  I cannot tell the House what the result of this mid-term review in two years time will be.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 20 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Molloy &mdash; The failure to provide funding to commence work on the home of a person (details supplied) in County Galway, despite a recommendation in July 1992 by the Western Health Board chief medical officer that a disabled person's house improvement grant be approved in this case; and whether the 1994 allocation under this scheme will be improved to enable Galway County Council to proceed with new works under this scheme; (2) Deputy Harney &mdash; Public concern arising from reports that a revised National Development Plan is to be submitted to Brussels; persistent indications that the EU Commission is unhappy with a number of the proposals contained in the plan; and the need to clarify the current status of the plan submitted to the Commission in October 1993; (3) Deputy Deasy &mdash; The future of the early potato industry on the south coast, particularly in County Waterford; <Col N="1094" /> (4) Deputy Quill &mdash; Whether the consultants' report on Irish Steel will be made available to the workforce; if so, when it will be made available; and the action it is intended to take arising from the recommendations contained in the report; (5) Deputy Dan Wallace &mdash; The urgent need to replace the windows in St. Patrick's national school, Gardiner's Hill, Cork, which are in a very dangerous condition; (6) Deputy Sheehan &mdash; The urgent necessity to grant postal voting rights to fishermen; (7) Deputy Dukes &mdash; The anomalies in the assessment of farm income for the purpose of determining eligibility for higher education grants; and reported proposals to the effect that assets such as land should in future be taken into account in carrying out such assessments; (8) Deputy Dermot Ahern &mdash; Two incidents which occurred in the Silverbridge area of County Armagh on Thursday, 24 February and Saturday, 26 February 1994, involving civilians and British Army personnel; (9) Deputy Allen &mdash; The problems at Irish Steel in view of recent disclosures that there may be substantial job losses at the plant; and the need to publish the consultants' report on the company; (10) Deputy Gilmore &mdash; The inadequate housing allocation for 1994 communicated to D˙n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council; (11) Deputy Theresa Ahearn &mdash; The closure of St. Joseph's College secondary school, Cahir, County Tipperary, leaving 120 students without secondary education from July 1994; and the proposals for the continuation of secondary education for the students involved and for the future employment of the present staff; (12) Deputy Michael Ahern &mdash; The need to clarify the situation pertaining to Irish Steel Limited following the recent consultants' report, as reported in the media, which is causing great anxiety among the workforce; (13) Deputy Sargent &mdash; The testing of ferries which has taken place since the passing of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992; the level of progress in this area; and the plans to ensure maximum safety on ferries; (14) Deputy Jim Higgins &mdash; The impact the shortfall of £800 million in Structural <Col N="1095" /> Funds will have on projects and the operational programme for the western region as contained in the National Development Plan.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill gives legal effect to the increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget and provides for other improvements to strengthen the social welfare code for families, workers, carers, lone parents and others who rely on social welfare.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, the Government is more than maintaining the real value of social welfare payments by providing increases in the weekly rates from next July of 3 per cent for more than 822,000 people and their 627,000 dependants which includes pensioners, widows, lone parents and families who are out of work because of illness or unemployment, and extra increases which amount to; 10 per cent for 112,000 people getting disability or unemployment benefits, and 6 per cent for 185,000 people on the lowest short term payments such as unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance to bring them up to the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> We are providing a major extra cash boost for 1,100 invalidity pensioners over age 66 who will get an increase of £10.20 a week in their personal rates of pension to bring them up to the old age contributory pension rate of £71 a week.</P>
    <P>I am introducing for the first time a new survivor's pension covering widowers on the same basis as widows.  From October for the first time some 9,000 widowers will be eligible for a contributory pension on either their own or their late spouse's PRSI record.  We are improving child benefit for 270,000 children through an increase in the rates from £20 to £25 for the third child and from £23 to £25 for each child thereafter.  We are extending the weekly income thresholds for eligibility for family income supplement by £10 thereby giving an additional £6 a week to 9,600 families.</P>
    <P>We are introducing a package of measures to support jobs in hard-pressed labour intensive sectors, such as clothing manufacturing and footwear, and to help those at work on low pay.  These measures include PRSI reliefs for employers and levy exemptions which will amount to a cash injection of some £89 million in support for jobs in labour intensive sectors.</P>
    <P>The measures include a reduction in the employer's share of PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent where employees earn £173 or less per week; an exemption from both the 1.25 per cent health contribution and the 1 per cent employment and training levy for employees and self employed people on low incomes; the ending of the liability of employers of medical card holders to pay the levies &mdash; 2.25 per cent &mdash; on behalf of these employees; a new two year employers' PRSI exemption scheme, and improvements in family income supplement for families at work on low pay.  Part of this package includes an increase in the PRSI ceiling for employers to £25,800, instead of £22,200, to offset a portion of the £46 million cost of the PRSI reductions.</P>
    <P>I am improving the means-test by giving additional disregards which will benefit carers whose spouse is working, lone parents who take up employment, <Col N="1103" /> and certain unemployed people who earn extra income from traditional indigenous activities, such as seaweed gathering on the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>We are continuing certain secondary social welfare benefits, such as rent supplements, in the case of unemployed people and other social welfare recipients who are participating in community employment or educational opportunities initiatives at second or third level.  I am exempting certain casual workers from the requirement to have to incur a &ldquo;substantial loss of employment&rdquo; in order to qualify for unemployment benefit.  I am providing authority to social welfare inspectors to investigate a claim by an Irish resident for social security payments from another member state of the EU, at the request of that member state, and we are requiring contractors and sub-contractors to produce employment records for social welfare inspectors and to make them liable in certain circumstances to repay social welfare payments fraudulently received by an employee.</P>
    <P>For the first time in the history of the State, I am introducing a contributory pension for widowers which will put widows and widowers on equal terms in relation to survivor's pension provision. This new pension is a huge breakthrough in the development of our social insurance system and puts Ireland foremost among our European Union partners in providing equal treatment for men and women who become widowed.</P>
    <P>It is by far the most significant social welfare measure to be introduced since I brought the self-employed into social insurance in 1988.  More than 9,000 widowed men and their families will benefit for the first time under the new arrangements which will come into effect from next October.  Under those arrangements, men and women who are widowed will be able to qualify for a contributory pension on the same basis, that is on either their own or their late spouse's PRSI record and subject to the same contribution conditions.  The cost of the new survivor's pension will be <Col N="1104" /> about £6 million this year and up to £27 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The implementation of equality of treatment between men and women in the area of survivors benefits has been under consideration at European Union level for some years, but little progress has been made.  I understand from the National Pensions Board that some ten OECD countries provide pension payments to both widows and widowers but, generally speaking, more stringent qualification conditions apply to men.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this new survivor's pension underlines the Government's commitment to the principle of equality of treatment between men and women. The implementation of that principle in the social insurance area has presented us with a number of difficulties in the past because of different entitlement conditions across schemes.  However, I am convinced of the need to confront those difficulties in our own way and at our own pace.  Above all, our plans must be implemented in a fair and equitable manner while at the same time protecting the entitlements of existing recipients.</P>
    <P>There are more than 85,500 widows receiving a contributory pension at an annual cost of £282 million.  I want to make it clear that their situation will not be changed in any way by the introduction of this new equal treatment measure.</P>
    <P>This progressive move is a practical recognition of our changing family structure. Given our young population, increasingly both spouses are participating in the workforce.  In these circumstances, a surviving spouse &mdash; whether a woman or man &mdash; with the responsibility of a young family is clearly in need of income support.  I am pleased that the Government decided to introduce this progressive measure which is a major breakthrough in the development of pension provision in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to provide in this Bill for an extra increase for older invalidity pensioners which was not announced at budget time.  This is a very significant improvement for those who are among the most vulnerable in our soceity.  This <Col N="1105" /> special increase is in line with the recommendation of the National Pension Board.  Some 1,100 invalidity pensioners who have attained age 66 years will from next July have their weekly pensions boosted up to the old age (contributory) pension level.  This increase will mean an extra £10.20 a week for a single person bringing their new weekly payment to £71.  A married couple currently getting £100.90 will receive £112.30, an increase of £11.40 a week.  Under this Bill, child dependent increases for larger families dependent on invalidity pension have also been substantially improved.  The weekly rate goes from £14.90 to £15.20 for each of the first two children and from £12.80 to £15.20 for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the D·il today contains a number of important measures which, taken together, will bring about substantial changes in the system of PRSI contributions and the various income levies directed at supporting jobs in labour intensive industries and those at work on low pay.  Deputies should also be aware of the other budget measures dealt with in the Finance Bill, namely, the abolition for all taxpayers of the 1 per cent temporary income levy plus the improvements in the income tax regime relating to exemption limits, personal allowances and the expansion of the tax bands.  The net effect of these measures proposed here today plus the other related measures in the Finance Bill is clear, simple and directed at what we all agree is our greatest national priority &mdash; the creation and maintenance of jobs.</P>
    <P>The cost to employers of creating and retaining jobs has been cut while take home pay for employees will be improved.  The incentive for employers to create jobs and the incentive for unemployed people to seek and take up those jobs will be enhanced as never before. Against the background of an improving economic climate internationally and low domestic interest rates I would expect these measures to contribute towards a better employment performance over the coming years.  I hope to see both a more rapid creation of new jobs and the maintenance <Col N="1106" /> of existing jobs in the labour intensive sectors at which these measures are directed.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides for a new employers' PRSI exemption scheme which will operate on a similar basis to the very successful 1993-94 scheme which has generated some 4,250 jobs over the past two years.  Under the new scheme, employers who take on additional employees from the live register between 6 April 1994 and 5 April 1995 will not have to pay the employer's share of PRSI contributions in respect of those employees during the two year period 6 April 1994 to 5 April 1996, provided the employees concerned represent a net increase in the number of employees in their employment over that applying on 21 February 1994.  The value of this concession to an employer is considerable. It can be worth £1,268 a year in respect of a new employees with earnings of £200 per week.</P>
    <P>Section 7 introduces a new employers' PRSI contribution of 9 per cent down from 12.2 per cent, which will apply across all sectors of employment in cases where an employee earns £173 or less per week.  The cost of this concession to the social insurance fund is substantial &mdash; in the region of £31 million this year.  In order to offset it in part, the contribution ceiling on the employer's contribution has been raised to £25,800 instead of £22,200.  This will contribute an estimated £3 million this year bringing the net cost of these PRSI changes to £28 million in 1994.  The full year investment in this concession is £46 million.  Even those sectors which do not receive a direct boost because their staff earn more than the £173 per week threshold will benefit through their purchases of services &mdash; catering, cleaning and courier services, for example &mdash; from firms who do.</P>
    <P>I will keep the possibility of further concessions on PRSI under review.  The social insurance fund, which is the source from which the various social insurance benefits are paid, is in a sound financial state and it is this which has allowed me to make the present concession.  This is <Col N="1107" /> in part due to the continued success of our efforts to reduce black economy working. The value of these activities is clear; in that they improve receipts to the fund and they allow rates for the legitimate economy to be set at the lowest possible level.  I would hope, having regard to the primary objective of the social insurance fund which is to provide pensions and benefits for workers, to continue down the road of shaping the PRSI system so as to encourage employment.</P>
    <P>Employers will also benefit from the waiving of the health contribution and the employment and training levy for low paid workers.  Up to now they have been responsible for paying these levies on behalf of employees who are medical card holders.  These levies amount to 2.25 per cent resulting in an employer's PRSI contribution of 14.45 per cent in some cases.  It is estimated that 100,000 workers have medical cards so the measure will represent a significant benefit &mdash; of up to £200 per employee &mdash; for their employers.</P>
    <P>This move will not only reduce PRSI costs but it will also simplify administration of the system for all 125,000 employers.  This measure is in line with the advice of the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems in their interim report. The waiving of these levies, provided for in sections 33 and 34 of the Bill, is not confined to people with medical cards but will also provide a boost to the take home pay of all lower paid employees and self-employed people who do not have medical cards.  From 6 April 1994, employees who earn £173 or less per week and self-employed people whose annual income is £9,000 or less will no longer be liable to pay the 2.25 per cent levies.  The combined cost of these two measures is estimated at £25.6 million in 1994 and £43 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the combined impact of the new low rate of employers' PRSI and the levies exemptions amounts to a major boost &mdash; to the tune of about £89 million a year &mdash; in the lower paid sectors of the economy.  About 80,000 employers that <Col N="1108" /> is two thirds of all employers, 400,000 employees and occupational pensioners and about 60,000 self-employed people will benefit from one or more elements of this package.  Add in the PRSI exemption scheme and the family income supplement and it is clear that we are making a major investment in jobs.  I am making this investment in the expectation of a return in the form of jobs retained and jobs created and jobs made increasingly available to long term unemployed people.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement has shown a dramatic increase of almost 25 per cent on this time last year.  There are now some 9,600 families receiving FIS and over 30,000 children benefiting from this payment.  The measures in this Bill will give FIS recipients an additional £6 per week in their weekly payment from next July.</P>
    <P>An overall increase of 10 per cent in unemployment benefit and disability benefit will increase the payment for recipients up to £61 per week.  That arises from a decision of the Government to discontinue pay related benefit payable with unemployment benefit in the case of new claims only with effect from next July.  Those savings are being devoted in full towards this special increase which will also apply to disability benefit, from which pay related benefit was discontinued in 1992.  The special additional increase will cost an extra £2.7 million this year.</P>
    <P>Other measures in the Bill include sections 3 and 4 which deal with increases in the weekly rates of social insurance and social assistance payment.  Section 5 deals with increases in child benefit. Sections 7 to 10 provide an increase in the ceiling in respect of PRSI contributions by employees from £20,000 to £20,900 per annum and an increase in respect of self employed from £20,000 to £20,900 per annum.  Section 9 provides for an increase from £235 to £250 in the annual rate of voluntary contribution. Sections 11 to 14 cover the new survivor's pension which will be brought into operation by way of a commencement order at the beginning of October.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> There is a number of improvements in means tests.  Section 15 provides for improvements in the means test for lone parent's allowance while section 16 provides for improvements in the means test for carer's allowance.  These improvements will come into effect from 28 July next.  An additional 500 carers will get the allowance for the first time and a further 350 existing carers will get increases in their weekly payments.  A full-time carer with a spouse earning £160 a week, who would not previously have been entitled to any payment, will receive a weekly carer's allowance of £34.</P>
    <P>Section 18 introduces a number of improvements in the means test for social assistance schemes, including disregarding the maintenance element of higher education grants for the purposes of the third level allowance scheme; disregarding mobility allowances or rehabilitation training allowances for all social assistance payments; exempting child benefit payments received from another member state of the European Union; extending the exemption of home help income so as to include employment by an agency approved by a health board and taking regulatory powers to exempt income derived from certain prescribed activities.  I have in mind here the exemption of certain incomes from traditional activities such as seaweed collection along the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the maternity benefit scheme.  Maternity benefits will be payable in the case of a still birth after 24 weeks of the pregnancy &mdash; the current duration is 28 weeks.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in this year's budget to allow me to implement changes in the rules governing entitlement to unemployment benefit in the case of certain casual or part-time workers. Deputies will be aware of what I am trying to do here.  Section 19 exempts people engaged in casual employment from the condition of having to have sustained a substantial loss of employment before qualifying for unemployment benefit. The precise definition of casual employment will be set out in regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> Section 20 allows injury benefit and unemployability supplement, payable under the occupational injuries benefit scheme, to be integrated with disability benefit.  No one will lose out on their entitlements as a result of this measure. Section 21 deals with pay-related benefit. This section increases the weekly earnings disregarded in calculating the weekly rate of pay-related benefit from £80 to £97.50.  That is technically necessary because of the increase in the rate &mdash; this measure applies only to people who maintain their pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for an increase from £5 to £10 in the minimum weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable to single people whose means are assessed under the benefit and privilege rules. Section 26 gives legislative effect across all social welfare schemes to the six weeks after-death payment of the adult dependant allowance, where appropriate. Deputies raised this matter from time to time, and this represents a very important development.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for regulatory powers under which entitlement to certain occupational injuries benefits may be extended to categories of workers not covered at present for those benefits.  It is my intention to use the regulatory powers in this section to extend occupational injuries benefits to workers whose work arrangements have changed in recent years requiring them to become sub-contractors, and thereby insured for PRSI pensions only, rather than remain as workers insured for the full range of social insurance benefits.  Changes in working arrangements in the construction industry will receive particular attention in this regard.</P>
    <P>This is substantial social welfare legislation following on the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act which was passed last year.  It continues the Government's commitment to maintain and safeguard the position of those who depend on social welfare.  It provides for a number of other improvements, including the new survivor's pension.  I expect to bring forward further social welfare legislation in the context of addressing the recommendations <Col N="1111" /> of the final report of the National Pensions Board as well as a pensions Bill to take account of necessary regulatory changes in the occupational pensions area since the enactment of the Pensions Act, 1990.  I look forward to a constructive debate on the measures proposed in the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has to be taken in the context of how it will affect the lives of the one million Irish people living on or below the poverty line and who have no real control over how they or their families run their lives as they are dependent on the State.  The Minister, and the Government, who have spoken as much about the concept of abolishing dependency have taken no real steps in this regard.  The basic recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare have been ignored.  The Bill has no direction or vision.  It gives very little hope to those who cannot work because of sickness and those who wish to work but cannot do so because of the poverty trap.  The Bill demonstrates the Minister's lack of understanding and ideas on how to get the unemployed into real and meaningful employment.  He seems to dwell on the often meaningless schemes which offer no real hope.</P>
      <P>The high ideals and finely polished words in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> about the poor, under-privileged and unemployed are contradicted in the Bill which demonstrates a further erosion of the insurance-based system.  Unemployment benefit is means-tested for those who are made redundant and deserted wife's benefit is similarly limited.  There was an outrageous and mean attempt to means-test widow's pensions, but due to the ferocity of the reaction from many women's organisations, and the Opposition parties, the Minister did a u-turn on this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These trends are a corruption of our social insurance system and must not be allowed continue.  The attempts to means-test contributory widow's pensions <Col N="1112" /> was a reprehensible act by a Minister who is obviously out of touch with what is happening.  It was an attack on vulnerable and lonely women.  It was a hard-hearted, callous, cowardly measure and the Minister did a u-turn only when he realised he could not push his proposals through the House.  How long will it be before proposals to means-test not only widow's pensions but contributory old age pensions are again introduced?  I hope the Minister will give guarantees on this when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was published just before this Bill.  I thought this programme would give priority to addressing the unemployment crisis and that it would include a national strategy on long term unemployment and job creation, that it would deal in some way with the problems of the long term unemployed.  However, there is very little hope in the programme for the unemployed and victims of economic failure.  There are many aspirations in the programme, but the thrust of the Bill does not signal long-awaited changes that would reflect these aspirations.</P>
    <P>The Bill has failed to bring about support for the work concept and to eliminate many of the anti-family provisions in the social welfare code.  I expected concentrated attention on this whole area in view of the fact that 1994 is the Year of the Family.  I thought the trade union movement would insist on a reversal of the dirty dozen proposals, but that did not happen.  I also believed that many of the employment traps in the social welfare system would be removed.  Even though this is the Year of the Family, the substantial anti-family elements in the social welfare code are still in place. Young people are still being driven out of their parents' homes in order to qualify for unemployment assistance.  Having left home, not only do they qualify for unemployment assistance but they also qualify for a rent allowance from the health boards.  This system is not only blatantly anti-family but it is bringing about a socially undesirable situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has again ignored the plight and fears of elderly people in urban <Col N="1113" /> and rural areas who are being subjected to attacks.  They cannot ask someone to live with them for security reasons because they are afraid they may lose their free electricity and free telephone rental allowances.  This is most regrettable as the number of attacks on elderly people has increased substantially in recent years; records show that there have been thousands of attacks on elderly people living alone.  Instead the Government penalise elderly people who take steps to protect themselves.  For example, old age non-contributory pensioners stand to lose their pensions if they take in someone for security reasons; the extra household income is means-tested.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced marginal improvements in the carer's allowance scheme, but it is still desperately inadequate. When the scheme was announced it raised the hopes of many people.  The improvements announced by the Minister will bring an additional 500 people into the scheme, increasing the number of beneficiaries to approximately 5,500, approximately 10 per cent of the number of applicants for the scheme.  This inadequate scheme, coupled with the home help scheme which pays carers £2 per hour, demonstrates the Minister's totally inadequate response to the institutionalisation of elderly people who, from a socially desirable point of view, would be better off in the family home.  It would be much more cost effective for the State to do this.  This woeful situation requires a co-ordinated approach by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare. Obviously, this has not been done and both Departments are tackling the problems of the elderly on their own.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance scheme is a good idea in principle, but it has two fundamental flaws.  First, the allowance is means-tested so severely that it is out of the reach of thousands of people who should but do not qualify; and, second, there is no provision to pay the allowance, if desired, directly to the person who is disabled.  We have heard much recently about empowerment.  However, by not paying the allowance directly to <Col N="1114" /> those people who need the care and who wish to purchase or buy in care, thus retaining control over their lives, the Department is refusing to empower a certain category of people.</P>
    <P>The Department must compare the real cost of providing care or personal assistance in the home with the cost of providing institutional care and act accordingly.  The Department should consider paying the allowance directly to those individuals, particularly those with a physical handicap, who receive care or personal assistance.  This would reduce the level of dependency, a concept which still exists in this area.  The allowance should be recognised as an essential component in helping people who are ill or have a physical disability to live independent lives.  Thousands of people who are ill or disabled can and want to live non-institutionalised lives in their community and would do so if they could get varying degrees of help.  Unfortunately, the Government has not given any consideration to this concept.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problem of moneylending, which has been addressed in some way in the Consumer Credit Bill and the schemes set up by the Minister. Even though the Minister is addressing the problems on the one hand, he is encouraging them on the other.  The dirty dozen cuts and the circulars regarding rent and mortgage repayments issued to community welfare officers have and will continue to create a paradise for moneylenders. I thought it was very hypocritical of the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Joan Burton, to publicly criticise local authorities by alleging that they were driving people into the arms of moneylenders by insisting that people pay their rent arrears or else face eviction.  This is especially hypocritical in view of what she has stood over in her Department since she became Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The limitations placed on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme have caused widespread hardship and the Minister and Minister of State have guaranteed that the evil of the loan shark will continue despite the measures <Col N="1115" /> announced by the Minister.  The Department, through its policies and cutbacks, has done more to contribute to the growth in the number of loan sharks in recent times than any other factor.  The Bill has failed to deal with this terrible evil.  The highly publicised measures in the Bill are merely token gestures.  I regret to say that I believe the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials fail to understand that thousands of people are living below subsistence level, are living from day-to-day.  I know from my work in my clinics at the weekends that the pressures at Christmas, Communion, Confirmation and new school years are such that they are driving families into the arms of moneylenders.  This puts them in a no-win situation and makes it very difficult for them to break out of the vicious downward spiral in which they find themselves.  I know the Minister has involved the credit unions in the household management system.  However, the limited support given to the credit unions to bail out people in the poverty trap merely shifts responsibility from the Department of Social Welfare to the credit unions, who cannot cope with the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions I have raised in the House the issue of equality payments to women in an effort to establish why women are not receiving their entitlements in terms of transition payments as a result of the McDermott Cotter II case.  Recently at Question Time the Minister for Social Welfare said:</P>
    <P>Settlements made in the courts regarding the McDermott Cotter II case were settlements that were made privately and confidentially.  These settlements were made in court and it is not my position to say what these settlements were. </P>
    <P>This stance is totally unacceptable.  The Minister is attempting to undermine the claims for payment put forward by thousands of women.  Recently, women in Cork and in other areas met to protest at the Minister's lack of response to claims <Col N="1116" /> submitted by them.  These women are being forced to hire solicitors to pursue their claims, and in cases where settlements have been made the Minister is refusing to disclose the level of settlements to the women and to the Deputies who represent them.  I want to protest strongly at the Minister's action.  I could quote letters on my file which I have written to the Minister about his refusal to disclose information requested by me and other Deputies on behalf of women.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the House the amount paid by his Department in settling claims made prior to the 1992 regulations? Will he also state the amount paid by his Department in response to claims under the transition payments? Will he stand over statements made by senior officials in his Department that claims amounting to approximately £160 million are with his Department at present and that it is resisting these claims, not on the grounds of whether or not they are legally correct but on the grounds that the figures involved are excessive?  I have with me an opinion which states that the State will fully defend any actions instituted subsequent to July 1992.  As these cases have a history of being referred to Europe, it could be a number of years before a final resolution is reached.  Will the Minister state his Department's position on this issue and whether he will be pushing his opposition to these payments all the way to the European Court if necessary?  Women want to know what they are entitled to and the Minister should come clean on this issue.  The Minister has no right to decide an issue based on the level of claims, it should be based mainly on the legal merit of the claims and the Minister is denying women their legal entitlements.</P>
    <P>In the D·il debate on the motion dealing with unemployment benefits, the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, stated that if any Deputy submitted parliamentary questions requesting information on the level of settlements already made, it would be made available because people should be entitled to such information.  She said <Col N="1117" /> also that in future she would ensure people get this information under the Freedom of Information Act.  She assured me that if I submitted further questions on the level of payments made to women through solicitors, this information would be made available.</P>
    <P>I subsequently took the Minister at her word and submitted questions to the Minister for Social Welfare.  Again, the information was denied me on the grounds of confidentiality even though the women involved requested me to get that information for them.  The Minister is acting irresponsibly on this issue.  Some women have been forced to go to solicitors because of the Department's refusal to pay money due to them as a result of the EU equality case.  Many of these women cannot find out from their solicitors or the Department of Social Welfare what money was paid to their solicitors on their behalf.  Every effort to establish the level of the payments or the settlements have resulted in a cloak of silence from the legal representatives of these women and from the Department. This is a matter the Department and the law society should address immediately. Surely individuals have the right to find out from a Department the amount already paid to legal advisers on their behalf.  I am asking the Minister to make a full and comprehensive statement at the end of this Second Stage debate on a situation which is open to exploitation where these women are being refused information regarding the value of settlements.</P>
    <P>The Minister, inside and outside this House, has continuously attempted to mislead Deputies and the public on a very important issue affecting women's rights.  I am now asking him to state the amounts paid to date and the value of claims outstanding.  Will he set out clearly his attitude to the claims made by women seeking arrears of alleviation payments arising from the decision of the European Court of 13 March 1991 in the Cotter-McDermot application?  Will he also set out the total number of applications and the estimated value of the claims made?</P>
    <P>In relation to the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; social <Col N="1118" /> welfare cuts which were introduced by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, prior to November 1992, I read with interest an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday under the heading &ldquo;Burton rejects cutback claim&rdquo;.  The article went on at length to again mislead the public on the question of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts.  When the Minister, Deputy Burton, comes here she will again ask us to forget the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts which were introduced prior to the 1992 election and which the Labour Party solemnly promised to reverse before the election.  This promise, like many others made before the election, was not followed through and the electorate's trust in the Labour Party has been seriously betrayed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare has rejected claims made by myself and other spokespersons in the House that some of the nastiest of the original &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts are still in place.  She now says the social welfare system has moved on and it is difficult to make a one to one comparison because of the changes in the system. This is a follow up to a statement she made in this House some months ago that the ghost of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts should be laid to rest.  I reject her statement. Some of the nastier cuts are still in place and if I had the time I would outline them.</P>

      <P>Since the Woods-Burton team came into power we have had in addition to the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts, the taxation of unemployment and disability benefit, the abolition of pay-related benefit and more restrictions have been imposed on applicants seeking disability and unemployment benefit.  One of the most unfair and savage cuts was the elimination of the entitlement to unemployment assistance to students, mainly those from working class backgrounds and from the PAYE sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna F·il-Labour Coalition, particularly the Labour Party, continues to behave in a most dishonourable way on its commitments made to the electorate. The Minister, when replying to my criticisms, is likely to point out that the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Taxation are mainly achieved over long term social welfare payments. I concede that a major percentage of all social welfare recipients receive payments <Col N="1120" /> at a higher level than the priority rate, but the priority rates were seen by the commission as emergency targets for the lowest level referred to by the Commission on Social Welfare required to provide adequate income.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations of the commission was to extend existing optional work programmes and develop new ones that would specifically encourage unemployed people to become involved in a wide range of activities which would contribute to their development and the development of the community and would eliminate the red tape and bureaucratic procedures in setting up these programmes.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his budget speech, announced another variation on the present range of programmes.  He introduced a pilot scheme based on the proposals of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors' which are similar to those put forward by my party last autumn.  However, the Minister gave me an assurance that people taking part in these programmes would not be denied secondary benefits.  Persons who have been involved in those work programmes have been denied payments under the supplementary welfare Act for exceptional needs and there is definite evidence of this.  One of the Minister's party colleagues in Cork recently added his voice to those who protested at the erosion of secondary benefits through work schemes.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to investigate cases where health boards are either refusing or reducing substantially applications for exceptional payments because the applicants are involved in optional work programmes.  Surely this is contrary to the assurances given by the Minister in this House.  It demands an urgent and conclusive investigation because if the situation is allowed to continue, it will defeat the whole purpose of work programmes. This new problem again indicates the lack of understanding of what life is like for people who are unemployed through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>In my contribution last year I told the Minister I would support any moves <Col N="1121" /> made to rationalise and simplify the social welfare code because there are very few people who understand even a part of our social welfare system.  This whole area requires an enormous amount of administration and bureaucracy. There is much wastage on administration costs nationally and locally.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill introduced in the past year has helped.  Nonetheless, the time has come to tidy up the whole social welfare system, rendering it more user friendly because, very often, the system is antipeople, and attempts to block people from obtaining information rather than giving them such information openly. The system largely remains complicated and confusing, creating many barriers to work, and communication between the general public and the Department needs to be harmonised and rendered more user friendly.</P>
    <P>In the past year I encountered many examples of people who lost entitlements because of the limitations of the system and the petty regulations in place regarding the time limit imposed on retrospective claims.  People continue to lose substantially because they have not been informed of their entitlements as a matter of right.  For example, I know of people who have been in receipt of one entitlement and were allowed continue to draw that entitlement even though they were eligible for a different benefit at a higher rate of payment, but when the shortfall was discovered the Department failed to live up to its responsibilities by backdating to the date of eligibility.  This practice is totally unacceptable.  I will be considering, as should the Minister, the introduction of regulations to eliminate this injustice &mdash; I am referring to the six months regulation of which the Minister will be aware.</P>
    <P>I should like to have referred to the whole jungle involved in means-testing but I do not have the time and I want to refer to other matters.  However, I would ask the Minister to endeavour to do something about that.  I would ask him also to address what is happening in the <Col N="1122" /> special committee on the closer integration of the tax and social welfare systems. I consider this Bill another example of bad planning, its victims being those already victimised through illness or economic failure.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with one or two issues which have arisen.  The first affects people going to Great Britain &mdash; this issue has been raised by the London Irish Centre charity and social advice workers who have been in touch with me to express their extreme concern at the proposed amendments to the British Department of Social Services legislation which has extremely damaging implications for Irish people emigrating to Great Britain and those already settled there.  The proposals will greatly limit entitlement to benefits for all Irish people who have lived in Britain for less than three years. In addition, the proposed amendments to the British homeless legislation will mean that many Irish people will no longer be considered for housing under the priority need rules.  It is likely that most new immigrants will be sent back to Ireland under these new rules.  If he has not done so already I would ask the Minister to direct his immediate attention to these issues, to raise these subjects with the British Government as a matter of the utmost urgency given the fact that their Department of Social Services plans to introduce these amendments to benefit entitlements by next summer.  In my view the British Government is acting contrary to European law by enforcing these amendments.  Some of these provisions smack of the most basic racist legislation imaginable.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to raise also affects emigrants that is, the requirement that one insurance contribution be paid in this country in order to qualify for unemployment benefit.  One of the major difficulties people experience returning here, especially from the United Kingdom &mdash; those who will have been in insurable employment for many years &mdash; is that, when they apply for unemployment benefit here, they need at least one insurance contribution paid here before qualifying.  It is highly unlikely <Col N="1123" /> that such people will qualify because of the difficulty in obtaining work here.  In addition, they will be refused unemployment assistance if they have accumulated savings while working in Britain. This is totally unacceptable.  Obviously, this affects a large number of emigrants not only from the United Kingdom but from other parts of Europe.  It is ludicrous to demand from an unemployed person returning from a European country an insurance contribution in order to qualify for unemployment benefit because in the first place a person signs on for unemployment because he or she cannot obtain employment.  I can understand the reason for such a rule on mainland Europe where there is greater mobility of workers between member states but, in this country it is punitive illustrating a certain lack of welcome for returning emigrants.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with other issues on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Social welfare is a major achievement of modern societies in that usually it has strong support through public opinion, as was shown recently in a Euro barometer survey that highlighted the almost unanimous support for a high level of social protection.  The Progressive Democrats believe that social welfare recipients should be given the best protection society can afford.  Social welfare is a major component also of social cohesion and solidarity.  However, social welfare and social protection systems are faced with growing pressures resulting from a number of factors, the first being the evolution of the labour market and rising unemployment, followed by demographic trends, in particular the aging of the population, changes in family structures, the growing instances of poverty and social exclusions resulting from these trends, together with a massive increased demand for a whole range of social services including a comprehensive welfare service and health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, to date we have focused on granting increases across a <Col N="1124" /> wide range of social welfare schemes to keep pace with, or to be slightly ahead of, inflation.  Recently there have been some endeavours to introduce incentives to attract people back into the workforce. In Ireland we have reached a paralysis of analysis of poverty and its effects on people.  Social exclusion does not mean only insufficient income, it goes even beyond participation in working life and is manifested in a number of areas, such as housing, education, health and access to services.  It affects not only individuals who have suffered serious setbacks but social groups, particularly in urban and rural areas, who are subject to discrimination, segregation or the weakening of traditional forms of social relations.</P>
    <P>There is very little in this Bill which will do anything to alleviate or remove those causes of exclusion experienced by over one million of our people dependent on social welfare, such as persistent unemployment, especially long term unemployment, the impact of industrial change on poorly skilled workers, the evolution of family structures and the decline of traditional forms of solidarity. All these phenomena are sometimes coupled with traditional forms of poverty concentrated in declining urban areas or in rural areas lagging behind general progress in society.  Growing resentment at being excluded from sharing wealth and opportunities heightens the risk of people being driven to desperation and disruptive behaviour, such as violence or drug abuse.  Insecurity generates fear of the future, in turn often leading to introversion or susceptibility even to racist ideologies of which I hope we will not see too much here, although it is a possibility.</P>
    <P>This Bill is introduced at a time when unemployment is high, even rising, when direct and indirect taxation are held to be severe and expenditure burdensome affecting the lives of 1.3 million, two out of every five, households.  A reform approach is needed rather than the <i>ad hoc</i> relief approach of merely adding on percentages.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare several years ago set out to examine the <Col N="1125" /> overall area of poverty in policy terms. There has been much lip service paid to its recommendations.  All that was necessary to ensure substantially greater progress was made in combating poverty and increasing social welfare payments was the maintenance of percentages of national income being spent on social welfare at levels pertaining in 1986.  In this year's budget many payments are being increased to the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, the impression being given that that goal had been reached. That is a gross misrepresentation because the priority rates were emergency rates the commission recommended be paid in 1986.</P>
    <P>The overall package of social welfare measures is to cost £72 million in 1994.  It is interesting to compare these with other choices made in the budget, for example, £100 million to finance the bad management debts of the various health boards.  What is needed in the area of social welfare is a clear statement of policy on the part of the Government. To this end we need an all-party committee on social welfare to examine the entire social welfare code.  The Progressive Democrats see the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Combat Poverty Agency the Conference of Major Religious Superiors and other interested groups working with such a committee on a consultative basis in a real partnership so that the many varied and complex social welfare issues could be dealt with and the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare implemented within a specified time.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a regular and healthy debate on social welfare a number of myths has evolved.  The first is that the social welfare budget is out of control and unsustainable.  Over the six years 1986-93 GNP increased substantially. However, the percentage of GNP spent by Governments on social services, health, housing, education and social welfare has declined over the same period.  It is useful to look at and compare the public service budget which has increased more in absolute terms than <Col N="1126" /> the social welfare budget.  The rise in income for public service employees has been six times that of the social welfare recipient.  Fewer than 200,000 people receive social welfare pensions; 190,000 people receive unemployment assistance and 77,000 receive unemployment benefit. Even with the National Development Plan, unemployment figures are set to rise so that by the year 2000 there could be almost 400,000 people unemployed. The number of pensioners is likely to rise given increased life expectancy and the social insurance fund will not be sufficient to meet increased demands.  We need more people to pay into the system.  Can the Minister confirm if public servants will be brought into the social welfare system?  If that happened the Minister would have an extra £400 million available to him.</P>
    <P>One of the main areas the budget failed to tackle was exclusion.  One-third of the people are in a triangle of exclusion and we ignore them at our peril.  The side effects of exclusion &mdash; suicide, depression, alcohol abuse, unhappiness and the destruction of families &mdash; flow from a flawed policy of dealing with exclusion in society.  It is time for an imaginative way forward, for an integrated holistic approach to deal not only with income for the unemployed but with the improvement of their quality of life and participation in society.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill provides for increases in rates of social welfare payments from July.  I welcome these increases but given the resources available to the Minister the allocation to social welfare is disappointing. All adults depending on social welfare are as deeply immersed in poverty after this budget as they were before it.  The priority given to children is unconvincing with no increase for the first two children, just £5 for the third and £2 for the fourth and subsequent child.  The increase in child dependency was negligible.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have always argued that adequacy in relation to need should be the cornerstone of the payments system and we regard child benefit as an effective and necessary <Col N="1127" /> mechanism to achieve this.  Further increases in child benefit for older children are warranted.  There is a case for a unified, simplified system of child income support as is the case in most European countries.  Any new system of child support should eliminate the need for family income supplement.  It is time adult and child dependency was looked at to avoid poverty traps.</P>
    <P>The reduction in PRSI for lower wage workers appears to be a step in the right direction but there is an absence of a coherent strategy in this.  The employers' PRSI and employees 2.25 per cent levy break up to £9,000 means that a new welfare and poverty trap is created at that level.  If workers earn £1 above this threshold will they pay the full levy?  Will their wage attract the full employers' PRSI on all their income and not simply on the earnings above £9,000?  To pay an extra £500 may cost employers a lot in payroll taxes.  If an employee in the hard pressed clothing industry is offered overtime next year the cost for the employer could be enormous.  A new ceiling has been imposed on those at the bottom of the ladder.  In view of that the Progressive Democrats' proposal to exclude the first £3,000 of everyone's earnings from PRSI would be more equitable.</P>
    <P>I fear we will face the same dead-end as sectors in the retail trade in the UK and the lower paid elements in the US.  If we allow tax breaks to lower paid workers they will continue in employment while highly skilled workers will not receive the compensation they deserve.  Real reform of PRSI would transfer it into the general tax system.  If applied to everyone, including the public sector, at the same rate it would generate an extra £400 million, introducing genuine reform to exempt low incomes but there has been no hint of that.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are committed to the elimination of fraud in the social welfare system.  There appears to be considerable concern at the extent of real or perceived fraud in the system.  In 1985 a special investigation unit of the Department of Social Welfare interviewed <Col N="1128" /> 8,000 people claiming unemployment assistance and benefit.  As a result 15 per cent of people ceased to claim.  In the 1987-89 period the present Minister for Social Welfare requested Craig Gardner to report on the extent of social welfare fraud.  To this day the Minister has consistently refused to publish their findings.  Discussions I have had with field staff indicate there is general concern within the Department at the high incidence of fraud, yet it does not appear to have been tackled on a large scale.</P>
    <P>There are minor amendments in the Bill but no overall formula to integrate people who feel they are living on the edge of the economy, those who suffer social injustice and inequality.  The budget and this Bill do little to move their agenda to centre stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a totally inadequate response to the plight of those dependent on social welfare.  While the Bill contains some marginal improvements, such as increasing social welfare benefits in line with inflation, there is no evidence of any overall coherent strategy on social welfare reform, no acknowledgement of the seriousness of the plight of those on social welfare and no indication that the fight against poverty is to be moved up the political agenda.  As with all recent social welfare Bills it contains a number of hidden cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget and this Bill were prepared against the background of the most favourable economic situation for two decades.  Those on social welfare had a right to expect some measures to substantially improve their position but once again they were passed over and virtually forgotten.  Most of the increases provided for are minimalist and will do nothing to improve their living standards.  The miserable level of most of the increases tell their own story &mdash; £2.10 extra for a contributory old age pensioner; £3.40 for a pensioner with a dependant aged over 66 and the figures for non-contributory pensions are worse &mdash; £1.80 and £2.90, respectively.  These same miserable increases have been applied to many on <Col N="1129" /> the lower rates, such as unemployment allowance and the carer's allowance.  It is fair to anticipate that not too many bottles of champagne will be cracked open when these increases are eventually paid. The wonderful increase of 40 pence per week for the child of a person on disability or unemployment benefit would scarcely pay for a bottle of milk, never mind a bottle of champagne.</P>
    <P>There was a time when social welfare increases were paid in April but the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government in the early 1980s began to push the payment dates back.  Among the strongest critics of this move was the Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Woods, who was then on the Opposition benches.  Now the Minister has pushed the meagre increases back to the latest possible dates in July and the increases in child benefit will not be paid until September.  There is a gap of more than six months between the budget and the payment of social welfare increases, yet welfare cuts such as the taxation of unemployment benefit will come into operation next month.</P>
    <P>The budget and this Bill represent another nail in the coffin of the insurancebased social welfare system.  Pay related benefits, which were once the outstanding feature of the social welfare system, have systematically been whittled away.  With the abolition of pay related benefit for new claimants from July, fewer and fewer people will benefit. The Minister tried to divert attention from this further cutback by focusing on the decision to increase disability and unemployment benefit by 10 per cent, which represents an increase of £5.40. Against this the abolition of pay related benefit for all new claimants will mean a loss of up to £16.80.  In other words, people who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs this year will find they are up to £11 per week worse off than if they lost their jobs last year.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> Pay related benefit was supposed to act as a cushion or a buffer to help those who lost their jobs or who through illness could not work to help them adjust from paid earnings to social welfare benefits. Now that is all a thing of the past.  People who are on good wages and who lose their jobs will have to make do on just £61 per week.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Finance announced in the budget that the pay-related element of unemployment benefit would be discontinued from July, this Bill contains another cutback which will further diminish the value of pay related benefit for those still in receipt of it. Section 21 increases from £80 to £97.50 the amount of weekly earnings disregarded in calculating pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and not an attempt to mislead, as the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, have done during the past 18 months in relation to the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;.  Workers are expected to continue to make pay related contributions, but will no longer receive pay related benefits.  This represents a unilateral change by the Government in the social insurance <Col N="1131" /> system.  Perhaps the Minister would like to correct me.</P>

      <P>It was a unilateral change by the Government without any warning or any adjustment in the pay related contributions which workers have to make.  If any private insurance company attempted unilaterally to reduce benefits while continuing to demand the same level of contributions, there would be uproar.  It is an outrage that the Government has been allowed to get away with this.  It is very clear that the Government no longer regards PRSI contributions as a source of funding for enhanced social welfare benefits, but simply views it as another source of taxation.</P>
      <P>The Bill also confirms that the Labour Party has totally thrown in the towel on the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; social welfare cuts. Despite all the lavish promises made by the Labour Party during the general election campaign, the victims of these cuts have now been quietly abandoned by the T·naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and his colleagues. Not one of the cuts, which the Labour Party exploited for all their electoral potential, has been reversed by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From leading critics of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;, the Labour Party, especially in the guise of the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, has been transformed into principal defenders of them.  Deputy Burton's approach changes as the mood takes her. On one occasion she will try to mislead the public and say that most of the cuts have been reversed.  On another occasion she will say that the cuts were not really important anyway.  Recently, in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> she is quoted as saying: &ldquo;It is now hard to know whether they have been reversed&rdquo;.  I have a cutting from <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 27 February <Col N="1132" /> 1994 &mdash; in case the Minister is in any doubt and in case he does not normally read it &mdash; in which Deputy Burton is quoted as saying: &ldquo;The social welfare system has moved on and it is very difficult to make a one to one comparison because of the changes in the current system&rdquo;.  She is no longer denying that the cuts have not been reversed, she is now saying it is difficult to locate them and we do not know any more.</P>
    <P>The Minister was anxious to correct me on some facts when I talked about the rates.  Will he correct what I am about to say now in relation to the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts?  The maternity allowance is still abolished; it has not been reversed.  The income test for deserted wife's benefit has not been reversed.  Pay related benefit has been abolished; it has still not been reversed, in fact it has been made worse. The reduced scale of benefits for part-time workers has still not been reversed. If English means anything &ldquo;reversed&rdquo; means something has been wiped out.</P>
    <P>The cuts in redundancy payments have still not been reversed.  The raising of the disqualification period from six weeks to nine weeks has still not been reversed, although the Minister of State has said he cannot really find out whether it is reversed.  Anybody who has been unemployed will tell you whether it is reversed. In regard to unemployment assistance, a stricter system of assessing means was introduced, and it is still not reversed. That was extended in 1993 when students were disqualified from the system.  That cut is still not reversed, in fact it has been enhanced.  Injury benefit, which was reduced from £65 to £63, has still not been reversed.  The usual inflation related increases have applied since then, but that cut has still not been reversed.</P>
    <P>Disability benefit conditions were tightened. Although they have been eased to some extent the original cut still exists and they have not been restored to what they were originally.  The cut has still not been reversed.  The eligibility conditions for treatment benefit were tightened. There has been some easing of the conditions but the original cut still remains. They have not been restored to their <Col N="1133" /> original condition.  The income ceiling was increased and that still remains.</P>

Some of them are completely in place, some have been made harsher and some have been eased slightly, but not a single one of them has been reversed.  The Minister has added to them in that he is now taxing unemployment benefit and has further reduced pay-related benefit.  Not only that, but the Minister quietly, secretly, introduced a new circular last November in which he reduced the amount of money which a spouse can earn and which may be disregarded by a person claiming benefit. By and large this is hitting women who are in part-time work.  Mr. P·draig ” MÛr·in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week dealt with it in a very clear way, although it is a very complicated area.  On 22 February 1994 the headline was &ldquo;When £7.50 a day does not make £45 a week&rdquo;.  When one is working part-time for a pittance, it does not make it.  This was a very sneaky cut which affects many women in part-time work.  The dirty dozen have now become the filthy 15.  The Minister has not reversed the dirty dozen, he has increased them and in some cases has made them even more vicious in their effects.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Government does not regard the PRSI system as a social insurance system.  In relation to the dirty dozen cuts, the people are not fooled by ministerial denials.  Those who suffered from the McCreevy lash in 1992, who saw their income levels cut and who believed the Labour Party promises during the general election campaign, know only too well that the cuts are still in place and that they have been betrayed by Ministers Burton, Stagg and their colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant new social welfare cut in this year's budget is not included in the Bill at all.  This was the decision to take a further £30 million out of the pocket and purses of the unemployed by taxing unemployment benefit.  So anxious was the Government to implement this that it could not even wait for the Social Welfare Bill and it was introduced by Ministerial Order within a week of the budget.  This was also done with such speed, because this cut will be introduced from next month while social welfare <Col N="1135" /> increases will not be implemented until July.</P>
    <P>The taxation of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit will hit people on relatively low incomes, reducing their living standards and adding to their difficulties in making ends meet.  It is another example of twisting the financial screw on those at the lower end of the income range while more and more concessions are provided for the well off. The end result of this move will be to take more tax off those on low and moderate incomes and reduce the living standards of those dependent on welfare.</P>
    <P>The principle of treating welfare payments as taxable income could only be acceptable in the context of full integration of the tax and social welfare system coupled with a substantial increase in both the basic level of welfare payments and the exemption limits for tax and PRSI payments.  In the absence of that sort of reform it is simply a further social welfare cut which penalises those on low income, and in some cases on moderate incomes.</P>
    <P>The introduction of tax on unemployment benefit, together with last year's decision to tax disability benefit, means that the sick and the unemployed are now paying as much tax as the entire farming sector.  The taxation of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit will bring in £30 million in a full year, while the taxation of disability benefit will bring in around £16 million or £17 million, giving a total tax take of close to £50 million.  Yet the total tax take from farmers in 1991 amounted to just £36 million and in 1992 to just £48 million.</P>
    <P>These damning statistics tell their own story about power and the influence of farmers on the one hand and the way in which the unemployed have been sidelined and forgotten about on the other. The farmers have no shortage of supporters and apologists in all of the conservative parties in this House, but Democratic Left is now the sole defender of the interests of the poor and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>When the 1992 Finance Bill first gave <Col N="1136" /> the Government the power to tax social welfare benefits, Deputy RuairÌ Quinn, then in Opposition, described it as being &ldquo;unnecessarily harsh and uncharacteristically cruel&rdquo;.  Now that it is comfortably in Government the Labour Party has done another U - turn and now becomes an enthusiastic advocate of the taxation of welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The full implications of the decision to tax unemployment benefit has not yet been fully appreciated by the unemployed, but I predict that when the order is implemented from next month Fianna F·il and Labour backbenchers will face a severe political backlash when the unemployed find that their meagre incomes have been cut even further.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is not in this Bill but which is of increasing concern to a growing number of women is the refusal of the Government to pay arrears of transitional payments to which they are entitled under rulings of the EC Court. Indeed, Minister Woods and Junior Minister Burton have attempted to engage in a conspiracy of silence aimed at depriving perhaps tens of thousands of Irish women of such payments.</P>
    <P>However, figures given in a reply to a D·il question I tabled last month show that the conspiracy of silence is breaking down and that more and more women are initiating legal actions to secure the money to which the European Court found they were entitled.  Minister Woods disclosed in reply to my question that legal proceedings have now been initiated against his Department on behalf of some 5,000 women.  These represent only the tip of the iceberg and many more women are likely to claim as word spreads.</P>
    <P>These claims are in respect of &ldquo;alleviation payments&rdquo; which had been introduced in 1986 but paid to men only.  In March 1991, the European Court ruled in favour of two Irish women who had taken a case and referred the matter back to the Irish Supreme Court.  However, before the Supreme Court could consider the matter the Department settled the case.  It clearly follows that if these two women were entitled to arrears, other <Col N="1137" /> women in similar circumstancs will also be entitled to compensation.</P>
    <P>However, the Department has attempted to draw a veil of silence over the matter in an effort to keep women in the dark regarding their entitlements.  A substantial number of legal claims are understood to have been settled privately by the Department, but Minister Woods has persistently refused to give any details.  In some cases payments of up to £6,000 are reported to have been made, but details have been hard to come by as a condition of payment has been that women will not disclose the amounts paid.  The attempts to deny women payments to which they are entitled and to force them into the hands of solicitors to secure their entitlements is an affront to the principle that women are entitled to equal treatment in all areas of life.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 and 29 of this Bill provide additional powers of inspection and place additional obligations on employers in regard to the keeping of records and are clearly designed to help combat social welfare fraud.  Social welfare fraud is unacceptable and needs to be rooted out, but there is an entirely inaccurate perception of huge social welfare fraud which is not borne out by the statistics.</P>
    <P>The Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Maurice Doyle, was widely criticised for a speech he made in November last for sweeping and unsubstantiated claims he made about the extent of social welfare fraud.  Among those who strongly criticised Mr. Doyle was the Minister, but the person who has probably done more than anyone else to paint a totally false picture of the extent of social welfare fraud has been the Minister himself, particularly in regard to the totally exaggerated claims he made on the expected returns from the special welfare amnesty.</P>
    <P>Little has been heard about the social welfare amnesty in recent months and many people may have forgotten that it was announced in May last year.  It was a political afterthought aimed at giving a bogus veneer of equity to the outrageous tax amnesty introduced by Fianna F·il and Labour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> However, this did not prevent the Minister making groundless claims on radio and in the print media on what the amnesty was likely to bring in.  These exaggerated claims simply fed prejudices about social welfare claimants.</P>
    <P>On RTE radio on 6 June last the Minister claimed that the social welfare amnesty could bring in £200 million and he repeated this claim in an interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> which was carried as the main front page story the following day.  Why have we heard nothing about the Minister's pot of gold since then?</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister for Finance not announce in the budget that he was allocating some of this £200 million to certain projects, as was the case with the returns from the tax amnesty?  The answer is simple.  There was no pot of gold.  As I pointed out at the time, the £200 million would never be collected.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will do his best to educate me and mislead the House as usual.  He tries to blind us with statistics.  He knows the facts and is guilty of an outrageous attempt of political fraud on the people. The true story was revealed in reply to a question I tabled on 2 February when he told me that 550 people had applied for the amnesty.  He claimed also that as these cases were still being processed exact savings figures were not available. However, these figures are almost exactly the same as the number who applied for the previous social welfare amnesty in 1991.  According to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 1992, that amnesty was applied in 522 cases and the total amount involved was £876,031 &mdash; a long way from the Minister's £200 million.  It is safe to estimate that this year's amnesty has brought in less than £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> The Minister may claim, he tries to confuse the issue by making this claim, that when he forecasts a return of £200 million he is talking also about employers and self-employed PRSI payments, which are included in the returns for the overall tax amnesty.  As that amnesty has brought in a total of only £240 million it means that either the Minister is guilty of indulging in &ldquo;Disneyland&rdquo; figures or that the tax element of the amnesty has brought in only £40 million.</P>
    <P>The public, particularly those dependent on social welfare &mdash; the vast majority of whom are law abiding citizens struggling to make ends meet on inadequate incomes &mdash; are entitled to an apology from the Minister for his suggestion that £200 million was waiting to be collected as a result of fraudulent social welfare claims.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> The Minister is trying to direct scarce resources to where they are most needed and this entails setting priorities.  The Department of Social Welfare is very goahead and has introduced schemes to try to get people back to work.  I would like the Department to have a greater role in that area.  Sometimes I detect interdepartmental wrangling between the Departments of Social Welfare and Enterprise and Employment but I would like the Department of Social Welfare to have a greater say in back to work schemes because, to date, its schemes have been positive and innovative.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases provided for in the Bill, particularly in the family income supplement and the carer's allowance, in respect of which the earnings disregard will be set at £100 per week.  The widower's pension marks a major step forward. I am glad that the income threshold has been removed.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increase in unemployment assistance payable to single people living at home.  Although it has only been increased to £10 it is significant and I like to think that it will be increased further in future years.  The system is crazy in that it encourages people to leave home to live in a flat to qualify for unemployment assistance and a rent allowance. This leads to increased costs for the Department of Social Welfare.  As a member of Dublin City Council, I am aware that among the thousands on the housing waiting list there are some who could live with their parents.  The Minister said that scarce resources have to be targeted at those most in need, but this is one area where costs are being incurred by the State.  In this context I hope the figure of £10 will be increased considerably in time.  This would lead to a saving for the State, not necessarily for the Department of Social Welfare.  It would also allow local authorities to assess their housing needs more accurately.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced that the adult dependant allowance will continue to be paid for six weeks following the death of a claimant.  This is both welcome and significant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> While I have not read the Bill in full, there seems to be no mention of the free schemes.  I ask the Minister to clarify the matter as changes were announced in the budget and some people are receiving confused signals from officials in the Department of Social Welfare, particularly with regard to the changes in the free travel scheme as they apply to widows.  There is confusion about who exactly will qualify.</P>
    <P>Given that new entrants to the public service will pay PRSI at the full rate, I ask the Minister to consider extending the free schemes to include retired civil and public servants.  Before I became a Member of this House I was employed by CIE and had civil servant status.  When my colleagues retired their pension was slightly higher than the social welfare pension.  As the free schemes have proved to be of enormous benefit in recent years I would like to see them being extended to include retired workers.  The Minister could start by extending the schemes to include those aged 75 years and over.  Given that new entrants to the public service will pay PRSI at the full rate I would like to see some movement in this direction.</P>
    <P>Frequently people come to our clinics to tell us that they have been refused a contributory old age pension because they do not have the required number of contributions, 20 per year.  While the regulations have been amended in recent years, it is extraordinary that those with an average of 18 or 19 contributions per year do not qualify for a reduced pension. These people feel hard done by.  The Minister recently received a report in this regard and I hope he will move in this direction.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned that the Minister's predecessor made a number of cuts a few years ago.  I have much sympathy for some of those affected.  I am speaking here about those who retired early at the age 57 or 58 and are in receipt of a private pension.  These people will not qualify for treatment benefits until they reach the age 65.  I know of one man who paid contributions for 40 years and is not entitled to a pair <Col N="1143" /> of glasses.  The Minister is raising the threshold for a family or couple to £70,000 but if extra resources are available I would like to see the scheme being extended to include those who are excluded at present.</P>
    <P>Those earning £173 per week or less will pay PRSI at a reduced rate.  People fear that this will be abused.  It has been suggested that all those earning £200 per week will suddenly find themselves earning £172 per week with a bonus of £28 per week payable quarterly and paying PRSI at the reduced rate for 11 out of 12 weeks.  Does the Minister think there is any possibility of abuse in this area? While a reduced rate of PRSI is a good concept, people will always manage to find loopholes in the system.  In this case are we opening the gate and asking people to enter?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That D·il …ireann calls on the Government to immediately initiate the necessary legal proceedings to prevent commissioning of the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP) at Sellafield in view of the fact that the Government has cited at least three EU Directives which the plant will contravene and given that British Nuclear Fuels Limited has indicated that it will be ready to begin reprocessing at THORP from 7 March 1994. </P>
      <P>Is oth liom nach bhfuil aon dul as agam ach an r˙n seo a mholadh don Teach seo anocht agus iarraim ar TheachtaÌ uilig macnamh a dhÈanamh air agus gnÌomh˙ i bhf·bhar an r˙in d· rÈir.  CÈ go bhfuil obair mhaith dÈanta go dtÌ seo, t· g· le c·s dlÌ Ûn Rialtas mar gheall or THORP ar go leor c˙iseanna agus de bharr c˙rsaÌ ama, t· pr·inn nach beag ag baint leis an gc·s cÈanna.</P>
      <P>Before and since my election I visited THORP at different stages of its construction. The product of operations at the plant, plutonium, will have a half life of about 0.25 million years as will the increased discharges to the Irish Sea and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The arrogance of those managing the project is incredible.  They dismiss concern about the day-to-day discharges of 2.2 million gallons of contaminated water into the sea from Sellafield.  In a written question to the British nuclear authorities I asked about the substantial and deliberate increase in authorised plutonium, 239 discharges between 1956 and 1958, into the Irish Sea at Sellafield.  The answer I got from the director of the Nuclear Electricity Information Group was: &ldquo;I do not think that anyone would do such an experiment now, valuable though the results may be, because of public perception&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Year by year plutonium and other radioactive by-products are accumulating at Sellafield, requiring constant security, <Col N="1145" /> monitoring, protecting, expense and risk for future millennia.  The arrogance which allowed this nuclear time bomb to continue, and even expand, can best be understood by comparing Sellafield to the Egyptian Pyramids.  If the Pyramids were stores for nuclear waste they would still need high security protection and round-the-clock guards on the door. However, the weather has taken its toll on these monuments, civilisations come and go and, if the economy of Egypt today is taken into account, it is most unlikely that this level of expenditure, security and monitoring could be afforded in today's North Africa.  Such expenditure for future generations will provide no economic benefit or return. What right has this or any other generation to place this burden and risk on its children?</P>
    <P>Future generations can do nothing about what is happening now.  Those of us living on both sides of the Irish Sea in Dublin or Workington, in Belfast or Barrow-in-Furness are in the front line. Over our graves children will ask why. Bram Longstappe, a former mayor of Barrow where most of the nuclear waste shipments are, has a poignant epitaph which is relevant to this motion:</P>
    <P>Mourn not the dead in the cool earth</P>
    <P>lie</P>
    <P>Ashes to Ashes</P>
    <P>Dust to Dust</P>
    <P>Rather mourn the apathetic throng</P>
    <P>The coward and the meek,</P>
    <P>Who see the world's great wrong</P>
    <P>And dare not speak.</P>
    <P>In some cases it is enough to speak, but not in this case.  All the pleas, appeals, diplomatic measures and resolutions have failed to stop THORP, although its start-up time has been delayed.  We now face the eleventh hour in the sorry saga of Sellafield and Sellafield II, as THORP is also known.  On 7 March 1994 British Nuclear Fuels plan to commission the THORP plant at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Much of the technology to be used in THORP has never been proven to be safe.  Sellafield's previous experiment <Col N="1146" /> with oxide reprocessing, which will be carried out in THORP, ended in near disaster, a serious accident in the socalled Head End Plant in September 1973.  There is no guarantee that a similar or worse accident will not occur if THORP is commissioned.</P>
    <P>THORP will make West Cumbria into one of the world's main dumping grounds for nuclear waste.  It is expected to account for about 34 per cent of the entire UK nuclear waste inventory from its operations between 1994 and 2030.</P>
    <P>Existing facilities for the disposal of nuclear waste from Sellafield are likely to be full to capacity by the year 2005. The state-owned company, UK Nirex Limited, plans to build an undergrund waste repository beside Sellafield so that THORP's waste can be buried there. Serious doubts have been cast over the geological suitability of the area, with a senior nuclear scientist, Dr. Derek Ockenden, predicting recently that a nuclear chain reaction could be triggered off by the underground waste.</P>
    <P>THORP will lead to further stockpiling of plutonium and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  President Bill Clinton is on record as being opposed to plutonium separation, one of THORP's main activities, as it will destabilise the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which is already under threat because of a resumption of nuclear testing by China.</P>
    <P>The British Government has admitted that discharges from THORP could cause 16 cancer deaths every month in its first ten years of operation.  I will spell out what the thermal oxide reprocessing plant proposes to do at Sellafield. Although Sellafield has been reprocessing nuclear material since it first developed weapons for Britain's nuclear bomb programme, the previously reprocessed magnox spent fuel is only one tenth as radioactive as the proposed oxide spent fuel which is the raw material required by THORP.</P>
    <P>Sellafield's previous experience of oxide reprocessing was unsuccessful.  In the late sixties the B204 military reprocessing plant was converted into the Head End Plant.  This plant reprocessed <Col N="1147" /> 100 tonnes of thermal oxide fuel from Britain's advanced gas-cooled reactors. An unexpected chemical reaction in a process vessel in September 1973 caused a serious &ldquo;blow back&rdquo; accident that severely contaminated 35 workers, as well as the building, and no further reprocessing has been carried out in that plant since then.</P>
    <P>Other countries' experiences with oxide reprocessing have been similarly troublesome.  The world's only operational commercial-scale reprocessing plant UP2-HAO at La Hague, France, has had many setbacks and now operates at only 40 per cent of its capacity.</P>
    <P>In August 1993 the UK Secretary of State for the Environment gave BNFL permission to undertake uranium testing at THORP.  Shortly after the testing was due to commence a leak of nitrogen oxides occurred in the plant while testing equipment was being disconnected from the Head End areas and the main part of the plant; 280 people were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  That an accident requiring plant evacuation should occur in the embryonic stages of THORP's operations does not augur well for its future.  Oxide reprocessing involves complex processes during which the risk of a serious accident with far-reaching implications is always present.</P>
    <P>The inherent problem with oxide reprocessing was spelt out by the 1986 House of Commons Environment Committee's Report: &ldquo;The intense radiation of oxide spent fuel damages the solvents and attacks process plant; at the same time it makes direct maintenance extremely difficult, if not impossible&rdquo;. Successive British Governments have chosen to ignore these words of warning.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the environmental consequences of THORP's discharges. British Nuclear Fuels Limited has said that it cannot guarantee that it can keep discharges within proposed limits.  This is spelt out by British Nuclear Fuels in its application for an authorisation to dispose of low level waste from the marine pipeline at the Sellafield site submitted in 1992 which is as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> The realisation of lower future radioactive waste discharges to sea from the Sellafield site depends on the successful performance of several new plants, particularly those associated with effluent treatment.  The design of some of these plants is unique and there is no previous experience to refer to in judging their likely performance. </P>
    <P>A report from <i>Time Out</i> magazine carried in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 24 May 1989 claimed that a major risk of radioactivity existed because storage ponds for THORP are not to be linked to a radioactivity extraction plant.</P>
    <P>The level of discharges from THORP are supposed to adhere to a standard alara principle which is an acronym for as low as reasonably achievable.  Many commentators have argued that the discharges from THORP will be much higher than those permitted from most other nuclear installations in the world. The discharge level of krypton 85 gas, for example, offers the most glaring illustrations of alara being flouted.  BNFL plans to increase its current discharge level of krypton 85 gas tenfold.  Two German scientists, Kollert and Reichelt, have estimated that a 50 per cent increase in global ionisation caused by the dispersal of krypton 85 would lead to a 10 per cent decrease in atmospheric resistance. The effects of the atmosphere's water vapours and the long term impact on the world's climate would be unpredictable.</P>
    <P>The 1977 Windscale inquiry recommended that &ldquo;BNFL should devote effort to the development of a plant for safe removal and retention of krypton 85 and if development proved successful, should incorporate it in the proposed plant&rdquo;.  BNFL said it would be too costly to install krypton 85 filters in the THORP plant.  Such short term expedience could prove disastrous in the long term. However, Her Majesty's Inspectorate and the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the United Kingdom have also expressed doubt about the technology for filtering krypton 85 stating that &ldquo;it has significant risk potential should <Col N="1149" /> there be a sudden release of the inventory of a cryogenic column or storage cylinder.&rdquo; That statement emphasises that technology for the removal and retention of krypton 85 cannot be deemed as entirely safe, another reason THORP should not be allowed to go ahead.</P>
    <P>Very little research has been carried out on the impact of Sellafield or THORP on animals.  Circumstantial evidence suggests however that the blackheaded gulls which formed a vibrant and ornithologically important colony on the Radenglass Estuary approximately two miles from Sellafield may have vacated their nesting spot due to their sensitivity to radiation.  To assess the wider environmental impact of Sellafield and the likely impact of THORP, a monitoring programme of wildlife on both sides of the Irish Sea needs to be established.</P>
    <P>It is particularly appropriate to raise the health effects of THORP in an Irish context.  However, it must be remembered that the effects of Sellafield to date are not confined to these islands, but can be detected in many other countries and oceans.  Aerial discharges monitored in Poland, Spain and Germany, for example, can be identified as originating at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>There are many shades of opinion on the effects THORP could have on human health.  An environmental impact assessment on THORP was not carried out nor has a through or authoritative projection on the health impacts been commissioned by the British Government. Proper research needs to be undertaken on leukaemia and childhood cancer levels here.  It is lamentable that the Department of Health's last report on leukaemia was published in 1986.  That report found that most of the significant incidence rates for children aged between nought and 14 years in the 1974 to 1983 period lived within relatively close proximity to the eastern coastline which, needless to say, faces Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The 1984 Black Report could not find any conclusive evidence that Sellafield caused the high levels of leukaemia near the plant but said that no other cause could be found.  The 1993 report by the <Col N="1150" /> UK Health and Safety Executive found that the incidence of leukaemia and nonHodgkins lymphoma in children whose fathers worked at Sellafield was about 14 times the national average.  While not ruling out other factors the report said that a link between radiation and the high levels of these diseases is quite likely.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could draw the Minister's attention to a book published in the United States called &ldquo;Deadly Deceit, Low Level Radiation, High Level Cover-Up&rdquo;, in which two United States statisticians conclude that radiation is partially responsible for the spread of AIDS and has caused millions of excess deaths in the United States.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has decided that the 1977 radiation dose limits should remain as guiding principles and hence no actual reduction in the tolerable dose limits has been declared. However, in his paper entitled &ldquo;When is a dose not a dose?&rdquo; published in 1992 Dr. Patrick Greene argued that the approach taken by the NRPB is scientifically fraudulent.  He stated, &ldquo;as far as the human body is concerned a dose of radiation is a dose of radiation.  If the NRPB considers that a dose of more than 0.3 mSV is not tolerable, it should make no difference whether this dose is due to contamination caused by old discharges, a dose arising from current discharges or a mixture of the two&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is no recent discovery; in fact in 1927 Herman Muller won a Nobel prize for showing that no level of radiation is safe.  There is indeed no threshold below which genetic damage, cancer or a shortening of life is impossible.  More recently environmental scientist, Peter Taylor, estimated that krypton 85 discharges could conceivably cause 200 fatal cancers and 10,000 skin cancers within ten years of THORP's commissioning.  Taylor suggested that because those cancers would be spread over more than one country they could be hidden in general cancer statistics.  We look forward to Ireland producing comprehensive cancer statistics in the future.</P>
    <P>This demonstrates that Sellafield's pollution <Col N="1151" /> is not confined to any one country's borders and that THORP is an issue of international concern.  It further underlines the need for use of best available technology to reduce and, as far as possible, eliminate krypton 85 emissions. There is not enough information available to assess the full impact on human health of other radio-nucleates from THORP.  We do not have a publication from the National Radiological Protection Board on tritium discharges which will increase substantially if THORP is commissioned.  Neither the National Radiological Protection Board nor the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the UK takes into account organically bound tritium and food grown in tritium contaminated areas when calculating doses of the critical groups.</P>
    <P>Evidence from the Canadian Pickering nuclear power plant has directly implicated tritium with causing congenital birth defects.  Thorough research is needed before this radio-nucleate and its behavioural patterns are properly understood. It would be highly irresponsible to commission THORP before it can be proven that tritium emissions do not represent a serious health hazard.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and the Government to think before tabling an amendment to this motion.  I acknowledge the good work which has been done in this area, but we should focus our efforts on readily identifiable breaches of European Union law which all pertain to THORP. If the amendment seeks to tackle the issue of Sellafield and in some way includes THORP as part of the overall case, we will play into the hands of the nuclear lobby as they are able to pick holes in and discredit our arguments because we do not have 100 per cent proof in regard to some health issues.  For that reason we should concentrate on THORP.</P>
    <P>The health claims on both sides are a legal minefield and distract from the clearly illegal decisions in relation to THORP.  We do not have time now to consider specific cases.  Is it not a coincidence that THORP got the go ahead on <Col N="1152" /> the same day the Downing Street Joint Declaration was announced?  Is it a coincidence that a decision on the Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council case is due to be announced in London on Friday and the plant is to be commissioned on Monday?  The Government must not be drawn into a political manoeuvre on behalf of Britain which will leave the Irish Government with no room to act.  Unless we deal with THORP as a single identifiable transgression of European law we will be sucked into the minefield of uncertainties and procrastination.</P>
    <P>I have dealt only with the proposed normal operation of THORP.  Before 1986, in the Soviet Union nobody would have seriously considered the effects of the accident at Chernobyl.  Given the vulnerability of THORP as a concentration of radioactivity from around the world, adjacent to several ageing nuclear reactors, it is important to bear in mind some of the effects of the disaster at Chernobyl. In a 1988 Greek study it was calculated that in Western Europe alone 200,000 abortions were carried out following fears caused by the release of radioactivity from Chernobyl.  The writer of the report, Professor Proukakis, claimed that a similar number of abortions had taken place in Poland.  The position in other countries in Eastern Europe could not be investigated at that time.</P>
    <P>A report in February 1989 revealed plants in the general area of Chernobyl were exhibiting giantism.  In one case poplar leaves were growing to a diameter of seven inches.  Farm animals 30 miles away on Ukrainian farms gave birth to deformed offspring.</P>
    <P>A 1988 report predicted that 400,000 people in Ireland would die as a result of a similar accident at Sellafield and that half our agricultural sector would be wiped out.  The cause of such an accident is difficult to predict, but the human error involved in Chernobyl is only one of a number of possible scenarios.</P>
    <P>Recent news of earthquakes in America remind us that during the 1980s England and Wales were hit by 60 earth tremors, two of which, Irish people will <Col N="1153" /> remember, occurred in 1984 and in April 1990.  In the latter case the epicentre was at Wrexham and measured 5.2 on the Richter Scale.  Fortunately, the source of the quake was 15 kilometers below the earth's surface.  The effects of a quake five or ten kilometers below the earth's surface would have been far more devastating.</P>
    <P>Natural disasters aside, the Pan Am 747 crash in January 1989 was caused by an explosion which occurred very near Sellafield.  While aviation rules exclude civilian aeroplanes from coming within a two mile radius of the plant, no such restriction applies to military aircraft. The Trawsfynydd nuclear power station in Wales is often used as a dummy target for military aircraft.</P>
    <P>We should contemplate the seriousness of disasters before they actually occur.  Surely a Government must take effective legal action on THORP if we are not to be reminded of the tragedy that has befallen other people around the world following accidents, nuclear bomb tests or other causes of radiation discharges. It may be difficult to contemplate, but it is important to bear in mind the report of one woman's experience who lived on one of the Pacific Islands.  When she was seven years old the United States detonated a 15 megatonne hydrogen bomb called Bravo over her island.  Since then she has produced seven limbless, headless offspring.  After her seventh pregnancy she said:</P>
    <P>I carried the baby for the full nine months.  When I delivered the baby it had no legs, no arms and no head.  It was breathing and it moved up and down but it was not a baby at all.  It was a bag of jelly.  I have had seven like that. </P>
    <P>In the area of plutonium transportation, glib assurances that Britain has transported more than 30,000 tonnes of fuel over seven million miles without any serious leak of radioactivity do not allay public concerns, especially in the wake of ecologically devastating accidents involving release of non-radioactive substances <Col N="1154" /> at sea, such as the <i>Braer</i> and <i>Exxon Valdez</i> oil disasters.</P>
    <P>The activity of THORP has been in breach of Article 79 of the Euratom Treaty, in so far as nuclear regulatory authorities are required &ldquo;to keep and provide records to the European Commission in the case of the transport of source materials and special fissile materials which include plutonium&rdquo;. British Nuclear Fuels has been notoriously reluctant to supply details of plutonium transports.  British fire brigades are not notified of radioactive flask movements in advance and lack the relevant expertise in radiological protection to know how best to act in an emergency involving nuclear materials.</P>
    <P>Who is to say that all the plutonium floating in the Irish Sea is legitimate?  In June 1988 British and American researchers claimed that more than two tonnes of plutonium from Britain's civil nuclear stockpile is currently unaccounted for.  On 28 March 1990, four people were arrested in London for smuggling nuclear trigger devices, in transit from the USA, to Iraq.</P>
    <P>What I have said could be used to build a strong case against THORP.  Even though the Attorney General, Mr. Harry Whelehan, claimed Ireland does not have a sustainable case against THORP, he has not made public the details of his deliberations on THORP.  I welcome the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen to the House and I am pleased he is present to hear my contribution.  Ironically, the Minister outlined why Ireland should take legal action against THORP.  He is on record as saying that the commissioning of THORP will be in breach of EU law.  In his submission on the second round of consultations on THORP, held by the British Department of the Environment last autumn, he cited three EU Directives which the commissioning of THORP would contravene.  EU Directive 80/836, as amended by Directive 84/467, states that no practice involving radiation exposure should be adopted unless it produces sufficient benefit to exposed individuals and to society.  One <Col N="1155" /> might ask what benefit radiation exposure in Ireland will provide?</P>
    <P>EU Directive 85/337/EEC requires that an environmental impact assessment be carried out before such a nuclear installation is undertaken.  The original planning inquiry in 1977 is now almost 17 years out of date.  The Windscale Inquiry of 1977 omitted a number of key issues that would have to be taken into consideration by an EIA, such as the impact of radiation on flora and fauna together, with the practice of releasing Krypton 85 the discharge levels of which may increase ten fold.  EU Directive 90/313/EEC requires that relevant environmental information be made freely available.  Supporters of THORP argue that the plant will be profitable on the basis of a report prepared by the accountancy firm Touche Ross. However, the British Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer, in December 1993 revealed that he had never seen a copy of this crucial report before he authorised THORP.</P>
    <P>The decision to take legal action ought not to be as daunting as the Government appears to believe.  A case taken by Luxembourg and the German State of Saarland against a Cattenom nuclear power station on the Moselle was heard by the European Court of Justice in 1986. That case was won when Cattenom was found to be in breach of Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty.  It will interest the Fianna F·il partners in Government, and perhaps the Labour Party, that the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, said in relation to Sellafield in this House on 12 March 1986: &ldquo;I do not know if many Deputies experience as I do a very real feeling of anger when I consider the enormity of this situation and what we in this country are being asked to tolerate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Green Party, as well as many people on both sides of the Irish Sea, again calls on the Government to act legally before it is too late.  It is often remarked that the Government seems to have put this issue on the backburner, but there is no backburner left.  I have repeatedly said that the Government has been working very hard diplomatically, <Col N="1156" /> but its words, though eloquent and plentiful, have fallen on stoney ground.  This call for legal action at the eleventh hour is one of many such calls.  In November 1988 a Dublin Corporation conference was urged by Mr. Peter Taylor of the Political Ecology Research Group in England to &ldquo;take THORP to court as the designs in its construction are not the most modern&rdquo;.  At another international conference in Liverpool in 1990, organised by Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment which was attended by Members of this House, including Government Members, a resolution was unanimously passed urging the Irish Government to reconsider its decision not to take legal action against the UK for radiological contamination of the Irish Sea.  That conference was known as &ldquo;THORP &mdash; The New Threat from Sellafield&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment the Government is considering refers to Sellafield and THORP as if they were one issue.  I repeat that the issue of THORP is as clear cut as one could imagine in terms of nuclear affairs.  The breach of EU Directives is a matter for legal procedure whereas it is almost impossible to be 100 per cent certain on arguments about the issue of Sellafield, which are very difficult to prove conclusively in a court of law.  I urge the Government, as protectors of the people, to take legal action specifically on THORP.  There may be cause for a court case on Sellafield, and the sooner the better, but THORP is the issue of immediate concern.  I make this request not for myself, not even for my party, but for people North and South of the Border, Unionist and Nationalist, British and Irish.  Even the police officer who arrested me in Workington Dock for blocking a shipment of plutonium nitrate, which was due to travel though rush hour traffic to Sellafield for reprocessing, would thank the Government for taking legal action on this issue.  That police officer told me he had to do his job but that he wholeheartedly supported what I was doing.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any question of the Government considering the sensitivities <Col N="1157" /> of the British authorities due to the peace process, which is extremely welcome and urgent, I ask it not to be dissuaded from being decisive on this matter in the courts.  Many people in Britain, including the UK Government, believe that the original decision to go ahead with THORP was wrong &mdash; even the man who made the decision admits it was wrong. If the British, with their stiff upper lip, do not take account of their previous mistakes &mdash; a considerable amount of money has been spent to date and will have to be spent on monitoring the plant even after it is finished in the year 2030 &mdash; and does not reconsider, we have the independence of a sovereign State, a member of the EU, and we should use the existing procedures to deal with this matter, whether by arbitration, which would be much weaker than a legal case, or a court case, which we would stand an extremely good chance of winning.  Let us be decisive on the matter.</P>
    <P>If this question involves reconsideration by the Attorney General, let him do so.  If it involves seeking wider legal opinion which may open up some, as yet, unnoticed loopholes, let that be done.  If EU Directives which have been signed and agreed by members are ignored we do not take a case, what is the point in having a law?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>D·il …ireann approves the actions taken to date by the Government with a view to the closure of the Sellafield plant, including THORP, and notes that the Government is continuously re-examining all possible options open to it, including diplomatic and international pressure and legal action, to achieve that objective. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is united in its concern about this issue.  The motion would have the Government embark on a legal action <Col N="1158" /> against the Government of the UK on a basis which is not specified, without any convincing evidence available to support the case and with expectations of success which could not be fulfilled based upon present evidence.  It is time for this House to address the issues raised by THORP with realism while maintaining legitimate concerns and doing whatever is possible with care and wisdom in protecting our interests.  We must avoid the trap of getting carried away by a tide of emotion and building up unsustainable expectations.</P>
    <P>For many years, successive Governments have pursued our concern about nuclear activities which could affect our well-being.  It is the clearly expressed wish of the Irish people and Government not to pursue nuclear power as a means of providing energy, or nuclear weapons as a means of our defence.  This does not mean we reject all nuclear activity &mdash; that has never been the case.  There are many applications in medicine, industry, research and agriculture where nuclear technology is useful and beneficial and the risks are minimal.  This is why we have a well regulated and safe regime administered by the Radiological Projection Institute of Ireland and backed by legislation.</P>
    <P>When it comes to activities carried out in other countries which may affect our well-being the Government has a right and a duty to do everything it can to protect our interests.  This can best be done by means of inter-government relations.  These means are direct bilateral representations, broader-based diplomatic pressure by like-minded countries, influencing international legal and administrative arrangements and mechanisms such as the European Union, the Paris and London Dumping Conventions and the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Legal action remains a possibility when there is sufficient evidence that there is a breach of national or international law and that the Government concerned has failed or is failing to take any action to remedy the breach.  It is not a sufficient basis for legal action that we do not like or agree with what is going <Col N="1159" /> on or about to be done in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It is time to put the question of THORP into its proper perspective.  The issue has been raised repeatedly in this House but despite all that has been said or done by successive Governments there are unrealistic expectations as to what can be accomplished by this or any other Government.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about a number of things.  THORP is located in another jurisdiction and is not answerable to the wishes of the Government or this House. A large investment of approximately £3 billion has been completed after ten years of construction and is about to be brought into use.  There are contracts of considerable value in place to be executed over the next decade and jobs to be maintained in an area with poor employment prospects.  The relevant UK authorities are prepared to license its operations, maintaining that it will not create an unacceptable public health or environmental hazard for its own citizens or other countries.  That view is endorsed by the European Union Commission in discharge of its functions under the European Treaty.  Recent legal proceedings in the UK on which judgments are awaited concerned the issue of due legal process by UK Ministers in authorising discharges without a new public inquiry.  It was not about achieving a permanent ban on starting up the plant.</P>
    <P>It should be clear from this that if there was a good legal basis for preventing the opening of THORP, proceedings would have been taken by one or other of the parties who are opposed to it.  The stance of the Irish Government has been made clear over the years to the relevant authorities. The basis for this stance is the increase in risk to the health of the public and of environmental contamination arising from discharges of radioactive effluent: the risk of accidents arising from the reprocessing activity and the storage and transport of nuclear fuel, plutonium and radioactive wastes; the accumulation of large amounts of radioactive waste on one site close to the Irish Sea and to <Col N="1160" /> Ireland; the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation from increasing stocks of plutonium; the so far unresolved problems of long term safe storage and disposal of radioactive waste; and the absence of proof of economic benefit from reprocessing which would justify the risks involved.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that in January of last year I sent a detailed and wide ranging submission to the UK Minister for the Environment and the UK Inspectorate of Pollution.  This submission conveyed in the strongest possible terms the Government's total opposition to the continued operation of all nuclear activities carried out at Sellafield and to any expansion of these activities. In particular, the submission expressed the Government's grave concern about commissioning the proposed new THORP plant on the site and the proposed new levels of authorised discharges from Sellafield into the atmosphere and the Irish Sea and called for a full public inquiry to be held before any decision is taken to proceed.</P>
    <P>On 28 June 1993, the UK Secretary of State for the Environment announced that, after consideration by him and the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of the report of the Inspectorate of Pollution, it had been concluded that no point of substance had been raised that should cause them to reconsider the terms of the draft authorisations. However, because a high volume of submissions, including ours, had raised questions as to the justification for the operation of THORP and other issues it was decided to delay the commissioning of the plant until a further round of consultations to deal with the wider issues had been held.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of material published by the UK authorities on these wider issues, I made a second and more comprehensive submission on behalf of the Government to the UK authorities. In addition to detailing our previously stated opposition to the THORP plant, this submission concluded that, as THORP will serve no overall useful purpose, there was no justification for the <Col N="1161" /> increased risk of radiation exposure that the public will receive from the plant.  I also concluded, in a separate detailed examination of British Nuclear Fuel's economics of reprocessing at THORP, that there are no demonstrable overall economic or security benefits arising from THORP's operation which would justify it or balance out possible and likely risks to public health and environmental damage.  In the submission I renewed my call on the UK authorities to hold a full, open and independent public inquiry, including an environmental impact assessment, to deal with the basic justification for operating the THORP plant in the circumstances now prevailing as well as the technical aspects of the revised discharge authorisations.</P>
    <P>Copies of the full submission were made available to Members of the Oireachtas.  Aside from the submission being sent to the Consultation Offices in Manchester, copies of the Government's document were sent to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer, MP, and Ms Gillian Shepherd, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Irish Embassies in London, Japan and Germany.  Copies were also sent to our EU Commissioner, Mr. P·d-raig Flynn and to the EU Commissioners responsible for energy policy and nuclear safety matters, Commissioners Paleo-krasses and Matutes.  All Irish MEPs were also provided with copies.</P>
    <P>Our concerns about THORP were also raised at the EU Council, the Oslo-Paris Convention meeting in Berlin in June 1993, the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in October 1993, the Consultative meeting of the London Dumping Convention in November 1993, the Board of Governors meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in December 1993 and in the EU Commission at the highest levels.  A delegation from my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland also met officials from various British Government Departments and agencies in December under the Irish-UK contact group on nuclear safety matters.  The <Col N="1162" /> Irish group restated its concerns about the environmental, health and other aspects of THORP.</P>
    <P>Despite the Government's objections to the THORP plant set out in its two detailed submissions, the concerns expressed by the other European Environment Ministers and the large number of other objections received in the public consultation process, the UK Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer, MP announced in the House of Commons on 15 December 1993 his decision to allow commissioning of the THORP reprocessing plant at Sellafield in West Cumbria.  The UK authorities had come to a judgment that there was a sufficient balance of advantage in favour of the operation of THORP and that the activities giving rise to radioactive discharges permitted by authorisations were justified.</P>
    <P>On hearing this news, I immediately expressed the Government's deep regret at the British authorities' decision.  I asked the Department of Foreign Affairs to convey, through the Ambassador in London, the Government's very strong views on the matter.  The Government's views on the decision were delivered by the Ambassador to the Secretary of State for the Environment.  I made it clear that the Government was particularly concerned that the British authorities had not acceded to the many requests made to them by this Government and numerous other interested parties for a full public inquiry into the wider issues related to the plant before a decision was taken authorising its commissioning.  It is still the Government's view that a full, open inquiry in which all contentious issues could be subjected to vigorous and independent debate and close scrutiny is the only process which would command widespread public confidence.  I know that Deputies from all parties would wish to be associated with the Government's feelings and fully support our efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>I particularly regret that the British authorities did not recognise at this stage the fundamental changes which have occurred in the nuclear industry since the <Col N="1163" /> seventies decision to build the THORP plant.  Reprocessing is no longer seen as an essential and future strategic activity to safeguard further energy supplies. Indeed the role of the nuclear industry is now much diminished compared with what was envisaged at the time.  The economics of reprocessing have fundamentally changed.  Uranium is now in plentiful supply and prices are lower. More important, the extraction of plutonium then envisaged as the &ldquo;fuel of the future&rdquo; in a new chain of fast breeder reactors does not now have any meaningful role in the energy supply chain because of the technical and economic failure to develop the required technology. Instead, a growing stockpile of plutonium is a cause of increasing concern about its possible risks of causing nuclear weapon proliferation and possible terrorist uses.  In addition, the intervening years have seen no progress in arriving at an acceptable solution to the safe long term storage and disposal of the growing volume of nuclear waste to which reprocessing gives rise.</P>
    <P>One can only come to the conclusion that commissioning THORP is based on the narrow and unconvincing grounds of financial expediency and the viability of BNFL and retaining employment in the Cumbrian region.  It is very regrettable that the UK Government did not see fit to conduct its review in open forum instead of behind closed doors and take a broad view of the present state and future prospects of the reprocessing industry.  I would also say to the governmennts of those countries whose utilities have contracted to reprocess fuel at Sellafield that they are using the plant as a means of resolving their own waste handling problems rather than securing real economic benefits for energy security and supply.</P>
    <P>I recently received a letter from Mr. John Gummer, MP, British Secretary of State for the Environment, regarding the decision taken jointly with the British Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to grant the discharge authorisations necessary for the go-ahead of <Col N="1164" /> THORP.  That letter asserts that the decision was arrived at following long and detailed study of all the points raised in the consultation process.  This repeats the British view that all national and international obligations have been met.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about some matters mentioned in the motion put down by Deputy Sargent.  There is no evidence or proof in our consultation document that the UK has definitely breached any of its own laws or EURATOM legislation. Whether there are grounds for litigation is a matter for the Attorney General to advise on.  In the document the Government called for a full, open and independent public inquiry to cover all relevant issues of dispute, including environment and health effects, basic principles of radiation protection, alternative spent fuel management options, nuclear weapons proliferation and the economics of the plant.  We also said that it was proper to undertake an environmental impact assessment based on EC Directive 85/337/EEC dealing with the environmental effects of certain public projects.  The point was made that if the construction of such a hazardous installation commenced today, it would be irresponsible not to hold an environmental impact assessment in our environmentally-conscious world.  The Government also felt that the terms of a Paris Commission Recommendation, PARCOM 93/5, which was co-sponsored by Ireland and Denmark in June 1993 in Berlin should have been respected by the UK Government.  Although such recommendations are non-binding on member states the Government considered it reasonable and legitimate that the recommendation should be respected in view of its adoption by a two-thirds majority of participants and commitments made by the UK Government through its membership of the Paris Commission, and given the concerns expressed by a majority of delegations about the radioactive waste emissions from the THORP plant into the maritime area covered by the Commission.  Unfortunately, the terms of the recommendations were not agreed by the UK Government.  It is <Col N="1165" /> my view that the credibility and authority of international bodies safeguarding the marine environment for the benefit of all will be damaged if the UK is selective about what it agrees to and does not fully recognise concerns about emissions of radioactive wastes.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the question of the need for an environmental impact assessment. While the scope of the 1977 Parker Public Inquiry was very wide-ranging and evidence was given on the then known effects of radioactivity on human health and the environment, no full or formal environmental impact assessment was ever carried out at the time nor has there been one since.  THORP, of course, did not originally come within the timeframe of the EC Directive 85/337/EEC dealing with the environmental effects of certain public and private projects after the Parker Inquiry as approval for the construction of the plant was given in 1978. The public inquiry and the EC Directive did not take effect until 1988. It would, however, be irresponsible not to have an environmental impact assessment today on THORP if construction of the plant was to commence now.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, considered that, given the huge scale and complexity of the plant, its potential impact on the marine and aerial environment, the lapse of time and knowledge of radiation hazards acquired since planning approval for the project was given in 1978, it would be appropriate to have an environmental impact assessment carried out on the basis of the EC Directive as part of a full public inquiry which we had also requested.</P>
    <P>There are problems however, about basing any legal action on the fact that there has been no environmental impact assessment.  As I already said, approval for the plant was given by the British authorities in 1978 while the EC Directive was not implemented in British law until ten years later.  Secondly, but more unfortunately, under the provisions of the EC Directive on Environmental <Col N="1166" /> Impact Assessment, reprocessing plants are in a separate category from nuclear reactors.  Nuclear reactors are positively subject to an environmental impact assessment.  Reprocessing plants however are treated differently in the directive and there is freedom of action on the part of the UK as to whether such a plant is subject to an assessment.  In this kind of situation, one would have expected British Nuclear Fuels to have acted responsibly.  I consider it illogical to have different nuclear facilities in separate categories but, unfortunately, that is the situation.</P>
    <P>This question of whether an impact assessment study in relation to the start-up authorisation is needed has been taken up by me with the EU Commission, with other interested bodies.  The Commission still have the question under consideration and I am pressing it for an early decision.</P>
    <P>At last week's meeting of the Oslo and Paris Conventions Working Group on Radioactive Discharges my officials called on the United Kingdom not to implement the new discharge authorisations at Sellafield until the provisions of the convention, and in particular its recommendation 93/5, have been observed fully.</P>
    <P>The UK and France confirmed their reservations on this recommendation while Belgium lifted theirs.  The Irish delegation drew attention to the issue of the new discharge authorisation from Sellafield in contravention of this recommendation. As a consequence it called upon the UK to accept fully all the provisions of the Parish Convention and its recommendations called upon the UK to conform with the provisions of PARCOM Recommendation 93/5.  It proposed that a special meeting of the Paris Commission or of its Working Group on Radioactive Discharges or of another suitable group should be held to consider the matter and it also called on the UK not to permit the implementation of the new Sellafield discharge authorisation <Col N="1167" /> until the provisions of the Paris Convention, and in particular PARCOM Recommendation 93/5, had been observed fully.  Denmark supported the Irish statement and the Netherlands urged both the UK and France to accept Recommendation 93/5.</P>
    <P>The Oslo/Paris Convention seeks the progressive reduction and eventual elimination of discharges of radioactive substances in the marine environment. Recommendation 93/5, proposed by Ireland, is specifically concerned with increases in radioactive discharges from nuclear reprocessing plants such as THORP and requires prior consultation with the Paris Commission concerning the need for spent fuel reprocessing, the desirability of carrying out a full environmental impact assessment and the demonstration that best available technology and the precautionary principle will be applied to any planned radioactive discharges. So far the United Kingdom has declined to accept the recommendation. Nevertheless, I will continue to make full use of international conventions such as these to apply ongoing pressure on the British Government in respect of its radioactive discharges to the Irish sea.  In line with the Oslo and Paris Convention we will seek to have all radioactive discharges from Sellafield and THORP progressively reduced and eventually eliminated.</P>
    <P>There have been calls over the years from many interested organisations and individuals for the Government to take legal action to secure the closure of the Sellafield plant.  The Department has, in consultation with the Attorney General's office, examined submissions from various interested organisations such as Greenpeace with regard to taking legal action against Sellafield.  However, these submissions, have related solely to legal procedural possibilities which might be explored and do not put forward any possible case supported by facts or evidence. While the Government has always <Col N="1168" /> been and continues to be committed to legal action if a sufficient case for it can be shown to exist, it cannot initiate such action without a firm legal case based on sufficient evidence.  Any such legal action would have to be based on scientific evidence as to the injurious effects of operations at the Sellafield plant on Ireland. No such evidence is as yet available.</P>
    <P>At a High Court hearing in London on 13 January 1994, Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council were given leave for a judicial review into the United Kingdom Government's decision to allow THORP to proceed.  The judicial review began on 7 February and concluded on 18 February.  The applicants are challenging the decision of the United Kingdom Secretary of State for the Environment to grant the authorisations for THORP without a full and independent public inquiry being held.  It should be stressed that this case is about the pursuance of the due legal process before authorisations were issued and it is not about action that would definitively stop operations at Sellafield.  Senior officials of the Department were in attendance at the judicial review from the outset in an observer capacity on behalf of the Irish Government.  It is expected that the decision on the review will be taken on about 4 March.  The judgment will be carefully examined by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>A recent landmark judgment of the High Court in the United Kingdom highlights the difficulty in establishing a direct cause and effect link between the operation of Sellafield and damages or injuries to people.  On 8 October 1993, the British High Court cleared British Nuclear Fuels of legal responsibility for the leukaemia of two children whose fathers worked at the Sellafield &mdash; formerly Windscale &mdash; plant more than 30 years ago.  It was ruled that the scientific study on which the claimants based their case was unsupported by other studies and had shortcomings which reduced the confidence that could be placed in it.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that <Col N="1169" /> activities at the Sellafield plant are in breach of the relevant EURATOM directives and regulations.  The Commission examined the implications of THORP and issued an Official Opinion on 30 April 1992 that the implementation of the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste from THORP is not liable, either in normal operation or in the case of a range of accident scenarios, to result in radioactive contamination, significant from the point of view of health, of the water, soil or airspace of another member state.  Recently, the Commission stated it had taken the necessary steps to ensure conformity of the THORP plant with the EURATOM Treaty.  The question of whether an impact assessment study in relation to the start-up authorisation is needed is currently still under consideration.  In addition to the EURATOM Treaty, options for legal action which have been examined include possible action pursuant to the EEC Treaty, Directive 76/464/EEC &mdash; on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged from land-based sources into the aquatic environment of the Community &mdash; the Law of the Sea, the Paris Convention, the London Dumping Convention, and action in the United Kingdom courts and in the International Court of Justice. However, these have all been confronted by the same obstacle &mdash; the lack of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>The question of an appropriate forum for legal action would also have to be considered.  To take action in the United Kingdom courts a specific breach of United Kingdom laws would have to be claimed and established by evidence.  In any event, Greenpeace United Kingdom and Lancashire County Council are fully utilising any scope that exists under United Kingdom law.  To take action in the European Courts, a breach of European law would have to be established in the face of the opinion of the European Commission of 30 April 1992 in respect of Article 37 of the Treaty and the recent <Col N="1170" /> statement by the Commission.  Again the problem is the lack of evidence.</P>
    <P>The voluminous documentation received from the UK Secretary of State following his announcement of THORP's go-ahead has being studied by officials of my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute in order to assess the rationale for granting the discharge authorisations and the details of the terms of those authorisations.  Particular attention has been given to the effect of the Secretary of State's amendments to the originally proposed authorisations and the specific overall discharge limits now to be imposed.  The House will be aware that the Government has pointed out in its submissions the glaring gap between what was originally proposed for discharges and what was possible using today's available technology and best operating practices.  The effectiveness of measures requiring British Nuclear Fuels plc to report annually on further discharge reductions and on its forward research and development for krypton abatement technology will be carefully examined.  Actual performance by BNFL in compliance with these discharge restrictions and other adjustments will be closely monitored.</P>
    <P>Despite adjustments in the discharges, there is no doubt that the operation of the plant will increase the risk to the Irish people through radioactive discharges and possible accidents.  In addition, there is considerable uncertainty as regards the ultimate means of disposal of the ever growing amount of waste accumulating at Sellafield.  This waste on one site comes not only from United Kingdom nuclear activities but from those of many other countries also, and its final disposal in a permanently environmentally safe manner has not been resolved.</P>
    <P>Because the THORP decision will inevitably increase the anxiety already felt by the public about Sellafield, I have also asked the institute to expand its programme of testing of levels of radioactive contamination of the marine and aerial <Col N="1171" /> environment and to monitor the levels of exposure to the Irish population to radiation arising from its start-up.  Special equipment has recently been installed at the institute's laboratories to monitor atmospheric levels of krypton-85 gas which is the main contributor to the increase in atmospheric discharges resulting from THORP.</P>
    <P>No increases due to THORP have been detected in our environment.  I should reiterate that operations are only being commenced at THORP and that it will be some time before any impact might be detected on our environment.  The institute has already estimated that in full operation, and assuming that discharges will be at the maximum authorised levels, the radiation dose to the most exposed member of the Irish public will be about 20 per cent greater from operations at Sellafield than at present.  It will still represent no more than 0.2 per cent of a person's present total radiation dose from all sources of radiation, the great bulk of which are natural.  However, this fact does not ease the fears of the public about THORP, particularly in view of the addition it will make to already large plutonium stockpiles, with the proliferation risk which this entails and also the shipment of radioactive waste through the Irish Sea and the accident risk associated with this.</P>
    <P>The Government does not accept that the continuing loss of life and injury in Northern Ireland is a matter of less concern than THORP.  These and all other issues are best resolved in the course of dialogue between friendly Governments. We may not always see eye to eye and agree on all issues, as is the case in relation to THORP, but it is wrong or mischievous to make non-existing connections or suggest that progress can be achieved in one at the expense of the other.</P>
    <P>In case the impression may be put about that the Government was complacent about THORP, I emphatically <Col N="1172" /> reject any such suggestion.  We have taken all the actions open to us and have pursued our case with vigour.  There is no question of the Irish public being exposed immediately to high risks as a result of the start-up of THORP, but that there will be some increased risk from discharges and possible accidents, however small, is undeniable.  What is strongly arguable &mdash; and this is the main basis for the Government's opposition to THORP &mdash; is that there is no demonstrable economic or social benefits which would justify these risks because the economic basis for reprocessing is unsound and the political and ultimately military and radiological risk of accumulating economically useless separated plutonium are unacceptable.  In addition, there is no long term satisfactory solution to storing and disposing of the pile of waste which will inevitably accumulate at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The problem is therefore a long term one which requires continuing vigilance, continuing diplomatic and representational pressure, insistence on technical improvements to reduce risk, building a stronger international political climate and more effective instruments to make operations such as reprocessing and the actions of Government that authorise and regulate them more amenable to reason and common sense and to public accountability in its broadest sense.  The Government will therefore maintain its complete opposition to nuclear operations at Sellafield and to any further expansion of the complex.  The United Kingdom Secretary of State has already indicated that any court proceedings against the operation of THORP would be resisted vigorously and, in his view, a court could not but be impressed by the care and attention devoted to the process of arriving at the decision to proceed with THORP.  The question as to what legal action the Irish Government could take now regarding the THORP plant is, of course, being kept under constant consideration and review.  In consultation with the Attorney General the Government <Col N="1173" /> remains committed to maintaining diplomatic and international pressure on the British authorities and, if the opportunity arises to initiate appropriate legal action, if there is a sufficiently good chance that such proceedings would succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister with interest and will compare his contribution with the statements made by his party's spokespersons when in Opposition. The contrast is quite stark. Tonight's statement by a Government Minister is a most feeble effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Who wrote that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wrote my own speech.  The statement is a complete cave-in to the pressures from the British Government. It is a climb down the like of which I have never seen in the ten years during which I raised the issue of Sellafield and Windscale. The former Deputy Gerard Brady and I were the first to raise this issue in the House when there was very little interest in Windscale.  The same officials now tell us there is no evidence we can pursue through the European Court.  The statements by the Minister are in direct contrast to what was said when Fianna F·il was in Opposition.</P>
      <P>Sellafield offered a target for Brit bashing and raised the hackles of the back-benchers at the appropriate time.  The Government will not take legal action because it says it has no evidence.  As a country which has nothing to gain but quite a lot to lose if there is an accident, we should make a strong and vigorous protest in international forums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went to Sellafield in 1983 and asked pertinent questions in relation to its operation. I was politely taken down the road to a dump which was called a treatment plant and shown low and medium radioactive waste exported from Ireland.  It was made quite clear that we were dependent on them to dispose of some of our <Col N="1174" /> nuclear waste and the position has not changed.</P>
    <P>As we do not have a waste management policy we depend on other countries to deal with our chemical, toxic and nuclear waste.  As a result, we are totally compromised in our stance with the British Government on this issue.  Instead of barking and biting in this House the Government should formulate a waste management policy.  Industries with waste output have not located here because of the uncertainty in relation to the disposal of waste.  A vacuum has been created by lack of policy in this area which has allowed a number of fringe groups to create unnecessary fears in relation to environmental issues although I distinguish between those and responsible environmental groups who have taken a correct stance.  It is very easy to lash out about foreign issues that affect us but when it comes to getting our act together we are found wanting.</P>
    <P>The proposed operation ignores our rights as a neighbouring nation to consultation on matters affecting the health and well-being of our people and environment. The risks associated with the development are avoidable and unnecessary.  The lack of established waste disposal facilities for THORP in either the UK or in those countries receiving THORP waste constitutes a violation of the precautionary principle. As this development violates the principle of international relations between sovereign states and accepted principles of environmental prudence, it should not be permitted to proceed.</P>
    <P>The majority of British nuclear installations &mdash; 12 in all &mdash; are located on the west coast facing Ireland.  The west coast has one of Britain's lowest population concentrations while the east coast of Ireland has its highest population concentration. A significant proportion of the Irish economy is based directly or indirectly on sectors dependent on the natural environment &mdash; agriculture, tourism, food industries, fishing and forestry. <Col N="1175" /> For this reason we should be opposed to indefinite operation of nuclear installations in western Britain.</P>
    <P>The first principle of the system of protection suggested by the International Committee on Radiological Protection states that: &ldquo;No practice involving exposures to radiation should be adopted unless it produces a sufficient benefit to the exposed individuals or to society to offset the radiation detriment it causes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland is exposed to the risk of radiation hazard by the transportation, processing and storage of all radioactive material at nuclear installations on the west coast of Britain.  This development will significantly increase the risk.  There is no benefit to either the individuals or society exposed to this risk.  Not only is this exposure to risk without benefit but it is without the consent or control of the citizens of Ireland.  This is a significant interference in the right to national self-determination and represents a violation of national sovereignty.</P>
    <P>The risks to which Ireland is exposed are avoidable because of the following factors.  If nuclear installations are safe why are they all concentrated along the west coast?  They could be evenly distrubuted throughout the UK closer to centres of population and consumption, thus avoiding a disporportionate share of risk exposure to the people of Ireland. Other forms of waste management generate less volumes of low and intermediate level wastes which require local disposal thereby increasing the avoidable hazard.  Seventy per cent of the material reprocessed at THORP will originate overseas, thereby increasing exposure to avoidable hazard.</P>
    <P>These factors must be further considered in the light of emerging issues which render the development unnecessary, namely, the cessation of &ldquo;fast breeder&rdquo; reactor programmes by customers and the falling demand and price for plutonium. The likelihood that these two factors, combined with Krypton 85 <Col N="1176" /> gas removal and decommissioning costs, will render the facility uneconomical.  The precautionary principle holds that actions with unpredictable outcomes should not be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Reprocessing at THORP will generate high volumes of low and intermediate level wastes which will require storage/disposal facilities.  At present there is no long term waste management programme in place.  The integrity of Nirex's planned repository for intermediate level waste is now being questioned by the UK Government's agencies.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, while it is proposed that all high level wastes should be returned to the countries of origin, none of them has built storage plants for high level wastes.  For these reasons alone the commissioning of THORP is premature.</P>
    <P>I know that 25 per cent of all electricity in OECD countries is nuclear generated. This contributes to reductions in atmospheric emissions and nuclear power contributes to international stability by diversifying energy sources.</P>
    <P>The advantages do not outweigh the virtually irreversible risks implicit in all aspects of the nuclear power industry. Commitments to further diversification of energy sources, complete with energy consumption management, can instead contribute significantly to these concerns. In general, a phased decrease in dependence on fission-based nuclear power must be achieved.  The commissioning of THORP is a retrograde step in this process.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will put in place certain measures to study and investigate the incidence of disease in this country. Not only should that be done, there should be increasing support for research and development of diversified energy sources.  We should contribute significantly to fission research and development and provide all monitoring of the Irish Sea on behalf of the European Union, on the effects of radioactivity in the marine environment.  I still believe there should be an independent nuclear <Col N="1177" /> energy inspectorate in Europe because for too long we have had to take the British word after accidents.  As the records show, Britain disclosed only what it had to because of public opinion.</P>
    <P>This issue has grown from a non-political issue in the early 1980s to an intensive political issue today.  I regret that all the talk and rhetoric from the Government in Opposition has come to nought because the Minister's contribution this evening is a complete climb down, giving in to the British Government and the heavily financed British nuclear fuels industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I came to this House in 1981, no subject has received more attention, nor has there been more manifestation of opposition to it, than the subject matter of Sellafield.  As my colleague said, all these manifestations of opposition appear to have come to nought even though the Government outlined and clearly indicated its outright opposition.  Towards the end of his contribution the Minister indicated that the Government will continue to oppose the extension of activities in Sellafield.  If we take the success of its opposition to date it would have been almost better not to oppose because it had the opposite effect.</P>
      <P>The issue of health and safety of people on this side of the Irish Sea was referred to by a number of speakers.  In view of agreement in the House on the possible risks I cannot understand the reason there has not been sufficient penetration of the armour on the other side of the Irish Sea in impressing on that Government that this matter is of serious concern to our people.  It concerns our health, welfare and safety although the threat of legal action does not appear to impress those on the other side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, this country is in dire need of a proper waste management plan.  It behoves the Government to focus its combined attention on that area because there is no sense in producing nuclear waste and hoping that somebody <Col N="1178" /> will take it to the other side of the Irish Sea for reprocessing.  Another aspect is the danger of an accident in the short term.  While British Nuclear Fuels has over several years put in place various safety measures which it claims will guarantee, as far as possible, against accidents, there is no absolute fail safe system.  The law of averages says there could be a serious accident and if one occurs, there will be a serious problem on this side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Every time British Nuclear Fuels issues a press release it states it has reduced, by a considerable amount, the degree of possible pollution or discharges with obvious benefits to those who live here, particularly those on the east coast.  In a press release, dated 21 February 1994, David Coulston, director of health and safety said:</P>
    <P>BNFL is fully committed to continuing to minimise the impact of operations on the environment.  Discharges of the significant nuclides have been reduced to 1 per cent of the peak levels of the 1970s. </P>
    <P>That is an amazing statement because if British Nuclear Fuels is now saying that 1 per cent of the significant levels of the 1970s have been achieved why did they tell us in the early 1980s that there was no danger and that comparisons could be made in relation to radioactivity in a host of other areas which were completely harmless?  If that is the case why did British Nuclear Fuels recently spend £600 million modernising safety standards at their plants?  If we accepted the reassurances in the late 1970s and early 1980s what was the necessity for the expense if there was not an ongoing problem?  The consequences of an accident in the short term would have long-term effects on the health and safety of people here, particularly those on the east coast. Despite the Government's protestations it has not sufficiently impressed on British Nuclear Fuels and/or the British Government the seriousness with which it has <Col N="1179" /> gone about its business.  If it had gone about its business in a serious fashion I have no doubt its views would have been taken on board and there would be an indication of a scaling down of activity. We could then have said that the Government has taken on board the fears expressed by the Irish people and sufficiently impressed on its counterparts on the other side of the Irish Sea its sincerity and determination.</P>
    <P>The question of ongoing discharges was referred to by other speakers.  Notwithstanding modifications to the plant in the past, all of which were stated to be state of the art in terms of improving the position from our point of view, why have they not been able to tell us there is no risk?  Nobody ever said that and nobody can claim it.  I fully recognise that the Sellafield site is of considerable economic value on the other side of the Irish Sea. We must also impress on our friends there that the price is too high for that kind of economic activity.  If the Government is serious about what it says now&mdash; and about what it said when in Opposition in the early 1980s &mdash; why has it not been successful in getting across to its counterparts and ultimately to British Nuclear Fuels the full extent of its fears and its intention to protect the health, welfare and safety of the people on this side of the Irish Sea?</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Bradford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put political differences aside tonight and appeal to the Minister to come clean on Irish Steel Limited in Cork.  A serious and dangerous game of cat and mouse is going on and it is being played with people's lives and future. The uncertainty surrounding the plant is hurting families, and morale at the plant <Col N="1180" /> must be very low.  Will the Minister take the necessary steps to restore confidence in the plant?  To clarify the position the Minister must release the consultant's report on the future of Irish Steel.  The leaking of the document over the weekend must have come from the Government or the board of Irish Steel.  Will the Minister put the record straight tonight for the sake of the plant, the employees and their families and the welfare of Cork city?  All the Deputies representing the area are here and it reflects our interest. Irish Steel is unique and must not be included in the decimation of steel plants throughout Europe.  Ireland, as the only island nation in Europe, has a strategic interest in retaining and maintaining a steel mill.  In the interest of fair play and openness will the Minister make available to the Members and to the public all the important parts of the report, although I accept that he may feel that some parts are sensitive and could be prejudicial to the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for allowing me to express my concern about Irish Steel and I agree with his demand for clarification.  The air of uncertainty surrounding the plant is very damaging.  The Minister is more than aware of the importance of this plant to the Cork region, particularly east Cork and Cork city area.  It is the lifeblood of the town of Cobh as the vast majority of the workforce come from there.  Any major loss of jobs in the plant would be a disaster for the town.</P>
      <P>We are not expecting miracles from the Minister but it is not long since promises and commitments were being thrown around like wedding confetti.  Perhaps all the promises cannot be delivered on but I appeal to the Minister to do the maximum and in the short term to clarify the situation.  Deputy M·irÌn Quill wishes to avail of the half minute left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate getting the time and I join in the appeal to the Minien <Col N="1181" /> ster.  He should publish the report as it was commissioned by his Department and it has his backing to that extent.  The workforce need to know exactly if it is the intention of the Minister to act on the recommendations of that report.</P>
      <P>Another report came from the board today and I hope that report will get full consideration before any action is taken. While we all admit the need for cost cutting, none of us will concede that there is scope for laying off more than 50 per cent of the workforce as recommended in the consultant's report.  That would have a devastating effect.  This plant is worth at least £11 million annually to Cobh and its environs.  To take that kind of spending power out of that region would be the death knell of the town of Cobh.  The Minister should intervene quickly and put in place a rescue package that will guarantee the long-term viability of the plant and save the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Mulvihill, Wallace and Martin.</P>
      <P>For the past 13 years I have represented Cobh.  In the mid eighties the closure of Verolme Dockyard had a devastatingly depressing effect on the people.  I hoped that another catastrophe of that scale would not occur, but if we are to believe the newspaper reports this weekend the future for Irish Steel is not hopeful.  About 300 or so of the workers live in Cobh or its environs.  Friends and supporters of mine whom I met over the weekend have expressed grave concern and anxiety about their future and how they will pay their mortgages, pay for their children's education and honour other commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loss of Irish Steel would mean the loss of about £11 million in wages circulating in the area and would have a serious effect on small service industries. The workers are aware that changes and rationalisation will have to come to ensure the future of the company.  The <Col N="1182" /> suggestion in the newspapers that 56 per cent of the workforce would be let go is nonsensical, especially when they suggest that the company will survive when those people are laid off.  The plant could not operate with 200 people or fewer.</P>
    <P>I decry the manner in which the report was leaked to the newspapers over the weekend.  I am sure the Government will have time to consider this problem and come up with a package to ensure the future of all the people working in Irish Steel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I live in the Cobh area and have many ties with Irish Steel as I was once employed there and I have a fair knowledge of what goes on.  Irish Steel means everything to the town of Cobh with its population of 10,000 people.  Every household has some connection either directly or indirectly with Irish Steel.  Further job losses in Irish Steel would devastate Cobh.  The dockyard in Cobh closed some years ago and we were promised 450 jobs which to date have not been delivered.  The people of Cobh are worried by the way this document was leaked last Saturday.  The <i>Cork Examiner</i> referred to 330 redundancies and this would devastate the town. Although once we had great employment, now there is very little.  Redundancies in Irish Steel would also affect spin-off industries and cause terrible problems for the population.</P>
      <P>There is a future for Irish Steel.  There are problems in Europe because European flat steel prices have fallen by 10 per cent since April 1991 and only recovered half of the 20 per cent drop which occurred from April 1991 to April 1992.</P>
      <P>Only concerted action by European steelmakers will stabilise prices and turn around the European steel industry.  I appeal to the Minister to put his every effort into saving the jobs in Irish Steel.</P>

      <P>Recently in Cork the Minister made a very positive statement <Col N="1183" /> on job creation which was widely welcomed throughout the city and county. Unfortunately, the announcement on Irish Steel over the weekend is a cloud not alone over Cobh but over the city at large.  Employment in Irish Steel affects both city and county.  There is grave anxiety among those who work in the plant as well as those involved in subsidiary activities.</P>
      <P>We know the Minister's record on Irish Steel, because in the past we have discussed with him the future of Irish Steel. He is well aware of our concerns and I know his commitment to Cork.  I join with my colleagues in asking him not only to clarify the uncertainty but let it be known where Irish Steel is going.  Management and workers in Irish Steel cooperate fully and will not be found wanting.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in expressing concern at the announcement on Irish Steel over the weekend. When the all-party delegation met the Minister to discuss Irish Steel he told us it was one of his priorities to build up confidence and trust between workers and management.  The nature and the manner of the leak over the weekend has done a great deal to damage that trust.  It is imperative that the Minister intervene at an early stage to bring management and workers together to negotiate in the context of the consultants' report.  There needs to be a team approach to the resolution of the difficulties that face Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that approaches are made to the European Communities in the context of employment as this is a major employment issue in County Cork. We need certain safeguards and protections, given the overall level of unemployment. With Europe's new emphasis on employment policy in the social document announced by Mr. Delors, we have a clear case to make to Europe on its role in the preservation and protection of <Col N="1184" /> existing jobs in our economy.  Irish Steel falls into this category.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Allen's comments that we must not play politics with this issue because the livelihoods of too many families are dependent on it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that seven Members have contributed to this debate, which is without precedent.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to clear the air on the consultants' report on Irish Steel.  I do not have to remind the Deputies of the background to this report.  In its financial year ended 30 June 1993, Irish Steel lost £13 million and its losses were continuing at the rate of £1 million a month.  Negotiations aimed at reducing these losses by cutting labour costs and changing work practices took almost six months to negotiate and indeed brought the company to the brink of closure.  In response to a call from SIPTU that the cost reductions did not go far enough to ensure the viability of the company and that a study by consultants should be done on the management's plan for viability, I commissioned last December a report on Irish Steel, the main purpose of which was to review the management's viability strategy.</P>
      <P>At the outset let me say that I have received the report which I have made available to the Irish Steel board on the understanding that it would be treated on a strictly confidential basis.  I understand that the report was considered by the board at its meeting yesterday and that I will be receiving its views on it shortly.</P>
      <P>I understand also that detailed proposals on specific measures to realise the cash savings that must be achieved, in line with the consultants' recommendations, will be prepared by the board over the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will appreciate that until such time as the Government has had an opportunity of considering the report and the board's strategy for introducing the <Col N="1185" /> cost reductions that are needed, I am not in a position to say what its position will be on its recommendations.  I have to say that the consultants have stated that, in view of the commercial sensitivity of the information contained in the report, it is not intended for general publication and they advise restricted circulation in order to protect the interests of the company, the management and workers, whose livelihoods depend on it.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that the publication of sensitive commercial information could be damaging to the company, particularly in these very difficult times for the steel industry, and it is in nobody's interest, least of all Irish Steel's, that this should happen.  We must protect against this at all costs.  Accordingly, I do not propose to publish the full report.  However, because I consider this an extremely important report and because of the need to have an informed and meaningful debate on the future of the company, I propose to make available to Deputies and Senators and to the workforce and management a summary of the report. Furthermore, I am asking the consultants to be available to them for oral briefings and for any clarifications which they require.</P>
    <P>Nobody should be foolish enough to think that tough decisions can be avoided in the case of this company or that these decisions will not involve pain.  This will not come as a surprise to anybody in the House this evening.  Sacrifices will be required on everybody's part.  However, decisions require full and careful consideration of all of the issues concerned in a non-confrontational and calm way and in a non-politicised manner.  I appreciate very much the comments made by the Opposition Deputies in this regard.  I recognise that they have at heart the best interests of the people of Cobh and the workforce at Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>This is where we can all help.  It is our duty to the workforce at Irish Steel and to the taxpayers to do so.  For this reason I must emphasise again the irrevocable <Col N="1186" /> damage that can be done to the company through the publication of sensitive commercial information and also through uninformed speculation about its future. Serious decisions have to be taken on the future of the company, a future in which I believe.  These decisions are best taken in the light of all the information available, in a calm and considered way and not in the full glare of the media.</P>
    <P>As soon as possible &mdash; by that I mean in the next number of days or perhaps a week &mdash; the company and its employees will have to consider and negotiate solutions to these problems.  They must be allowed to do that in an atmosphere that is not clouded by intensive and frequently inaccurate press speculation.  They need to take careful and prudent stock of their position and their options.  They need to have regard to how the company is perceived by its customers, it suppliers, its creditors and its competitors.  In view of the difficulties currently being encountered in Brussels in reducing the huge overcapacity in the European steel market, many of Irish Steel's competitors would be only too glad to see Irish Steel's difficulties being highlighted.</P>
    <P>All of us who want to secure the future of the company will realise it is only by facing up to these difficulties that a solution can be found.  By working together the workforce, management and the board, with the support of the Oireachtas, can find a satisfactory future for Irish Steel and for the people of Cobh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important need of any disabled person is to have easy access to normal facilities within his or her own home.  In 1971 I was very conscious of the need to enable disabled people to have ground floor facilities to make ordinary living easier for persons confined to a wheelchair.  As the then Minister for Local Government, I introduced a new scheme of grants, the disabled person's home improvements <Col N="1187" /> grants, which I am glad to say have benefited many handicapped people over the past 23 years.</P>
      <P>I am, however, greatly concerned at the Government's evident lack of commitment to this scheme which seems to be amply illustrated in County Galway where 94 applicants to the county council have been recommended for a grant by the county medical officer.  The total grant requirement, based on a 50 per cent grant, is £297,000 but due to the miserly allocation from the Minister for the Environment only £15,000 is available to Galway County Council in 1994 for this work.</P>
      <P>I am astonished at the callousness of the Government in denying the most needy in our midst basic facilities to enable them live with a small degree of comfort in their own homes.  I am talking about people who are physically disabled; confined to a wheelchair; who may need ramps to get in and out of their homes; door jambs widened to accommodate wheelchairs; door handles lowered; downstairs bedrooms, sittingrooms and bathrooms to give independence in their personal lives and kitchen sinks lowered to facilitate working from a wheelchair. Similar facilities are required for people with severe heart conditions, emphysema and other debilitating and disabling handicaps and diseases.  These citizens, some disabled since birth, others disabled while playing a vigorous role as members of the working population or weakened in old age after a lifetime of service to their families and the nation, deserve better in 1994 than the Government is offering.</P>
      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government carries the fine words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are firmly committed to eliminating inequality for all groups in society that have suffered from disability, disadvantage and discrimination. People with physical disability have the same talents and abilities as anybody else &mdash; they are <Col N="1188" /> equal citizens.  A major programme of improvements is necessary to end marginalisation, to ensure full expression of equality.  Particular provision will be made in our housing policy and plans for the elderly and for people with a disability.  We are committed to the establishment of a caring society where the needs of those living in poverty and others who depend on income maintenance from the State are seriously addressed.  It is our intention to move as fast as possible towards a system that provides fast and efficient access to all on the basis of need. </P>
    <P>None of these fine sentiments will bring relief in 1994 to the 94 applicants in the Galway County Council area who will be deprived of basic facilities unless the Minister's priorities are altered and more money is provided for this urgent scheme.  An extra £300,000 this year would bring some relief to these stricken people.  The Government that has decided to deny Galway County Council this £300,0000 has chosen instead to allocate £5 million to Croke Park.  This is a strange and inhuman set of priorities for any Government.  Shame on the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to admit the callousness of his policies to date, to recognise the sheer cynicism that allows him to make finely worded commitments never to be fulfilled.  This is sad in the extreme.</P>
    <P>In a recent debate in this House on another subject it was established that the Minister was committed to investing £6 million in constructing one mile of roadway, yet he would deny £300,000 to the most needy, people who have had to have recourse to the housing aid for the disabled scheme to provide basic facilities in their homes.</P>
    <P>In the specific case in question there is no possibility of any work being undertaken in 1994 under the allocation of £110,000 from the Department of the Environment, even though this application <Col N="1189" /> was approved by the County Galway medical officer in July 1992.  At the present rate of funding it could be four to five years before all of the current applicants receive grant payments.  I have not referred to the Galway Corporation area where there are also many urgent applications.  In one case a 23-year old girl who is confined to a wheelchair has to be lifted in and out of the bath by her mother because a wheelchair shower cannot be provided until a grant is approved under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council states that of this year's grant allocation of £110,000, £95,000 has had to be paid out for work completed during 1993, leaving only £15,000 for any work carried out in 1994. Approval has been granted in 22 cases, representing £75,000, where payments will soon be due but there is no money available to meet £60,000 of that requirement. In 20 cases where the county medical officer has recommended grants totalling £72,000 approval cannot be granted because there is no money available. Another 52 cases representing £150,000 cannot be considered due to the dire financial situation.</P>
    <P>These facts are an indictment of the Minister's policy and priorities to date. He should do something worthwhile to help these deserving people before they lose all faith in him and his Government's promises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of the disabled person's grants scheme is the responsibility of individual housing authorities, as the Deputy is well aware.  For this reason I would have no knowledge of the position on any application and it would, furthermore, be inappropriate for me to attempt to intervene in any individual case.</P>
      <P>I should clarify the position on the financing of these grants.  Expenditure by local authorities under the disabled person's grants scheme is financed from their own capital or revenue resources, by borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency or by a combination of these methods.  My Department recoups up to half the authorities' expenditure subject to a maximum cash limit in any one case.</P>
      <P>Capital expenditure on these grants, together with local authority house purchase and improvement loans, is subject to the capital allocation for these purposes notified to the local authorities annually.  Local authorities are facilitated as far as possible in providing increased capital allocations to meet demands for grant expenditure.  Within the capital allocation it is a matter for the authorities to decide the funding arrangements to be made each year in respect of these grants. The Deputy, as the person who introduced the scheme, knows that neither the Minister nor the Department of the Environment is involved in such decisions.  Therefore it is primarily for the local authority to determine how individual applicants fare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital allocations for 1994 will be notified to authorities shortly but in the meantime they can continue to pay grants in the normal way and need not hold up any applications on this account.  I am satisfied that the amounts of the capital allocations have not been the cause of difficulties in relation to grant payments. Authorities are well aware that they will always receive a positive response from the Department if they seek to have their allocations revised upwards to allow them to borrow from the HFA where <Col N="1191" /> they cannot provide sufficient funds from their own resources.  Loan finance has been and continues to be readily available from the HFA to authorities seeking it for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about grants, not loans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about loans to individuals but rather to local authorities to pay grants.  Last year the number of recoupments made by my Department in respect of disabled person's grants amounted to almost 1,600 at a cost of £2.5 million.  Notwithstanding the continuing increase in activity and in grant payments under the scheme the limit on the maximum individual recoupment from the Department was increased by me with effect from 1 March 1993 by 60 per cent from £2,500 to £4,000.  As the general practice has been for local authorities to match the recoupment available to them from the Department in individual cases the effect of this increase should be to raise the maximum available grant from £5,000 to £8,000.  This is clear evidence of the Department's commitment and mine to this scheme.</P>
      <P>Although the level of activity under the disabled person's grants scheme remains high, I have become aware from representations that there may be problems with the availability of grants to eligible persons in some areas.  Such would arise if authorities failed to make adequate provision for the scheme in their annual estimates or were not prepared to borrow from the HFA to supplement internal resources.  It may well be that the problem in the case referred to by the Deputy is due to a failure by Galway County Council in this regard.  It is its responsibility and it has the means to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be happy if it was the case that disabled persons, some of whom would urgently require to have their homes adapted, were prevented from <Col N="1192" /> having their accommodation needs met because of the failure of any local authority to operate the scheme as intended and introduced by the Deputy.  Accordingly, my Department is carrying out a detailed survey to establish the general situation in regard to the operation of these grants around the country.  A detailed questionnaire has recently been sent to housing authorities and they have been asked to submit their replies as quickly as possible.  I will then consider whether any action on my part is needed but I stress that this should not be seen by local authorities as in any way absolving them from their responsibility to operate the scheme properly in their areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have rushed back from Paris to represent the potato growers of Ballinacourty and other areas on the south coast.  The growers are alarmed to hear rumours of the introduction of legislation which would restrict them to planting potatoes in the same area of ground only once every four years.  For the people that I and other Deputies represent that would be disastrous and would gravely upset their system of planting and growing potatoes.  It is normal for the early potato growers to take conacre. They are small farmers.  In Ballinacourty in particular, 20 acres would be regarded as a sizeable holding and people can make a good living out of that if the potator crop is successful, if there is no overproduction and they can get in the seed in good time.  The objective is to get the seed potatoes in before St. Patrick's Day in order to get an early crop. However, in a year such as this they may not be able to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A system of rotation whereby the grower could plant the same area of ground only once every four years would destroy their livelihood.  I ask the Minister to be flexible.  I would not disagree <Col N="1193" /> with this legisltion if it were to apply to main crop potatoes.  There is a problem there because the potatoes are so long in the ground.  The real experts are the people who grow the potatoes in Goleen, Knockadoon, Kilmore Quay, Carnsore Point, Fethard-on-Sea, Ardmore or Ballinacourty. They tell me that the early potatoes are in the ground for only 12 weeks and that eelworm is not a danger. They see no reason for bringing in repressive legislation.  They can get value from the land they rent if they can get two crops of potatoes in the three years; in the interim year they will probably plant corn on the same land.  The problem the Department wishes to address does not arise in the case of early potatoes but has more to do with the main crop potatoes, which are left in the ground through August, September, into October and, in some cases, into November.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give these people a chance.  They will not survive if this becomes law.  They compete with the Italians and the Cypriots, who have considerably better climates.  They do it on a very small acreage and work extraordinarily hard.  They are dependent on the vagaries of the weather.  I hope the Minister can give me an assurance that this legislation will not apply to the early potatoes and will apply only to main crop potatoes.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Deasy back from Paris.  I am impressed by his concern for the potato growers of Ballinacourty and the south west generally.  I am also concerned, as is my colleague, the Minister for Food and Horticulture, Deputy O'Shea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last October Minister ”'Shea issued a press release with a view to bringing to the notice of potato growers that statutory regulations were being drafted which would introduce a system of crop rotation for potato growing.  This advance notice was given in order to draw the attention of growers, particularly those taking conacre, to the importance of implementing a proper rotational practice and to prepare <Col N="1194" /> them in good time for the impending regulations.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that the frequent growing of potatoes in the same land leads inevitably to a build-up of potator cyst nematode (PCN), or potato root eelworm, as it is more commonly known.  Unfortunately, too many growers fail to observe this fact and the Department therefore has found it necessary to take steps to ensure that crop rotation is practised so as to prevent the spread of PCN and to protect the health status of the national potato crop.</P>
    <P>The need to provide the statutory rotation of potato crops is recommended in the programme for the development of the potato sector drawn up by An Bord Glas.  This recommendation had the support of all parties involved in the drawing up of the development programme.</P>
    <P>In the course of his address to the National Potato Conference three weeks ago, Minister O'Shea again expressed his concern and undertook to have further discussions with the farming organisations before proceeding with the introduction of legislation.  Last week he met their representatives and had a full discussion on this subject.  He undertook to consider their suggestions and to communicate a decision to them without undue delay.  He is at present considering their views on the regulations dealing with rotation for potatoes.</P>
    <P>A problem can arise for potato growing which is related to the new rules on cereals following the reformed CAP regime for cereals.  It is claimed that it is uneconomical to take land to grow potatoes for one year without a follow-up crop of cereals.  Cereal compensation can only be paid on eligible land, that is, land ploughed between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 1991.  Cereals grown on &ldquo;new&rdquo; ground, that is, ineligible land, would not get the arable aid.</P>
    <P>In the context of individual base areas Ireland continues to argue that there is no need for rules on eligible land, as the <Col N="1195" /> individual base areas system will have adequate controls.  The Commission however refuse to waive these rules and there is no guarantee that the Commission will relent on this.  I wish to point out to the Deputy that &ldquo;early&rdquo; growing areas have been found to be infested with PCN and that there is evidence that infestation has spread to main crop growing areas through lack of proper hygiene controls.  Under existing legislation land which becomes infested with PCN must be put down to grass.  It is known that the infestation can remain in the land for up to 20 years.  Potatoes which are exported must be certified free from PCN.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> I have the advice of experts, but I know that Deputy Deasy is an expert in his own right.  He has told me of his expertise in horticultural matters and I know he has a number of tunnels in operation.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my written reply to Question No.  105 on 2 February 1994.  My Department has asked F¡S to provide the information sought and this will be communicated to the Deputy as soon as it is received.</P>
      <P>Details of patterns of early school leaving by county are not available in the education sector.  Data is compiled by F¡S Local Employment Offices on the basis of returns submitted twice yearly by schools giving details of pupils who have left school early.  A social guarantee register is compiled by F¡S and used for recruitment onto training and employment programmes, including Youthreach in the vocational education committee sector.</P>
      <P>Following the undertaking given to Deputy Seymour on 2 February, the Department wrote to the Assistant Director General, of F¡S asking for information on early school-leaving trends by county and seeking access to the data emerging from analysis of the social guarantee register.  The information is being compiled by F¡S at present and they will supply it to the Department as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The planning data for national schools lays down guidelines on pupil space in school playgrounds.  The planning data for national schools was drafted and designed in accordance with the relevant British and European standards. These standards are determined by reference to extensive research and development of playareas for school children. The provision of a school site or the provision of a site extension where necessary is mainly a matter for the school authorities.  The suitability and size offered by the school authorities is, however, inspected and approved by my professional advisers prior to the sanctioning of grant-aid for the new school or extension.</P>
      <P>My Department is carrying out a pilot survey on the facilities of a limited number of national schools and a general survey is planned before the summer when the results of the limited pilot survey are assessed.  Play areas will be included in both surveys.</P>

      <P>The investigation to which the Deputy refers has now been completed and I am assured that adequate arrangements are now being put in place to avoid a recurrence of this unfortunate incident.</P>
      <P>As indicated to the House on the 26th January last, the issues involved in this case have to do with the security arrangements surrounding the handling of young offenders.  I would not, therefore, consider it appropriate to make the findings of the investigation public.</P>
      <P>However, I can assure the House that both I and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, view this incident with the utmost seriousness.  From the detailed investigation carried out it is evident that the incident occurred because the normal arrangements for dealing with cases of non-admission to a young offender centre were not followed on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Under these arrangements, it is required that the accompanying garda should return the offender to the court, if it still sitting.  Where the court is not sitting, the offender would normally be returned to the Garda station where he/she would be given station bail.  On more rare occasions, the offender would be returned home and placed under the care of a parent or responsible adult.</P>
      <P>As a result of the breakdown in procedures on this occasion, my colleague the Minister for Justice has asked the Garda Authorities to ensure that all gardaÌ are fully aware of their responsibilities in this area for the future.  In addition, my Department is currently engaged in discussions with the Department of Justice and the Garda Authorities to review current procedures and consider whether further improvements can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I am grateful to the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to correct a <Col N="971" /> statement which I made to the House on 23rd November last in response to Private Members' questions on this matter.</P>
    <P>In the course of responding on that occasion, I indicated that the court had been informed that Trinity House was full and that nonetheless the Judge decided to sentence the youth in question to one month in Trinity House.</P>
    <P>I made this statement in good faith and on the basis of the information available to me at that time.  However, I have since been advised that the court had not in fact been so informed.</P>
    <P>The confusion surrounding this point arose from the fact that on the day of the court hearing, the centre was contacted by a member of the Garda regarding availability of a place in the centre for the youth in question.  This garda had been charged with bringing the youth to the centre.  The staff of the centre had incorrectly assumed that the inquiry was being made on behalf of the court and had so advised my Department.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to apologise to the House and the court for any inconvenience to which my previous statement on this point may have given rise.</P>

      <P>There are currently 1,369 temporary teachers employed in primary schools.  The total cost of employing these temporary teachers is approximately £23 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures for making appointments to teaching posts in primary schools are laid down in the &ldquo;Guidelines and Rules of Procedure for Boards of <Col N="972" /> Management&rdquo;.  Under the terms of Rule 23 (e) of the procedures, the appointment of temporary assistants is a matter for the Board of Management, subject to the approval of the Minister.  This provision, in effect accords management authorities discretionary powers in relation to the appointment of temporary teachers. Teachers so appointed must, of course, be qualified in the ordinary way.  My understanding is that Boards of Management, in most cases, exercise the discretion allowed them by going through procedures of publicly advertising and competitively selecting long term temporary appointees.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the positions of the INTO and the management bodies, who hold differing views on the issue of the introduction of mandatory procedures for the appointment of temporary teachers.  My Department is continuing to have discussions with both the managerial authorities and the INTO in order to facilitate an agreement between them. For this reason I am reluctant to comment further.</P>

      <P>Membership of the European Union obliges the relevant authorities in all the member states in the administration of their schemes of third level student support not to discriminate between their own nationals and nationals from other member states.</P>

    <P>As a result of these obligations the situation regarding third level students from here studying in the UK and students from the UK studying here is as follows: (a) In the UK practically all undergraduate students from here qualify to have their fees paid by the authorities there, as is the position with their UK counterparts; in order to qualify for maintenance grants they must have been resident in the UK for three years which is the same requirement that applies to the UK students; (b) UK <Col N="975" /> students attending third level institutions here may qualify for a higher education grant or a vocational education committee scholarship subject to a one year residential requirement.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 196 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently received the report of a study on the cost of parents of school text books.  The study was carried out by a firm of business consultants at my Department's request.  The consultants <Col N="976" /> examined all the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books.  In the course of the study, they conferred with all the educational partners and considered many proposals including suggestions such as those made by the national parents council.</P>
    <P>The study found that the average costs per pupil of school texts per complete course, if purchased new, are of the order of £148 for the three-year junior certificate course and £147 for the two-year leaving certificate course.</P>
    <P>The report contains a number of recommendations designed to reduce the cost of school text books to parents.  The main recommendation is that book rental schemes offer the most practical method of reducing the cost of school books to parents.  The report found that rental schemes have succeeded in reducing the cost of books from over £100 to as little as £15 per annum.  Copies of the report are being sent to all schools and to the partners in education.  I am confident that the contents of the report will be used to lessen the financial burden on parents. In particular, the report should give a stimulus to the establishment of rental schemes in schools which do not have them already.  The establishment of school libraries for text books is in effect the same as book loan-rental schemes.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the financial burden that purchase of school books places on low income parents.</P>
    <P>It is for the purposes of alleviating this burden that my Department operates the schoolbook grant scheme under which aid is provided to schools towards the purchase of school textbooks for needy pupils.  I am pleased that, in 1994, I am able to increase the allocation for the scheme for primary schools by 15 per cent over the 1993 provision and by 14 per cent in the case of post-primary schools.  The total allocation for both levels for 1994 is £5.1 million.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these increases are reasonable in present budgetary circumstances and I will continue to seek further improvements as resources permit.  I accept the report's finding that seed capital is a major problem in the <Col N="977" /> setting up of rental schemes particularly in schools in disadvantaged areas.  In this year's budget the allocation for the book grant for needy pupils in primary and post-primary schools is £5.1 million &mdash; an increase of more than 25 per cent over what was available two years ago.  I intend to use the increase in the book grant to help schools which have been classified as disadvantaged by my Department and which commit themselves to book rental schems to overcome the problems of seed capital.</P>
    <P>School authorities have also been advised that selected textbooks should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.  The syllabus planners, therefore, try to avoid over frequent changes and are conscious that they should avoid any unnecessary increase in costs.  However, textbooks must be changed on occasion if teachers are to keep their work educationally stimulating and if content and methodology are to be kept reasonably up-to-date.</P>
    <P>A number of other relevant issues which were adverted to in the report, such as the size and weight of school books, and the suggestion from the national parents council of supplements to textbooks instead of replacements will be considered in consultation with the relevant interests including textbook publishers.</P>

    <P>The scale and nature of the project as proposed necessitated detailed and complex preplanning by CHDDA in consultation with my Department and the level of fees paid is considered fair and reasonable and consistent with the extent of the preplanning work undertaken.</P>
    <P>The payments in respect of CHDDA fees on site acquisition, site management and site security also reflect the lengthy and complex negotiations involved in the acquisition of title to all the individual properties on the site.</P>

It set out a capital investment of £120 million for third level collegles, most of which will be expended over the period 1994-97.  Following detailed examination of UCD's proposals in consultation with the higher education authority, it was decided that UCD's European Regional Development Fund allocation should be targeted at the provision of Microcomputer Facilities.

      <P>While I appreciate the Deputy's concern that the results of the junior certificate examination should be issued as early as possible, an issue date in early August, as the Deputy has suggested, is not feasible at this time for practical reasons.</P>
      <P>The early issue of the results of the leaving certificate examinations is a first priority of the examinations branch of my Department and the resources of the branch are dedicated to this task.  For practical logistical reasons including availability of staff, the date of issue of the results of the junior certificate examination is linked to the date of issue of the leaving certificate results.  The processing of the results of the junior certificate examination begins as soon as the processing of the leaving certificate results has been completed.  This work takes four weeks so that, in recent years, the results of the junior certificate and of its forerunner, the intermediate certificate, have issued in mid-September, four weeks after the date of issue of the leaving certificate results.</P>

      <P>At present many schools teach a modern continental language, mainly French, both during and outside school hours even though this is not part of the official curriculum.</P>
      <P>There is considerable public interest in this topic, and it is being considered at present by the NCCA as part of the overall review of the primary curriculum.  One of the ideas being explored is, as part of the development of the European dimension in the primary curriculum, to include an introduction to a modern continental language as part of a language awareness programme.</P>
      <P>I am currently considering the establishment of a pilot project on this topic &mdash; the research and development phase of which might begin during the next school year.  However, I must point out that there is a problem of curricular priority for a very limited amount of available time.  Any proposal to introduce a modern continental language, including French, into the official primary curriculum would have to be considered in the light of the fact that we already teach two languages in every class in the primary school &mdash; unlike most of our European neighbours.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>I have decided that my Department should commission an independent study of the post-primary needs of the Knocklyon-Scholarstown areas from the service industries research centre at UCD.  It is intended to have the study completed within four months.</P>
      <P>I have taken this decision in view of the protracted history of this particular project, and of the major demographic implications of recent and proposed housing developments for Knocklyon and adjoining areas.</P>
      <P>In light of this decision the inclusion of Knocklyon school project in the post-primary building programme for 1994 does not at present arise.</P>

      <P>My Department has no record of receiving an application from Dundalk AFC within the past three years.  An earlier application fell to be considered under the amenity grants scheme and as such the question of providing a grant would have been one for the local authority.</P>
      <P>In response to recent representations to the Minister of State at my Department an application form under the recently advertised recreational facilities scheme was sent to the club.  The closing date for the receipt of completed applications is Friday, 4 March 1994 following which all applications will be considered.</P>

      <P>The Government has decided on the areas to be included in the local development programme and a list of these follows.</P>
      <P>The specific operational boundaries of each partnership area will be decided following local consultation.  A national coordinating team is being put in place to undertake the consultation.  This is the procedure which operated in the case of the twelve pilot partnership areas. However, I can confirm that the northside partnership will be extended to include the areas mentioned in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>The areas designated are as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  The twelve areas chosen as the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pilot areas will continue with an extension to boundaries in some areas: Ballymun; Coolock/Darndale, extended to include Kilbarrack; Dublin Inner City; Finglas, extended to include Cabra; Tallaght; Cork North City, extended to include other disadvantaged areas of Cork City; Dundalk; Kerry South-West, extended to include other disadvantaged areas of rural Kerry and Killarney; Limerick City; Mayo North; Waterford West, extended to include other disadvantaged areas of rural Waterford; Wexford South-West, extended to include other disadvantaged areas of rural Wexford, Enniscorthy and Gorey.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Eleven new urban areas have been designated: Clondalkin; Ballyfermot; Blanchardstown; Crumlin / Kimmage / Walkinstown; Bray; Galway; Drogheda; Waterford City; Wexford; Tralee; Pockets of disadvantaged areas in South County Dublin and Dun Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  Ten new rural areas have been designated: Mayo Central; Donegal; <Col N="991" /> Connemara; East Galway; Limerick West; Offaly North and Kildare North West rural; Longford and Westmeath rural; Monaghan; Cavan and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>The precise boundaries of the designated areas will be decided following local consultation.</P>
    <P>It is intended that all of the designated rural areas will be assisted to benefit from the new Leader programme, which is currently under discussion with the European Commission.  It is the Government's objective that the new Leader programme operate in all rural areas, that it should have a wider remit to include education, training, community and environmental development and capacity building at local level, and that the designated areas would operate as Leader areas.</P>

I am glad to report that the same delegate attended a meeting of the IWC last week to consider this proposal.  Some progress was made clarifying outstanding legal, ecological and geographical aspects of the proposal which will come up for decision at the next conference of the IWC in May where this country will jointly propose the sanctuary with France and other like-minded countries.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Southern Hemisphere proposal, the only other sanctuary established under the auspices of the IWC is the Indian Ocean Sanctuary.  The Government actively supports the proposal for an EU-wide sanctuary and other member states are being approached seeking their support for such a proposal.</P>
      <P>Apart from this country, which declared all its seas a whale and dolphin sanctuary in 1991, I am aware of whale sanctuaries in the Ligurian Sea and in the Caribbean (Silver Strands) and last year I supported a proposal for a sanctuary for whales and small cetaceans by Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the car in question was detained on 15 February 1994 on suspicion that there might have been a breach of the laws relating to vehicle registration tax (VRT).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The car was registered in January 1993 with the Commissioners.  The person who registered the car applied for and was granted relief from payment of VRT on the car as he claimed he was transferring his residence to the State.  A condition for the granting of this type of relief is that the car cannot be disposed of within 12 months of its registration without the <Col N="997" /> prior permission of the Commissioners. Consequently, the person was advised that this restriction was being placed on the car until 12 January, 1994.  A breach of this restriction immediately renders the vehicle liable for VRT.</P>
    <P>I understand the car was sold in June 1993 to the person concerned.  This is before the 12 month period of restriction had expired and was done without the permission of the Commissioners having been sought.  Accordingly, the car became liable to VRT which has never been paid.  This is an offence under the Finance Act, 1992, and renders the car liable to seizure and forfeiture.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their investigations into the case have not yet been completed. However, there is no suggestion at this stage that the person concerned acted in any way other than in good faith.  The Commissioners are viewing his involvement in the case sympathetically and will not be imposing any penalties on him arising out of the seizure.  It is expected that the car will be returned to the person concerned very shortly.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 80 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for payment of unemployment assistance a person must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.  S/he must also satisfy a means test.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to 12 October 1993 and he claimed disability benefit from 5 October 1993.  From 4 January 1993 the rate of benefit payable depends on the persons level of earnings in the governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has no earnings in the governing contribution year and payment has therefore been authorised at the weekly rate of £25 which is the maximum rate of disability benefit appropriate in this case.  He is also in receipt of a smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Comprehensive details of payment amounts are not currently available on a nationwide basis.  However, from some sampling of claims in receipt of payment at computerised offices in February of this year, it would appear that the numbers receiving less than £10 and between £10 and £20 in any week are relatively small.  The sample suggests that of the total number of people in receipt of an unemployment payment slightly more than one-half of 1 per cent of claimants were receiving less than £10 and just over 1 per cent were being paid between £10 and £20.  Just over 11 per cent of claimants in receipt of a payment were receiving between £20 and £50, 71 per cent were receiving between £50 and £100 and just under 16 per cent receiving over £100.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest.  Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health board in the light of the circumstances of the case and the payment is normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to the family circumstances, less £5.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of either unemployment benefit or assistance may qualify for a mortgage supplement, depending on their circumstances as may recipients of other social welfare or health board payments.</P>
      <P>An applicant is not required to have a mortgage for a minimum period before being considered for a mortgage supplement; however, a supplement would not normally be paid in cases where a mortgage was taken out at a time when the person was not in a financial position to meet the repayments.</P>
      <P>If the partner of an applicant for a supplement is in part-time employment, his or her income would be taken into account in the calculation of the supplement.</P>
      <P>The guidelines on the operation of rent and mortgage supplementation are under review at present in consultation with health boards and I intend that revised guidelines will be published in the near future.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in October 1993.  Under the scheme, unemployed people&mdash;who have been out of the work force for 12 months or longer and lone parents can continue to get 75 per cent of their weekly social welfare payments for one year and 50 per cent of their payments for a second year in addition to their secondary benefits, while exploring the potential of employment in indigenous industries or while setting up self-employment ventures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This optional scheme, which is targeted primarily at the long-term unemployed, <Col N="1002" /> provides them with a financial cushion while exploring options to return to the active labour force.  On the other hand, the F¡S enterprise allowance scheme is aimed primarily at unemployed people who have recently left the workforce and who may wish to return to take up self-employment.  Periods spent on F¡S courses, including any training components of the enterprise allowance scheme, can be counted towards satisfying the eligibility conditions for the back to work allowance.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, people who may have availed initially of the enterprise allowance scheme can then avail of the back to work allowance provided that they satisfy the necessary conditions.</P>
    <P>To date 1,110 new jobs have been approved as a direct result of the back to work allowance.  715 people, who formerly received either unemployment assistance or lone parents allowance, are in receipt of an allowance at an average weekly payment of £79.</P>

      <Quest>the allocation that has been made to the criminal injuries tribunal in 1994 for payments of awards, if, in view of the delay in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9, which was finalised in July 1993 after eight years of processing interest will be paid on the award made in this instance because of the delay; and if she will make a statement on the general operation of the tribunal and the delays at each stage.</Quest>

      <P>A sum of £1 million has been provided in the 1994 Estimates in respect of the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminal inflicted.  There is no provision in the scheme, under which the tribunal operates, for payment of interest on awards of compensation made under the scheme.  Awards are paid as quickly as possible within the limited Exchequer resources available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to delays, I am informed by the tribunal that, in the absence of any <Col N="1003" /> special circumstances giving rise to delay, applications being lodged with the tribunal at present are likely to be determined by a single member within 12 months of the date of lodgment.  In the event of an appeal by the applicant, the waiting period for an appeal hearing is 18 to 24 months approximately.  Awards of compensation currently being paid were accepted 16 to 19 months ago.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the tribunal that, while longer delays occurred in the case of some applications lodged in the past due to the large volume of applications made in the period 1980 to 1986, such delays are not of the order suggested by the Deputy except where factors outside the control of the tribunal are involved. Such factors are: failure or delay on the part of the applicants or their legal representatives to provide the tribunal with the necessary evidence to support the claims or to agree dates for hearing of appeals; the need for the tribunal to await the resolution of associated criminal and-or civil actions; the complexity of the injuries sustained giving rise to prolonged delays in the preparation and submission of final medical reports.</P>
    <P>As these cases are disposed of, pressure on the tribunal will ease and improvement can be expected in the time taken to deal with current cases.</P>

      <P>A wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of under-age drinking is included in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  The Act is designed to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years to purchase alcohol or to be in possession of it or to consume it other than in a private residence.  In particular, under section 35 of the Act, it is an offence for a licenceholder to allow any under-age person in a licensed premises when an exemption order is in force and it is also an offence for such a person to be so present.  The 1988 Act, furthermore, provides for stiff penalties for licence-holders convicted of supplying alcohol to under-age persons. In the case of a first offence, the maximum fine is £300 which increases to £500 for a second or subsequent offence. The mandatory licence endorsement provisions <Col N="1005" /> of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts also apply to such offences.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, I am informed that District Court records show that the numbers of special exemptions granted in the District Courts in 1992 and 1993 were as follows:</P>

I cannot say why an application for town commissioner status was not made in respect of Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid advances of his 1993 cattle headage grant on 27 November 1993 and his 1993 suckler cow premium on 29 November 1993.  His applications are being processed further at present and any balance of the headage grant due will be paid in the near future.</P>
      <P>Payment of the balance of the suckler cow premium cannot be made to a particular applicant until all applications received from him-her in the course of 1993 have been processed.  This is necessary to ensure compliance with EU regulations covering in particular the ceiling on eligible animals and stocking density. The processing of November 1993 applications means that in most cases payment of the final 40 per cent of premium will not start before late March.</P>

If such losses exceeded 10 per cent of the number of ewes claimed by applicants and written notification was not received within the ten days, then the penalty was the loss of premium on all ewes.

Small scale milk producers have, for example, priority access to any milk quota which becomes available under the restructuring and temporary leasing schemes and under the flexi-milk arrangements.  They have also been given priority in the allocation of the additional quota which I negotiated for Ireland at last year's EU farm price review.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan for the use of Structural Funds, it is proposed to provide assistance to dairy farmers to upgrade their on-farm facilities to bring them into line with EU standards. The provision of a subsidy towards milk quota restructuring is also being considered for funding in the same context. Under both measures, priority will be given to smaller producers.  The consultations with the EU Commission on the plan will not be completed for some time.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently reviewing the operation of the milk quota system and the views of the association referred to will be taken fully into account in that review.</P>

      <P>A total of 10,622 applications for reserve quota were received from flockowners.  The total quota available for distribution from the reserve amounted to approximately 200,000 premium rights.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions provided that quota would be allocated to the following categories of producers in descending order of priority.</P>
      <P>Category 1</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Flockowners whose application for the ewe premium in 1991, due to exceptional circumstances, did not correspond to the true situation on their holdings in previous years; (b)  flockowners who have regularly submitted an application for the ewe premium, including in 1992, but who have not done so in 1991; (c) flockowners who were paid the ewe premium in 1991 but did not apply in 1992 due to exceptional circumstances; and (d) flockowners who submitted an application for the ewe premium for the first time in 1992 or subsequent years and who meet the following conditions: are under 35 years of age; their total household income is less than £14,822 per annum; at least 50 per cent of their total income is derived from farming and have the following qualifications; (i) if born after 1 January 1968, must have (a) obtained the Teagasc certificate in farming or a higher qualification or (b) have three years practical experience in farming and have satisfactorily completed a course of training in farming of a minimum duration of 150 hours, or (ii) if born before 1 January 1968, meet the requirements <Col N="1040" /> outlined in (i) or have five years practical experience in farming.</P>
    <P>Category 2</P>
    <P>Flockowners who can demonstrate that the operation of the quota limits will jeopardise the viability of their holdings and who have embarked on (i) a farm improvement plan involving sheep production drawn up by 1 January 1993 or (ii) a finance restructuring plan related to sheep production drawn up in conjunction with Teagasc by 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>Category 3</P>
    <P>Flockowners who have acquired land formerly used for sheep production by other producers.</P>
    <P>In addition, the application form provided for another category, category 4, to enable flockowners who applied for the ewe premium for the first time in 1992 to apply for premium rights which would have been allocated to flockowners who applied for the premium in 1991 but who, having ceased sheep farming, did not apply for the ewe premium in 1992 and whose holding was not taken over by another producer.</P>
    <P>Work on processing the applications began in December 1993 and is continuing. To date 123,060 premium rights have been allocated to 3,023 successful applicants.  Over 2,500 applicants had to be written to seeking further information which they failed to supply with the original application and this has led to long delays in finalising quota allocation.  In addition, quite a number of obviously incorrect applications were received.  For example 2,836 producers applied for an allocation under category 1 (a) when clearly they had more sheep in 1991 than in previous years.</P>
    <P>The number of unsuccessful applicants to date is 5,508.  Work on processing the remaining 2,091 cases which are the subject of queries is continuing as replies to the queries are received.</P>

      <P>For all headage schemes there is a limit on the total amount which can be paid per acre.  Based on the acreage which the person concerned declared on his sheep headage application his entitlement under the sheep headage was curtailed to £190.80.  He did however declare a bigger acreage on his 1993 area aid application which if correct, will qualify him for a balancing payment under the 1993 sheep headage scheme.  I have arranged to have the discrepancy in the acreages investigated and any payment due will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I recently announced a £4.8 million investment programme to further develop and upgrade computer facilities and provide other resources in my Department in 1994 to achieve timely payment of headage and premia in future.  This investment which is part of an on-going investment programme aimed at improving the operation of these schemes will allow for the development in 1994, of a computerised inquiry facility and of a system of on-line inputting of payments.  It will also allow for the recruitment in 1994 of up to 110 extra staff to be deployed on headage and premium payment schemes in the local and headquarters offices of my Department.</P>
      <P>I have also undertaken to seek changes in EU rules to facilitate earlier payments and to put in place arrangements for consultations with farm organisations etc. with a view to simplifying application forms and other administrative procedures relating to the premium and headage schemes.</P>

      <P>Since intervention weight limits were first proposed by the EU Commission I have continually stated my strong objection to the measure in the Council of Ministers and in bilateral meetings with the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development.  The Government decided to challenge the measure in the European Court of Justice and a case was lodged accordingly with the court on 4 June, 1993.  The Government also applied to the Court on 13 June for interim measures whereby the implementation of the weight limit of 380 kg as of July, 1993 would be suspended but the court did not grant the suspension.  However, the court decision does not prejudice the outcome of Ireland's substantive case against the Commission Regulation.</P>
      <P>The third reduction in the intervention weight limit is due to take effect on 18 July 1994.  While intervention has been of much less importance as a market support in recent months because of better and more consistent marketing by the beef industry, reduced beef production in the European Union, the re-opening of certain third country markets which had been closed to Irish beef and increased live exports, I will continue to oppose weight limits.</P>

      <P>Under section 3 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, the conveyance (which includes a mortgage) of an interest in a family home by a spouse will not, in general, be valid unless the prior consent in writing of the other spouse has first been obtained.  In many cases it may be desirable for couples to seek legal advice in circumstances where they decide to mortgage the family home for the purpose of securing a loan.  I have no proposals to amend the law so as to impose an obligation on all couples to receive legal advice in such circumstances. However, the law in this area is under review in my Department <Col N="1052" /> and decisions on any proposals I may bring forward will be announced in the normal way.</P>

      <P>The provision and management of services at Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar, County Mayo, in the first instance are a matter for the Western Health Board. <Col N="1053" /> This responsibility necessarily involves the identification by the board of staffing and service needs at the hospital within the context of the overall resources available to it.</P>

This review is undertaken having regard to service and personnel criteria in the context of the priority afforded to each post by the agency concerned, with particular regard to the availability of financial resources.</P>
      <P>An essential part of this process is the requirement that agencies prioritise their manpower proposals.  Accordingly, the Western Health Board were requested by my Department towards the end of last year to make a formal submission prioritising its current consultant manpower proposals for its acute hospitals, for consideration in the context of the financial resources available to the board in 1994 and having regard to personnel and service criteria.  The board has recently sent to my Department a formal prioritised submission detailing 22 additional consultant posts for its acute hospitals, which include proposals for the appointment of additional orthopaedic consultant staff.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware Comhairle na nOspidÈal has statutory responsibility for approving all consultant appointments. Comhairle has furnished the data requested by the Deputy which is set out in the attached tabular statement.  Before a new or replacement permanent consultant post is considered by Comhairle na nOspidÈal an agency must receive a financial clearance for the post from my Department.  The identification of staffing needs, including consultant manpower proposals, are a matter for each individual agency in the first instance. My Department's examination of such proposals is undertaken having regard to service and personnel criteria in the context of the priority afforded to each post by the agency concerned with particular regard to the availability of financial resources.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with the statutory role that Comhairle na nOspidÈal has in approving consultant appointments in determining what appointments it will approve in advance.  The exact number and discipline of consultant posts to be approved in the current year, therefore, will probably not be known until Comhairle holds its last meeting of the year.</P>
      <P>Comhairle has indicated that of the 344 consultant posts detailed in the attached tabular statement, 113 are additional consultant posts.  This indicates the support of my Department for the development of consultant services within available financial resources over this period.  I am committed to ensuring that consultant services are further enhanced in 1994 and in future years within the financial resources available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the issue raised in the Deputy's question, in the first instance, is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, alcohol misuse is always a cause for concern for me.  It is particularly worrying when young people are involved.  To combat problems in this area my Department, through its Health Promotion Unit, gives a high priority to educating young people about alcohol.  The unit has in place a number of initiatives designed to educate in the area of alcohol misuse among young people which I have set out below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the most effective approach to the issue of alcohol use and misuse generally, and by young people in particular, is in implementing a comprehensive national alcohol policy.  Such a policy must address economic, social, cultural, legislative and educational factors relevant to alcohol use and misuse.  In pursuance of this, the Deputy will be aware that the Government requested the Advisory Council on <Col N="1056" /> Health Promotion to develop such a comprehensive policy.  Following an intensive consultation process with relevant groups, including youth organisations, this policy has now reached final draft stage.  I expect to receive the report on this policy soon.  As it will deal with issues relevant to other Government Departments I will need to discuss it with my Government colleagues.  But my intention is to publish it as soon as that consultative process has been completed.</P>
    <P>The initiatives undertaken by my Department's Health Promotion Unit include: The Drink Awareness for Youth (DAY) programme.  This is a combined initiative between the Health Promotion Unit and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  It is a preventative programme which aims to inform and educate young people about the responsible use of alcohol and the dangers involved in its misuse.  The programme has been used by youth leaders, teachers, probation officers, juvenile liaison officers, Garda recruits, F¡S and members of the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  To date, over 1,000 people have attended training seminars which equip people with the skills necessary to use this resource.</P>
    <P>The substance abuse prevention programme. This programme, for second-level schools, is a joint initiative between <Col N="1057" /> the Health Promotion Unit of my Department and the psychological service of the Department of Education with support from the Mater Dei Counselling Centre and the European Commission. It enables students to develop their ability to take charge of their own health and to make informed decisions about the use of all drugs, including alcohol in their lives.  Teachers are currently being trained to use this programme.</P>
    <P>The education of parents is increasingly being highlighted as a means of influencing young people in handling alcohol issues.  In conjunction with the Southern Health Board, the Health Promotion Unit has developed a pilot project on parent education on alcohol, drugs and family communication.  This project recognises that young people and their parents must be provided with assistance to help them deal with the problems posed by both licit and illicit drugs.  To this end, the programme focuses, not only on alcohol and other drugs, but also on the skills and personal attributes that help people deal with drug situations.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit also provides information on alcohol, in the form of a series of three booklets relating to young people and alcohol.  These booklets are directed at young people themselves, their parents or guardians, and youth leaders.  They have been widely disseminated and are available free of charge from the unit.</P>

    <P>Source: Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE).</P>
    <P>The provisional figures show that six women aged between 25 and 34 years died from breast cancer in 1992.</P>
    <P>As the causes of breast cancer remain to be clearly established, emphasis is placed on early detection at the preinvasive stage, through mammography, and consequent early treatment.</P>
    <P>Mammography in Ireland is used largely as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or worried women.  Diagnostic mammography services are now provided at 17 hospitals throughout the country and expertise has been growing in all aspects of the early detection of breast cancer and its treatment.  Mammography is available to all women on referral from their general practitioners or through the local breast clinic.</P>
    <P>Mammography screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis to detect those women with unrecognised breast cancer.  There has been considerable debate and discussion regarding the effectiveness of mammography screening in reducing mortality from breast cancer.  However, there is general agreement that mammography screening programmes are not effective in reducing mortality in younger women.  For this reason mammography screening programmes tend to be <Col N="1060" /> directed at women aged 50 years and over.</P>
    <P>Studies have been carried out abroad which suggest that well organised screening programmes can reduce deaths from breast cancer in women aged 50 years and over by 25-30 per cent among the screened population.  As indicated earlier, however, medical opinion is divided on the value of mammography as a mass population screening tool and some doctors consider it to be ineffective.  As I have said on previous occasions, it is essential to establish whether positive results can be achieved in Ireland and also to determine how they might be achieved.</P>
    <P>My Department is supporting a major mammographic breast screening programme currently under way at the Mater Foundation.  This programme &mdash; the Eccles Breast Screening Programme &mdash; is part of a network of pilot schemes on breast cancer screening being carried out within the European Union.  The Eccles Breast Screening Programme is being carried out in a defined catchment area, North Dublin and Cavan-Monaghan.  All women in the catchment area aged between 50-64 years are eligible to attend for screening.  The age group to be screened complies with EU criteria.</P>
    <P>The programme is the first study of its kind undertaken in this country. Decisions on the national policy to be followed in this matter will be influenced by the results of the pilot study.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the fact that student nurses commencing training in 1993 in mental handicap will be granted an extra 12 weeks theoretical input to give them parity with students in general nursing arising from EC Directive 89/595, if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, on registration in 1995, this will leave students in mental handicap in 1992 isolated, that they will find it impossible to obtain post-basic courses which in turn will restrict their professional development and limit their job opportunities; and, in view of this, if he will consider the granting to such students those 12 weeks theoretical input; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The training programme for student mental handicap nurses who commenced training prior to October 1993, conforms with all relevant national and EU requirements. There is no factual basis to the assertion that these students will be disadvantaged in seeking access to post-basic training by reason of the level of theoretical instruction in their basic training programme.  It is not my intention to <Col N="1068" /> amend the training programme for these students.  The option of doing so has been examined but, because of the resource and logistical problems involved for the nurse training schools, it was not considered viable.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.</P>
      <P>I would be anxious to ensure that the first language of the State is promoted in second-level schools and colleges.  I would not agree, however, that this can be done by simply awarding more A grades in Leaving Certificate Irish.</P>
      <P>In my recent replies to other questions from the Deputy I stated that grades are not allocated arbitrarily.  They reflect the performance of candidates in an examination which is specifically tailored to the objectives and content of the course in the subject concerned.</P>
      <P>It would be unrealistic to seek a close correlation in the distribution of grades between different Leaving Certificate subjects because different levels of student motivation, different objectives, different course content, different emphases and different participation rates inevitably produce different patterns of grade distributions between subjects.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the tendency in Irish to emphasise the productive skills of speaking and writing whereas modern continental languages set more store by the more accessible receptive skills of listening and reading.  I have also referred to the fact that the introduction of a listening test in Leaving Certificate Irish in 1993 has already led to an improvement in the performance of candidates.</P>
      <P>As the skill of listening comprehension in Irish is developed in the schools it can be expected that there will be a corresponding improvement in students' examination results in the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is at present reviewing and updating the Leaving Certificate syllabus in Irish.  As part of this process it will make recommendations in regard to the revision of the Leaving Certificate examination in Irish.  The members of the council's course committee for Irish are <Col N="1074" /> fully aware of the need to make the learning of Irish a satisfying experience.  They are also aware that the possibility of high achievement in the Leaving Certificate examination can contribute to the promotion of the language.</P>

      <P>The Transition Year allows students to spend an extra year in second-level education and gives them a year's break from the pressures of examination preparation.  It gives them an opportunity to gain experience of the world beyond the walls of the classroom, thus broadening and enhancing their general education. It prepares them for a smooth transition to the world of work or to the next stage of their education.  They develop a spirit of initiative and selfreliance and, as they grow in social and environmental awareness, they learn to become responsible and caring citizens.</P>
      <P>The success and good practice evident in many of the schools currently providing Transition Year programmes, and in particular the potential of such programmes as a key element of the three year senior cycle, were paramount in the decision to make the Transition Year available to all schools in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provided for a six-year cycle of post-primary education and this enabled my Department to give all schools the option of introducing a Transition Year Programme with effect from September, 1994.  583 schools have advised the Department that they intend to offer the Transition Year Programme <Col N="1078" /> from 1994.

      <P>The Programme for a Partnership Government, which was published in January of last year, makes a commitment to: &ldquo;broadening the curriculum to foster creativity, critical faculties, political and social awareness, and analytical and problem-solving skills&rdquo;.  Arts education is a very key element in this broadening of the curriculum.</P>
      <P>I have made continued commitments to the important place of the arts in the education system since I took office.  I again take this opportunity to affirm the centrality of the arts within educational policy and provision, and particularly in the period of compulsory schooling.  I regard artistic and aesthetic education as key elements within the school experience of young people.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education liaises closely in this matter with the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. The Report of the National Education Convention endorsed the place of the arts in education and recommended the establishment of a co-operative initiative by the Department of Education, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Arts Council and representatives of arts teachers associations to consider the place of the arts in Irish education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to give the fullest consideration to the report on the National Education Convention in the formulation of policy proposals for the White Paper. This is the unequivocal commitment <Col N="1079" /> which I have given and I am happy to repeat now.</P>
    <P>In the case of primary schools, pupils in all classes are currently exposed to a broad programme in the Visual Arts and Music.  As part of the general review of the primary curriculum, the programmes of work in Arts Education, which encompasses the Visual Arts and Music, are being examined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  These revised programmes will be introduced to schools in the near future.</P>
    <P>At second level, a new syllabus for Art, Craft and Design was introduced for the Junior Certificate Examination in 1989 and it was examined for the first time in June 1992.  The new Junior Certificate Music syllabus was introduced in 1991 and it will be examined for the first time in June this year.  In the context of the extensive review of the senior cycle currently being undertaken by the NCCA, new syllabi for both Music and Art will be introduced in schools in 1996 and examined for the first time in 1998.</P>

      <P>The report of the Special Education Review Committee represents the most comprehensive examination of the special needs area ever undertaken in the State.</P>
      <P>I view this report as a most welcome and important document which provides a framework for the future development of special education services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my first actions, following publication of the report, was to convene a special seminar at which the report was discussed in great detail by a wide range of interests who had made submissions to the committee.  I was very impressed by the quality of the contributions made at the seminar and by the generally positive response to the committee's report. It is my intention that the views expressed <Col N="1082" /> on that occasion will be taken on board in the process of implementing the report which is now underway in my Department.</P>
    <P>Some of the committee's recommendations have considerable resource implications and will take some time to implement.  In other cases there is scope for more immediate action.  Indeed, in my recent announcement on the 1994 education budget, I outlined a number of measures which will make a significant contribution towards achieving the objectives set out by the special committee. In this connection, I would draw particular attention to the following initiatives which are being taken in the current year:</P>
    <P>* 100 extra remedial teachers will be appointed.</P>
    <P>* Ten extra psychologists will be appointed to the school psychological service.</P>
    <P>* 50 extra Child Care Assistants will be appointed.</P>
    <P>* 80 extra teaching posts are being allocated to the special education area.</P>
    <P>* 50 additional schools will be included in the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme for capitation grant purposes.</P>
    <P>* 40 extra teaching posts are being allocated to schools which have pupils with a disability in special classes.</P>
    <P>* 15 additional Home/School/Liaison Co-ordinators are being appointed.</P>
    <P>* £12 million is being allocated to substantially increase capitation grant levels for children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>* £100,000 is being allocated to provide for escorts for children with disabilities travelling to and from school on special transport services.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures will contribute to a significant overall improvement in the level of service available to children with special needs and represent a very positive initial response to the committee's report.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering the report in detail with a view <Col N="1083" /> to drawing up a comprehensive programme of phased implementation.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House of my commitment to addressing the needs of all children who are at a disadvantage educationally and I consider that the actions which I have already taken are confirmation of my commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming White Paper for Education and the Education Act which will follow, will provide the basic framework for the future of our education service. The report of the review committee will provide a vital input into this process.</P>

      <P>Since the introduction of the junior certificate in 1989, there has been an on-going programme of in-career development for teachers with further courses being organised on a regional basis for 7 and 8 March 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of transition year, I have arranged for an in-career development programme to be delivered at regional level by a team of experienced teachers who have been trained specifically for the task.  The programme involves briefing <Col N="1087" /> the whole staff of schools offering transition year and includes two days of in-career development at local level for groups of 4/5 teachers from each school.</P>
    <P>With regard to changes in the senior cycle including the restructured leaving certificate vocational programme, the new leaving certificate applied programme and revised syllabuses, I propose to put in place a comprehensive training programme of in-career development for the teachers involved.</P>

      <P>My Department is in the process of having the necessary practical arrangements made, so that catchment boundary transport may be provided for the pupils who were the subject of previous parliamentary questions.  It will not be possible to introduce this before the start of the next school term.</P>
      <P>The arrangements will be subject to review, following completion of the Department's assessment of the application for a new second-level school in Kilcoole, and of the medium-term demands for accommodation in the Bray/Greystones and Wicklow catchment areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of revision of the catchment <Col N="1088" /> boundaries to include Kilcoole, Kilpeddar and Kilquade will be included in the review of the post-primary requirements of the general Bray, Greystones and Wicklow areas, which is currently being carried out in the planning section of my Department.  Pending completion of this review, Kilcoole, Kilpeddar and Kilquade will continue to be in the Bray/Greystones catchment area, and the catchment boundary pick-up point will remain the same &mdash; at Newtownmountkennedy.</P>
    <P>Eleven pupils from these localities belong to the Bray/Greystones catchment area and are entitled to transport to all post-primary schools in that area &mdash; not just the school of their choice.  The purpose of having a catchment area is to ensure the continuing viability of all schools in an orderly fashion, to provide a good education for children, and so to protect employment.</P>
