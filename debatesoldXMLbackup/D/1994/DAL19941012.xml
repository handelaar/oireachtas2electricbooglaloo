      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the briefing given to the <i>Cork Examiner</i> is correct, that the Minister for Justice did not tell the full truth here yesterday, that she misled the House because the President of the High Court will not be affected by the new proposals the people are being fooled by the Government because it does not propose to change anything that will affect appointments to the presidency of the High Court.  That was <Col N="1464" /> the issue.  The Taoiseach owes it to us to clear this matter up.</P>

      <P>In view of the replies we received from the Minister for Justice yesterday with regard to the Court Officers Bill and the conflicting versions of what is expected to be in this Bill emanating from the two partners in Government, could the Taoiseach tell us which of the conflicting versions is the correct one?  Will the presidency of the High Court be covered by the incoming Bill?  Will any senior judicial appointment be covered by it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister for Justice in this House.  I have seen no signs of conflict.  I would refer the Deputy to the Government statement and recommend that he study it.  He will be well able to understand it and should not anticipate what will be in the legislation until it is published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach seriously think that it is in the interests of the cohesion of this Government, for what that is worth, that another weekend be spent speculating about whether or not a High Court appointment will be covered by this Bill?  Does the Government seriously think that it is in the interests of the country or the normal conduct of Cabinet business that <Col N="1465" /> that should remain uncertain any longer?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My heart is deeply touched by the concern of Deputy Bruton for the stability of this Government. Please settle down and stop jumping up and down.  There will not be an election until 1997.  The Deputy does not have to worry about the cohesion of this Government; it has been working well, is working well and will continue to work well to 1997.</P>

      <P>I did not mean any disrespect, Sir.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that he would be publishing a new legislative schedule next week.  Will it contain legislation on Cabinet confidentiality, having regard to the manner in which the Taoiseach inspired leaks to describe how the Labour Party voted on the tax amnesty at the Cabinet and how they conducted the discussions on the tax amnesty in order to do down his Labour colleagues?</P>

Since the Taoiseach has told us the Government is stable, has it the intention of fulfilling that commitment which was one of the important inputs to the programme from the Labour Party, or does the Government intend to sell off those institutions individually?</P>

Will the Taoiseach clarify if it is the case that it is not the Minister for Health who will be introducing this Bill and that it will be included in the Freedom <Col N="1469" /> of Information Bill?

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my commitment to the philosophy of gender equity.  Even though I was critical of the Minister in a number of areas last night, particularly in the area of third level education, I commend her on her diligence in pursuing the notion of gender equity.  Unfortunately, the concept of gender equity seems to have become unfashionable.  A matter as critical as this should not be seen as a fad but as a human right and that is why I am vehement in my support of gender equity in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am critical of the Minister because she has been tinkering with education instead of dealing with the substantive issues.  We should be debating the White Paper on Education.  The Minister recently spoke on a radio programme on which she came across as very reasonable.  She said that the White <Col N="1471" /> Paper would be published in November, to which the broadcaster retorted: &ldquo;you did not say which November&rdquo;.  Unfortunately that view is shared by many people.  There is tardiness in respect of the White Paper on Education and that is most unfortunate.  The Minister spent too much time on issues relating to structures and battles with bishops rather than dealing with the real issues of education.  We should focus on education as it applies to the future of our young people.  I realise that structures form part of that debate but they are not the substantive issue.</P>
    <P>I specified last night that elements in the Bill need to be clarified and that we would put down amendments on Committee Stage.  My party supports the Bill, particularly the notion of gender equity.  I look forward to discussing other issues with the Minister, such as the area of curriculum, third level education and the grants system.  We should also focus on primary education which lacks funding.  Parents in particular are involved in fund raising to support schools.  They willingly participate in school life, but it is wrong that education should be funded by cake and bring-and-buy sales.  Schools should be funded and children should have the opportunities they deserve.  I commend the Minister on introducing these Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>My party supports the principle of gender quotas and the recommendations by the Second Commission on the Status of Women on gender quotas on State boards and bodies. When these Bills were before the House in 1992 I supported the principle of gender quotas and argued very strongly that they be specified in the legislation rather than giving a vague, generalised commitment, which subsequently caused the difficulties referred to by the Minister that gave rise to the present legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will support the general thrust of the Bill in so far as it seeks to establish that there will be a minimum of 40 per cent <Col N="1472" /> of either gender on the governing bodies of regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I am very surprised that, given the Minister's stated commitment to the principle of gender representation and the Government's stated commitment to the principle of enabling women to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country, the Bill is confined solely to regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Discrimination against women is widespread and a major problem in the education system.  With the decline in the number of convent schools and the number of sisters who held principalships and senior positions in convent schools, with the advent of lay principalships and appointments, representation of women at a senior level in the education system has declined.</P>
    <P>At third level &mdash; throughout the education system &mdash; there is an appalling under-representation of women both in the governing bodies of universities and at senior staff level.  The latest figures I have for universities &mdash; I concede these may vary &mdash; indicate that in UCD only three of the 34 members of the governing body are women; in UCC three of the 27 members are women; in UCG two of the 26 members are women; in Trinity College three of the 14 members are women and in the University of Limerick three of the 16 members are women.  In each third level institution the president or chairperson of the board and the chief executive or principal, with one exception, is male. In each vocational education committee the chief executive officer is a man.</P>
    <P>The Conference of Religious of Ireland in a recent report document the extent to which women are under-represented in the education system.  At primary level, for example, while women account for 76 per cent of the total number of teachers they account for only 48 per cent of principalships.  At second level the figures are worse; while women account for approximately 50 per cent of the total number of teachers <Col N="1473" /> they account for only 11 per cent of principalships in community schools and 4 per cent in the vocational education committees.  At third level women account for only 2 per cent of university professors and 14 per cent approximately of the total number of teaching staff.  In the Department of Education fewer than one-fifth of the number of senior positions are held by women.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation where two people are elected or appointed, for example, by the academic staff or students to the governing body, one must be a man and one a woman.  In general I agree with this.  When the Minister assumed office she appointed a senior adviser and a programme manager, both of whom were men.  The principle of gender balance encompasses far more in the education system than the appointment of members to the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Given that its stated intention is to address gender imbalance in the education system this Bill does not go far enough.  If the Minister was serious about tackling the appalling inequalities and discrimination against women in the education system she should have introduced legislation which dealt with this in its totality covering the question of the appointment of principals in schools and the appointment of members to the governing bodies of institutions other than the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I am told repeatedly that when women present themselves for interview for the post of principal or vice principal they are asked questions about their family commitments and very often about their personal lives. This would not happen in the case of a male applicant.  In the education system, therefore, there is strong discrimination against women and this should be addressed.  In a field of activity in which women have taken an active interest during the years and are highly represented, <Col N="1474" /> the teaching profession, the question of the number of women in senior positions &mdash; this also applies to the teacher unions &mdash; will have to be addressed.  In this regard the Bill does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>The Bill, however, goes too far in giving the Minister increased powers over the vocational education committees, the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  While its stated intention is to tackle discrimination against women the real purpose of this Bill is to dig the Minister out of the hole in which she finds herself because of conflict with the vocational education committees.  Section 2 (2) places two requirements on vocational education committees.  Paragraph (a) places a requirement on a vocational education committee to ensure that in making its recommendation not fewer than seven recommended for appointment to the governing body are women and not fewer than seven are men.  Paragraph (b) states that a vocational education committee shall make such recommendations subject to such directives as may be issued by the Minister from time to time.  On Committee Stage I will explore this matter in greater detail.</P>
    <P>We have to be mindful of the history of the legislation relating to the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I recall that when the legislation was first introduced to establish the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology as autonomous institutions with their own governing bodies there was a massive row between the then Minister for Education and the vocational education committees on the question of whether the vocational education committees would have any role in the appointment of the members of the governing bodies.  The legislation, as originally drafted, provided for the Minister to appoint the members of the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  In discussions between the members of the IVEA who held Fianna Fáil party cards and the then Minister <Col N="1475" /> a compromise was cobbled together to allow the vocational education committees to make recommendations in the appointment of members of the governing bodies.  Section 2 (2) (b) of this Bill will bring us back to the original position; in other words, the Minister will appoint the members of the governing bodies.  The Minister will have free rein to issue whatever directives she wants to the vocational education committees about the recommendations they will make.</P>
    <P>The question of student representation is addressed in the Bill.  The Minister addresses the duality of student elections as provided for in the original regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology legislation. The original legislation provided for student union elections at one stage of the year and another set of elections to elect two members to the governing body.  As often happens the same people need not be elected giving rise to problems of accountability.  I attempted to address this problem by way of amendment and I pointed out that students could elect to the students union John X and Mary Y as president and vice-president respectively and then the governing body would make arrangements for the election of two student members of the governing body and two entirely different people might be elected giving rise to a conflict.  That problem has been recognised but the solution proposed in the Bill is the most bizarre I have seen in a long time &mdash; it is certainly the first time that an electoral problem has been solved by abolishing the election, and this is what the legislation is providing for.</P>
    <P>These Bills provide that two students, one of whom will be a man and the other a woman, shall be chosen in accordance with regulations made by the governing body.  That does not provide for an election but provides that any governing body &mdash; I note the Minister is shaking her head &mdash; can make regulations resulting in the selection of students on any basis.  I know that the <Col N="1476" /> level of conflict between students unions and governing bodies is not very great but a governing body might find itself in conflict with the student union and the regulations it might devise might reflect that conflict.</P>
    <P>I read a report in this morning's newspaper that the difficulties with the students union presidency in University College Galway have been resolved but for quite some time there was a problem as to whether the first person elected or the second person elected was the legitimate president of the students union. The president of the students union in Letterkenny Regional College found himself in conflict with the chairman of the governing body.  The situation became so out of control that the Minister was required to investigate it but the problem has not yet been resolved. I understand that the person who conducted the inquiry into the matter has reported to the Minister and I would like to know the outcome.</P>
    <P>There is no governing body in that college but, apparently, the chairman of the original governing body, a party to the original problem, is still functioning as a sole member of the governing body. This situation has arisen because of a conflict between the students union representatives and the governing body.  It is not inconceivable that problems could arise between a students union and a governing body which could give rise to regulations being introduced for the selection of student representatives which might not necessarily reflect the democratic wishes or the students autonomous right to have their own representatives.  Why can provision not be made for the students union to nominate one male and one female representatives to the governing body?  I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with this.</P>
    <P>I received correspondence on the issue of staff representation.  Staff are concerned that the provision the Minister is making for the staff to elect one man and one woman is denying them their autonomous right to elect whomever they wish.  No doubt we will go into <Col N="1477" /> this later.  A letter I received from a teacher in one of the colleges states:</P>
    <P>In issuing the election notice for the current governing body, the governing body stated it was acting on the direction of the Minister in limiting the choice of the electorate.  This matter is being challenged in court.  A full hearing of the case is due later this month.  In introducing her Bill the Minister is attempting to pre-empt any decision of the court.</P>
    <P>This raises an issue which the Chair may wish to address.  I have always been concerned at the way the Chair interprets the <i>sub judice</i> rule and if I were to attempt to raise questions on matters which are before the court I think the Chair would rule me out of order.  If this correspondent is correct then an issue arises as to whether the Minister, in introducing this legislation, is seeking to circumvent a decision of the courts on matters which are currently before them.  In particular, I draw the Chair's attention to section 5 which deals with governing bodies.  Under subsection (4) of that section the Minister proposes to give retrospective effect to the appointment of the governing bodies.  It states:</P>
    <P>This section shall be deemed to have come into effect on the 1st day of January, 1994.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the views of the Chair as to whether the Minister is in order in putting before the House legislation which it has been claimed is seeking to circumvent matters which are before the court.  It would appear that the Minister is seeking to give retrospective effect to matters which have yet to be decided by the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bills have to be put in context. This is the first education legislation which the Minister has brought before the House.  I am always glad to see education legislation before the House but I am somewhat surprised that these are the first Bills the Minister has introduced.  We have been waiting for quite some time for the substantive education Bill which has been promised time and <Col N="1478" /> again not only by this Minister but by her two predecessors.  The Green Paper on Education was published early in 1992 and we were told that the educational interests would be consulted within six months with the White Paper being published early in 1993.  I accept there was a general election, with the appointment of a new Government and a new Minister and, understandably, a period had to be allowed for the new regime to put its stamp on what was taking place.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased at the Minister's initiative in establishing the Education Convention in Dublin Castle with very wide ranging consultation with educational interests on the future of education.  I am at a loss to understand what has been happening for the past 12 months because it is over 12 months since the Education Convention met.  At that time it appeared there was a converging of views in the education field as to the future of Irish education.  I attended several seminars organised by various interest groups where the various educational interests appeared to be moving towards a position where it was possible to work out a new partnership relationship between the various interests in education, the owners and patrons of schools, teachers, parents, the Department of Education and the Government, representing the taxpayers.  It is regrettable that initiative seems to have been lost and in the past 12 months the White Paper has not been published &mdash; apparently it is to be published some time towards the end of the year.  We seem to have moved further away from agreement on education than was possible 12 months ago. It seems also that the Minister has approached some of the more sensitive issues in a confrontational way which has not lent itself to reaching agreement with the education interests and the boat has been missed.</P>
    <P>Approximately 12 months ago, at the time of the education convention, the Minister missed an historic opportunity to reach agreement with the various interests in education.  That is very <Col N="1479" /> regrettable because we are now locked into a sterile conflict about control and ownership of education when the vast majority of people, including those who work in and consume the education service, are more concerned about the questions of cost and quality.</P>
    <P>We have had what can only be described as a number of very exceptional decisions by the Minister for Education.  There was an announcement on the abolition of university fees for which apparently there was no Government approval and which the Minister has not yet clarified.  An expert group on student grants was appointed.  Half the outcome of their deliberations was announced and last November the Minister promised she would publish the report of the de Buitléar group, but it has not been published.  It was leaked in the public press from which it appears the de Buitléar group has made certain recommendations on equalling the opportunities of children of PAYE workers to the opportunities of farmers and self employed people.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying to the debate I invite her to state when she intends to publish the report and what she intends to do about its recommendations.</P>
    <P>On curriculum reform, for example, a considerable amount of work has been done by the NCCA.  The curriculum committees recommended changes in curricula for the leaving certificate and within the past month the Minister announced that despite the work done by the curriculum committees and the fact that they were under orders to produce early reports, she has decided to postpone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know about the muzzling, but certainly she has postponed the implementation of curriculum reform and has now appointed <Col N="1480" /> another committee to re-do what the curriculum committees were doing in the first place.</P>
      <P>I am very surprised that in legislation dealing with regional technical colleges there is no reference to the establishment of new regional technical colleges. Last year, Castlebar regional technical college was an issue in the Mayo by-election.  It seems to have obtained some type of an outhouse arrangement from the Galway regional technical college.</P>

      <P>I see no reference to the promised Dún Laoghaire Regional Technical College which surprise me greatly, because I thought the Minister would have been committed to the establishment of that regional technical college.  When the original regional technical college and Dublin Institute of Technology Bills were going through this House, I argued strongly that built into the legislation should be a commitment to establish the Dún Laoghaire regional technical college, because the number of regional technical colleges is defined in the original legislation.  In amending the regional technical colleges Bill, it would have been appropriate for the Minister to amend the legislation in such a way that the number of regional technical colleges would be increased and, specifically, that the regional technical college long promised for Dún Laoghaire, for which there is a site and for which the Minister occasionally makes a statement to the effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill is a further step on the road to enshrining gender quota and as such it is welcome.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that we should examine the governing bodies of the universities also with a view to ensuring that proper gender balance is introduced to those august bodies.  We all agree that there has been major improvement, particularly in the role of women, in the education sector.  The role of women in the teaching profession and the number of women participating in various courses in third level colleges has increased significantly. That there will now be a gender quota as part and parcel of management structures within colleges will ensure there is an appropriate thoughtfulness in the attitude of governing bodies towards their students and staff.</P>
      <P>On the development of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology, I welcome the use of Structural Funds.  The majority of the regional technical colleges have existed for some 20 years and the additional funding has enabled them to move with new impetus towards the second developmental stage.  It is interesting to note also that despite the publicity during the summer from the university sector, there are now more applicants for places in regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology than for universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The university sector sought increased funding and put pressure on politicians and parents by indicating there will be a 25 per cent increase in the cost of courses.  It did not matter to them that more applicants sought places in regional technical colleges and in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The Minister should look at the cost to her <Col N="1482" /> Department of a student attending university compared to attending an regional technical college.  I compared University College, Cork, with Tralee regional technical college.  I based my calculations on the amount of funds given both those excellent institutions and divided that by the number of students attending the colleges.  My survey showed a major disparity in the cost to the Department.  It cost £4,500 to go through university whereas it appeared to cost £2,500 to go through an regional technical college.  That has major cost implications for the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I asked a parliamentary question last year seeking the unit cost comparison between universities and regional technical colleges and was told this information was not available.  It is high time now that it was made available.  We are all aware that more and more young people seeking access to third level are denied it, not because they have not attained the minimum requirements but because they do not have sufficient points.  The Minister is left with the problem of how to provide the best possible third level education while ensuring the highest possible number of places.  From my analysis it makes greater economic sense to expand the Regional technical college-DIT sector than to expand the university sector. regional technical college and Dublin Institute of Technology courses are shorter and more flexible than university courses.  They can be adapted to meet the needs of the region the college serves.  They are more attractive to the lower socio-economic group who tend to apply to them rather than to university.  The Minister should keep that in mind when planning for the provision of additional places.</P>
    <P>I understand that Cork regional technical college is the most difficult college to which to gain entry.  It demands the highest points for entry compared to any other regional technical college or to Dublin Institute of Technology.  As a result many students fail to gain entry <Col N="1483" /> although they have attained the necessary standards.  The Minister should look at that.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Deputy Gilmore, his comments about the Castlebar outhouse were less than circumspect and did great injustice to the staff and students who benefit from that institution.  Such people should be lauded rather than treated in such shabby fashion by Deputy Gilmore.  It is madness to continue building regional colleges in centres like Castlebar, Thurles or Dún Laoghaire when there is outreach in education.  There is no reason we could not create an out-centre in Skibbereen under the direct control of the regional technical college and staffed by lecturers under the aegis of Cork regional technical college.  Such an out-centre could serve west Cork and parts of Kerry.  Third level education in Cork is extremely costly and many students must travel to Kerry, Waterford, Athlone or abroad to attain such education.  This would be a cost effective way of ensuring they have access to third level education.  At the end of the day students would be better qualified and capable of being employed.</P>
    <P>Rural towns would be more vibrant if courses were held in out-centres. Imagine the difference it would make to a town like Skibbereen if 250 students attended an regional technical college out-centre.  That is the way forward.  The National Council for Education Awards could ratify courses and regional technical colleges could ensure their standards applied.  It would be effective from a cost point of view.</P>
    <P>As regards awarding degrees by regional technical colleges, major progress has been made within the vocational sector over the last 20 years. Vocational education committees play a vital role in the board of governors of regional technical colleges.  They know exactly what is required and the input from vocational education committee members to the board of governors of regional technical colleges cannot be underestimated.  I have seen colleges <Col N="1484" /> progress from offering two year certificate courses to offering diploma courses and now, in some instances, they offer degree courses.  There is a hands on approach in regional technical colleges and in the Dublin Institute of Technology compared with universities.  The feedback from employers is that there is a more practical content in regional technical college courses and the graduate is far more adaptable in the workplace.  This aspect is beneficial in enabling students to secure employment.  The Minister should reconsider the proposal to put a cap on the number of degrees awarded by regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  There might be a need for some capping in this area but, given the developments in education over the years, colleges should be given flexibility so that they can continue to flourish and develop.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I welcome this Bill, the first legislation to emanate from the Department of Education since the Minister took office. This House has not distinguished itself by the number of education Bills it has considered over the years.  I look forward to further legislation in this area, following the publication of the White Paper on Education.</P>
      <P>This Bill reflects the significant steps taken by the Government to improve the status of women in positions of authority in institutions which are under public control.  The Government's policy in regard to gender balance has been much derided by some commentators and many sections of the media, but I believe that over time it will work and be very effective.  I welcome this Bill which will implement that policy in regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the question of gender balance in this significant and growing sector of our education system is addressed.  As the Minister said, the number of students in this sector has increased significantly from approximately 10,500 in 1980 to approximately <Col N="1485" /> 35,000 today.  This sector deserves the full attention of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>The majority of students in my area attend the regional technical colleges in Athlone and Carlow.  Those of us who know students attending regional technical colleges can say without reservation that these colleges promote participation in education, greater accessibility to education and are more affordable in the sense that students can live at home and commute on a daily basis.  They also provide great opportunities for progress in that students can take diploma and degree course and then transfer to other colleges within or outside the State.</P>
    <P>There is a gender balance in the student population of these colleges. Women make up more than half our population and this should be reflected not only in the student intake but in the number of women on the staff and the governing bodies.</P>
    <P>I share the positive views expressed by Deputy O'Keeffe about the extension centres being developed by regional technical colleges.  I, too, was disappointed to hear Deputy Gilmore describe the developments in places such as Castlebar as &ldquo;outhouses&rdquo;.  As a former chairman of the County Offaly vocational education committee, I am aware of the excellent work done by the extension centre opened in Edenderry in conjunction with Athlone regional technical college.  These centres provide courses for students who because of financial or distance problems, cannot take courses in regional technical colleges. The development could profitably be expanded in many other areas.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education is reviewing the level of need in the third level education sector before making any further provision.  That review should take account of regional factors. Under the CAO-CAS system students can apply to all regional technical colleges.  The inclusion of a regional balance in the system would enable <Col N="1486" /> students from my constituency who cannot afford to go to college in Letterkenny, Cork or Tralee to attend college in Athlone or Carlow.  This would be a useful development.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Bill will be criticised by those who have doubts about the effectiveness of positive discrimination in society.  I heard it said that legislative, positive discrimination has not worked well for ethnic groups in America or Britain but this Bill deals with a different matter; it relates to women who make up more than half the population.  It is important in the education sector to have positive discrimination in favour of women who make up such a large proportion of the student and staff populations but who hold very few of the top posts in administration and management.  As a general principle it is better if we can make progress in this area by way of policy, guidelines and advice.  However, in areas where these are not effective legislation is necessary, and I agree wholeheartedly with its introduction to deal with this limited area.</P>
    <P>Critics of legislation on positive discrimination say we should have a system based on merit.  However, this implies that women do not hold top positions because they do not merit them.  This is patently not the case.  To date the power and decision-making structures have discriminated in favour of men and it is high time a measure was introduced which gives women greater participation in this area.  The Government's policy in regard to gender balance has worked very well in appointments to State boards.  This proves that if one looks for women of merit and capability to fill these positions one will find them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to put on a statutory basis the gender balance requirement in appointments to the governing bodies.  It is ironic that, on the one hand, Deputy Gilmore criticised the Minister for not doing enough and on the other, lent some credence to the arguments put forward by those who oppose change in this area.  I commend the Minister on the introduction of this <Col N="1487" /> reforming legislation and look forward to the introduction of further legislation which will deal with the changing needs in a fast developing educational sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Curim fáilte roimh an Bille seo.  Ós rud é gur phós mé bean álainn agus go bhfuil triúr iníon agam agus mac amháin, níl trioblóid ar bith agam ó thaobh áit na mban nó tionchar na mban sa tír seo.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe regretted the absence of Deputy Gilmore who, if I recall correctly, was leader of the students' union at one stage, as was his very able colleague, Deputy Rabbitte. When St. Paul was riding to Damascus he got a fright, fell off his horse but saw the light and was converted.  I hope the Deputy's zeal has not gone altogether overboard.  I dare say he would say something I would readily accept, that he was accepted by a majority vote which is democracy at work.  If more than half the students are female and vote for a male student, that is fine with me but that there must be a compulsory number of females is the only difficulty I perceive.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty in acknowledging that women can play as good if not a better role than men in any set of circumstances.  I was encouraged, having spoken to people in a regional technical college, to discover they were quite happy with the way things were working out, that while it may have proved somewhat difficult for interview boards to obtain qualified women, it was merely a distance difficulty they perceived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could end up with people who felt they must perform a task they did not like.  A member of the academic staff who may be superb in her field of expertise may have no interest in being elected to a governing body.  I suppose most sensible men have no interest in being public representatives given that there are a sufficient number of public representatives.  If one is engaged in teaching, there is much to be said for <Col N="1488" /> going home after school hours, resting, and being fresh for the following morning rather than travelling to meetings undertaking tasks for others.  If sufficient women have that inclination the two preferred candidates in any vote could transpire to be women.  I do not see why any students' union could not elect two women student leaders.  The provisions of this Bill could be a barrier to two women who were very keen to represent the students' union.  One of them would be debarred from so doing because a male would have to be automatically elected.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to get this gender balance right.  For example, does one prevent a person coming forward for election or does one ensure that somebody comes forward for election?  If somebody wants to put themselves forward for election and is elected, that is fine but, if they are forced to put themselves forward as candidates because a female has to be elected, it might not weigh altogether to the advantage of women.  We must remember that there are many female teachers at primary level.  When I taught there were six women out of a total of eight teachers in my school.  I was principal because I was older than them, but I experienced no difficulty with them.  I found them marvellous and they continue to be so, but I predict that a difficulty will arise if we push this gender balance.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister considered imposing a 40 per cent intake of male students in the teacher training college because there the gender balance has gone utterly out of control?  I do not know what will happen in schools where discipline appears to be a major problem. That is not to say women cannot impose discipline, they can but, as male students become older, the presence of a male teacher who will not take any nonsense is essential.  In my many years teaching I found it was invariably the bullies who whinged most whenever they had to suffer.  In the age of corporal punishment within which I spent most of my teaching years, its threat was a marvellous steadying influence on <Col N="1489" /> students who wanted to render life miserable for others.  My philosophy was that children should be free to come to school, remain there and return home unhindered.  I do not know how schools continue to function without any punishment level because, taking a student aside and talking to him, will have no effect if he decides to kick another student the minute he leaves.  It is very difficult to manage such students.  While I know there are plans to implement suspension and so on, one must ask one-self what suspension means to a child at primary level?  It means nothing whatsoever.  A student on the eve of sitting his leaving certificate will be worried about results whereas, suspension to a child at primary level, will make him think all his Christmases have come together.  Of course, that depends on the attitude of the parents, who could make life miserable for such a pupil but, conversely, if the parents were so inclined, probably that child would behave properly in school.  Without proper teacher/parent relations one cannot have discipline in schools.  Equally, if a teacher cannot contact parents and talk to them on a friendly basis life will be miserable for teacher and pupil alike.</P>
    <P>The overall question of gender balance should be addressed seriously at primary level also.  While it might be unfair to females who might not attain a higher academic level, if we achieved gender balance in other sectors, there is a case for some such balance at the primary level, if not by raising the level of male teachers to 40 per cent perhaps by endeavouring to encourage greater numbers of male students to engage in the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges have played a major role and have expanded rapidly since their establishment.  We must remember that they are third-level colleges and we should always compare them with universities.  They should award degrees; diplomas alone are not sufficient.  While they can award certain degrees, a system should be devised to enable them award a degree on completion of most of their courses so that <Col N="1490" /> students who participate in them would not be perceived as second-class third-level graduates.  The regional technical colleges are not second-class, third-level institutions, they conduct very practical courses and students emerging from them generally are very well qualified but, invariably universities have a monopoly when it comes to availing of resources or funding.  If we are serious about encouraging regional technical colleges we should ensure that they obtain their fair share of European Union or other funds available for research and so on.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees did a marvellous job in vocational education, when they were familiar with circumstances obtaining in their respective counties and so on.  Despite what others have said, I am not so sure that they are as well equipped to deal with regional technical colleges as they were in the past in dealing with their own schools. While their role appears to have been diminished somewhat, they appear to be given powers about which I will speak later.  For example if Carlow regional technical college was influenced in its operation only by the vocational education committee we would omit neighbouring counties from which many students come, such as Kilkenny, Wexford, Laois, Wicklow and Kildare. There must be a wider network of contacts.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has introduced powers to enable vocational education committees to seek nominations from any number of organisations.  Would she consider, for example, extracting a list from the regional technical colleges?  In the long run the management boards of regional technical colleges will be fully aware of the areas from which their students come, where they need to have influence and which might be the best nominating organisations.  From that list, thereafter, the vocational education committees could determine which nominating bodies they would choose. We must remember that, for example, Carlow must compete with Waterford, Athlone and Limerick so that it might <Col N="1491" /> be very important that they have a considerable influence on neighbouring counties.  I know the nominating bodies do not have to be located in Carlow, Waterford or other neighbouring counties but, bearing in mind the old system under which vocational education committees dealt with their county only, it would appear the practice obtains that the county in which the regional technical college is located appears to have greatest representation.  The Minister might review the overall system of nominations, perhaps allowing the principal of a college or the management board decide which nominating bodies would be of greatest benefit to them and allowing the vocational education committees choose from that same list.</P>
    <P>There has been an expansion of student numbers in regional technical colleges from approximately 6,000 to 25,000, which is to be welcomed and is a sign of the success of those institutions.  Unless we have an extension of the buildings there will be difficulties. Since the founding of these colleges there has been a lack of proper library facilities.  This problem has existed for so long that the Minister will have to take a bold step and, despite public spending, come to the assistance of these colleges.  Seating accommodation for 70 students of the 2,300 students is certainly not putting the regional technical colleges in a position to compete with universities.  At university level students are expected to use the facilities.  If library facilities are not available in the regional technical colleges it may give the impression that research and study is not that important in them and that they are not really third level education institutions.  The lack of library facilities in regional technical colleges should be tackled immediately because we must get students into libraries to carry out research.  If only 70 places are available for over 2,000 students that suggests that they cannot work.</P>
    <P>Canteen facilities must be expanded. It follows that if there is an increase in <Col N="1492" /> the number of students there is a need to expand canteen facilities.  There is no point in people walking along corridors on their way to the canteen to eat sardines when they are being crushed like sardines on the way or thinking they are leaving Croke Park every day they walk the corridor.  In a sense it is good to have such a difficulty because it means student numbers have increased.  The numbers will increase only because there is success in regional technical colleges.  The authorities, and the Department of Education, should provide the money to increase the necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the operational report sent to the vocational education committees in March.  During the summer I was surprised to see advertisements for lecturers in regional technical colleges.  Some of the vacancies may have arisen because some lecturers left. From what I can gather, the clearance for new courses arrives too late for the regional colleges.  It has been suggested to me that at the time the vocational education committees get the report the Minister should also get a copy so that she can anticipate the request for new courses that will later be recommended by the vocational education committees. The Department would then be in a position to give clearance in good time so that extra lecturers can be employed and the course set up.  The Minister should think carefully about this because those involved in the regional technical colleges do not have the freedom to prepare courses sufficiently early in the year.  Perhaps the Minister could change the date for receipt of the operational report from March to February or even January.  The vocational education committees may think they are being by-passed but I am merely suggesting that the Minister receive a copy at the same time to allow her to deal with the expansion of courses.  On the other report, the Minister can wait for vocational education committee approval and suggestions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the 40 per cent gender balance does not <Col N="1493" /> apply to political elections because I could be fighting for the last seat in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.  I would hate to survive and receive a note saying that because there were not 40 per cent women TDs in the constituency I would have to step down.  Although I have the utmost respect for women I would hate to have to step down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity that the introduction of these Bills gives the House to comment on the development and future of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I am happy to acknowledge the excellent work being done by the regional technical colleges and by the Dublin Institute of Technology and the wonderful education being provided for our young people.  It can be seen from the growth in figures that they are well supported by young people.  Since 1980 student numbers have increased from 6,500 to 25,000 in the regional technical colleges and from 4,000 to 10,000 in the institute.  There is a thirst for knowledge and third level education among our young people and that is something we should strive to satisfy.</P>
      <P>The 1969 report, which formed the basis for the establishment of the colleges, related the colleges to economic growth both nationally and in their regions.  It is interesting to note the Minister's comment:</P>
      <P>In their continuing adaptation over a period of almost 25 years since then the colleges have continued to stimulate demand for skills which the economy needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to see how the colleges have evolved over the years.  They are now dealing with more than the educational area.  Activities such as applied industry-supported research, technology transfer, services to regional industry, industrial training, product development technology centres and new industry incubation are now an ever increasing feature of the regional technical colleges sector.  An expansion should be <Col N="1494" /> encouraged not only of the number of colleges and the number of places but the role of the regional technical colleges.  In regard to the regional technical colleges and their future development I wonder whether the title regional technical colleges, with the emphasis on technical, is too restrictive because they cover a much wider area at this stage.  I ask the Minister to consider the title of the colleges which play a much greater role now in our third level education than in the past as can be seen from the growth figures.</P>
    <P>Our bright young people coming from primary and second level are rightly demanding more places in third level education.  We should speak of the colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology as third level institutions. When I refer to the demand for places at third level I must refer to the iniquitous points system.  It appears to be the fairest of systems but it is a very tough and difficult one.  As a parent of two daughters who have gone through it, I know how difficult it is for parents and children when leaving certificate results are announced.  There is the question of how many points have been obtained and if this represents a cut-off point in their education or as far as career opportunities are concerned.  If they do not get the break from second level into third level it may affect their career paths and their life.</P>
    <P>Of all the examinations our young people sit, the one which has the greatest impact on their careers is the leaving certificate.  That examination is a traumatic experience for them.  We cannot change the points system, but we can make more places available so that more young people have an opportunity to avail of third level education.  Thousands of boys and girls succeed in getting sufficient marks in their leaving certificate to enable them to obtain places in third level colleges.  They would be well qualified to pursue courses and careers of their choice, but due to the restricted number of places at third level they are denied that opportunity.  I encourage the Minister to continue her <Col N="1495" /> battle with the mandarins in the Department of Finance in regard to the number of places at third level.</P>
    <P>If the newspaper report last weekend is correct, officials in the Department of Finance are of the view that the demand for places at third level will drop and, consequently, there is no need to increase the number of regional technical colleges.  I reject that view and I am glad to note from the report that the Minister is fighting a case for the establishment of more regional technical colleges.  A higher percentage of young people will be seeking a third level education in the future.  There will be an ever-increasing demand for places, not only from those completing second level but also from those who want to further their education at a later stage.  The Minister will have my support in her battle for the establishment of additional regional technical colleges. We as a society should not fail our young people by depriving them of the opportunity of a third level education if that is their wish.</P>
    <P>In referring to the number of third level places nationally, I make special plea to the Minister, in respect of the Fingal area of north County Dublin, an area which I have represented in this House for many years.  In the Balbriggan, Swords and Malahide electoral areas there are more than 10,000 young people attending second level education, 8,000 of whom do so in Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Swords, Malahide and Portmarnock, not to mention the numbers attending second level in Howth, Castleknock, Blanchardstown and other areas of Fingal County.  There is a demand for the establishment of a regional technical college in the area and I take this opportunity to ask the Minister seriously to consider the matter.  I am not being parochial on this issue.  I am merely stating a case which has been made by the local authority in its development plan.  It is vital that those 10,000 young people be given an opportunity to avail of third level education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> We are fortunate that the Dublin City University is located on the fringes of the Fingal area and that UCD, Trinity College, the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology are located in the city.  They are all very important institutions.  There is a growing demand for third level education and we should not deprive our young people of that opportunity.  In regard to the location of a third level institution in the Fingal area, a site in the Swords-Malahide-Portmarnock area or in the Balbriggan-Skerries area would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>There is a growing demand for particular skills.  The IDA is concerned about the level of language skills.  Telesales and telemarketing is a growth industry and the only restriction in that regard in the future will be the ability to provide workers with adequate language skills for that industry.  A college in Fingal concentrating on language skills would fill the gap.  In the early 1980s there was an urgent need for qualified engineers and the shortage of engineering college places was a drawback to the IDA's promotional efforts to attract investment.  The problem was tackled with the co-operation of the Departments of Education and Industry and Commerce and colleges and universities throughout the country.  A similar problem will arise in the future in regard to language skills and we should make plans to address it now.  I encourage the Minister to consider seriously the possibility of establishing a college designated as a centre of excellence for language skills.</P>
    <P>In considering the establishment of a college in Fingal, the Minister should take into account the tourism industry. A college dedicated to language skills with an emphasis on tourism would be a welcome development.  With a greater emphasis on tourism in the future, there will be potential for additional jobs.  As particular skills are necessary in that industry such a college located in Fingal would be an asset to the national infrastructure and a considerable advantage <Col N="1497" /> to the young people I have the honour to represent in this House.</P>
    <P>A Government has a responsibility to its citizens, especially the young and elderly.  It is incumbent on us as public representatives to speak up for those two sections of society in particular. Short term financial restrictions should not limit the development path of a young person who wishes to advance to a third level college.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to ensure that in the years ahead our young will be given the reassurance that on completing their leaving certificate a third level place will be provided for them if they have the ability and desire to follow that path.  That would be preferable to the present system where the choices, future careers and development of our young people are restricted, not because of ability but because of economic factors that control the number of places available.</P>
    <P>The present system is wrong and should be tackled.  Given the thirst for knowledge, advancement and development among our young people there will be an increased demand for places in third level institutes in the future.  We should not restrict the number of places, rather we should encourage our young people by giving them every opportunity to advance in life on the path they choose.  That will result in an increased demand for places and we must provide them.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the need for a third level college in Fingal and I strongly urge the Minister to favourably consider the case I made for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss these two Bills.  I do not object to the proposals in the legislation to increase the number of women appointed to the boards of regional technical colleges.  The Minister referred to this matter as gender equity. I hope we do not take this matter too far by pursuing the 40 per cent model put forward for elections in some countries, including Ireland, by various pressure groups.  People in any walk of <Col N="1498" /> life should be elected on merit. However, I recognise there is a bias against women, probably built on tradition, and it is difficult to overcome.  I agree that encouragement should be given to increasing the number of women appointed to various boards and elected to Parliament, but not on the basis of a formula which would bring in people who would not be up to the mark.  People may say there are many males in the Assembly who are not up to the mark and they may be correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be an erroneous and foolish path to follow that people should be elected substantially on the basis of their sex; ability and capabilities should be the main priorities in this case.</P>
      <P>I represent the area of Waterford where we have a wonderful regional technical college which is packed to capacity, probably considerably overcrowded.  One of the most burning issues in Waterford at present is that the regional technical college has not been upgraded to the status of a university. There is considerable discontent about that issue about which I am sure the Minister is aware.  She may put forward arguments regarding population decline resulting from a fall in the birth rate in the coming years.  There has been a decline in births since the 1980s which will result in a noticeable population decline in the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third level institutions, regional technical colleges or universities, throughout the land are grossly overcrowded.  In recent weeks I heard Dr. Mitchell, President of Trinity College and Professor Michael Mortell, President of University College, Cork, complain about the overcrowded conditions under which they and their staff work.  Third level institutes are bulging at the seams and that trend will continue despite demographic factors such as the decline in the birth rate.  As pointed out in a report last week, in certain areas, particularly <Col N="1499" /> in north Dublin, people are discriminated against on a significant scale because of the lack of provision of a third level institute in their locality. Finglas, probably the most deprived area in Dublin, was singled out.</P>
    <P>The south east, particularly Waterford, is seriously discriminated against in the matter of third level education.  It needs a university and its case is irrefutable.  I ask the Minister to upgrade the regional technical college in Waterford, which has a significant number of degree courses, to the status of university as was the former National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick about ten years ago.  It is recognised that the upgrading of the institute in Limerick has been a huge success.  Members who visited the new Limerick University have been impressed by the improvement brought about by its upgrading.  It is a marvel.  That upgrading was in no small measure due to the magnificent work of the president of that university and formerly of that National Institute of Higher Education, namely, Professor Ed Walsh.</P>
    <P>What has been achieved in Limerick can be achieved in Waterford with a little political commitment and will.  The Limerick experiment was a massive success, the same can be done in Waterford and I do not understand why it is not being done.  Waterford has the best regional technical college in the country but it is grossly overcrowded and cannot meet the demand for places so why can it not be upgraded?  It is not fair to the people of that region, who number about half a million, that their children should have to travel to Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Galway to obtain university degrees of significance.</P>
    <P>We quite understand that subjects like dentistry, medicine and veterinary medicine demand such huge expenditure that they can be available only in one or two institutions.  However, we want to see a university where the humanities can be taught and degrees in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering can be granted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> Discrimination is blatant.  It costs in the region of £5,000 to £6,000 to send a child to a university away from home. Some families have to send two, three or four children, sometimes simultaneously, to such a university.  The cost is crippling because these people generally do not get grants.  Their outlay could be £25,000 a year.  Imagine a PAYE worker trying to exist when he is paying £25,000 a year with no income tax relief and no grant or maintenance allowance.  How could anybody justify that?</P>
    <P>Waterford is a city of 40,000 people. The south east region, including Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny, south Tipperary and Waterford county and city comprises half a million people.  How can the Government justify discriminating against people to such a degree?  We are 100 miles from Dublin and over 80 miles from Cork so it is not feasible to travel to and fro each day.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by the demographic factors mentioned or by the leaks from the working party set up by the Minister to study the future of third level education.  The Waterford and South East University Action Group considers it important to comment on some of the leaks to the media in recent weeks.  That the south east region has been unfairly treated is accepted in some of the references that were leaked. The Clancy report, which some people like to forget, clearly states that there is a bias against children living a distance from a university.  A report published last week shows that that basis exists in places as close to here as Finglas with reference to the need for a regional technical college.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the supply of graduates would exceed the demand in the region is unacceptable.  The important question is which comes first, the graduates or the industries that would employ those graduates.  Industries will be attracted if there are graduates.  Arguments to the contrary are spurious.  Because we do not have a university we have only one high technology industry in the locality.  Compare <Col N="1501" /> that with Galway, Cork or Dublin. There is a massive imbalance.  There is the almost perverse view that Waterford and the south east are so wealthy that they do not need assistance or subvention from the Government.  We got less money proportionately in the National Plan than any other region in the State.  Now we are being discriminated against in the most basic of areas, education.  Decent hard-working people are being victimised by not being allowed to upgrade a very successful regional technical college into a university.</P>
    <P>Recently the Waterford university action group handed in a petition to the Taoiseach with 20,000 signatures demanding a university for Waterford. That speaks for itself.  I am not looking for the impossible.  I know that a new university on a green field site would cost an arm and a leg, probably in excess of £100 million.  As a university graduate and secondary school teacher I have some knowledge of the situation. I am not asking for that.  It is said that I am more forceful than the other Dáil Deputies in my constituency, but I am still very polite.  We are known as the gentle county.  However, when we get annoyed we really do get annoyed, and people are getting very annoyed about this subject.  We are merely looking for an upgrading for the regional technical college in Waterford to university status, just as the NIHE in Limerick was upgraded ten or 12 years ago.  When I walk or drive through the campus that is Limerick University nowadays, I am in awe of the situation there in contrast to that in the comparable city of Waterford.  It is magnificent, and all credit is due to the people responsible, Dr. Walsh in particular.  I am looking for something similar in my own city and constituency and I do not think it is too much to ask.  We want facilities and courses.  We want playing facilities and library facilities, the type of facilities that children are entitled to.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has any sympathy with the situation or if she will go back to the birth rate figures for the <Col N="1502" /> last 14 years and make a mathematical decision rather than a human one, which is all we are asking for.  We can refute the inspired leaks that appeared in recent weeks from the working party on third level education set up by the Minister.  It is as if we are being softened up for the blow that is to come, that there is to be no university for Waterford.  I will not accept that, nor will the Waterford action group.  I do not think my three colleagues who are members of one of the Government parties will accept it either.  I am trying to be as reasonable as possible, but we have an irrefutable case.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say that these Bills deal primarily with gender equity for the boards of regional technical colleges but I do want her to reflect on the points I have made.  It is not good enough to say there is no demand.  A university with engineering and science graduates will result in two spin-offs. The first is that graduates will be available to supply any high technology industry that wishes to come to the area. The second is almost as important. Middle-aged executives who have children growing up will look on Waterford as a good location if it has university facilities.  That is a major inducement to people in management who want the facility to educate their children.  There are many plusses that are not being taken into account.  The most damning indictment of the present policy is that despite the downward trend in population the universities and regional technical colleges are bulging to capacity because more and more people want their children to go to university.  That trend is increasing.  The Minister can provide all the stastistics in the world but she will not convince me or the action group in Waterford to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister the best of luck with the two Bills.  There is nothing radical in them.  They are rather mundane but necessary.  There should be more academics represented on governing bodies &mdash; the word &ldquo;academic&rdquo; is a little <Col N="1503" /> off-putting for many people who consider academics to be people who do not have their feet on the ground. Academics are the salt of the earth and the backbone of the nation.  They educate us and keep us sane and those with gumption write pertinent, penetrating articles and tell the truth in an articulate way.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation.  For the first time we are enshrining in legislation the principle of gender equity in terms of boards over which the Government has control.  The 1992 legislation provided that there should be a gender balance.  In this legislation we are enshrining the strategy and method by which vocational education committees will be enabled to ensure that important balance.  The legislation sets out the level of part-time and whole-time members of academic staff who may participate in election to boards.  This gave rise to litigation in the past in the Dublin Institute of Technology and I am glad the Minister is making provision for the matter in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Programme for Government <Col N="1504" /> there is a commitment to a 40 per cent gender balance in areas of public life over which the Government has control, specifically semi-State bodies and boards to which the Government makes appointments.  The purpose is to ensure a greater level of participation by women in public life.  That is an important principle and I am sure nobody would disagree with it, but in bringing that about we must determine whether there is need for positive discrimination.  In the short term we should commit ourselves to a policy of positive discrimination.  Over the years it was accepted that the public arena was male dominated and I welcome the provisions in the Bill to redress that imbalance.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that we are initiating this principle in the education area.  Our educational institutions are most important in that they provide for the education, training and development of young people.  It is important that there is a gender balance on the governing bodies of our third level institutions. This applies equally to the boards of management of primary and second level schools.</P>
    <P>This legislation arises from an anomaly in the 1992 legislation in that no structure was provided to ensure the implementation of the gender balance. As chairman of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee I encountered this difficulty last year in attempting to ensure equity on the governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The vocational education committee has authority to nominate six members, and two of those nominated are women.  However we found ourselves in an invidious position when we sought a gender balance from the five organisations who are represented on the body.  Even though we pointed out to them the Government's policy on gender equity, in most cases a male candidate was chosen, to the dissatisfaction of the Minister, and we had no say in the matter.</P>
    <P>Since then this problem has been <Col N="1505" /> resolved and two of the five nominations are female.  As the Minister acknowledged in her speech, we are achieving our targets in terms of gender equity.  The anomaly that existed has been eliminated.  Under this legislation not only can we seek nominations from more than five bodies but we can ensure gender equity is achieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister has specified that in future there must be a gender balance on the governing bodies of regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  There are two members of the academic staff and two student representatives on those bodies, and in each case one member must be male and one female.  I welcome the fact that the Minister established the governing bodies on a preliminary basis for 12 months, from March 1994 to March 1995, and thereafter they will be established on a five year basis.</P>
    <P>A further anomaly in the 1992 legislation was the requirement that agriculture be one of the professions from which a person was nominated.  This was an oversight as, unlike the regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology does not provide agriculture related courses.  It would have been reasonable to include it as an option but agriculture is not of central importance to any of the colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  This presented us with a difficulty in making recommendations.  There was also a delay due to the disagreement with the Department of Education about the way in which this provision was to be interpreted.  This anomaly has now been rectified.  Under the amendment we will be able to choose our nominees from a number of organisations.</P>
    <P>A third anomaly related to the question of which members of the academic staff &mdash; full-time, part-time, EPT or wholetime &mdash; should be entitled to vote. The Minister wisely decided that all permanent staff &mdash; and temporary staff who work a minimum of 50 per cent of the hours worked by wholetime staff &mdash; should be allowed to vote.  This is <Col N="1506" /> reasonable and will ensure that only those staff who have set down firm roots in the institution will be allowed to vote.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I heartily welcome this legislation.  I wish to address the question of the role of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges which were established under the auspices of the vocational education committees which, since their establishment in the 1930, have been concerned with the provision of vocational education.  Because their remit is flexible the vocational education committees have been able to meet the needs of the community and the market-place in terms of education and training.  They have been able to do this extraordinarily well.  Initially they were able to meet the need for technical education which was not being met fully by the universities.  This was done through the establishment of the regional technical colleges and the consolidation of the six colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology in the 1970s.  To meet a need within the community the vocational education committees now provide post leaving certificate courses which are attended by 16,000 students.  Likewise they are meeting the needs of the large number of unemployed by providing vocational training opportunities and an adult education programme.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation introduced in 1992 the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology were separated from the vocational education committees which were given the right to make recommendations on who should be appointed to the governing bodies.  Rather than break the educational links we should strengthen them.  I am glad the Minister is now placing the emphasis on pre-school education through to primary and second level and on to PLCs and the enhanced points system which was devised by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  Under this system those who come from a disadvantaged background are given an opportunity to attend third level.  Places should be <Col N="1507" /> reserved in third level institutions, universities, the Dublin Institute of Technology or regional technical colleges, to allow us plot a course.  The route through education must be kept open at all levels.</P>
    <P>Like other vocational education committees, the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee provides post leaving certificate courses and has sought accreditation by British universities, polytechnics and institutions, including some private and professional institutions.  It has, however, encountered an obstacle in seeking accreditation by third level institutions in this country as the universities have refused to become involved.  Because these courses have been recognised and accreditation granted by British institutions, students who have attended courses in colleges in Dublin and throughout the country will be accepted in Britain.  I ask the Minister to address this matter.  The reason I emphasise this point is that it brings us back to the aim of the vocational education committees which was to plot a route through education whereby one could proceed step by step.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to what he described as the iniquitous points system.  While I agree it is rigid it is probably the fairest system we could come up with.  Because of its nature, however, it is automatically inflexible.  We have to recognise that society is complex and we should not respond by having a rigid system but by allowing people to plot their route to educational success.  As we are all aware, there is a strong link between educational attainment and job prospects and it is clear that those who go furthest along the path of education are more likely to obtain a job.</P>
    <P>My vision is that Dublin should be a centre of learning.  In Dublin there are three universities, UCD, Trinity College and DCU as well as six colleges of education providing for a huge range of professional attainment, a regional technical college in Tallaght and a host of <Col N="1508" /> private educational institutions sprouting up.  Young Europeans see it as an ideal place in which to learn English.  I think we could market Dublin in particular and Ireland in general as a centre of educational excellence.  This tradition goes back to the times when we were known as the island of saints and scholars.  We are recognised as a cultured and educated people and this could be a central part of the promotion of ourselves.  In this legislation we present ourselves as enlightened in the manner in which our educational institutions function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to contribute to this debate.  These Bills are being introduced for a specific purpose, that is to introduce gender balance into the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>Nobody objects in principle to the implementation of gender balance. Having listened to speakers from different parties it is perfectly obvious everybody accepts that women who make up more than 50 per cent of the population should be represented on these boards and throughout every organisation. Nobody wants taken representation and in my view people should be appointed only on merit.  Nobody wants token women or token men on a board.  Given the level of representation of males on boards, obviously a number could be considered as token representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education is no burden to carry.  The Minister and her Minister of State are the guardians of education opportunity not only for this generation but also for future generations, as they create the base and the foundation on which future generations will be educated to make their way in life.  There is an enormous responsibility vested in the Minister for Education and the Minister of State at her Department.  Often the Department of Education is maligned. It has been in existence for over 100 years and its civil servants have seen Governments come and go.  While it has been slow to adapt to many of the <Col N="1509" /> changes in modern society, the fundamental structure is very sound and when it has adapted it has been for the better.</P>
    <P>Regional technical colleges are modern universities in their own right.  The growth of towns such as Letterkenny, Carlow, Dundalk, Tralee and Athlone, to mention some non-university towns, shows how regional technical colleges contribute to the economic and social development of the town as well as providing educational facilities for students. The Minister states:</P>
    <P>New industry incubation, co-operation with and assistance to indigenous industry and the attraction to the region of investment in development are and will continue to be major functions of the sector.</P>
    <P>That sentence contains the fundamental point on regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>It has been Government policy over the past 25 years to spread industry throughout the country in order to give every locality a measure of economic growth.  The IDA and now Forbairt are charged with attracting industry to a locality.  Generally the emphasis is on metropolitan areas with large populations and easy access to markets and better infrastructure generally.  It is extremely difficulty to attract competitive industries to areas outside the major metropolis.  This can often be compounded by the fact that the managing director of a firm which decides to locate in Ireland may well be offered a choice of location and it really boils down to the opportunities he sees in the different areas.  Choosing to site in an area can depend on the location of a regional technical college or a third level education facility.  Given the level of expertise and the capacity to change, invent and adapt that competitive industry from abroad wishes to have at its disposal the facilities and the culture that grow from regional technical colleges and universities are crucial.</P>
    <P>Castlebar has long sought the provision of a third level education facility. The quest for an independent regional technical college which began over 20 <Col N="1510" /> years ago continues to the present day. As a Deputy resident in the town let me express my appreciation to the Government and to the Minister for Education for seeing through in part a deal which was worked out between the vocational education committee and the Department of Education to provide third level courses in Castlebar as an outreach campus of Galway Regional Technical College.  Since the courses began last week a number of industries and younger manufacturers have indicated an interest in locating engineering and construction facilities in the general locality.</P>
    <P>There are over 100 students on the campus and congratulations are due to Mr. Thorn, the principal.  It is projected that there will be 1,000 students by the year 2000.  That gives life and substance to a rural town.  Grants will be paid to students, hopefully on time, and this will give a general boost to the economic life of the area.  It means that lecturers, tutors and other academics will live in the locality and give of their best to it. The people of Castlebar and of County Mayo have been given an opportunity and they have to seize it and prove to this Government or the next that the ability exists to warrant status as an independent regional technical college in due course.  This cannot be approved overnight.</P>
    <P>When my party was in Government between 1982 and 1987 it was our intention to provide a greenfield independent regional technical college in Castlebar.  That did not see the light of day but I am happy that through the aegis of the vocational education committee, the Department of Education and Galway Regional Technical College, third level courses are now being held in the town.  I genuinely believe this presents a unique opportunity for our county &mdash; filling in the gap between Sligo and Galway &mdash; to achieve independent status within a few years.  I assure the Department of Education that every effort will be made in terms <Col N="1511" /> of a quality of courses, the attractiveness of the location and the general circumstances in which the students find themselves to ensure that there will be a sufficient number of queries to take up the courses in Castlebar.</P>
    <P>We are only a short number of years from the turn of the century.  I genuinely hope that by the year 2000 there will be a strong, vibrant and independent regional technical college in Castlebar for the people of Mayo and students outside the county.  When one reads through the educational magazines it is very heartening to see the extent of education, from Japan in the Far East, where people return to school in their 80s, to other international countries where huge resources are allocated to the educational sphere.</P>
    <P>We have always been justly proud of our system and credit is due to the teachers and staff who laboured for many years with very inadequate facilities.  Despite that those institutions turned out young men and women who have been a credit to this country wherever they have travelled in the world. Many Japanese, American and German firms are happy to take on Irish apprentices.  They employ young Irish technologically competent students and this is a measure of how far we have advanced in this area.  The only limit to our progress in the technological area is our imagination.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary, and I do not have a problem in regard to ensuring gender balance on these boards.  The more fundamental point, however, is the right of our students to the best quality and broadest education they can obtain.  The extent of courses and the depth of the educational involvement in the regional technical colleges is very encouraging.  I invite the Minister and her Minister of State to visit the third level facility in Castlebar.  I hope, as these courses expand, the remainder of the unit there can be acquired as a fully fledged campus when independent <Col N="1512" /> status has been granted.  When the Minister visits the facility, she and her Minister of State will be encouraged by a newborn regional technical college which, with careful nurturing, will grow strong and vibrant and play an important part in the educational development of students in the west.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to express my thoughts in regard to the provision of a third level facility in my native town.  I assure the Minister of State that this facility is welcomed by everybody and, while it had a tortuous birth, all that is behind us.  We must now look to the future which is one of hope and enthusiasm, we will all work as a cohesive team from all corners of the political divide to ensure that that hope never dims but strengthens in kind and in facility.  I hope the Minister will ensure that we are granted our final aspiration and that we achieve independent status in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill on gender equity but I wonder are we getting a little carried away with this issue. The first consideration in choosing a candidate for any particular post is whether that person has the ability to do the job.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the development of third level education.  I listened to my constituency colleague, Deputy Deasy, speaking earlier.  I may reiterate some of the points he made but they are worth repeating.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Education is not present to hear my contribution.  I know my good friend, the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, lives only a few miles from Waterford city, he is well aware of the need for university status in the area and will not have to be convinced about what is needed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to some recent media reports regarding an alleged report of a <Col N="1513" /> working group which is preparing the ground for a steering committee reporting on the future development of higher education.  It has since emerged that no such report exists but that a discussion document has been prepared for the working group, which has not yet been considered.  I have every confidence in the integrity and the capacity of that working group and I have no doubt that it will produce a report based on solid fact and valid argument.  While I have no information regarding the authenticity of the statements which appeared in the media, some of them are unacceptable and must be countered lest they influence those who will make various decisions.</P>
    <P>There are four points in question. First, there is a suggestion that, historically, there has been no great demand in the south east for a university. Second, it is suggested that the supply of graduates exceeds the demand in the region.  Third, there is a suggestion that the problem could be solved through the medium of grants and, fourth, it is suggested that the lower rate of manufacturing start-ups in the south east is due to geographical location and the level of transport infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I will deal with these points individually.  The suggestion that there is no great demand for a university in the south east is utter nonsense.  Until quite recently the south east would have been seen as perhaps the most prosperous area in the country and because of that the people in the region were, to a certain extent, unversed in the art of lobbying compared with other regions.  In several respects Government investment indicates that less money is being invested in that region compared to others and the facts bear that out.  That unfair discrimination, however unintentional, against students from the south east regarding access to university places has only become clearly apparent with the overall increase in both demand and supply nationally.  The correlation between the existence of a university in the region and industrial and economic development generally has <Col N="1514" /> only lately been realised in the south east.  Perhaps we were not sufficiently focused in the past.  Limerick is a great example in the way it went about achieving university status.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years the Waterford University Action Group has undertaken tremendous work in highlighting the need in the area.  There is great anger in Waterford about the lack of facilities in the region.  Deputy Enda Kenny referred to the situation in Castlebar.  I visited May for a few days during the recent by-election and I was aware of how angry people were about the provision of a new regional technical college for their region.  This was evident by the putting forward of an regional technical college candidate in the by-election.  I assure the Minister that that same anger exists in Waterford.</P>
    <P>Recently I brought members of the Waterford University Action Group to meet the Taoiseach.  They presented him with a petition signed by 20,000 people demanding university status in the south-east.  Those 20,000 signatures were not obtained by people going from door to door demanding that people sign the petition.  They were obtained in various locations in Waterford city over several days.  People wanted to sign the petition and that number could have been doubled or trebled if necessary. There is no reason to doubt that if the facility was available the demand would be any less than it is in other regions. Part of the problem is the supply of graduates exceeding the demand. Almost all the industry in the region is traditional.  As Deputy Deasy said, there is only one firm which could be classified as hi-tech and the IDA can verify that.</P>
    <P>We constantly hear of hi-tech firms locating in other regions.  These announcements are usually accompanied by a statement to the effect that the presence of a university was a key factor in the location.  The absence of a university has handicapped industrial development in the south-east region. This has been enunciated publicly by <Col N="1515" /> the IDA and repeated by industrialists when queried about their unwillingness to set up in the region notwithstanding other advantageous factors.</P>
    <P>Industrial and economic development in the 1990s will be based more and more on knowledge and expertise, the availability of scientists, engineers, researchers and technological development.  A university in the region is vital if these sciences are to be available.  This must be provided as early as possible. Other regions are moving ahead of the south-east and that must be arrested. Conversely the absence of a university would portend a bleak economic future for the region.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I read a report which placed Ireland at the bottom of the technological development league table compared to our EU partners.  The south-east is at the bottom of such a table within Ireland.  It is ridiculous to say the problem could be solved through the provision of grants.  That is to fob off the region and make us second class citizens.  The long existence of an injustice is no justification for its continuance.  Grants, in the absence of a university, would not solve the handicap to the industrial and general economic development of the region.</P>
    <P>It was stated that it costs in the region of £5,000 to send a student to university for a year.  As students who leave the south-east are paid grants why not use that money to develop proper facilities in the region?  Even with grants, where can students go as existing universities are drastically overcrowded?  We have a lower participation rate in university education than many of our EU partners and there is a great need for additional university places.</P>
    <P>The south-east was seen traditionally as a prosperous region.  It has a long history of industrialisation and is the most urban of all regions.  Its previous comparative prosperity was based on two factors: It was the best equipped in natural resources and it is a great location <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain and Europe than any other region.  It is also nearer <Col N="1516" /> to the capital city than many other regions.  When one considers that areas which face 3,000 miles of grey Atlantic are doing better than the south-east it is clear that geographic location is not a factor.  The south-east is magnificently equipped with port facilities, both container based and roll-on roll-off.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear Deputy Molloy state there was need for a second river crossing in Waterford.  I am well aware of that as is everyone who lives in the area.  It is a pity the Deputy was not so concerned about it when he was Minister for the Environment.  It is easy to talk about it now but he did not do anything about it then.  There is need for a second bridge and to improve the approach roads to the city and upgrading of the roads.</P>
    <P>The case for a university in the south-east rests on two main factors &mdash; the right of its citizens to be treated equally and the economic factor.  It is not a case of discriminating against the region, but the negative effects of this are aggravated with the passage of time.  Given the regions tremendous natural resources and its location the provision of a university would put it well on the way to solving its economic problems.</P>
    <P>We need a dramatic increase in the number of university places.  This was the finding in the Department's report. The need cannot be met by existing institutions.  I do not understand why a new university cannot be provided in Waterford.  A university is not just built with bricks and mortar but on its reputation.  The regional college in Waterford has a tremendous reputation and built on that a university can be located in the area.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with gender equity and I look for equity for both genders in the south-east and want university status to be given to the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has always been a difference between those who espouse gender equality and those prepared to take concrete measures to support it.  It is easy to pay lip service to equality while not making any decisions <Col N="1517" /> which would challenge vested interests. In that context I congratulate the Minister for introducing the Bill and putting flesh on the commitment given by the Government in March 1993 to ensure gender balance on State boards.</P>
      <P>The argument against gender quotas which some Members put is well known. They can, in certain circumstances, discriminate against suitably qualified and able men.  However, the historical discrimination against women and the damage to society caused by the exclusion of over 50 per cent of the population from positions of power must override that objection.  Countries which have been most successful in overcoming discrimination and its legacy such as Scandanavian countries have openly and successfully used gender quotas as a means of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not enough to say that structural barriers against the advancement of women have been removed and they should compete on the same basis as men.  More and more women are doing this successfully and obviously the trend will continue but, having said that, barriers to women's advancement in a society dominated by men are often as much invisible as visible.  I hope the process whereby women successfully compete will be greatly encouraged by the type of measure we are discussing today.  Whatever the reason, be it the old school tie or simple prejudice, women have been and continue to be excluded from positions to which they would be entitled if judged solely on merit.  In no other area is this as significant as in the field of education.  In many instances, women represent over 50 per cent of the student population and this must be reflected in the control and management of colleges.  We cannot and must not exclude, either intentionally or through neglect, one gender from the college governing bodies.  To do so would be to limit the range of experience available to such bodies in their service of the college student population and society generally.  It is <Col N="1518" /> worth pointing out that the Government's gender quota applies in reverse. This is relevant in education where the participation of men in the teaching profession is less than 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>The practical implementation of the Bill will cause some difficulty.  No doubt some people's life long membership of an regional technical college will be endangered but I see this more as a reason to proceed with the Bill rather than to hold back from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Joint Declaration of 15 December 1993 is an intergovernmental agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom which sets out a balanced context for the achievement of a lasting peace with justice in Ireland.  As such, the Joint Declaration is a charter for peace and reconciliation.</P>
      <P>In the declaration I set out the intent of the Irish Government, in the event of a total cessation of paramilitary violence, to make arrangements within this jurisdiction to enable democratic parties to consult together and share in dialogue about the political future.  These arrangements include a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to be set up on foot of consultations with democratic parties, North and South, to make recommendations on ways in which agreement and trust between both traditions in Ireland can be promoted and established.</P>
      <P>In my statement in this House on 31 August, following on the IRA announcement of a total cessation of violence with effect from 1 September, I indicated that I proposed shortly to initiate bilateral discussions with all interested parties on the establishment of the forum.  Pursuant to that indication, there has been a round of consultative meetings at both political and official level on the issues of principle and of practical operation arising from the forum.</P>
      <P>Some parties suggested that there be a roundtable discussion on plans for the forum, but I have responded that this exploratory round of consultations will remain on a bilateral basis.  This is in line with what I indicated here on 31 August.  I hope that a further round of consultations with all the party leaders involved will expedite matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> In the course of the consultations to date, I circulated an initial draft of terms of reference for the forum to serve as the basis for consultation.  A number of written submissions were received in response from parties.  The draft terms of reference have been amended in some respects in response to the views received and in preparation for a further round of consultations.</P>
    <P>I have set out my vision of the forum as a consultative and advisory body which will examine ways in which lasting peace, stability and reconciliation can be established by agreement among all the people of Ireland.  While the forum itself will not be a body to carry on negotiations, I hope that its work will contribute positively to the climate in which negotiations take place, and that many of the recommendations made at the forum can be translated into practice.  In all my statements.  I have stressed its &ldquo;broad church&rdquo; nature &mdash; the fact that it is open to democratically mandated parties in Ireland which abide exclusively by the democratic process.</P>
    <P>I was and remain concerned that the major traditions in this island should participate in the forum.  For that reason, in addition to the general standing invitation to participat, I wrote specifically to the leaders of the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party and the Popular Unionist Party on 9 September urging them to take part in this process of healing old animosities and of building up trust.  The same message is being sent through any informal contacts or channels available to us.  Deputies will be aware, moreover, that there is a standing invitation to Unionist leaders to meet myself, the Tánaiste or any other members of the Government, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Because the forum is intended to consolidate and move forward the peace process, it is important that all Northern parties participating are accorded favourable treatment in terms of representation.  This is in accordance with the practice followed at the New Ireland Forum.  I have also made clear that participation in the forum will be entirely <Col N="1522" /> without prejudice to the position on constitutional issues held by any party.</P>
    <P>While the response on the forum to date from the Unionist tradition has not been a very positive one, neither has it been uniformly negative, at least at individual level, and I am hopeful that, as the peace lasts &mdash; and I expect an early cessation of all loyalist violence &mdash; and the forum demonstrates its potential for fruitful dialogue, we may in time see a contribution to the forum from the Unionist tradition.  I would certainly welcome, encourage and facilitate any such development.</P>
    <P>I am favourably disposed to organising the forum and its work in such a way that would facilitate such contributions, whether from political parties, churches, community groups, trade unions, business and vocational bodies etc.  It is likely that the forum will seek submissions and invite presentations but other formulae, such as the possibility of observer status, are also under consideration by the Government.  It is fully in accordance with the purpose and role of the forum that it should be both socially and politically inclusive in nature.</P>
    <P>I hope to see the forum operational within the next month.  Its organisation and mechanisms have yet to be finalised &mdash; as I have already said, I envisage further consultations on this and other matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Taoiseach's invitation to the Unionists will be accepted.  In the event of non-acceptance by them I have some reservations about the effectiveness of the forum.  If the Unionists decide not to participate in the forum, what does the Taoiseach expect it to achieve, particularly having regard to the peace process which hopefully will continue and a possible loyalist ceasefire?  In the absence of participation by the Unionists, is there a danger that the establishment of a forum might be counter-productive?  I raise these questions for genuine reasons and I am open to be convinced about the success of the forum.  Has the <Col N="1523" /> Taoiseach considered that the forum might not achieve the goals to which he has referred in the absence of participation by the Unionists?  Will the Taoiseach spell out first, what he hopes the forum will achieve and, second and very significantly, how he expects the forum to input into and interlink with the talks process?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the large number of questions tabled to the Taoiseach let us have brevity.  I am anxious to facilitate all Members involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far I have received a response from Mr. James Molyneaux, the leader of the Official Unionist Party who, in his courteous reply, said his party would not be participating.  As yet I have not had a response from the others.  The situation may change when, hopefully, we get an early cessation of loyalist violence &mdash; I do not know &mdash; but, as far as the Government is concerned, we would welcome any involvement on the part of any of those parties. Of course, the Alliance Party has already clearly indicated that it will participate.  Some others may; I do not know, but that is the present postion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to what the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will do, I set out clearly my vision of the forum being a consultative and advisory body which will examine ways in which lasting peace, stability and reconciliation can be established, by agreement, among all the people of Ireland.  Indeed its title &mdash; the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation &mdash; spells out precisely its objectives, that is to identify hurdles and obstacles that get in the way of endeavouring to unite the hearts and minds of the two communities in the North after 25 years of violence.  It will take some time to build up trust and confidence between them again.  Therefore, the Forum for Peace <Col N="1524" /> and Reconciliation affords an opportunity to identify areas which can be tackled to render it easier for the two communities there to begin to live together in a normal way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions arise from the Taoiseach's replies so far.  In relation to the reply from Mr. James Molyneaux of the Official Unionist Party, would the Taoiseach say whether Mr. Molyneaux indicated that his refusal to participate was at this time, whether it is Mr. Molyneaux's view that the door is open, to some extent, or is not completely closed to their participation at some point in the future?  My understanding is that the Official Unionist Party has not given a categorical refusal to participate in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Second, when the Taoiseach says that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will be an advisory body, will he say to whom it will offer advice; for example, will it be to the Government, to the three-stranded talks process which hopefully will get under way quite soon or to whom?  To whom will that advice be offered given that it is a body being established by the Irish Government?</P>
      <P>On the request of the leaders of the Opposition parties in this House to the Taoiseach, that he meet us and officials of our three parties jointly in order to expedite consideration of our concerns and proposals on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, will be reconsider that request, particularly bearing in mind that not all of his consultations to date have been on a purely bilateral basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand the reason the Taoiseach is refusing this very reasonable request by the <Col N="1525" /> leaders of the Opposition parties in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to further consultations with political parties, I should say I set out to achieve the maximum amount of consensus in this regard.  The only reason the Government and I do not consider it appropriate to meet everybody together is that we must be extremely careful to avoid the label of everybody in the South coming together to arrange the agenda, set the terms of reference and all of that, in circumstances when the Northern parties have been met individually, were quite happy to have been met individually and put their case on an individual basis.  Consequently, they might expect us to deal with this in like manner.</P>
      <P>In the interests of uniformity, none of us should in any way present a wrong image of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation before it begins.  It is in that light that we believe the consultations which have begun on an individual basis should continue on an individual basis.  I should add that full consideration is being given to all of the points made.  At the end of the day the Government will have to decide.  We will be seeking the largest possible consensus but, again, we must go ahead with the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked to whom will the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation report.  The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will be set up by the Government and, of course, will be reporting to the Government and proffering any advice it has to offer.  In the course of the forum discussions and consultations one would expect that people with different views and from different parties would participate, hopefully resulting in the widest input of views from the parties and helping to get people to understand each others point of view.  The objective is to establish peace and reconciliation on this island.  That is the position as I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the response I received <Col N="1526" /> from Mr. James Molyneaux, I should say that the words suggested by Deputy De Rossa have not been used.  One would hope that, as the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation develops, the Unionist party, and others, if not participating at the beginning, might consider participating at some stage along the way.  I think that would be the hope of everybody in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive replies.  Will he comment on three points I want to raise?  First, is it the intention of the Government that the democratic parties participating in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation would be represented proportionate to their electoral strength, or does he envisage representation being weighted in favour of the smaller parties in terms of electoral strength, particularly weighted in favour of Sinn Féin?</P>
      <P>Second, would the Taoiseach comment on the type of person he would consider suitable to chair the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and say whether he will be acting unilaterally in appointing a chairman or whether the chairman will be put in place by agreement with the leaders of the other parties who have signalled their intention to participate?</P>
      <P>Third, when the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation gets under way does the Taoiseach envisage it being a body with a particular programme on which it will embark and complete, or does he perceive it as a kind of permanent standing committee which would act as a sounding board for proposals put forward at talks elsewhere until, eventually and hopefully, an agreed solution to the problems on this island are arrived at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not set any time limit on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  Our view is that it will continue to be in existence as long as necessary.  This is an evolving process in which we are all becoming involved; things are changing and changing fast. We are delighted to see those changes <Col N="1527" /> taking place.  Therefore, we are not imposing a time limit.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the chairman of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, as has happened to date, we will be exchanging views on possible chairmen of that body.  We have not yet arrived at any decision; there will be more consultations in relation to that matter.  We are seeking the proper person to undertake the task.  Whether such proposal emanates from an Opposition party or anybody else, if we can all agree, or get as close to agreement as we can, that will be fine; that is our objective.</P>
      <P>In relation to the weighting of parties proportionate to their electoral strength, I said in my reply that, in the case of the last forum, there was weighting in favour of the Northern parties.  I said it is the Government's intention to continue that weighting process in favour of the Northern parties.  Therefore, there will be disproportionate representation on the part of the Northern parties, all of them, as against the weighting of parties down here.  We must also bear in mind that there are Independents here, Independent Senators and so on. Proposals have been put forward by Democratic Left and The Workers' Party have made their views known, as have others.  If I am reading everybody correctly I do not think we should adhere rigidly to our absolute representation here.  If we are interested in obtaining the greatest number of contributions representing the widest possible variety of views, for example, if one considers the Green Party representation, we will see that we cannot have partial representation.  We will endeavour to obtain the widest possible representation of views rather than adhere rigidly to party representation based on the proportion of their electoral vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government accepted the Fine Gael proposal that parties participating in the forum would pledge themselves exclusively to use non-violent methods for all purposes? The current terms of reference for the <Col N="1528" /> forum require them only to pledge themselves not to use violence to promote the ideal of national self-determination but do not exclude the use of violence for other purposes and would not, apparently, exclude punishment beatings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to deal with the suggestions made by every party.  This is the idea of having discussions with all the individual parties.

      <P>Is this forum a matter of public business and, if so, why is the Taoiseach unwilling to answer questions about it openly in the Dáil?

I note that has not been done in this case.  Will the Taoiseach participate in the forum as a member, as his predecessor did, in the New Ireland Forum?  In reference to Question No. 7 will he explain why invitations to some parties to the forum, including meetings with them, were issued prior to other parties even being sent an invitation?  Why was a distinction made between parties on the island of Ireland in this matter?</P>

      <P>I do not know to whom the Deputy is referring.  If he is referring to the written invitation to the Unionist party I can tell him that the same open invitation went out to everybody.  Some people expressed the view that we should follow it up by issuing letters to those parties.  I have done that and I have no hesitation in saying that. The Alliance Party and many other parties responded to the open invitation. There is nothing new about that.  Some people expressed the view that if the Unionists got a personal letter from me it might be better.  All I want to do is to get the maximum number of people at the forum.  There is no need for bickering as to when I sent out the terms of reference.  Everybody will receive a copy of progress to date before the next meeting with them.  That should be sufficient.</P>

I made one simple suggestion to the Taoiseach that the terms of reference must be in accordance with the principles of the Downing Street Declaration, which was not in the draft terms of reference I received.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the terms of reference will be in accordance with the principles of the Dowing Street Declaration?

What I have said is that I am seeking the widest possible variety of views and contributions to be made to the forum.  Any suspicion raised can cause grave suspicions in the minds of people from Northern Ireland.  We should look at their position and at what we are trying to do in this forum and see how we can get the best contribution from everybody.  If we start on a basis of narrow political views then this forum will not succeed.  I want to see everybody taking full account of the views of others.  I have never laid down, as a condition for entering the forum, that full acceptance of every single word in the Downing Street Joint Declaration was necessary from any party point of view.  I have made that clear at all times and the question is unnecessary.  In relation to how the Government will be represented, it will be a matter for the two Government parties to decide their personnel at the end of the day.  All <Col N="1531" /> those questions will be answered for the Opposition parties in the discussions we hope to have.  That is a better exchange of views.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that everything possible must be done to prevent the impression being given that this forum is to be a pan Nationalist front?  If any weight is to be given to minority parties &mdash; I agree with what has been suggested &mdash; in the absence of any other Unionist party consideration should be given to increasing the membership of the Alliance Party in the forum.  Second, I believe the main reason for the forum was to bring Sinn Féin in from the political cold and on that basis I welcome it.  In terms of the wider job the forum has to do how does it differ from the previous New Ireland Forum?  Third, will the Taoiseach confirm that it will be made clear to all that the forum is not to be a forum for renegotiating the Downing Street Declaration, as some people believe? Finally, will the Taoiseach make it clear that the forum will not be a basis for renegotiating what is meant by &ldquo;consent&rdquo; which means the ability to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; as well as the ability to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm whether participation in the forum requires acceptance, at least, of paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Joint Declaration, which is the paragraph that comes before the announcement of the Government's intention to establish the forum.  It says that parties participating in the process must permanently end support for paramilitary violence.  Is the use of the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; in respect of an end to support for the use of violence a condition for eligibility to participate in the forum?  Is that portion of the Downing Street Joint Declaration applicable?</P>

      <P>I have to repeat myself again.  I did not say a condition for participation in the forum involved full acceptance of the Downing Street Joint Declaration.  I said a permanent <Col N="1533" /> end to violence is required, a decision to end the violence that has been part and parcel of life in Northern Ireland for the past 25 years and that is still my view.  It is now six weeks since that decision was made.</P>
      <P>I thought the twists and turns made on the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; in another House of Parliament might not find their way in here. At least we all accept that the ceasefire is for good and we should not portray it otherwise.  We want to get the loyalist paramilitaries to believe that also.  They have said in public on many occasions that if IRA violence ceased, they would cease violence.  We are all looking forward to that time which, I hope, is not far away.</P>

      <P>It is too simplistic a reading of the Sinn Féin-IRA position to say the IRA has accepted the principle of consent we have accepted. It has added phrases and conditions such as &ldquo;without British interference&rdquo; which clearly means the withdrawal of Britain from Ireland.  In addition, it says there can be no veto which clearly means that, while it is prepared to accept consent from Unionists in Northern Ireland to some form of federal <Col N="1534" /> Ireland, it is not prepared to accept a denial of the right of the majority on this island to decide otherwise.  Bearing that in mind, is the Taoiseach satisfied while there is that difference in the interpretation of consent that Sinn Féin-IRA is absolutely committed to maintaining the ceasefire and ending its military operations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I refer Members to the statement issued following my first meeting with Gerry Adams in the presence of John Hume which states that the problem cannot be solved without the involvement and agreement of the Unionist people.  That is simple, straightforward and clear English.

      <P>I want to clarify the position of Sinn Féin in relation to the forum.  The Taoiseach stated there would be a favourable waiting period from the point of view of representation for Northern parties.  In that context, does Sinn Féin qualify as a Northern or Republican party?  Will a favourable waiting period apply from the point of view of representation for Sinn Féin in terms of its electoral strength?  What role does the Taoiseach envisage for Sinn Féin in the forum?  What is the status of official Irish Government contacts with Sinn Féin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The status is similar to the status of contacts with other parties who have indicated they will participate in the forum.  I thought all parties would like to see Sinn Féin involved in the forum so that we might consolidate the peace process.  As Deputy Currie stated, it is a means of bringing people into the political and democratic process to find a solution to a centuries old problem here.  People should not try to place barricades along the way.  We want to talk this matter through and we are committed to finding a solution by peaceful means.  We should not try to nit pick along the way.  I thank Deputy De Rossa for the report which he has submitted to me.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In this remarks about the forum, the Taoiseach talked about the democratic parties on this island being represented.  Does he see merit in the suggestion that an invitation should be extended to the political parties in the United Kingdom to make a submission at the forum?  If he considers that an unwieldly mechanism, would he at least consider inviting representatives of the UK parties on the Parliamentary tier of the British-Irish Association to attend as observers and to make submissions if necessary?</P>

One only has to reflect on the decision by Belfast City Council not to agree to hold a civic reception for the Down team to realise how far we have to go.  We all know it would be desirable if the Unionists participated in the forum.  The reconciliation must be between Nationalists and Unionists and if the Unionists are not represented genuine reconciliation will not be possible.  Will the Taoiseach agree there will not be much hope of getting the Unionists to participate if the question of consent is open to debate?  On reading the terms of reference of the forum and hearing the Taoiseach's response today, I am concerned that Sinn Féin is being brought into the forum under the illusion that it will be able to renegotiate the issue of consent. That issue is not only fundamental to the Unionist parties but to the majority of parties in this House.

Will he agree that there is at least a possibility that Sinn Féin would seize on that apparant difference in an attempt to renegotiate the Downing Street Joint Declaration at the forum?  Since it would appear that the forum would not be concerned only with political matters but with social and economic ones, is there not a case for representation on it by officials from the European Union and the United States, which both have given and promised strong economic support to an evolving new Ireland?</P>

I must have said three or four times this afternoon that the consent principle is paramount and the Downing Street Joint Declaration is not open to renegotiation.  Full use should be made of the forum to bring people together and we want to involve as many as possible, whether on the basis of full membership, alternate representation, observer status, making presentations or whatever.

      <P>There have been four plenary meetings of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The committee is assisted in its work of reviewing and monitoring progress in implementing the programme by a secretariat group representative of relevant Government Departments and the social partners.  The secretariat group has also met on four occasions.</P>
      <P>The committee has discussed many issues arising out of the programme and also matters of concern to the social partners.  The issues of the economy, employment and unemployment, particularly long term unemployment, have been of central concern to the committee, which discussed them at their last meeting of the committee on 29 September in the context of the improved economic outlook.  The committee agreed to explore the potential for making updated recommendations to Government as envisaged in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> for consideration in the context of the 1995 budget.  The Government looks forward to the receipt of these recommendations which we will consider very carefully.</P>
      <P>The procedure now being adopted by the committee marks a further deepening of the partnership process in support of the shared objectives for growth and employment.  I would like to compliment all of the social partners for their contributions to this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to employment prospects, the indicators both direct and indirect for 1994 support the view that employment will grow strongly in 1994.  The estimates for employment creation over the year continue to improve and the Government, along with independent forecasters, is now expecting about 28,000 new jobs to be created this year compared to predictions of 21,000 at the time of publication of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> This is reflected in the fact that the numbers on the register now stand at some 20,000 lower than at the beginning of 1994.  The <Col N="1542" /> Government expects that as employment continues to grow so unemployment will continue to decline.  We are, however, in no way complacent and look forward to the updated recommendations from the Central Review Committee, to which I have referred, as an important contribution to action to intensify the improvement in employment and unemployment we have seen this year.</P>

      <P>The report of the National Economic and Social Forum was studied carefully by the Government and it decided that a group should be set up to co-ordinate all the efforts and consider how the resources being spent in this area could be improved to ensure better results.  That group is reporting to the Office of the Tánaiste on that matter.  It will be working in tandem with the Central Review Committee and the partnership companies. They cover many areas but not all. There is plenty of scope for pilot schemes to be considered based on the ideas put forward by the National Economic and Social Forum on long term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Long-term unemployment is the hardest nut of all to crack and we are not sparing in our efforts to tackle it in a variety of ways.  We have done that since the Government came into office. We set up partnership companies and new innovations in relation to the holding of allowances to see what effect that would have on long term unemployment, and it has had the desired effect. We have broadened that since its introduction.  I recently met the partnership companies of the south and north inner cities.  With experience behind them <Col N="1543" /> they have come forward with new suggestions about where the Government could play a greater role on the macro level &mdash; they can manage things at the micro level.  It is interesting to hear what actions they are now looking for on the part of Government.</P>
    <P>On the countrywide application, apart from the partnership areas, the county enterprise boards are proving successful in most counties and are doing extremely well in some with the result that we have to provide more resources between now and the end of the year because the allocations already given have been taken up.  That is a good sign of movement in that regard. The approach is one of a combination of initiatives and effort not alone by State agencies but by Government.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the number of jobs created as being 28,000 and said he expected that as jobs were created the unemployment figures would fall.  My understanding is that unless three times that number of jobs are created the figures cannot fall unless there is also an increase in emigration.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?  Also, to what extent are the 28,000 jobs that he refers to part time or full time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that employment figures cannot fall unless there is emigration.  The requirement for jobs in the economy is between 20,000 and 25,000 and the projection for this year is over 28,000.  That is improving as we go along and is much better than anybody expected last January.  It will take time to get unemployment figures down to acceptable levels.  This problem is getting full attention at Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union has its own policies at macro level to generate the European economies.  They will all have an effect on what happens here because 70 per cent of what we produce has to be sold abroad.  The better the performance of the European economies &mdash; and <Col N="1544" /> they are performing successfully now, including the British, German and French economies &mdash; the better the performance of the Irish economy which, at 5.5 per cent expected growth this year, is far above the performance of the others.  The more foreign markets grow the more will Irish exporters be in a position to take advantage of them and consequently create more jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the structure of the tax system, and in particular PRSI, is the biggest remaining obstacle to maximisation of job potential in this economy and that this is confirmed in the EU white paper on competitiveness?  Will the Taoiseach agree to ask the Central Review Committee to conduct a study on the long term effect of high levels of PRSI on the employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The biggest obstacle to the growth in employment relates to demand for goods and services where real sustainable jobs are created, as Deputy Bruton knows too well.  How often has he told us that in this House and elsewhere?  We have to stimulate demand, and demand is stimulated when world trade grows.  That is beginning to happen.  As to the cost of employment here, I do not accept that we are not competitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> our European partners.  I hear this argument made continuously in this House.  If people examined the figures and looked at the social cost of employment in Ireland and elsewhere they would find that it is not as Deputy Bruton and others pretend.</P>

      <P>On the Taoiseach's remark that additional resources will have to be supplied to the county enterprise boards before the end of the year, has it been decided to make additional resources available?  A county enterprise board of which I am a member has 48 projects of which only four can be financed because the limit of £500,000 will be reached later this month.  Will the Taoiseach comment on <Col N="1545" /> allocating a budget of £500,000 to each county enterprise board irrespective of the needs of that area, population size etc?  Would he agree that the question of allocating £0.5 million to a county with over 0.25 million people as compared with a county with 30,000 people needs to be looked at?</P>

Will the Taoiseach confirm that the funding for the county enterprise boards was halved this year to £9 million compared with £21 million last year and that is why they are running out of funds?  Will he confirm that 48 per cent of the cost of employment in this economy goes to the Government in taxes, levies and PRSI and that this is the single biggest disincentive to employment?  Does he agree with the comment by Dr. Donal de Buitléar, former Secretary of the Commission on Taxation, that we need to create 70,000 jobs each year until the end of the century and not the 25,000 jobs that the Taoiseach seems happy with?  Lastly, did the Taoiseach learn anything about successful tax reform on his recent visit to New Zealand?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it a bad idea?  As to the point raised by Deputy Harney, the 25,000 jobs I referred to is to look after the numbers coming on to the labour market every year.  We need more than that to make a serious dent in unemployment.  I do not accept that the social costs of employment are the big deterrent to job creation.  As Minister for Finance, I tested this argument when I made it possible for people to take on employees without incurring additional social costs.  We had pilot schemes and we know what the results were.  Certainly there is a contribution to be made in that area and I have never denied that, but I do not accept that it is a panacea for the problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>In regard to the county enterprise boards, it will take a couple of years for them to level out at their annual requirement.  Deputy Harney would agree that to try to project what they might require is difficult.  Projects in county enterprise boards will not be left without finance.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment puts out its best judgement on what budgets might be required.  It may be too much for some and too little for others, but after a year or so it will be quite clear how they will level out.  I can assure the House that no project held up at county enterprise board level will be left without funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider the survey on social costs where he says an experiment was undertaken?  Is he aware that what he is talking about was a temporary reduction in PRSI for people who took on extra employees?  Would he not agree that the problem is that when an employer talks about taking somebody on he is taking him on for, perhaps, a lifetime of <Col N="1547" /> up to 40 years and that a short term 18-month reduction in PRSI does not significantly improve the economies of that proposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We tested the market. Sustainable jobs are put in place when there is a demand for a product or service.  It does not matter that there is no social cost if one does not have a buyer for the product or the end product is not competitive enough.  Those are the things that matter.  It is incorrect to suggest this is not a competitive economy considering that during a deep recession we increased our exports and share of decreasing markets, the greatest test of competitiveness in any economy.  I look forward to a very sizeable increase in exports now that world trade is beginning to increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that an employer who experiences an increase in demand for a product has two ways to fulfil that demand: by employing more people or by intensifying capital investment in the firm. Since people receive subsidies for capital investment and pay taxes on employing workers, they are more likely to increase production by capital investment than by increased labour input. An equalisation in the tax treatment of capital investment, which is subsidised, as against employing people, who are taxed, needs to be considered if we are to maximise the employment input as a result of an increase in output.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated he is on the point of solving the unemployment problem this year but perhaps he will forgive me if I am sceptical, given the level of unemployment in my area.  To what extent are the 28,000 jobs to which he referred part-time?  Are many permanent full-time jobs which are lost to the economy being replaced by part-time, in many cases low paid, jobs?  Will the Taoiseach indicate the extent of emigration this year?  He gave a figure of 25,000 new jobs required each year and said that 28,000 jobs were created this year, but he did not give a figure for the number of jobs lost.  He claimed there is a reduction of 20,000 on the unemployment register but those figures do not add up.  Where are the lost jobs?</P>

Is the Taoiseach aware that an ESRI study of employers showed the largest proportion found that high levels of tax in the Irish economy is the greatest disincentive to employment and 35 per cent said they would sacrifice grant aid in lieu of tax changes?</P>

Deputy Bruton did not <Col N="1549" /> understand what I meant by a shift in policy in that regard but that is what I meant.  There is a reduction in the level of grants paid and a totally different policy approach is being taken by Forbairt and the IDA in this regard.  It is desirable that taxes are as low as possible but social costs are imposed for a purpose: they are used to remunerate workers who pay into this fund and have to get money out of it.  There is a continuous barrage by employers seeking cheaper social costs, but somebody has to fund the benefits to employees. Let us put this in perspective and look at the overall picture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 103, 146, 158, 226, 230 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies will appreciate that waste disposal in the health services in a manner that is safe, efficient, environmentally friendly and cost-effective has become a very difficult problem to resolve.  I am, therefore, very glad to inform the House that considerable progress is being made in tackling this problem, although there are still many difficulties to be overcome, not least in the technical field.  We are now breaking new grounds in the proposals which I am about to outline and continuing vigilance will have to be exercised by everyone involved to ensure that the anticipated satisfactory results are achieved.</P>
      <P>The approach of my Department to solving the problem of disposal of health care waste is one which has four stages: putting in place an environmentally conscious health care waste policy; examination of the technical and organisational options for the treatment and final disposal of health care waste; preparation of a strategic plan for an integrated system for the treatment and final disposal of health care risk waste on a nationwide basis and implementation, following consultations, of the strategic plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first stage has been completed and the policy document has been issued to health agencies.  The policy promotes good waste management <Col N="1552" /> practices including prevention, reduction and segregation as well as the preparation of waste management plans by each hospital.  My Department has carried out studies of best practices in management of health care waste in European hospitals and of final disposal methods used both in Europe and the United States.  A trial of one of the new disposal methods was carried out recently at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>Following these studies and trial, a strategic plan for an integrated system for the treatment and final disposal of health care risk waste has been circulated to the health agencies.  The plan proposes four central treatment facilities nationally, two in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway, utilising one or more of the new technologies.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the plan, which will take place as soon as possible following the necessary consultations, implies phasing out of the existing old hospital incinerators such as those at St. Finbarr's Hospital and Cork Regional Hospital.  Pending the installation of the new technology in Cork, the Southern Health Board is seeking to make alternative arrangements as quickly as possible to enable it to shut down the incinerator at St. Finbarr's Hospital.</P>
    <P>I have had inquiries made of the Southern Health Board into the storage of radioactive waste at St. Finbarr's Hospital.  Low level radioactive waste is produced as a by-product of diagnostic tests in modern medical practice.  Stringent controls are in place, monitored by the legislative authority, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; RPII &mdash; to ensure safe handling and disposal of the waste.  The waste is stored in concrete compartments at St. Finbarr's Hospital, in full compliance with RPII standards.  The RPII was recently requested to inspect the site at St. Finbarr's Hospital and has confirmed that it is satisfied there is no risk to the public from the storage of waste material at the hospital.</P>
    <P>With regard to Beaumont Hospital, the incinerator there has not operated for some years.  The clinical waste from <Col N="1553" /> the hospital is segregated into infectious and non-infectious components, the former being incinerated off site by private contractors and the latter being sent for deep burial at a local authority landfill site.</P>
    <P>There is no waste, radioactive or other, being incinerated on site at Beaumont Hospital at present and there are no plans to do so.  A recent trial at Beaumont Hospital of one of the alternative disposal methods, the microwave method, gave valuable information as an input to the strategic plan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 46, 84, 88, 111, 115, 149, 231 and 240 together.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board, that the number of persons who have been screened for hepatitis C under the national blood screening programme is 55,212 as at 10 October 1994.  The number who have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies as at 10 October 1994 is 1,013; 438 of these women are positive for the hepatitis C virus.</P>
      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board has advised me that as at 10 October 1994, 1,222 children and 346 partners have been screened for hepatitis C. Up to 10 October 1994, ten children and three partners have tested positive for the hepatitis C antibodies.  Two of these children have tested positive for the hepatitis C virus.  Further investigations are underway in all these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive counselling programme involving medical consultants at the Blood Transfusion Service Board and general practitioners throughout the country was put in place by the Blood Transfusion Service Board for persons who received the Anti D product at the outset.  Persons who tested positive for hepatitis C under the national blood screening programme <Col N="1557" /> were invited to Blood Transfusion Service Board consultations which took place in Dublin, Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  To support the Blood Transfusion Service Board counselling services, a counselling programme was also structured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board with the Well Woman Centre in Dublin.  Large group information meetings on hepatitis C were also held in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Tralee, Limerick, Galway, Castlebar, Sligo, Monaghan, Mullingar and Donegal.  Counselling in small groups, up to 20, is also being undertaken by the Blood Tranfusion Service Board.  Individual psychological support is also available where this is considered necessary.</P>
    <P>A limited <i>ex gratia</i> expenses scheme is being operated by the Blood Transfusion Service Board to ensure that all Anti D recipients are in a position to avail of the screening, counselling and treatment services.</P>
    <P>Treatment for those who test positive for hepatitis C is being provided at the following six designated hospitals: St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; Mater Hospital, Dublin; St. James's Hospital, Dublin; Cork Regional Hospital; University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
    <P>A total of 421 women have undergone a liver biopsy.  The hospitals do not have the patients' biopsy results broken down into the specific categories.  The number of women who have been prescribed interferon is 27.  I am not aware of any child or partner for whom treatment has been prescribed.  I have been advised by the hospitals that the treatment being provided is being monitored and that the outcome of the treatment will be assessed in due course.</P>
    <P>Treatment, including prescribed medication, is being provided by the public hospital service free of charge. As already announced in May last the VHI is providing cover towards the costs of private hospital accommodation and consultants' charges for members who test positive for hepatitis C arising <Col N="1558" /> from the national blood screening programme.</P>
    <P>I have met with a deputation from Positive Action on two occasions and I have approved a grant of £5,000 from the Health allocation of national lottery funds which has issued to Positive Action.  The funding required to support the services put in place for those who have tested positive for hepatitis C is being met by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>No consideration has yet been given to the question of compensation.  I am awaiting the report of the expert group which I established in March last.</P>
    <P>The services put in place for persons who have tested positive for hepatitis C under the national blood screening programme will be available for as long as they are required.  The needs of those who have been diagnosed as positive for hepatitis C will be monitored and reassessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the necessary support services are provided to meet their needs.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree, in view of the fact that several months have passed since this problem was first detected, that the information made available to the women concerned has not been as extensive as it should be and has been slow in coming?  Is it not a sad reflection on the information services that these women had to invite an international expert to advise them at a seminar in this country?  Does the Minister agree that much of the information they were able to elicit from this expert contrasted starkly with some of the information provided by his own Department?</P>

      <P>Most independent observers have been complimentary in terms of our efficiency in screening in excess of 55,000 women under the programme in the timeframe I have outlined and in some cases triple screening <Col N="1559" /> not only for the antibodies but also for the virus.  A comprehensive national screening programme, a comprehensive counselling service and a treatment programme have been put in place.  I supported the establishment of Positive Action as a support group for those who have tested positive for the hepatitis C virus.  As these people are in need of support and counselling I met Positive Action on two occasions and have provided it with an allocation from national lottery funds to meet its day-to-day expenses such as telephone costs and postage.  I have established clear lines of communication so that the knowledge available to me will be available to it.  It is understood by everybody that problems will arise.  I am trying to ensure that the best possible service will be available to the women concerned and their families who have discovered they have the virus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure you, Sir, that I did not waste too much time asking questions.  The Minister took ten minutes to reply to them.  It may be acceptable that in the long run screening was carried out efficiently but will the Minister accept that afterwards the degree of support and information made available to the women was deplorable?  Positive Action was given a grant of £5,000 but surely the Minister should have evaluated the level of expense incurred by them, and in line with previous commitments given on the costs associated with the problem would he not have found it in his heart to give them more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of out-of-pocket expenses, the Minister's view is vastly different from those who have been affected by hepatitis C.  He might <Col N="1560" /> address the question of Interferon treatment.  It was clearly indicated by international experts that Interferon is not the solution in a specific number of cases but this information was not made available by the Department of Health or the Blood Transfusion Service Board until experts arrived on the scene.</P>

      <P>I made it clear all along that there is no definitive view on the treatment of people who have developed serious liver problems.  I can quote a number of experts.

I understand that others can call in any experts they like but I will give the House the information available to me from the best national and international experts.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for ensuring the suitability of persons working with children in residential care centres is primarily a matter for the employing authority of the centre concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in view of recent allegations of child sexual abuse in certain residential child care centres, I am taking steps to ensure greater vigilance in the selection of staff in these centres.  A <Col N="1561" /> working group which includes representatives of my Department, health boards, Residential Managers' Association, Conference of Religious of Ireland and the Irish Association of Care Workers is reviewing the guidelines on recruitment of child care workers which were first issued by my Department in 1979.  As part of this process, agreement has recently been reached with the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána to introduce a formal system of Garda clearance for applicants for posts in the children's residential centres.</P>
    <P>While this system will be an important useful addition to the selection procedures, it cannot, of itself, be a guarantee that unsuitable persons are prevented from working in residential child care.  I urge all concerned with the recruitment of staff to be constantly vigilant in all aspects of the selection procedures to ensure the safety and protection of children in residential care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <P>When does the Minister intend to publish the report on the allegations of sexual abuse in Madonna House given that it is in the public interest to do so and that former employees of Madonna House are living under a cloud of suspicion in terms of their future employment prospects?</P>
      <P>As foster care is now used in the main to accommodate children who formerly would have been placed in residential care will the Minister explain why 80 per cent of the current stock of foster parents &mdash; as indicated in a recent report &mdash; have never attended a review of the children in their care?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>These are two separate issues.  I have not yet received a report on Madonna House.  I am anxious, in accordance with any report that has come to my attention since I became Minister for Health, to make it as public as possible.  Obviously I will have to look at the contents of the report to ensure that it does not reflect on individuals against whom allegations were made but not proceeded with by the <Col N="1562" /> Director of Public Prosecutions as well as to ensure confidentiality &mdash; which is paramount &mdash; in the cases of the children concerned.  With those caveats I am anxious that the core of the report, including the recommendations, will be a public document.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the report on fostering the Deputy mentioned.  The Department of Health requires some form of training for all foster parents and any gaps in the procedures in a certain health board area have been examined on foot of those findings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will offer if nobody is offering.  I welcome the opportunity to speak and I will focus on the development of regional technical colleges.  I see I am speaking to the converted as my colleague from Waterford, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry Deputy O'Shea is present.  I am sure he has no argument with the case we are putting forward for the regional college in Waterford.  It is a pity the Minister for Education is not here.</P>
      <P>The Minister's efforts to achieve gender balance are laudable and we would all like to see it achieved, particularly in the area of education because there is a balance of male and females in the delivery of education.  A problem with the vocational education committees which highlights a more fundamental problem is that there are not female members on boards to meet the Minister's criteria of appointing two females to the board of governors of the regional technical colleges.  This was certainly the case in the vocational education committee in Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the bodies requested by the vocational education committees to put forward nominees, one would hope that female nominees would be put forward by many of these institutes. That did not happen in the past and it highlights the more fundamental issue <Col N="1679" /> of the number of women who are active, in the broadest sense in public life and makes it difficult to achieve the Minister's target.  This legislation is probably the first stage in getting the structures correct within the governing bodies.</P>
    <P>I wish to sound a note of caution at this stage.  While in principle everybody agrees that gender balancing is necessary, it is difficult to enforce.  I am concerned that some of the women who may be appointed as governors of the various colleges might be seen to be in those positions simply because they are female and filling a necessary quota and not for the true reason which is to make a substantial contribution to the development of the colleges they represent.</P>
    <P>In regard to the make up of the governing bodies, the development of the regional colleges has had a significant impact in third level education but, more important, is making a substantial contribution to the economic well-being of the colleges.  The increased availability of courses in the colleges has enhanced the opportunities for students from different backgrounds to qualify in subjects that, perhaps, were not easily available in the past.  This has resulted in a big increase in the number of students wanting to attend regional colleges.  The Waterford Regional Technical College had the highest number of applicants of any third level institution, including universities.  Between 28,000 and 29,000 applications to attend the college were received, a clear indication of the quality of the courses being offered there.</P>
    <P>The boards of governors of the regional colleges must be competent to make a contribution to the development of the colleges.  The Minister should allow the colleges to organise what could be termed &ldquo;search committees.&rdquo; similar to those in the universities and polytechnics in the UK.  The latter were set up to seek out business people interested in establishing direct links with the colleges.  Regional colleges should develop such links.  They must <Col N="1680" /> have the credibility and the ability to appoint to their boards of governors people who are of a standing nationally and internationally to direct the driving forces in the colleges.</P>
    <P>That is not covered in the Bill.  In the near future the Minister will have to cater for such links by way of further legislation because the world of commerce, as rightly identified in the Minister's statement, must have links with the colleges.  The best way to develop those links is to allow the colleges appoint the appropriate people to their boards of governors.  I ask the Minister to consider that suggestion.  If search committees were established and identified suitable people, either male or female, for appointment to the boards of governors, they could be recommended to the Minister.  For that reason the Minister must maintain direct control.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to Waterford Regional Technical College.  I do not intend making the arguments that have been made in regard to the inequity in the distribution of resources.  It is clear that the south east suffers as a result.  Nobody could fail to realise that there is substantial inequity in the distribution of resources and that is a stark fact in the south east.  In recent presentations to the Higher Education Authority that argument was recognised and accepted.</P>
    <P>I hope in the study being carried out and which will be presented to the Minister by the end of the year that the problem in the south east will be addressed. I am concerned, however, about one aspect.  I am not suggesting that Dublin does not need or should not have all the necessary facilities but running through this argument is the premise that everybody who lives in Dublin should have all the third level institutions and those of us who live outside Dublin must send their children to the various institutions around the country.  That is not a fair or balanced argument nor one that sustains equity in the distribution or resources.  I do not want the problems of the south east to cloud the case being <Col N="1681" /> made about the lack of facilities in Dublin.  I accept there is a shortage of certificate courses in Dublin.  The reverse is the case in the south east where there is a shortage of places on degree courses.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of the concern about the shortage of places on degree courses in the south east.  It is my view, and that of all interested parties in the south east, that in the distribution of additional degree places, a substantial number, between 2,000 and 2,500 places must be made available to the regional college in Waterford.  According to the college, and most interest groups, that is the way to develop a university in the south east.  We have an institute in Waterford of the highest standard and recognised nationally &mdash; and internationally.  The new resourcing of that college is essential if it is to grow and strengthen its position in the market-place.  The Minister must realise that the way to solve the problem is to develop the regional college in Waterford into a university.  We seek, demand and expect that the number of degree courses will be increased and the number of places increased by 2,500.  In that way the regional college in Waterford could claw back the ground lost in terms of equity <i>vis-á-vis</i> other regions and resources would not be diminished.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is to have equity, resources must be put into the regional college in Waterford so that the south east will not be deprived of third level educational facilities.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm labhairt ar an mBille seo agus cuirim míle fáilte roimh an moladh atá ann go dtabharfar deis do na fóirne páirtaimsireacha a bheith páirteach i dtoghadh daoine ar bhoird stiúrtha na gColáistí.  Dul chun cinn é sin agus rud maith é.  Déanann na fóirne partaimsireacha go leor ar son na gColáistí agus ar an ábhar sin ba cheart go mbeadh deis acu siúd a bheith istigh ar dhaoine a thoghadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a rá áfach nach bhfuil mé chomh tógtha leis an smaoineamh go gcuirfear iachall ar dhaoine gnéas <Col N="1682" /> cothromas a chleachtadh.  Tuigim an smaoineamh atá taobh thiar de ach ní dóigh liomsa gurb é sin an bealach le dul ar aghaidh.  Sílim féin gur rud é gnéas cothromas a thabharfaimid chun tosaigh más rud é go bhforbraíonn muid an smaoineamh i measc an phobail.  Ach ní dóigh liom go mbeadh glactha ar bith ag an bpobal leis gan sin.  Bíonn go leor daoine ag casaoid má leagtar síos go gcaithfear daoine a thoghadh ar an mbealach seo nó ar an mbealach siúd. B'fhearr mar sin go roghnófaí daoine ar na boird de réir a gcumais.</P>
    <P>Má dhéantar sin toghfar mná.  Má tá fadhb ar bith leis an scéal seo is é nach bhfuil dóthain ban cheana féin ar na coistí ghairmoideachais sna contaethe éagsúla.  Sin an áit ar cheart tosú.  Ba cheart an nós a fhorbairt go mbeadh mná agus fir ar na coistí seo ar fad.  Ach tá mé beagáinín amhrasach i gcomhnaí faoi rialacha daingne a leagadh síos a rá le dream ar bith in áit ar bith go gcaithfidh siad daoine den aicme seo nó den aicme siúd a thoghadh.  Creidim in ionannas agus i gcomhionannas fear agus ban.  Creidim nach cheart go mbeadh aon deighilt eatorra agus creidim gur mó an deighilt a chothóidh sé ná a réiteoidh sé, rialacha mar seo a chur i bhfeidhm.  Ní hé seo an bealach le tabhairt faoi.  Ba cheart tabhairt faoi ar leibhéal na gcoistí ghairmoideachais, ar an leibhéal áitiúil ag déanamh cinnte go mbeadh na coistí sin ionadaíoch ó thaobh fear is ban de agus go réiteodh an fhadhb é féin.</P>
    <P>Feicim fadhbanna ag éirí amach anseo má roghnaíonn dreamanna éagsúla níos mó fear ná mar atá leagtha amach sa Bhille.  Beidh daoine míshasta faoin rud áirithe sin.  Maidir le cúrsaí oideachais i gcoitinne de, agus cúrsaí na gColáistí Réigiúnacha caithfimíd breathnú ar chúrsaí tríú leibhéal sa chomhthéacs go bhfuil níos lú airgid á chaitheamh in aghaidh na micléinn sna Coláistí Réigiúnacha ná mar atá á chaitheamh sna hOllscoileanna.</P>
    <P>One of the questions that must be asked is why the <i>per capita</i> cost in university is so much greater than in an regional technical college.  This begs <Col N="1683" /> many questions which perhaps are not asked through fear or because the power of third level institutions tends to be so great that productivity is not questioned.  From the point of view of the State it costs £12,000 per annum to keep a student at university.  If one looks at the direct access to resources which the student has one must wonder where the money goes.</P>
    <P>My memory of college is my basic contact with lecturers was at lectures where there were 300 or 400 people, tutorials tended to be given by PhD students and there were two practical sessions per week if one took a practical subject.  I often wonder at the high cost of university education.  We need to examine all expenditure within the State to see if we get value for money. Such an analysis must be carried out independently and not through self-regulation or examination.  We spend a huge amount of money on education but we do not offer third level education to all those who qualify for it.  We must look at productivity as the resources given to this sector are astronomical.</P>
    <P>RTCs provide an alternative third level structure and give value for money.  They have regionalised third level education, an important factor.  I would like to see regional technical colleges in areas such as Mayo where they do not exist at present.  The regional technical college structure provides regional third level education in Donegal, Sligo, Waterford and Athlone which was not provided by the university structure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have reservations about some sections but I welcome the provision that part-time staff who work a certain number of hours will have a say on a par with full-time staff in selecting people for the governing bodies.  Ba mhaith liom an Bille seo a mholadh ar an mbealach sin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for bringing the amendments before the House.  They are minor but significant.  By increasing the ratio of <Col N="1684" /> women to men on regional technical college boards the Minister has effectively enhanced the status and commitment of women to education.  There is need to encourage women to seek higher and more responsible positions across the educational spectrum.  Too few seek the position of principal at primary, post-primary or regional college level.  This may be for traditional reasons, a keen sense of family responsibility or lack of encouragement but whatever the cause this amendment has opened a window of opportunity and I welcome it with qualifications which will be reflected in the Fine Gael amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Sadly &mdash; I say this with a great sense of weariness &mdash; it is the thin end of the wedge and the fudging of an issue which is of great importance to myself and my constituents.  This is a failed opportunity.  A window is opened for women but a huge door is closed to the youth of the midlands.  It is a recognition of one section of the community but a rejection of another.  Why did the Minister not avail of this golden opportunity to approve the TRBDI for Thurles and County Tipperary?  The Minister had an ideal opportunity to declare her intentions in regard to this college and to provide hope and a future for young people in the south midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked this question on numerous occasions.  Ministers have come and gone but my priorities have not changed.  Unlike successive Governments, I have not shifted the goalposts on this issue at any time; rather I have tirelessly, and with conviction, put forward the argument that the future prosperity of Thurles and County Tipperary lies in the establishment of a third level institute in Thurles.  I have asked a simple question which requires an equally simple answer.  The Minister and the Cabinet have turned their backs on rural Ireland.  Approval for the establishment of a third level institute in Thurles at this stage could have opened the way for the immediate implementation of the college agenda.  Why did the Minister not seek Cabinet support <Col N="1685" /> for a college in Thurles prior to the introduction of this Bill?</P>
    <P>My criticisms are born out of disappointment and disillusionment.  My disappointment arises from the fact that the junior partners in Government and the Labour Minister for Education have failed to live up to the principles and ideals of the Labour Party philosophy. The founding father of Labour politics in Ireland, James Connolly, was committed to education as a means of emancipating people from the shackles of ignorance.  He sought to decentralise education and place it in the hands of the people who need it most, our youth. The present flag bearers of the Labour tradition have lost sight of this concept, or maybe they have simply been engulfed by the narrow minded, piecemeal and <i>ad hoc</i> policies of their senior partners in Government.</P>
    <P>I feel disillusioned because of the hours of creative energies put in by many people in Tipperary in developing this college concept, which now seems to count for nothing.  Approval for the college at this time could have opened the way for it to be incorporated into the financial estimates for 1995.  If the Minister continues to procrastinate I can only come to the conclusion that the Members of the Cabinet have become like the characters in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, divorced from reality and nurturing self-delusion and fantasy.</P>
    <P>The TRBDI is not simply a regional technical college, it is an advancement of the concept of regional education. Not only will it provide an educational service for mainstream students but it will also offer the option of continuing education and re-education for members of a community which has lost touch with education and training.  The TRBDI has developed the concept of integrated education using out centres as locations for learning and incorporating the skills and expertise of local businessmen and professionals.  The human resources element has opened up the opportunity for adult education in both a full-time and part-time capacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> The TRBDI concept meets all the criteria necessary to receive European funding.  A site has been purchased and is ready for development.  The structures and procedures have been laid down and the feasibility and costings have been worked out.  I am sure the House understands my disillusionment and the need to ask what more needs to be done by the people of Tipperary to gain recognition and to be given a very necessary educational opportunity.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the position of the TRBDI in terms of the language used by the Government.  The Government talks of commitment to the Programme for a Partnership Government.  In Tipperary the word &ldquo;commitment&rdquo; means seeing something through to the end. The TRBDI proposal recommends that the college should be open for 14 hours per day, 360 days of the year; its courses should be flexible and client orientated; the staff should have a continuing education commitment written into their contracts and they would go into the rural community, assess rural development needs and make changes to existing programmes and develop new ones where required.  The only commitment I see coming from the Cabinet is one not to make a decision on this document.</P>
    <P>The Government talks about employment and putting people back to work. However, its solution is to take people off the dole and place them on social employment schemes, to reduce State involvement in large public sector companies and to cut labour forces in companies by up to a half.  This is what I meant by short term and <i>ad hoc</i> policies.</P>
    <P>The TRBDI will bring much needed employment to Thurles, both directly and indirectly.  Directly it will provide staff in the college, ancillary employment in the town and develop the necessary infrastructure for the employment of young people in the longer term. Experience in other towns which have third level colleges demonstrates clearly that regional technical colleges attract <Col N="1687" /> business and industry.  The TRBDI concept places special emphasis on rural development, science and technology and business education.  These areas will generate self-employment, allow for the redevelopment of Greencore activities in Thurles through links with Erin Foods and act as a source of training and development for the proposed mining industry at Lisheen Moyne, Thurles. These valid long term objectives will create sustained employment and a skills base which will give Tipperary a competitive edge in a difficult European market.</P>
    <P>The Government refers to foreign investment in Ireland.  In the past this usually meant fly-by-night chancers who came in for a quick kill and departed rapidly.  The Government seems intent on continuing this policy.  The TRBDI concept envisages a more realistic base for foreign investment.  The college would provide long term opportunities for foreign investment, capital projects developed through curricular disciplines would provide realistic opportunities for people to create real and lasting employment and there would be training programmes for foreign students financed by foreign grants.  The TRBDI proposes to specialise in the development of agri-business which is the main-stay of the Irish economy.  No other college proposes such an extensive education in rural and agri-business development.  The college also proposes to develop expertise which can be sold abroad and which will provide income at home.  Such expertise is a financial asset and should not be underestimated. Bord na Móna discovered this during the 1980s when it began selling bog technology to the east Europeans but unfortunately not enough advantage was taken of this and the gap was subsequently filled by others.</P>
    <P>The Government constantly refers to the need to develop the local economy, encourage small businesses and nurture enterprise.  At the same time the Taoiseach invites selected members of big USA multinational corporations to <Col N="1688" /> come here and advise us on economic development.  Their agenda does not favour small business or the sole trader. The establishment of a college in Thurles will have both short and long term effects on the local economy. Benefits such as rents, small business, transport, clothing, entertainment, food, industrial research facilities, agri-related business and changes in morale and self-esteem within the local community would be guaranteed by establishing a college in Thurles.  We want to keep our young people in Tipperary and to allow them decide their future through education and local opportunities.</P>
    <P>In recent years at least three senior Ministers have come from Tipperary, North and South.  All Tipperary has experienced during this time is the closure of the sugar factory in Thurles, the closure of the Digital factory in Clonmel and many other closures and redundancies.  There has also been constant indecision about the establishment of a third level institute in Tipperary.  This does nothing to inspire confidence. Fianna Fáil has for seven years adopted a negative policy to this issue and the Labour Party now seems intent on imitating this policy.</P>
    <P>As Members can see, my feelings of disappointment and disillusionment are justified.  If approval for the establishment of a college in Thurles is not to be given under this legislation, how will the decision be made?  What procedure will be applied and what is the relationship between the Minister and her Cabinet colleagues regarding this project?  It was suggested that a decision would be taken when the Minister's interim report entitled &ldquo;Third Level Educational Needs&rdquo; was presented in September.  Now we are told we must await the end of the year report and that, when it has been assessed, a decision will be taken.  Is the Minister willing to give such a guarantee?  In view of all previous commitments and broken promises the House will understand my paranoia, the result of constant stone-walling and evasion.</P>
    <P>The present impasse leads to further <Col N="1689" /> questions.  It is a sad reflection on the clarity of Government policy that, having promoted this cause over 15 years, I still seek answers to inane bureaucratic questions.  For example, the Department of Education carried out an analysis of the proposal.  What is the outcome?  When will the Department steering committee report on the provision of third-level colleges?  The financial questions are of greater significance.  For example, what effect will revised European Union funds have on the Tipperary Rural Business Development Institute?  In the report of January this year £9.5 million was targeted to be made available for facilities.  Is this money still available or has it been promised to Tralee and Cork regional technical colleges and other educational institutions?</P>
    <P>The people of Tipperary want answers to these questions and are entitled to them.  Never before has an entire county been so united on a single educational issue.  The amount of time, effort and expertise devoted to this project has been enormous and the motivation behind it is very simple, a large, young population in Tipperary being forced to leave every year as there are no opportunities available to them.  At the same time many cannot afford to travel 40 miles to the nearest regional technical college.  Statistics clearly show that 80 per cent of students who attend regional technical colleges come from within that region and that 50 per cent of enrolments annually are in the non-university sector.  The problem in Tipperary is simple &mdash; the youth are there but lack the skill to comprise an effective workforce.  Education and jobs are interdependent.  The Tipperary Rural Business Development Institute, by its very existence, could solve that problem.  In Tipperary there is a great desire to learn.  One glance at the adult education programme in the county will confirm this fact.  However, the programme is piecemeal and lacks integration.  The Tipperary Rural Business Development Institute would encompass this programme and create <Col N="1690" /> the links needed to co-ordinate a more effective one.</P>
    <P>In the areas surrounding Tipperary there are a number of regional technical colleges and colleges but they lack the necessary cohesion and integration.  The Thurles college would link those colleges, geographically and educationally, building from certificate to degree courses and ensure that there was no overlapping or duplication in the process.  What more needs to be said to convince the Government side of the House of the values of and necessity for this college?  We must remember that education is a constantly changing facet of our society.  The development of the regional technical colleges in the late 1960s and 1970s was a tremendous innovation, opening up opportunities, affording education and providing skills to a wide range of people.  Now the 21st century beckons with educational demands changing at an even faster pace than most of us had anticipated 20 years ago.  The regional technical college model is there and we must develop its potential.  The Tipperary Rural Business Development Institute constitutes a further expansion of that model.  The European Union is helping to provide resources to finance the requisite change.  If we wish to avoid industrial disasters such as those in Irish Steel and the Irish Sugar Company then the TRBDI model is the road to follow, diversifying its activities in different communities, where necessary.  Its educational philosophy is sound and rooted firmly in experience, making use of all local resources, encouraging constant development and re-evaluation.  I emphasise to the Minister, a former teacher who has shown a commitment to educational development on other areas &mdash; remedial, civic, social and political &mdash; that Tipperary needs this input and that Thurles has the necessary expertise and facilities to support it.</P>
    <P>I posed a number of questions today and in recent weeks to members of the Cabinet.  It is fitting to conclude with one further question.  If the Minister and her Department reject the concept <Col N="1691" /> and TRBDI model as constituting an appropriate educational solution to a very real need, from where can they provide an alternative that is as well thought out, costed and evaluated educationally?  I do not believe there is such an alternative.  Indeed if this educational facility is not provided one wonders who will answer to our children for the destruction of rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of these two Bills.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Minister's emphasis on appointing women to the governing bodies of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges which is the object of the provisions of these two Bills and proves that the Government is intent on fulfilling the commitments contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government, to create greater equality throughout our society.</P>
      <P>The Government has always had the clearly stated objective of increasing women's participation in public life.  As we all know, this will not occur overnight but will be enormously facilitated by establishing a practice of providing role models at governance level for students of third-level institutions.  In the case of educational institutions, gender balance assumes particular significance bearing in mind their role in educating young people in all aspects of life.</P>
      <P>This is a positive, necessary legislative step which will halt the traditional, self-perpetuating dominance of public life by men.  As a teacher, I am delighted at the introduction of these Bills because, in the past, many women, faithful servants of our educational system, experienced enormous difficulty in breaking through the proverbial glass ceiling to rise through the ranks.  Therefore, it is crucial that this Government is active in promoting the issue of gender equity. Of course, there will be those who will carp and belittle what the Minister for Education is attempting to do in the provisions of these Bills but those who oppose them are sexist and anti-women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> We must always remember that students attending third-level educational institutions are at a crucial stage in their development.  Very often their educational experiences at primary and second-level has taught them that, while three-quarters of the teaching staff may be female, generally the principal is a male.  They will have noticed that usually school inspectors are male. They may even have been aware that management boards often are comprised largely of men but that school cleaning staff are usually women.  It is high time this cycle was broken.  Only through taking positive steps such as these, and as quickly as possible, can we bring about that gender equity.  Very often women comprise in excess of 50 per cent of student numbers in our colleges and should have a commensurate representation at board level.</P>
    <P>The development of regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges has been an undoubted success in recent years.  For example, in the past 15 years wholetime student numbers attending regional technical colleges have increased by almost 300 per cent, from 6,500 to 25,000 at present.  Similarly, the numbers of students attending Dublin Institute of Technology colleges have increased 150 per cent, from 4,000 to in excess of 10,000.  The 1992 Acts governing these two bodies allowed for expansion of the range of activities provided by them, for example, in industry-supported research, transfer of technology, industrial training and the incubation of new industry, welcome developments which have made a huge contribution to broadening educational opportunity and access here.  One very important aspect of this development is the facility afforded to continue to higher studies on the completion of regional technical college and Dublin Institute of Technology courses.  Two projects for women are run by the regional technical college-DIT sector in association with the NOW programme sponsored by the European Union, further welcome developments, under which pre-training <Col N="1693" /> courses in science and technology are organised and week-long taster courses in engineering and technology, sectors in which traditionally there has been a low proportion of women.  Such initiatives encourage women to think of a broader range of options available to them.</P>
    <P>The great success to date of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges is acknowledged but regrettably it is necessary to introduce this legislation. When we look back at the experience during the past year or so we see the reason.  In the case of governing bodies in the regional technical colleges, the vocational educational committees effectively nominate 11 of the 17 ordinary members.  One member each is elected or nominated by the non-academic staff and the ICTU.  Two members each are elected by academic staff and students.  The position is broadly similar in the case of the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.</P>
    <P>In implementing the Government's gender policy, the Minister required colleges to make regulations for the election of one woman and one man in the case of the academic staff and students. The Minister also requested the vocational education committees to make nominations reflecting a gender balance.  The vocational education committees failed to do so and pointed to the fact that the legislation imposed no obligation on them to have any regard to gender balance or to the Government's policy on gender balance when making recommendations.  I regret that this was the attitude adopted by the vocational education committees.  It would have been preferable if the vocational education committees had wholeheartedly adopted a proactive policy to ensure gender balance.  This regressive action on the part of the vocational education committees has necessitated this legislation.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when the principle of equal opportunity is respected fully by all members of society and, more importantly, when <Col N="1694" /> full support is given for equal representation of women in all areas of public life.  An opportunity was given to the vocational education committees to nominate women to reflect the Government's commitment to ensuring a gender balance on a voluntary basis but it was not taken up.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has moved so quickly in introducing the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. This debate affords me an opportunity to express appreciation for what has already been achieved regarding third level education in Mayo.  It also gives me a chance to lay down a marker as to what should be provided in the future. I say bluntly and clearly that I and the people I represent will be satisfied with nothing less, in the long term, than a fully fledged regional technical college. It would be bad manners if I did not pay tribute to the Minister for what has already been achieved.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Enda Kenny, also deserves credit for fighting this cause when all seemed lost.</P>
      <P>Last week the first students commenced classes in the newly renovated west wing of St. Mary's psychiatric hospital in Castlebar.  More than 100 pupils were enrolled.  It was a great day for the west, for Mayo and for Castlebar.  Looking around the Castlebar campus on enrolment day I saw tutors anxious to set about the important task of imparting knowledge to their young charges.  More important the youngsters were, as they say in my part of the country, just raring to go.  I have no doubt when the results of the final examinations are available this group of boys and girls will have done themselves and their parents proud.</P>
      <P>The facilities provided at St. Mary's are a credit to the authorities who worked against the clock to have the building ready on time.  The head of the college, Mr. Richard Thorne, and his staff are also deserving of the highest praise for the spirit and commitment they have shown in the early days of this important project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> I was disappointed to read that the centre is officially known, not as Mayo Regional Technical College, but as the Castlebar campus of the Galway Regional Technical College.  We in Mayo want and deserve a regional technical college that stands on its own feet. We want a fully independent third level college, whose facilities and status are equal to Galway, Sligo, Letterkenny, Limerick and Waterford.  One of my priorities as a Member of this Dáil will be to help achieve this.  The knockers have had a field day as regards third level facilities in Mayo.  I do not propose to join them but there is a genuine concern that what we have in Mayo is not a third level college but third level classes. There is simply no guarantee, contrary to what others claim, that the commencement of third level classes will automatically lead to a fully fledged college.  I want the courses which began in Castlebar last week to be the forerunner of a fully autonomous independent regional technical college in Mayo.  In the past figures and statistics have been quoted to show the tremendous exodus from Mayo every Sunday evening to attend third level classes elsewhere.  The case has already been made for a fully fledged college.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about developing the west.  Unfortunately, there has been more words that actions.  Ways must be found of keeping our youth at home, both in the school going years and later when they need to earn a living.  The Church recognises the importance of a fully fledged regional technical college in Mayo and has supported the campaign for such a facility.  The Government, if it is serious about saving the west, cannot fail to provide such an important educational infrastructure. Let the historic happenings in Castlebar last week be the beginning, the front runner of even greater things educationally in my native county.  A fully fledged regional technical college in Mayo would benefit an entire region.  As well as producing badly needed third level graduates it would help correct one of <Col N="1696" /> the major imbalances in modern Ireland, i.e. the over-concentration of population facilities and infrastructure on the eastern seaboard.</P>
    <P>I hope the hospital patients and staff affected by the educational developments at St. Mary's will be well looked after.  I compliment the Minister on what has been achieved in Castlebar. As she begins to prepare the Estimates, I appeal to her to sanction a fully fledged regional technical college for next year which would be a major boost to the economy of Mayo.  The Minister has done a good job and I am not afraid to compliment her but I am asking her to finish the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party has no problem with gender equity and would support it in any sphere of the public service.  My party's record on this issue has stood up over the years.  The Fine Gael Party has more female representatives than any other party and we have a high percentage of females in all prominent positions.  From the point of view of gender equity the actual input of Fine Gael is unquestionable.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that this Bill refers only to gender equity and does not refer to other critical changes in independent nominating bodies and in establishing voting rights for a range of persons in part-time employment.  This issue was referred to in detail by the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Paul McGrath. Neither the Minister's Second Stage speech nor the Bill refer to other significant difficulties encountered in operating the 1992 Act.  The most significant difficulty is whether this Bill is constitutional.  Deputy McGrath spoke at length on this and has posed several questions to the Minister in this respect which I hope she will answer when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the motivation for introducing this Bill with such haste, just one week after publication?  Is it timed to pre-empt the forthcoming court action by the Dublin Institute of Technology academic staff association?  Is this the reason it is backdated to take effect <Col N="1697" /> from January 1994?  If so, it is a matter for concern.  The Bill was published a week ago.  The next day <i>The Irish Times</i> reported groups welcoming the Bill. Indeed, as Deputy McGrath pointed out, there was not a great deal of reaction from the colleges.  Was there proper communication with them before the Bill was published?  Were they consulted in regard to its contents?</P>
    <P>I support the concept of a gender balance in public bodies, but will this Bill ensure it?  Will the President have to refer it to the Supreme Court?  If that is the case, a gender balance in public bodies could suffer a severe setback?  The bottom line should be that, regardless of gender, those who are best qualified for a position on a committee should be appointed.  However, if a 50:50 gender balance is required those appointed should be the best qualified and if properly qualified people cannot be provided, there is nothing wrong in extending representation to other groups.  In County Kerry &mdash; where tourism is fundamental &mdash; apart from members of local authorities, those who participate in development groups could play a vital role in running regional technical colleges and should be given an opportunity to do so.  In ensuring a gender balance on public bodies, we must also ensure that those appointed are adequately qualified for the position, which I am sure is the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>My party supported the Second Stages of the 1992 Bills, we are committed to the development of regional technical colleges and institutes of technology.  Those institutions accepted the challenge posed by the 1992 Act and in most cases implemented its provisions with enthusiasm.  At that time I spoke strongly in their favour and so far they have confirmed the confidence that Oireachtas representatives placed in them.  Those colleges have developed into institutions of higher education which are second to none in the European Union and this House should compliment those running them for the way <Col N="1698" /> they have dealt with the additional students, the higher level courses, the European Union programmes and, above all, the public funds voted by this House.  Deputy Ó Cuív questioned the amount <i>per capita</i> spent on university as opposed to college students and the value for money we get from our regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Two issues are not addressed in the Bill, namely, title and budgets.  The issue of title is an important one.  As business and the humanities form a significant part of the work of regional technical colleges, the word &ldquo;technical&rdquo; should be dropped from their title, they should be described simply as regional colleges.  In discussing the regional colleges Bill two years ago, some Members said they should be referred to as polytechnics, but the title &ldquo;regional colleges&rdquo; would be acceptable.  The title &ldquo;director&rdquo; is not used to describe the chief officer of higher education institutions in the European Union, it is used as a subsidiary title for the director of building and student services.  I propose that the title of this office should be changed to that of president.</P>
    <P>The national diploma course in the humanities which was to be initiated in the Tralee Regional Technical College last September aroused considerable interest locally because, for the first time, this would have combined the workings of Siamsa Tíre and the regional technical college in Tralee.  I am sure the Minister would agree that this is the way forward for regional technical colleges, they must be seen as a dynamic force in the communities and regions they serve.  As a member of the Kerry County Enterprise Board, I proposed that the regional technical college should carry out our development plan for the next three years, a proposal which was taken up by the monitoring committee of the enterprise board who has produced a comprehensive report with the help of the regional technical college in the county.  That demonstrates the expertise available in <Col N="1699" /> regional technical colleges and the value communities can gain from them.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that a number of applicants applied for the diploma course in the humanities, because of various constraints and bureaucracy the course did not go ahead.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure the course is initiated next year.  Culture is becoming an important aspect of the tourism industry and, therefore, further development and refinement of music, and other aspects of our culture and heritage is essential. It is important that such a course is provided in regional technical colleges so that we can give our visitors a high quality product.  People were disappointed that the diploma course did not go ahead this year.  In addition to achieving a B in Irish in a pass paper, those who wished to take up the course were required to successfully complete auditions in ear, voice and dance movement. It was not possible to obtain approval for the course from the Department prior to 1 May because of section 13 (4) of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, and because the artistic assessment auditions could not appropriately be held in the days immediately prior to the leaving certificate examination, they were deferred until 17 to 24 June 1994. Applicants who attended the artistic auditions sought a guarantee that a course would be run in September 1994 and as such a guarantee could not be given, a significant number changed course preference prior to 1 July.</P>
    <P>Verbal approval for this course was given to the director of the college on 25 July and confirmed in writing on 7 September. When first round offers were made by the CAO-CAS in Galway on 18 August 1994 the director considered there were insufficient remaining applicants to form a viable class group and two options were available. Those options were to re-advertise the course with a likely commencement date of January 1995 or to defer intake until September 1995 and assume the letter of 8 September gave approval for <Col N="1700" /> course commencement in September 1995.  At the meeting of 28 September the governing body adopted the second option as did the professional staff of Siamsa Tire, the colleges' partners. Because of a provision in the Regional Colleges Act, 1992, and the delay in communication between the college and the Department it is necessary to amend that Act to avoid a future logjam. Section 3 (4) states that the vocational education committees shall on or before 1 May each year submit to the Minister for approval the programmes and budget submitted by the governing body together with such modifications as may have been made by the committee.  Obviously, in this case that provision prevented the course from proceeding.  Will the Minister address this problem and ensure that the course proceeds in 1995?  It represents an important departure, its content is innovative and it is the type of course that will become popular throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Members on this side support the introduction of gender equity.  It is vitally important that as many women as possible should be involved in decision making at all levels.  Deputy Browne said that primary school education, where up to 90 per cent of staff is female, must be given priority as it has implications, particularly in the provision of physical education.  For example, it may be difficult for some female teachers to bear the elements in taking physical education classes outdoors, be it Gaelic football, hurling, soccer or whatever.  I understand Finland has a similar problem.  If that imbalance continues it will lead to major repercussions in physical education.</P>
    <P>Gender equity at all levels of education must be considered.  The Government faces a challenge in respect of the very small number of women in senior positions in local authorities.  In Kerry County Council it is noticeable that very few women attend council meetings despite there being many capable women on its staff.  The provisions are a <Col N="1701" /> start in dealing with the problem of gender equity, but difficulties will arise. This area should be given a good deal of consideration and initiatives should be taken.  Despite some reservations and the questions I raised for the right reasons, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the generally positive thrust of the Bill, but it is regrettable that legislation must be introduced to obtain gender balance among governing bodies.  That balance should occur naturally but the Minister believes it will not happen without the introduction of legislation.  While there is a general welcome for this legislation once it is on the Statute Book her problems will not be over.  Implementing its provisions will be much more than an academic exercise.  I hope the blueprint will work out but there will be problems.</P>
      <P>Sligo Regional Technical College is in the heart of my constituency.  When a Bill which deals with the governing bodies of regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology is introduced it is right that a person representing an area in which a college is located should pay tribute to the staff of that college for their good work.  Since Sligo Regional Technical College was established in the 1970s it has flourished and has had a major impact on the north west region.  Each year it turned out well qualified and, probably because of the spirit in the college, highly motivated graduates.  Admittedly, as usual many graduates had to emigrate, but those who did were at least equal, if not better equipped than, their peers in the host country to which they emigrated and were able to command excellent jobs.  Indeed, many gained valuable experience and subsequently returned home.  Anything that helps to maintain employment in that area or ensures that people who have to emigrate are well equipped to do so is extremely valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sligo Regional Technical College is the main reason for the success of the industrial sector of that area and it is fitting that tribute should be paid to its <Col N="1702" /> staff.  Many multinationals have located there and great progress has been made in tool making.  Indeed that area has become the centre of tool making here.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that ESF grants have now been means tested.  Those grants influenced the growth of Sligo regional technical college which was very sucessful in attracting students from farming, manual workers and professional backgrounds and which gave rise to a well balanced socio-economic student body profile.  Unfortunately, I fear that the introduction of the means test, for reasons of which the Minister is well aware, puts that balance at risk.  Unfortunately, that battle has been fought and lost as far as we are concerned.  I know of the Minister's interest in the technological stream of education provided by regional technical colleges and her emphasis on that area is correct.  We look forward to more resources in terms of buildings and staff being put into the regional technical colleges.  The crowds that gather in the corridors of such colleges could be compared to the crowds that will gather in Lansdowne Road tonight.  The college buildings were built to cater for students in a particular period but they are inadequate for the present needs.  They need investment to provide for expansion.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider retraining staff.  Most of the staff in the regional technical colleges were recruited in the 1970s.  They are now in their forties or fifties and many of them are operating in a rapidly changing technological area.  It is essential that teachers should be informed ahead of the new developments.  It is universally accepted by teachers that major investment in retraining is needed in the technological area where there has been massive developments.</P>
    <P>This should be a concern of the boards and I am sure that when they are gender balanced there will be an extra touch to meet this precise concern.  The Minister should have a serious look at the need for retraining and lecturers, professors and teachers will given her the strongest possible backing.  I am <Col N="1703" /> glad of the ability to be involved in research and development and to become commercial in that area.</P>
    <P>Sligo Regional Technical College, Letterkenny Regional Technical College, Magee College and the University of Ulster at Coleraine are in the north-west section of the country.  There are others along the line &mdash; I have no doubt Deputy Boylan will speak about his in Cavan.  In the spirit of peace at present we should be looking for stronger cross-Border ties in education.  Letterkenny and Derry are not too far apart but Fermanagh, for example, is in the hinterland of Sligo.  Rosses Point golf club in Sligo would have had up to one-third of its members from Fermanagh until the troubles broke out.  There was cross-Border activity prior to and subsequent to the Border being put in place which continued until the troubles began.  Now that there is a cessation of violence, which it is hoped will be on a continuing basis, the Minister should look at how we can forge stronger links between, say, Sligo Regional Technical College and the University of Ulster.  This could be carried to accreditation, something in which the academics in those areas have a particular interest.  I have been in the University of Coleraine in recent times and met the excellent people there. They, in turn, have a great interest in the people in Sligo and Donegal.  I know of some classes in Sligo where perhaps a quarter of the students have opted for the University of Coleraine as their first choice &mdash; these are students going on to the university as distinct from the regional technical college.  I would be grateful if the Minister would consider what might be done, perhaps at no cost, to the advantage of everyone and the furtherance of education which we all desire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill but I question the necessity for it.  Is this not an insult to women in 1994?  Surely modern day woman is capable of taking her <Col N="1704" /> place in any walk of life, on any committee or in any board room.  We have prime examples of women leading in various fields in this country.  Surely the Minister is not saying it is necessary to make places available for them, that they cannot compete?  I do not accept that.  Our first citizen does a fine job. She is a marvellous example of 1994 womanhood, presenting the image of this country in a very positive manner internationally.  When the President is abroad and speaking on behalf of the nation one does not worry about what she will say next as in the case of some leaders, one listens with anticipation.</P>
      <P>In my part of the country in the field of engineering in which it was unheard of for women to be involved many years ago, one of the finest engineering firms, Moffat Engineering, is led by a woman, Carol Martin, who has put many of the men in that field in the shade.  There are many more positive examples.  When the Government has serious problems such as at present and in the recent past, it is not Minister Cowen or Minister McCreevy who are pushed out front but Minister O'Rourke, to present the image.  Those examples show that women can play their part.  This measure is not necessary and could be taken as an insult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, most people agree that there is a necessity for gender equity.  Let us turn to primary schools for a moment.  I understand that 80 per cent of primary school teachers are female. Whether that is a good trend can be questioned.  The male influence will always be important.  The household we see as good and proper consists of a mother and father, both having an influence, the father with the sons if he is blessed with them, daughters to look up to him and the mother there to care for them all.  That is the proper balance.  In our national schools where there is an all female staff boys must feel left out. If teachers' duties do not conclude at 3 p.m., if they are involved in sports and boys must be taken for hurling, football, soccer, rugby etc., and girls for camogie and other sports, there is a necessity for <Col N="1705" /> balance.  With an 80 per cent female teaching staff I worry how the next generation of young men in this country will turn out.  I hope they will be as good as in the past.</P>
    <P>This debate has developed into a discussion on third level education and everybody has put down a marker for their own area.  I will be doing the same and the Minister can hardly blame me for that.  There are other aspects to this discussion, the first is that education is vitally important.  When talking to young people in groups having met them on the road thumbing lifts as they have to do because of the cost of travel to and from college &mdash; I will come to that aspect in a moment &mdash; I always tell them to get all the education they can, that it is a golden opportunity; and, broadly speaking, the opportunities are there.  Without a good grounding in education one will not be able to get a meaningful job.  That was not the case 20 or 25 years ago.  Someone with the leaving certificate could become a bank clerk and eventually a bank manager. Previous to that even the primary certificate from national school was a passport to advancement.  That day is gone. Although there are exceptions qualifications, certificates, diplomas or degrees are essential if one is to have a chance.  The primary schools are outstanding in turning out young people although conditions are not as we would like them to be.  However, that is a debate for another day.</P>
    <P>I am a strong supporter of the vocational school system.  My children have gone through it and I fully realise what they have to offer, a marvellous system of education which complements the private colleges.  People can choose. There was an attitude that the vocational schools were for a certain section of the community but that is nonsense.  Children from all walks of life have gone to the vocational schools. People with airy fairy notions of sending their children to private colleges now realise that they made a mistake, that in the vocational schools there is a wide <Col N="1706" /> choice of classes &mdash; woodwork, metalwork etc., and cookery classes, etc., for the girls.  There is a mix, children will find that this is what suits them and will then progress to the regional colleges or the universities.  The regional colleges present a marvellous opportunity for young people to subsequently advance to a degree course.  They do it in slow stages but they will make it if they get the initial grounding.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in regard to cost and location.  The case has been made for Castlebar, Sligo and Waterford. People have said that everything is centred in Dublin.  Dublin is well facilitated with universities and regional colleges.  I have sons in Dublin so I speak from experience.  A major problem relates to the availability of places which are not freely available and it is difficult to get into colleges.  The Minister says we cannot make places for everybody but we must &mdash; all the children must be cherished equally.  It is not good enough to have a certain cut off level and to tell the rest they cannot get in.  Likewise it is terrible for children to have to drop out if they fail after the first year as it can have a serious effect on them.  The Minister may disagree but I believe many of the faculties decide how many students will pass their examinations in a certain year.  There is a cut off point because it is undesirable to have too many doctors, architects, solicitors and so on.  There may be many young boys and girls with the required ability but only those at the top of the scale get through, and that is unacceptable.  Everybody should be given the opportunity to get into the jobs market if they have the relevant qualification.  The system does not provide for equal opportunities for all qualified people.</P>
    <P>It is almost impossible to find suitable accommodation in the city of Dublin. The Minister has an obligation to ensure that suitable accommodation is available for young boys and girls from the country.  There are marvellous bedsitters and flats in the city but some of the accommodation is not of the <Col N="1707" /> required standard.  Many children are tempted to take such accommodation because their parents cannot afford to pay for suitable accommodation.  I query the health conditions in many flats and bedsitters.  There are many responsible people who offer excellent flats and digs but there are others who rip off their tenants and in many cases flats are not suitable for habitation.  This underlines the necessity for regional colleges which would allow students to live at home.</P>
    <P>In Cavan there is a college of further studies, a marvellous development of recent years.  It is a new college but already the results are showing.  The principal subjects taught in that college are office and computer skills.  It has also developed a pre-nursing course which is extremely popular.  The college is linked to the regional technical college in Athlone but further development is necessary.  Since Cavan is 75 miles from Dublin, students attending college in Dublin must find accommodation there.  There is no direct transport system from Cavan to Dundalk and therefore students attending college in Dundalk must find accommodation there.  The same applies in regard to Sligo and Galway.  The cost of accommodation is all these areas is very high.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan referred to means testing of the ESF grant, which is unacceptable as it puts many people under great strain.  The income limit for this grant is £16,000 and there is a clause relating to families with eight or more children.  There are very few families nowadays with eight or more children. Let us be realistic about this matter.  I know of cases where the husband works, for example, as a postman and his wife takes part-time work to supplement the income.  In those cases the wife's earnings are taken into account in the means assessment, thereby debarring the children from receiving a grant. Because of these people's initiative in earning extra money for their families they are being denied a grant to which <Col N="1708" /> they should be entitled.  The ESF grant should not be means tested.</P>
    <P>Likewise, students seeking local authority grants for university should not be penalised as a result of a parent taking on extra work to supplement the family income.  The money earned in this way is simply pocket money which is spent on extra items for the family rather than on luxuries and people should not be penalised as a result.  Means tests should be assessed on the income of the head of the household.  If both parents have full-time jobs that is a different matter but where the husband is the main income earner and the wife works part-time, her income should not be taken into account.</P>
    <P>There should be closer co-operation between colleges North and South. There is a marvellous university in Coleraine in Derry.  it is within reach of those in the north-east and north-west region and some arrangement should be made whereby students in those areas could attend that college.  Perhaps the Minister would consider those points. The ESF grant should be considered. Universities and colleges should be required to inspect accommodation to ensure it is suitable for students.  That would be one way of overcoming the accommodation problem.  We should ensure that our children have every comfort and are given every possible opportunity.  I look forward to the Minister's comments on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am probably right in saying that this is the first Bill that has come before the House that specifically sets out to achieve a particular objective in terms of gender balance and the Minister is to be congratulated on that. However I hope the Minister will not consider me curmudgeonly or begrudging when I say I am not particularly impressed by the legislation.  I know I am venturing into an area in which it is very easy to be misunderstood, but I do not think the Minister would disagree when I say that her success in bringing forward this Bill is probably due in no small part to the fact that she is a <Col N="1709" /> woman and this has been very much a woman's cause.  That is underlined by the fact that in other Bills that have come before this House since the Government came to office, the Government failed to take the opportunity to provide specifically or explicitly for gender balance on other boards.  Maybe part of the reason is that the Ministers concerned are men.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has spent much time &mdash; I suspect she has &mdash; arguing about gender balance, but I would like an objective reason for this legislation.  I am not going to speak about the educational aspects of the Bill.  I simply want to sound a note of, at least, scepticism to show that the House may not be entirely convinced by this politically correct and fashionable urge to bring about a particular level of gender balance.  It has been notable in this debate that, although the Bill is principally about the objective of gender balance, there has been very little talk about it.  It has become a matter of faith in certain quarters in politics that 40 per cent of the people occupying positions deemed to be important should be women.  I would like the Minister to reflect a little on where that 40 per cent came from.  There is no justification whatsoever for 40 per cent, or indeed for 30 per cent, 50 per cent, 65 per cent or any other percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a general rule 51 per cent of the population is female and 49 per cent is male &mdash; there tends to be a slight majority of females over males.  The argument about gender balance in politics has nothing to do with that.  It has everything to do with the objective fact that women have been discriminated against in most western societies for most of our known history.  Because of the way our society has been organised it has been made extremely difficult for women to take up certain positions which we believe, culturally, are important.  I fully support the contention that this should change, discrimination brought to an end and actions and attitudes which give rise to it &mdash; I will not say rooted out because that is <Col N="1710" /> far too violent a phrase &mdash; modified so that we have a more natural emergence and participation by women on the basis of their abilities overcoming the discrimination.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that Bills such as this are the right instruments to use.  This will emerge clearly when the Minister begins to put the gender balance provisions of this Bill into effect.  I have a shrewd suspicion &mdash; I think the Minister shares it &mdash; that it will be difficult in some cases to bring this about.  The Minister will have to wangle and manoeuvre to achieve this objective. Part of the reason for this is that no percentage, 40 per cent, 45 per cent or 50 per cent, can be objectively justified; there is no rational reason for it in terms of the abilities of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the Minister for Education is the first to put this measure forward given that she has by far the biggest role to play in Government in providing the means with which we can influence the attitudes and practices which give rise to the dissatisfaction rightly felt by women at their low level of participation in areas which we think are important in our culture, economy and so on.  It is in the way we educate people that we see the most deep seated influences which give rise to the situation with which the Minister is trying to deal.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister paid particular attention to that area.  I do not say that as a criticism because after 21 months in office no Minister for Education can hope to have fundamentally altered the shape or direction of our education system; it would take much longer than that but the Government is not doing anything substantial in our schools to change this.  We have had some cosmetic exercises in the past; action has been taken on the question of gender stereotyping, some of which has been worthwhile and some ludicrous.  This reminds me of what they tried to do to Enid Blyton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No real action has been taken in terms of the direction of the education system and the content of the school programme that will, in the medium to long term, bring about a fundamental change.  This may be a recognition of the fact that it takes much longer to do this than a couple of years which the campaigners would like and, second, it is happening anyway because society as a whole has become, more conscious of the injustice it perpetrates on over half the population.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that a Labour Party Minister introduced legislation of this kind because the Labour Party, like its counterparts in many other countries, is a believer in the &ldquo;nanny state&rdquo; whereby the State decides what we should do and in what we should believe.  Whenever a problem arises or whenever a need is perceived in society the first instinct of the Labour Party &mdash; it is not alone in this in Irish political culture &mdash; is to ask itself what the State should do about this to shape our minds and hearts, if it can ever get that far, to eradicate this evil in our midst.  In terms of this Bill the &ldquo;nanny state&rdquo; is at it again; it will make us and all these boards more egalitarian whether we or they like it or not and, above all, it will do this regardless of whether it is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not refer to the old stances that can easily be labelled &ldquo;chauvinist&rdquo; or the circumstances in which this balance will produce the wrong people.  I am aware there are cases where the imbalance has produced the wrong people but this is not the way to correct it; the State should not get involved and legislate for the way we think.  I bet the Minister cannot give me one good reason for believing that the figure of 40 per cent is right.  It may well be that in some part of the country the natural process of selection, based on ability and suitability, will produce a board of the vocational education committee of which 70 per cent of the members will be women.  In theory that may happen under the Bill.  It may also be the case that in an adjoining area the natural <Col N="1712" /> process of selection will produce a board of which 70 per cent of the members will be men but this will not be allowed to happen and we do not know why.  Why should the position be the same in two areas &mdash; people are not the same?</P>
    <P>A friend of mine, a farmer, who has long since passed to his reward, used to tell me when I worked for a major farming organisation that he hated listening to me when I used terms such as &ldquo;in general&rdquo; or &ldquo;on average&rdquo;.  He used to say that he did not like averages because if one's head is in the oven and one's feet in the fridge, on average, one is at a comfortable temperature.  In relation to some of these boards the Minister will have her head in the oven and her feet in the fridge but whatever else happens there will be a general balance regardless of whether we will have the best possible board in a particular region.  This is the wrong way to go about it.</P>
    <P>I sound that note in the House because it is evident from the debate that, in general, Members have been intimidated by this deadening fad of political correctness and the rush to fit in with what is popularly perceived to be the respectable liberal thing to say, do and believe in politics.  The self-righteous Labour Party &mdash; it has not been as self-righteous in the past few days &mdash; has all the wisdom about what is politically correct and the politically sexy ideas.  We will have unnecessary bureaucracy to bring about a result which will look fine on the outside but which will be purely cosmetic and you should not take that, Sir, as a chauvinist or sexist remark.  I cannot see how this will do anything for education.  It may in some cases bring people into the loop of involvement but in others it will keep people out.  The Minister will have a headache in making sure that this balance will be properly respected because it seems to be the respectable thing to do.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is worthwhile spending time in going through this pofaced procedure of legislating for this <Col N="1713" /> when it will not do anything worthwhile for education.  In the meantime there are other developments in the education sector which will have a far more intimate effect on the way the system serves people, and which we are not discussing, although some of these issues have been touched on in this debate. Although it is not strictly relevant to the Bill I am sure, Sir, you will allow a passing reference to the Minister's apparent intention &mdash; supported for once by Democratic Left, which I find very ominous &mdash; to take account of assets in determining eligibility for third level education grants.  It is one of the most dangerous proposals I have ever seen.  I wonder if the Minister will follow the logic of that proposal and look perhaps at PAYE workers in a high technology firm and include not only the physical assets of the firm but the intellectual property rights that attach to the firm. The assets of a good firm involved in computer-aided design employing ten or 12 people might be distributed among the workers.  Would the Minister be happy to do that?  Logically she should, because if she is to value and take account of assets owned by a farmer, publican or shopkeeper in assessing eligibility for third level education grants, she is valuing the tools they have at their disposal to make a living.  She will not do that to PAYE workers, not because she has made any intellectual examination of it but because in the dead doctrine of the Labour Party people who own assets are not entitled to the same kind of service from the &ldquo;nanny&rdquo; State as people who do not own assets or who cannot be shown to own assets or have an individual title to them.  That will be much more important for our education system than the question of gender balance.</P>
    <P>I would love to see the day &mdash; and I do not think the Minister will hasten it &mdash; when we would not comment on the gender balance of any board, business or committee because it would be irrelevant.  We would simply know that we had a system in place that produces the best people for the job and we would <Col N="1714" /> not care about their gender.  What the Minister is doing will not have a constructive effect on the deep-seated reasons for the problem.  Society will get on with it without reference to the &ldquo;nanny&rdquo; State interference that the Minister is proposing.  This Bill is mis-conceived and will not achieve the objective the Minister has set.</P>

      <P>Examples include the amending legislation that is under consideration today and ongoing reform <Col N="1715" /> of the structure of second level senior cycle education and the agreement with second level schools on selection procedures.  Similar action with regard to other urgent issues will be taken should the need arise before the publication of the White Paper.  The process of finalising the White Paper is well advanced. Taking account of the comprehensive consultation process which has taken place to date, the White Paper will be an important document which will outline the framework for the development of education into the next century.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath acknowledged the comprehensiveness of that consultation but sought to draw a distinction between the White Paper consultative process and what we saw as the lack of consultation on the Bills.  I am very happy to inform the House of the consultative process put in place since the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992 and the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992 were passed.  We have formalised a process of consultation between my Department and the directors of the regional technical colleges through the regional technical college management services, for which a full-time officer and secretarial support staff have been sanctioned.  Consultation on all sorts of issues relevant to the sector is ongoing on a regular basis since the legislation came into effect.  This, of course, is a vast improvement on the old system where the contact between the Minister was through the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee, who until December 1992 was the accounting officer for the colleges.  With regard to these Bills specifically, I can confirm that consultation took place with the regional technical college management services and directors were aware since last March of my intention to bring amending legislation before the House.  I have to refer to the difficulty of consultation on gender balance as the representation at that level is of one sex only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of an appropriate title <Col N="1716" /> for the colleges to reflect their particular expertise has been raised by a number of Deputies.  It is one previously discussed during the debate on the Principal Acts.  The regional technical college and Dublin Institute of Technology Acts clearly indicate the breadth of the educational services to be provided by the colleges as follows:</P>
    <P>To provide vocational and technical education and training for the economic, technological, scientific, commercial, industrial, social and cultural development of the State with particular reference to the region served by the college.</P>
    <P>Once again I am sorry to say we have heard arguments that taking compensatory action at statutory level to reduce under-representation of women is somehow insulting and demeaning to women.  I refer in particular to the contribution made by Deputy Dukes.  To be accused of being concerned about equal treatment because of experiencing a fashionable urge is not worthy of members of his party.  He might look like a new man but he certainly does not sound like a new man.  Deputy McGrath has contributed a great deal to the recognition and acceptance of the need for gender representation and positive action.</P>
    <P>The experience of that part of the population that is underrepresented is that without a statutory requirement the ratio seldom changes.  Deputy McDowell usefully outlined to the House how legislation of this kind had a positive effect when implemented in the Nordic countries.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies put forward the case for additional higher education facilities in the greater Dublin area and in Cork, Thurles, Waterford and other areas.  I welcome the fact that Deputies Enda Kenny, Gallagher, Browne, Ring and others disassociated themselves from the derogatory term of &ldquo;outhouse&rdquo; used by Deputy Gilmore to describe the Castlebar campus.  The provision in Castlebar is significant and is making a very worthwhile contribution <Col N="1717" /> to higher education services in the region.  I draw the Deputies' attention to the fact that the steering committee on the future development of the higher education sector is making an in-depth analysis of this question including the case for Waterford, Castlebar, Thurles and Dublin, so ably put by Deputies in the past two days.  Despite reports in the media no report has yet been drawn up. An interim report will be submitted to me in November.  When I receive that interim report I will be in a position to consider that matter further.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have criticised these Bills because they do not address what they see as a wider range of problems in the colleges and institutes.  These Bills are brought forward to address the very specific problems which have arisen in the appointment of governing bodies, principally the issues of who should vote in staff elections and gender balance.  It would not be possible for the institutions to operate effectively and within the 1992 legislation unless these issues were clarified.  In all other respects the new statutory basis of the institutions has been a notable success, a fact referred to by many speakers in this debate.  I have no doubt that the institutions, like all complex organisations, have day to day problems.  Most of these can be and are resolved in a spirit of co-operation between the various interests involved.  It must be borne in mind that the legislation governing these institutions is only two years old. It is unnecessary and would be unreasonable to embark upon any widespread review of the Acts when they are still in a settling in period.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised as to the constitutionality and democratic credentials of some of the Bills' provisions. Deputies McGrath and Gilmore referred in particular to the provisions requiring that academic staff elect one man and one women as their representatives on the governing body and to the pending High Court action on this matter.  These Bills are not unconstitutional or undemocratic.  Insofar as the legal action is concerned, I do not wish to <Col N="1718" /> comment on it except to say there is nothing in the Bills which would affect the proper jurisdiction of the courts. The aim of the Bills is to bring forward certainty to matters which are at present inadequately provided for in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was it retrospective?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGrath argued that a system of a male and female panel for academic staff elections distorted the democratic process. These Bills do not impose any requirement that there should be such panels. The Bills allow the governing bodies of the institutions to decide how the staff members are to be elected to the governing bodies while ensuring that in the case of academic staff, one is a man and the other a woman.  This can be done following consultation with staff interests in a reasonable and fair way. In that regard I consider the two panel system employed by the institutions in the most recent elections to be both fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath referred to the threshold of 280 teaching hours which would be required before a staff member could take part in elections as a legislative tablet of stone.  This is not the intention or the effect of the provision. The aim is to provide that academic staff who work a minimum of 50 per cent of the current workload of full-time staff can take part in these elections.  If the number of hours worked by full-time staff were to vary the Minister could, as provided in this provision, vary the threshold for part-time staff accordingly.  Far from being inflexible tablets of stone, the provisions give the utmost flexibility to a Minister to respond as circumstances warrant so as to maintain the spirit of this legislation.  I would also point out that these provisions relating to part-time staff are specific to the election process only.  Their aim is to bring certainty to the issue of the electorate. They have no implications for any other aspect of the employment of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question <Col N="1719" /> of degree provision in the regional technical colleges.  It is important that a balance be maintained in the education sector in the levels of terminal qualifications which students attain in order to provide a balanced workforce for the economy.  In recent years there has been an increase in the degree and higher provisions in the regional technical colleges.  It is now approximately 10 per cent, which is a significant output.  Any further development must take account of national development needs.</P>
    <P>In the recognition of new courses it would be the general wish of all involved in the sector that the quality of educational provision be safeguarded for all incoming students to the colleges. Part of that safeguard lies in the insistence by the Department of Education on an appropriate preparation and lead in time for the development of new courses.  There is a responsibility on the Minister to ensure that this preparation and lead in time is observed and compliance with the 1992 Acts will guarantee this.  There have been difficulties with colleges where the necessary preparation has not taken place and this obviously has to be monitored by the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore criticised the approach to the method of appointment of students to the governing bodies.  The aim of the Bills' provisions is to ensure that the interests of students in the colleges and the institute are effectively represented.  Representations were made to me by the management of the institutions and the Union of Students in Ireland that the present system of selecting student representatives should be changed.  The procedures applying to the University of Limerick and Dublin City University were put forward as models worth adopting.  Those provisions enable the governing bodies to make whatever arrangements are appropriate in the circumstances.  They have invariably resulted in officers of the students' union being appointed to <Col N="1720" /> the governing bodies.  This has contributed to a unified system of representation for students at various levels in the colleges.  I would like to encourage this development in the case of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I have every confidence that the colleges and the students can work together to devise a system of representation in the interests of all.</P>
    <P>Deputies Cullen, McGrath and Browne raised the question of allowing the institutions themselves to put forward organisations from which nominations to the governing bodies can be made.  This proposal is an interesting one which I would be prepared to consider and I will ask my officials to consider how it might be implemented. Deputy McGrath and I will meet again on Committee Stage to discuss the proposal.</P>
    <P>I thank all those Deputies who supported the Bills, including Deputies Deenihan, Nealon, Boylan and even Deputy Dukes for raising the temperature.  I found most of the comments to be constructive.  I anticipate that the Bills will greatly assist in the continuing development of the regional technical colleges and the institute in a spirit of co-operation and inclusiveness.  The system of governance then achieved will provide a commendable model to other institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh) Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the dissolution of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards, for the sale of their ancillary businesses and for the establishment of a new national milk agency.</P>
      <P>The Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards were established in 1936 and 1937 respectively by orders made under the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936.  The boards' primary function was to ensure an adequate all-year-round supply of milk for liquid consumption in the country's two biggest urban areas.  This was achieved through the boards' power to ensure that producers received a minimum price for their milk.  Because milk production in Ireland is highly seasonal and before the boards were established, the producer price of milk sometimes fell below the cost of production, there were occasional shortages of milk for liquid consumption during the winter months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> The milk board regime provides for a &ldquo;production district&rdquo; from which dairy farmers supply milk and a &ldquo;sales district&rdquo; in which the pasteurisers and distributors must have registered premises in which to prepare milk for the consumer.  In Cork, the sale and production districts are the same; an area within a radius of about seven kilometers of the city centre.  In Dublin, the sales area is Dublin city and county together with the urban district of Bray, while the production district comprises most of Leinster.</P>
    <P>Basically, only milk supplied by producers within a board's production area who registered with the board could be used for the production of milk for liquid consumption within a board's sales district.  Milk could be brought in from outside the production area under licence in times of scarcity but this was the exception to the general rule.  The milk board's regime worked well over the years and although it has legal backing only in the Dublin and Cork areas, it provided a model for arrangements put in place in other parts of the country.  Thus, despite the highly seasonal nature of our production, winter shortages are a thing of the past and the activities of the boards were generally regarded as an important contributory factor to our high level of milk consumption.</P>
    <P>As a result of complaints from milk processors outside the board's areas, the European Commission examined the position and formally notified the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry that the board's activities were not in accordance with European Union law.  The restriction of access to the market for drinking milk in Dublin and Cork to parties within the board's areas who were registered with the boards, the licensing of any milk coming in from outside the board's areas and the fixing of minimum producer prices, were contrary to European Union rules of competition and contravened the rules for the common organisation of the market in milk and milk based products.  On the advice of the Attorney General it was <Col N="1723" /> decided not to challenge the Commission's view.</P>
    <P>There followed extensive consultations with the Commission on what measures might be put in place to ensure a steady supply of good quality drinking milk for our customers despite the highly seasonal nature of our production while keeping within the bounds of European law.  There were also extensive consultations with the dairy industry.  The fruits of this consultative process are set out in the provisions regarding the establishment of a new National Milk Agency.</P>
    <P>Apart from their statutory functions of regulating the supply and price of milk for liquid consumption, the boards, over the years, were involved in supplying services to their milk producers. These services include artificial insemination of cattle, milk recording and mastitis control.  As a consequence of these activities, the boards acquired considerable assets and built up a staff of more than 130 employees.  However, as time went on, due to developments on other fronts there was a decline in demand for the services the boards provided.  They began to lose money and it became clear that they were significantly overstaffed.</P>
    <P>When it became apparent that the boards could no longer continue on their present statutory basis the Government decided they should be wound up and their ancilliary businesses sold as going concerns.  To facilitate this sale, it was obvious that the staffing would have to be rationalised.</P>
    <P>After protracted negotiations between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the union representing the staff, an agreement was reached in January this year under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission which fully protects employees' interests in the context of the boards abolition and the sale of their ancillary business.</P>
    <P>Broadly, the terms of the agreement are as follows: some five or six staff who will be required for the new National <Col N="1724" /> Milk Agency will be recruited from among the boards' staff, always provided, of course, that a sufficient number of suitably qualified candidates apply for these posts; some 70 staff will transfer to the private sector on the sale of the ancillary businesses as going concerns.  They will have safeguards in relation to their terms and conditions of employment including, in certain circumstances, a right to return to employment in the public sector.  The agreement also provides that some 50 staff will be granted voluntary early retirement on terms similar to those which applied in the Public Service in the 1987-88 period.  Finally, the Exchequer will take over the board's pension funds and the State will assume full liability for pensions for the staff concerned in respect of their employment with the boards, on the same basis as it does for civil servants.  To fund the staff rationalisation programme and meet costs associated with the sale of the business, a sum of £1.5 million has been provided for in the Vote for Agriculture and Food 1994.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the broad considerations underlying this Bill I will now outline its provisions in greater detail.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains definitions of certain words and phrases used.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the establishment, by ministerial order, of a National Milk Agency.  The basic role of the agency will be to ensure that a reliable supply of good quality, reasonably priced milk is available to consumers throughout the year.  The agency will have a part-time chairman appointed by the Minister and representaties of milk producers, pasteurisers, distributors, retailers and consumers.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the dissolution, by ministerial order, of the Cork and Dublin District Milk Boards and the sale, which will be by competitive tender, of their ancilliary business.  It also provides for the possibility of transferring that business to an interim board.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the order which abolishes the boards will, at the same time, replace them with the new agency. <Col N="1725" /> The intention is that the ancilliary business should be sold at that time also. However, as a precautionary measure in the event of a delay in the sale of the business, the Bill has provision for an interim board, comprising three persons to be nominated by the Minister, to take over the general direction of the business until such time as the sale can be finalised.</P>
    <P>Such a transfer of assets would be technically liable to stamp duty under the 1985 Finance Act, so it is necessary to provide a statutory exemption in keeping with the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with superannuation for the board's staff.  Essentially, it provides that, when the boards are abolished, the administration of their pension schemes will become the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It confers the power to amend these schemes. In practice, the schemes will be amended to make it possible to discharge the terms of my Department's agreement with the staff &mdash; to provide enhanced severance payments as well as their entitlements under the redundancy payments legislation for temporary and seasonal staff who may be granted voluntary early retirement, and to provide notional &ldquo;additional years&rdquo; of service for permanent staff in the same circumstances.  Also, as provided for in the agreement, former and present members of these schemes or the surviving spouses of deceased members, will be afforded the opportunity of acquiring spouses and children's benefit.</P>
    <P>In this latter regard, it is necessary to amend the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1961, and this is being done by subsection (7).  Since all pensions will, from then, be guaranteed by the State, subsection (8) provides for existing pension funds to be taken over by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Sections 5, 6 and 7 deal with the central purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 makes it an offence to sell pasteurised milk for liquid consumption <Col N="1726" /> unless it has been prepared from raw milk produced on foot of a contract registered with the new agency.  There are a few necessary minor exceptions to this rule.  Section 6 contains the rules of the registration of a contract with the agency.  Basically a contract must be for a minimum period of 12 months, the raw milk supplied must be at least of the quality prescribed by law and the purchase price must, in the opinion of the agency, be adequate to compensate the producer for continuing in production during the winter months.  Section 7 requires that the agency keep a register of milk producers, processors and the contracts made between them.</P>
    <P>Section 8 requires that a levy be paid to the agency in respect of every litre of milk acquired by a processor under a registered contract.  The rate of levy will initially be set by the Minister and may subsequently be altered by the agency with the Minister's consent.  By this means it is intended that agency will be completely self-financing.  The section also deals with matters incidental to the payment of the levy, such as the requirement to furnish full information on the quantity of milk supplied so that the amount due can be calculated and it provides penalties for furnishing false or misleading returns or for non-payment of the levy.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 lay down the requirements for records to be kept and information to be furnished to facilitate the agency in its work of regulating milk supplies.  Section 11 distinguishes between information which may be published and that which must be kept confidential.  Sections 12, 13 and 14 deal with matters such as the alteration to or cancellation of registration and the admissibility of registers as evidence in the courts.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 to 23 are termed &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; provisions.  They contain no new substantive material, their function is to provide powers and impose obligations to ensure that the foregoing provisions can be efficiently and effectively implemented.  They also cover a number of necessary legal technicalities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> The Schedule to the Bill sets out detailed rules for the establishment and functioning of the new agency: I have already alluded to the most important of these.</P>
    <P>I trust I have given Deputies a clear outline of this Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  This debate has been struggling to get up and running for some time.  When the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill, 1991 &mdash; the phrase &ldquo;No. 2&rdquo; has been dropped from the title of this Bill and I can only assume this is the third attempt to legislate in this area &mdash; was debated in the Seanad on 11 December 1991 I made the point that this Bill was replacing the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Bill.  Will the Minister indicate in his reply the niceties involved in dropping the reference to &ldquo;price&rdquo; from the title of the Bill?  I suspect it was dropped because our European colleagues felt uncomfortable, during a time of deregulation and open competition, at the idea of our legislating for price control.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill the agency will largely be able to control the prices paid to producers.  There are good reasons for doing this &mdash; it is important to reward liquid milk producers particularly during the winter months when they incur extra costs.  As an aside, why was the word &ldquo;price&rdquo; dropped from the title of the Bill?  I think I am correct in assuming that this is our third attempt to enact legislation to abolish the Cork and Dublin District Milk Boards and replace them with a milk agency which will cover the entire country.  Fine Gael has no major difficulties with the Bill, which I envisage will have a fairly smooth passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to aspects of the overall milk collection system which concerned me in 1991.  I hope the Minister can give me an assurance that these matters have been rationalised to some extent and are not as chaotic as they were at that time.  In my contribution in the Seanad I naturally referred to the <Col N="1728" /> situation in Wexford.  Although Wexford would be perceived as far as removed from Cork and Dublin, many Wexford milk producers supplied excellent quality milk to the Dublin District Milk Board, which covered all of Leinster. These producers must be commended on their high production standards.  I also referred at that time to the suppliers to Snowcream Limited, which has now moved to Waterford, Wexford Creameries, whose product was new on the market in 1991 and which has since carved out an excellent niche in the Wexford market and further afield, and Slaneyside Farm Dairies.</P>
    <P>I made the point that there was an urgent need for rationalisation in terms of the milk collection system and the supply of liquid and manufactured milk to outlets.  I pointed out that lorries from co-ops and creameries were passing each other going in opposite directions, lorries on the way to the Dublin District Milk Board were passing milk lorries on their way to Waterford.  At the end of the day the consumer, who in most cases is the housewife, has to bear the extra transport costs involved. Can the Minister give me an assurance that the transportation system has been rationalised since then?  Were such problems evident in other areas?  Given transport costs, particularly for bulk milk lorries, rationalisation in this area is urgently needed.  Has the Minister a role to play in this area?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to say how the position in the 26 counties will relate to that in Northern Ireland once we enact this legislation.  How will our liquid milk production system compare with that in the North?  Will there be a conflict of interest?  Am I right in saying that the legislative position of milk suppliers in the North will change next spring and there will be no regulation of this sector generally?  What is the thinking of the Northern authorities who apparently are going in a totally opposite direction from us in terms of this legislation? Having regard to the climate in which we are living, should consideration not be given to dealing with agriculture, <Col N="1729" /> agricultural production and the interests of consumers in agricultural products on an all-Ireland basis?  Given the importance of the quality of the product to the consumer and the very strict qualitative criteria rightly demanded to safeguard the health of milk consumers, would it not make sense to negotiate with the Northern authorities to ensure that we are both doing the same in terms of liquid milk production?</P>
    <P>I would appreciate if the Minister could develop the point in regard to the unions so that the present position is beyond doubt.  Many people, mainly men, have served the Cork and Dublin District Milk Boards extremely well and efficiently since they were set up in the 1930s.  We should put on the record our thanks to them for their work.  They were responsible for ensuring a supply of liquid milk to consumers in Cork city and Dublin city during the winter months.  Prior to the setting up of these boards difficulties were regularly experienced in supplying high quality milk to consumers during the winter months &mdash; producers could not be enticed to produce high quality milk during the winter when they incurred more costs.  On behalf of Fine Gael I wish to record my thanks to all those people who staffed and operated the Cork and Dublin District Milk Boards and the ancillary services.  Many farmers had occasion to avail of the excellent AI service provided by the boards.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the other ancillary services provided by the boards.  What is the present position in regard to the sale of the ancilliary services?  Has the private sector expressed much interest in purchasing these services?  The Minister said that 70 staff will transfer to the private sector on the sale of the ancilliary businesses as a going concern and that they will have safeguards in regard to their terms and conditions of employment, including in certain circumstances a right to return to employment in the public sector.  Will the Minister develop the concept of &ldquo;certain circumstances&rdquo;?  Obviously the <Col N="1730" /> Minister has considered this point and discussed it in depth with the unions.  He must have in mind a scenario where it might be necessary to absorb these staff back into the public sector.  Will this concept create a precedent?  I find it interesting that a public sector business can be sold as a going concern to the private sector together with public servants and a clause can be included in their terms and conditions of employment under which they can be reabsorbed into the public sector if necessary.  This is an interesting provision and I would like to know the circumstances in which the Minister thinks they might be reabsorbed into the public sector.</P>
    <P>I commend our colleagues in the Seanad who have undertaken the bulk of the work on this Bill, rendering our job unusually easy.  Normally a Bill begins in this House, the initial donkey work being done by us, before it goes to the Seanad.  The excellent work done by Senators on this Bill renders our job much less onerous than we might have expected.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of contracts of a minimum of 12 months duration to ensure continuity of supply of high quality milk for the liquid milk markets generally.  Given the trading of quotas, converting assets to value on paper, in terms of contract and right to produce, will the Minister say whether such contracts will be tradeable in their own right as distinct from only when there is a sale of the dairy production facility by the farmer.  In other words if a farmer wants to get out of liquid milk production and has a two-year, three-year or five-year contract to produce liquid milk, can he trade that contract to another producer who already meets the necessary criteria, in liquid milk production?  I should like clarification of that point as it has been brought to my attention that the matter is likely to arise with the registration of contracts generally.</P>
    <P>I note that in the Seanad the definition of &ldquo;heat treated milk&rdquo; for liquid consumption was extended from the narrowest interpretation to include <Col N="1731" /> flavoured and fortified milks of all types.  It goes without saying that this new agency must bear responsibility for the quality and manufacture of all milk drinks.  Certainly I welcome the improvement effected in the Bill in that respect in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In advance of Committee Stage I am not sure I need to go through the sections in much greater detail.  I have had no indication of when Committee Stage will be taken in this House or by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  Perhaps we can be informed before proceedings conclude this evening.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael support the Bill which has been awaited for some time.  We appreciate the importance of controlling the quantity and quality of the liquid milk supply to our consumers.  We have the highest consumption of milk <i>per capita</i> in Europe and the second highest consumption world-wide with the exception of New-Zealand.  It is in the interests of all those involved in milk production, distribution and retailing that this continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>While dairy production was in difficulty for some time because of medical and scientific concerns about increased consumption of fats generally, particularly dairy fats, it would appear that the scientific world is having, if not quite a change of heart, a second thought on that.  Certainly, there are differences of opinion but, given the importance of milk to children, women and others to whom the intake of calcium and all of the other benefits conferred by the consumption of milk are absolutely essential, this is an aspect of food production and supply that must be strictly controlled.  We must ensure always that there is milk available to the liquid milk market, particularly during the difficult winter months, and that milk is produced in quantity and of a quality to meet the demands of consumers.  I should appreciate the Minister answering my queries when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the <Col N="1732" /> Minister on this important Bill and assure him of my party's support for it. Ultimately everybody's wish is that consumers obtain the purest quality milk and that producers be adequately compensated.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill are broadly agreed.  The need to establish a new National Milk Agency and replace the long-established Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards arises from the competition rules of the European Union. As the very successful operation of the liquid milk market here over the years has demonstrated the vital role proper regulatory agencies can play, it is entirely right and proper that some agency which would ensure the supply of good quality milk for human consumption at all times of the year at a reasonable price should continue to be guaranteed to individual consumers.  I understand that will be the responsibility of the new National Milk Agency. The successful record of the old milk marketing boards in maintaining year-round supply, very high standards of hygiene and reasonable price, has set the standards that must be maintained by the new agency.</P>
      <P>We must remember that the marketing and distribution of milk for household consumption is a major industry here, accounting for approximately 10 per cent of all milk produced.  It involves approximately 40 pasteurising dairies nationwide, employing approximately 5,000 people, and its overall value is approximately £300 million.  Of course, another key group is the liquid milk producers who comprise approximately 4,500 farmers.  When all of these people and their livelihoods are taken into consideration it brings home the necessity for a properly regulated market in the more competitive environment now part and parcel of our membership of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In measuring the success of the old Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards we must bear in mind the major seasonality problem encountered in milk production here given that much higher levels are produced in the summer <Col N="1733" /> months than in winter.  Nevertheless, the proper regulation of the liquid milk market over the years has ensured a constant milk supply all year round. Farmers did not receive a premium for producing milk for the liquid milk market but, given the extra costs and inconvenience incurred in winter milking, such was entirely justified.  The seasonality problem highlights the need for reasonable regulation of the liquid milk market.  The ever increasing demand of consumers for top quality, hygienic products for human consumption also underpins the necessity for proper national standards to be rigorously enforced in the production and supply of such a basic commodity as milk for human consumption.</P>
    <P>I presume the proper operation of the National Milk Agency will ensure the continuation of very high standards in the liquid milk industry through the registration of all milk producers and dairies stipulating specific technical standards along with guarantees of year-round supply.  The old district milk boards served this country well.  The best we can hope for from the new National Milk Agency, once established, is that it will continue to maintain the very high standards and uniformity of milk supply, at a reasonable price, on an all year-round basis achieved by the old district milk boards since their establishment in the thirties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very fortunate since the thirties to have had a secure domestic liquid milk supply system which has served us very well.  It has been a success story and any change must lead to even greater improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards ensured continuity of supply.  With the changes being forced on us by the European Union Directive there is an onus on the Minister to ensure there will be no breakdown in the system resulting from milk supply being affected by seasonal factors.  It needs to be recognised that trends in production have been in this direction despite all the exhortations of <Col N="1734" /> Ministers for Agriculture, the Department and the European Union.  We have to have an even distribution over the year and it is a matter of some concern that the trend is now in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>One central responsibility for the new milk agency will need to ensure there is a regular supply of milk of the highest standard.  In the past the provision of liquid milk has created opportunities for thousands of farmers and ancillary workers to live a farming life and to provide for their families.  This feature of Irish agriculture has been subject to great change.  A NESC report, due to be published shortly, points out that whereas 20 years ago the average dairy herd size in Ireland was ten cows, it is now 25 cows.  In 1966 there were 77,000 small milk producers supplying the dairy co-operatives while in 1986 there were only 25,000.  This may make sound commercial sense but it has its effect, particularly on rural life and on the rural environment which must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>How this agency performs in that context will depend, in part at least, on its composition.  We have only the vaguest indications from the schedule attached to the Bill, stating that the number of first and subsequent ordinary members will be nominated by a processor, distributor, retailing, consumer interest and that these would be appointed by the Minister.  This is far too vague and does not indicate the central role that producers and consumers must play in the new agency.  At this stage the Minister should define the appropriate number.  He has a responsibility to ensure that producers, who are a key element in the agency and consumers, upon whom, at the end of the day its success depends, are significantly represented.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the large dairy co-operatives is that they have been systematically deconstructing the relationship between co-op and farmer, upon which the movement was originally based.  This relationship has now <Col N="1735" /> become that of supplier and food processor, which is an entirely commercial relationship.  Clearly there may be points of disagreement in this new agency when it comes to setting milk prices for producers and other issues.  In the past, in relation to retailers, there was a concerted effort by a multiple chain to engage in a price war which could have had devastating consequences.  Under this Bill the Minister has an obligation to ensure that where there is disagreement an arbitration system is in place to allow for the possibility of agreement.</P>
    <P>The registration of contracts is one of the most important provisions in the Bill.  Registering contracts for at least 12 months between processors and producers ensures a constant match between supply of quality raw milk and demand for drinking milk.  The Bill further provides that contracts must offer adequate recognition for the increased cost faced by liquid milk producers, which is a guarantee for producers.  Such guarantees must be honoured in this new partnership.</P>
    <P>We only have to look at recent events in Government to see that the principles of partnership are vulnerable to being undermined.  In view of recent events in the semi-State sector, at TEAM and Irish Steel, it is worth noting that this Minister took well over two years to resolve the staffing and redundancy difficulties and rightly so.  If the end result was to overcome problems of redeployment to the satisfaction of our workers &mdash; and as public sector workers they are our workers &mdash; then the time was well spent.  I too have a question in relation to any of those who may return to the public sector: will they return without loss of status or seniority?</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note how the definition of milk has changed since 1991.  The range of forms of milk has been allowed for in the Bill to ensure that all liquid milk sold to the consumer is governed by proper regulatory controls.  Nowadays the consumer expects high standards and is entitled to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> Will the Minister clarify whether the new technology which produces super or double pasteurised milk is covered in the Bill.  Super pasteurised is the technology of the future.  It will have a dramatic effect, certainly across the European Community, in the way milk is stored and sold.  The need for refrigeration will be reduced enormously and this will have an impact on transport and the retailing of milk particularly since the problem with after taste has been sorted out.  Rapid change is a fact of life.  Will the Minister confirm that this treatment, while it may not have direct application at present to the Irish market, may well have in the future and will he ensure that the legislation is not out of kilter with scientific developments?</P>
    <P>We all support the main purpose of the Bill &mdash; to ensure a year round supply of drinking milk in the country as a whole.  Existing arrangements were declared illegal under European Union law as there was deemed to be a restriction of market access for drinking milk to registered producers, processors and distributors located in the areas concerned.  The EU also outlawed the arrangements for establishing a minimum milk price for producers.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to set up a new agency to represent producers, processors, distributors, retailers and consumers of milk.  The Bill does not specify the number of members from each of the interests, only that the appropriate number as prescribed by the Minister by order, will be appointed in each case. This is a major weakness.  At the very least, the Bill should lay down the relative proportions from the various interests.</P>
    <P>The agency is to ensure that producers are given &ldquo;adequate compensation&rdquo; for milk supplied under the contract throughout the year and particularly during the winter months. The key relationship which determines the overall structure of the industry is that between the farmers and the dairy co-operatives.  The vagueness as to the composition of the agency board <Col N="1737" /> becomes critical because it is not certain which interests may come to dominate the industry.  Comparative analysis of international trends shows that the industry squeezes farmers more and more.  A concern is that processors and large retail interests may dominate at the expense of both producer and consumer.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister about the omission in the Bill relating to the exclusion of imported milk from regulation.  Milk can easily be imported from Northern Ireland.  Any standard set by the agency must apply to imported as well as home produced milk.  No consumer would thank the Minister if the imported milk is of inferior quality if, for example, it has been produced with the help of animal milk production promoters not used here.  Section 5 (d) specifically excludes imported milk from regulation in the Bill.  The Minister should state clearly that the interest of both producers and consumers will be protected.</P>
    <P>The market we are considering is significant in terms of production and employment.  The liquid milk market is worth about £300 million a year.  Ireland has the highest level of milk consumption in the European Union.  In world terms we are high consumers of milk. While the consumption of full cream milk is static, there is growth overall. Total liquid milk sales in 1990 amounted to about 490 million litres.  In 1992 the figure was 511.8 million litres, the increase being shown in skimmed milk.  It is in the interest of everyone to ensure that milk consumption is kept as high as possible.  According to the CSO household budget survey, the average milk bill is about 9 per cent of total spending on food.  Clearly Irish people drink a lot of milk and clearly it is good for them.</P>
    <P>It is vital that milk is available to consumers at a reasonable price.  It is also important that farmers receive adequate payment for producing milk and maintaining consistently high quality standards.  The so-called &ldquo;milk wars&rdquo; may well benefit consumers in price <Col N="1738" /> reductions but ultimately, the consumer interests are not served by them. Equally, the processors can give large discounts to the multiples to increase market share.  As well as this, the multiples can get three months' credit and have the milk delivered directly to the cold cabinets.  The corner shops and the milkman do not get such favourable treatment.  Yet many people will continue to want milk delivered to their door or to pick it up at the corner shop. Eliminating this trade will mean a poorer service to the consumers as well as an overall reduction in the milk market, which would be detrimental to both consumer and producer.  We should remember that milk is an important food.  Its nutritional value, in particular to growing children and to women to protect them against osteoporosis, is well proven.  Milk also happens to be relatively cheap.</P>
    <P>A point raised by the ICMSA relates to the election of the appropriate number of producer members.  Those eligible to vote are registered producers, i.e., those farmers who have a registered contract of supply of milk for liquid consumption.  There is no provision which deals with producers who may wish to get into liquid milk production.  The ICMSA point out that this election procedure could amount to a closed shop in the sense that existing liquid suppliers, particularly in the old Dublin and Cork district milk areas, could dominate the representation of producers under the proposed system.  Such a result could lead to the exclusion of liquid milk suppliers outside these areas.  Perhaps the Minister would refer to that issue.</P>
    <P>There is one important related matter which this Bill should but does not address.  In line with EU Directives the Government will shortly be introducing a waste management Bill.  The Department of the Environment is charged with the duty of legislating in this area. However, protection of the environment must be everyone's business, if we are to tackle the problems that are costly and damaging when left unaddressed.  Good environmental practice <Col N="1739" /> dictates reuse instead of recycling or dumping.  The milk bottle is a classic example of a reuseable resource which has the added advantage of being acceptable to the consumers.  Consumers do not need to be introduced to the milk bottle.  It is a familiar part of life, but we should not underestimate its importance.  Tetrapak style packaging may serve the interests of the retailer but it is a step backwards in environmental terms.  The carton is impossible to recycle because it is made up of two materials.</P>
    <P>I understand that efforts are being made to bring in a biodegradable carton which is long overdue, but there is still a good solid argument for increasing the use of milk bottles.  A bottle can be reused 20 to 30 times and then recycled. The economic argument against bottling has to take into account the environmental cost for the equation to be correct.  With higher standards set by the EU, it is extremely expensive to provide landfill sites for dumping.  Manufacturers will increasingly have to bear the real cost of production which includes environmental costs.  In the liquid milk business, we have an opportunity to reduce the waste mountain which is not just wasteful in terms of resources, but costly in environmental and financial terms.</P>
    <P>At present, only 11 per cent of liquid milk is packaged in returnable bottles. Yet returnable containers save energy, reduce waste, preserve raw materials and reduce pollution.  Unlike current packaging, they can be made in Ireland from recycled material and thus create employment.  In December last, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, stated that Government support would be given to reuse in appropriate areas. Supermarkets &mdash; and indeed the free market &mdash; cannot be permitted to dictate to us on the protection of the environment.  In other EU countries there are rates of up to 100 per cent on the use of returnable containers.  Here in Ireland, we could begin to live up to the plethora of aspirations on this issue that <Col N="1740" /> have emanated from this Government and indeed from the last one.</P>
    <P>The public good dictates that a national milk agency be established. Leaving matters solely to the free market without any controls would cause a shortage in winter and a glut in the summer months.  Government intervention of this type makes sense.  It made sense in the 1930s too, and served the country well over the years.  In the 1990's, technological change has brought major advances.  This creates its own challenge which affects the public good.  By the year 2000, environmental factors will be part and parcel of the economic costs of production and manufacturing.  In the publication of this Bill, allowance is already established for the seasonality of milk production.  Allowance could also be made for good environmental practice which has both a cost and a benefit, but which cannot be ignored indefinitely.  Such an opportunity is offered to us in this Bill.  I hope the Minister takes it.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the purpose of the Bill is to provide for the dissolution of the Dublin and Cork milk boards and for the establishment of a national milk agency.

      <P>The operations of the Dublin District Milk Board, particularly by the Dublin dairies have been a bone of contention for many since the mid 1980s.  In 1936 and 1937 two district milk boards were set up to ensure an adequate supply of milk to the cities of Dublin and Cork.  With the seasonality of production at that time, there was a scarcity of milk during the winter months and some of the milk coming on the market was not of a high standard <Col N="1741" /> in terms of hygiene.  I recall back in the 1940s and 1950s 20 churns of milk being transported by rail &mdash; when we had a rail system in our area &mdash; from southern co-operatives to distributors in the north east.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1985 the EC was of the view that the Dublin District Milk Board was operating in a monopoly position and that it should be disbanded.  The then Government failed to respond to that observation.  I recall pressing the then Minister for Agriculture for action in that regard on many occasions.  For many years the Dublin dairies used the provisions of the 1936 Act to maintain a virtual monopoly on the supply and sale of milk to the largest Irish market, namely, Dublin city.  On the other hand, they dumped their surplus supplies all over the country without let or hindrance causing serious difficulties for small pasteurising plants and distributors in the provinces, especially those in the north east.  The Town of Monaghan Creamery was the first dairy outside Dublin to trade in liquid milk.  The previous speaker referred to Tetrapak packaging, the Monaghan dairy was the first to introduce such packaging in the 1950s.  While Deputy McManus made a case for the Dublin Glass Bottle Company, she should know that bottles have many drawbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of dairies, including the Town of Monaghan Creamery, endeavoured to enter the Dublin milk market but were blocked by the Dublin dairies.  To make matters worse, to get their own back, Dublin dairies tendered for the sale of 60,000 gallons of milk in rural areas.  A compromise was sought through the Department of Agriculture and eventually the Dublin dairies brought a High Court injunction against the Town of Monaghan Dairy which had the result of restricting the supply of milk in Dublin.  In other words, the Dublin dairies <Col N="1742" /> could sell their milk in country areas but their competitors in the country could not sell their milk in Dublin.  That ridiculous position lasted from 1985 to 1987.</P>
      <P>With a change of Government in 1987 a more civilised approach was possible. Under section 32 of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) (Amendment) Act, the Town of Monaghan Dairy applied for a licence and was successful.  That enabled it to acquire milk from its registered producers in County Monaghan for resale in the Dublin area.  The sorry saga is outlined in a letter which I sent to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey on the return of the Fianna Fáil Government to power in 1987 and which read:</P>
      <P>I wish to draw your attention to the serious situation for Monaghan farmers which has arisen following Judge Barrington's ruling in the High Court Injunction against the Town of Monaghan Creamery which restricts their supply of milk in the Dublin City area.</P>
      <P>This will mean a loss of 365,000 gallons per year, that is 1,000 gallons per day.  When this is added to the 60,000 gallons which the Town of Monaghan Creamery lost to Dublin Dairies to supply to Monaghan Hospital, it creates a serious problem not only for the Monaghan milk suppliers but also poses a threat to employment in the Creamery and the future of this enterprising Co-op.</P>
      <P>This situation has arisen as a result of the failure by the Government since 1985 to respond to the EEC Commission's opinion that the Dublin District Milk Board, who are operating in a monopoly situation under the 1936 Milk Act should be disbanded.</P>
      <P>Urgent measures are now required in order to amend this outdated Act. In the interest of fair play it is necessary that prompt action be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1743" /> While preparing this contribution yesterday I was listening on my monitor to the Leader of Fine Gael express many pious aspirations.  I then recalled the blatant monopoly position which lasted for years when he was in Government. While we called many times for the matter to be rectified, nothing was done until a caring Government who understood the position took office.  The then Minister, Senator O'Kennedy, turned the cards and gave fair play to the small producers and pasteurisers in Monaghan and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>In the milk industry quality must be of a very high standard. In the 1930s the quality of consumed milk was reasonable but the quality of milk was much lower in the separating processing for making butter.  Standards have been raised in both areas because producers who do not meet a high standard will not be allowed to stay in business.  Given the present stringent regulations I am satisfied that second grade milk is not produced and that all milk is suitable for the pasteurised milk trade.</P>
      <P>There have been changes in the milk industry and there is now skimmed milk and low fat milk.  The processing of low fat milk offloads additional butter fats on a butter market which is already experiencing difficulties.  There have been many milk promotion campaigns and the Minister should organise more. Such a campaign was launched in the Dáil restaurant, but I do not know if it was a great success.</P>

      <P>I do not go to the Dáil bar.  Milk consumption here could be increased by as much as 50 per cent.  As a member of a health board I am particularly conscious of young people's health.  Milk is one of the cheapest foods and if we consumed more it would be the best way to dispose of surplus production now that we operate under a quota system.  The manner in which multiple stores marketed milk as a lost leader in the past was a cause for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role played by roundsmen in the distribution of milk is an important one. Twenty to 30 years ago they operated only in towns and cities, now they can be found driving flashy vans, on the narrowest boreens in isolated rural areas. A story was told about two scrawny cows looking over a hedge who saw a van pass displaying a picture of a cow promoting the sale of homogenised, <Col N="1745" /> pasteurised and sterilised milk.  One said to the other, &ldquo;Daisy, doesn't that make you feel inadequate&rdquo;.  That story illustrates a changed pattern in milk distribution.  It would be a bad day if roundsmen ceased to deliver milk because of an inadequate supply.  That loss would be felt by many, particularly low income families.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill but it is nine years overdue.  It is difficult to understand and justify the long delay in the introduction of this urgently needed legislation.  Its delay has frustrated many enterprising pasteurising and dairy plants.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a case for the establishment of a milk agency, but I am concerned that future competition would lead to an inadequate supply.  There are 4,500 supliers of pasteurised milk and milk usage is 179 litres per person per year, a very high milk intake, one of the highest in Europe.  Of those 4,500 suppliers, a sizeable number live in my county mainly because many were the first to become involved in pasteurising milk.  They delivered milk to Dundalk, Bundoran, Castlebar and Athlone. Those milk producers catered for an area eight to ten times the size of their catchment area.  Having been involved in an agricultural milk co-operative I noticed the prosperity of farmers who became involved in milk production. Not only did they work seven days a week on a contract basis, they also branched out.  A recent survey of disadvantaged areas in Monaghan highlighted that many milk suppliers were involved in a fairly substantive secondary agricultural project.  Such agricultural projects include mushroom growing, poultry and egg production.  Many milk producers received a good return on their milk and were able to invest in a second enterprise.  Many people who consider such projects ideal enterprises for small farmers would be surprised that they are a secondary enterprise for many milk producers.</P>
    <P>The milk industry is very important and must maintain a high standard.  Producers say that the standard of milk is <Col N="1746" /> far higher than it should be because they find it difficult to analyse cell counts and conform with the regulations, but I believe the present quality will be maintained.  The shift in the seasonality of milk supply to an earlier calving programme in December has resulted in the highest remuneration from the sale of milk being secured through the sale of liquid milk to the processing plants.  That trend is based on the high monetary returns secured from milk production.  It was important to abolish the district milk boards and I would have no hang-up about it if that were all.  Today we got extensive documentation from the IFA on the advisability of support for this board.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Ministerial Pay Recommendations: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy John Bruton on Tuesday, 11 October 1994:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to defer implementation of the Review Body special pay award for Ministers so as to set a necessary headline in relation to overcoming the current industrial relations difficulties in State companies, maintaining control of public expenditure and improving the competitiveness of our economy.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;acknowledges the independent and expert role performed by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector over the last 25 years in providing advice on remuneration levels to the Government at various times,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" />&mdash;recognises that it has been the policy of various Governments to accept and implement the recommendations of the Review Body and that the Government accepted in principle the recommendations in Report No. 35 of the Review Body when that Report was published in 1992, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;supports the implementation of the recommendations in respect of all groups dealt with in Report No. 35, without exception, on the deferred phasing basis, extending over 1994 and 1995, decided on by the Government, this approach being in line with arrangements for other similar cases agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the context of the negotiation on the Pay Agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.&rdquo;</i></P>

      <P>It is regrettable that we are spending the first and second days of the new Dáil session engaging in a debate of this type, but I make no apologies for contributing, nor do I apologise for the stance that I and my party have taken on this matter.</P>
      <P>The massive pay hike which was awarded in a most surreptitious manner on the eve of the debate on the Beef Tribunal report was as cynical as it was unjustified.  In any business the underlying thread is that of performance and remuneration is linked to performance and productivity.  Not so in regard to the business of this Government.  Our Constitution, a solemn document which underpins the existence of democracy in this State, expressly states that the Government shall be responsible at all times to Dáil Éireann.  This fundamental provision has been flouted consistently by Ministers who regard the Dáil as at worst, a nuisance and at best a rubber stamp for decrees and ordinances of this tarnished flying circus masquerading as a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> Frequently important matters of public concern brought to the attention of the Taoiseach are disallowed and questions are transferred or watered down and replied to by way of bland statements lacking in information and dressed up as answers.  The mantra of the Government &mdash; and I have heard it more from the Minister of State opposite, Deputy Fitzgerald, than from anybody else &mdash; appears to be to flaunt empty formulas about ethics, accountability, transparency, openness, and freedom of information while the day to day practice of the House is one that imparts as little information as possible to Deputies on matters of grave public concern.  I am not surprised, because the concepts of accountability, openness and freedom of information are alien to Fianna Fáil as they are to any party which has held the reins of power in any State for such uninterrupted period of time as have Fianna Fáil since the foundation of this State.</P>
    <P>It is no surprise then that the Taoiseach, Leader of Fianna Fáil, and his Ministers become confused on the matter of the national interest because for Fianna Fáil the national interest is and always has been the party interest, and the Government of this State becomes proprietorial in nature.  The European league table or comparison of ministerial salaries and allowances that was read into the record of the House last night by numerous Deputies in the course of this debate is self-explanatory. However, coupled with the elaborate cushion of handlers, and fondlers, advisers and spin doctors and family assistants all paid for by the Exchequer, it is a sad commentary on Irish public life which, in time, will be judged by the people.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Finance who has graced the House with his presence again this evening failed miserably in his defence of the indefensible.  I ask the Minister who made particular reference last night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It obviously suits the Minister and his partners in Government to ensure that the debate is as limited as possible.  The Minister, in defence of the indefensible, referred last night to the Gleeson report, No. 35.  If the Minister was quoting from the report, why did he not tell us that the recommended salary for the Taoiseach, high as it was, was £88,000 and not £94,000 as it is now?  Why has the Government awarded itself an amount in excess of that proposed in the Gleeson review?  Why is the Tánaiste's awarded salary higher than the £75,500 recommended by Gleeson?  It is worth bearing in mind that the Gleeson report made no reference to the office of the Tánaiste which is costing the taxpayer in excess of £1.5 million a year on top of the £80,000 that he has now awarded himself.  Why has the Government used the Gleeson Commission in an attempt to justify increases even higher than the very generous award proposed by that committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the few minutes available to me and having regard to the fact that at 8.30 this evening the Government will vote down the Fine Gael motion with the might of 31, or 35 or 36 &mdash; its majority is so big they sometimes lose sight of the figures themselves &mdash; I propose that the Government defer acceptance of this award until such time as the terms of the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i> have been substantially <Col N="1750" /> implemented.  This will allow Ministers an opportunity to justify in some degree the present outrages and unnecessary exercise in pocket-lining.  It is no more than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  These awards are the recommendation of Gleeson.  We did not put that recommendation into operation at the time the report was issued.  It must be remembered that a number of other categories is getting awards also and I have not heard anyone say they were not entitled to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has had his say.  I have had experience in four Governments over eight years and we sometimes work 18 hours a day or more.  Many would say that Ministers are birds of passage.  Members of Cabinet and junior Ministers come and go, and I have seen Ministers fail to get re-elected.  The reason was that, given their responsibilities in their various Departments, they were unable to attend to the many pressing local issues in their constituencies.</P>
      <P>I would like to know whether the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Bruton, will give back to the Exchequer the increase he will get in his pension. That will be the test.  It is easy to be hypocritical, but it will not take the public long to cop on to that.</P>
      <P>I recall the Minister for Finance in the 1980-81 period writing to all those in Government at the time asking us to forfeit our ministerial increases.  I agreed reluctantly and, if memory serves me right, I included a memorandum to the Minister for Finance to the effect that we would get very little thanks from the electorate.  I was proved right in that it was soon forgotten.  I do not know of anyone, either inside or outside this House, who has refused a pay increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read today with great interest that <Col N="1751" /> RTE has employed a new presenter of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;.  It is alleged that that person will receive a six figure salary.  I do not begrude anyone their salary, but we should not be told we are not entitled to our salary.  It is all right for those who have the media and the national network at their disposal to do what I call a cheap phone-in.  Why, when RTE appeared before the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies, did it refuse to give an account of the salaries paid to many of the personnel in that organisation?  I do not begrudge anyone in RTE their salaries, but what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</P>
    <P>It will be interesting to see how many members of Fine Gael who were in Government down the years will return the increase in their pensions.  From speaking to people in Fine Gael, many of them do not agree with this motion, but they must follow their Leader.  At one time if you took the shilling, you carried the can and followed the band.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a long time in Laoighis-Offaly and took on every challenge in that constituency, which looked after me very well.  When the time comes again I will ask the electorate to support me and my party. There is a perception that Members of this House are not entitled to their salaries.  I have been in this House for almost 26 years and I know of many good Members across the political divide who failed to be re-elected and were left in poor circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in another forum, a person with a good job must think twice before standing for election to the Dáil, and that is very sad.  The Oireachtas makes legislation and it would be regrettable if people of good calibre declined to put their names forward for election.  Many would not put forward their names because of the &ldquo;stick&rdquo; they would receive from the public.  Over the years <Col N="1752" /> even backbench TDs and Senators have received an amount of abuse which would not be tolerated by anyone else.</P>
    <P>Many Members of the House work seven days a week, with very little time off.  They are at every beck and call. Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas are accessible to the public on all issues.  They attend functions relating to housing associations and other issues and do not return home until late at night or the following day. Members' families also carry a great burden.</P>
    <P>I should have pointed out earlier that I wish to share my time with Deputy Liam Lawlor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The new committee system that has been put in place makes an even greater demand on Ministers.  I am glad to speak on this motion and I speak from experience.  It may not be nice to say this but the reality is that all Ministers are birds of passage.  The increases were recommended in the Gleeson report and, if memory serves me correctly, in 1983 the then Minister, John Boland, granted us a substantial increase and my party accepted it.</P>
      <P>On the question of the salary of a Deputy, if we were to work the same number of hours worked in any other employment we would receive far higher remuneration.  I would not begrudge any of the people on the list I have an increase but in general they work from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., can organise a golf outing during the weekend and return on the Monday morning.  No Deputy, or Minister in particular, can do this.  In Government there is always something happening, particularly at weekends.  Even though a Minister may have arrangements made he could be called upon to remain in the Department, sometimes on a Sunday.</P>

      <P>I do not begrudge Ministers any increase and I never have but I would be interested to know if Deputy Bruton will sign on the dotted line and refuse for the good of the country, to accept the increase.  I would also be interested to know how many more will do so.</P>

If these people are prepared to give of their time it is not too much to expect the Head of the Government to attend their meetings. This involves a 36 hour round trip.  I know that Deputies Bruton and Owen have travelled extensively but foreign travel is no great pleasure or bed of roses for those who have to travel.  After a week or two one has had plenty.</P>

    <P>Deputy John Bruton's nominees on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were asked to go to the Gleeson Commission.  There is a need for reform and probably no one knows better than a former Minister for Finance the reason the issues have arisen in this way.  Previous Administrations decided to forego pay adjustments in the national interest and this impacted on not only Ministers but on chief executives of semi-State companies and senior civil servants.  How often has it been said in the course of the debate that people in the semi-State sector are grossly underpaid for the responsibility of managing such large organisations? Mr. Dermot Gleeson addressed all <Col N="1758" /> these issues objectively taking cognisance of history.  Under a former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, Members had to forego a pay increase in the national interest and that was perceived as a cynical exercise rather than a wonderful gesture.  People now perceive that an increase awarded independently should be given.</P>
    <P>Opposition Members are critical of the level of income and backup for the work of politicians.  Great strides were made particularly by Mr. Charles Haughey as Taoiseach who introduced many intelligent reforms and provided a backup to politicians.  Negatively criticising a selective recommendation will probably be seen for what it is, a cheap political attempt to criticise the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Members of the Government.  Are the Members opposite prepared to have the increase rescinded?  Will they forego the increase?  If they are sincere why did they not table an amendment to all the recommendations so that nobody would have an increase?  Is the Leader of the Opposition trying to placate his party backbenchers by accepting the 3 per cent increase?</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that whatever Mr. Dermot Gleeson recommended is equitable and correct.  The increase also applies to senior <Col N="1759" /> civil servants, chief executives and other key personnel in semi-State organisations.  For far too long there has been an apologetic attitude among those who take public office.  This criticism is a cheap attempt to demean the office and role of those who hold public office.</P>
      <P>A great many people calculate income at an hourly rate.  Every politician in this House knows, because we all probably work similar hours, that to combine the work of a Deputy and Taoiseach the Taoiseach puts in 12 to 14 hours a day for six days a week and with the normal annual break, which the Taoiseach is recorded as having this year, it works out at something less than £3 per hour, £2.87 if calculated on a 12 hour working day.  That is proof of the petty political nonsense in which the Members opposite are engaged.  The Opposition should be objective and table an amendment to cancel the increase for everyone or let the independently awarded increase be given.</P>

      <P>The task given to the Gleeson review body was to look at the pay levels of a small number of elite public servants, including Members of this House and Government Ministers. The review body has come up with recommendations, the scope of which no other tribunal, with the possible exception of the beef tribunal, has ever recommended.  It recommends, with no distinctions, except for a minor one in the case of the leader of the main Opposition party, a salary of £32,700 for a TD; a salary of £95,920 for the Taoiseach, the differential being £63,220, the largest such differential ever recommended in the history of the public service, and I speak with some authority <Col N="1760" /> on that subject.  The differential before the Gleeson recommendation was £51,525, a rather adequate differential I would have thought.  The differential between a TD and a Cabinet Minister is now £43,600, again an enormous and unprecedented differential compared to the pre-Gleeson figure of £33,684 which I submit demonstrated a very healthy regard for one's betters.  It is intriguing to reconcile the relative scant regard of the review body for the hod carrier TD with the fulsome provision made for that TD when he becomes a Minister.  I recently began to detect an apparently more benign disposition among those working in a high earning legal environment towards political office holders as compared with those in Opposition who peel the potatoes.  In this case the review body simply got it wrong.  The differentials between TDs and Cabinet Ministers are simply not justifiable and the Government has compounded that error.</P>
      <P>The salaries recommended for the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Cabinet Ministers exceed acceptable levels in the eyes of reasonable people and it would have been to the advantage of the Government and of politics if the Cabinet had modified them &mdash; which it was perfectly free to do &mdash; to bring them more into line with salary levels in keeping with the reality of our significance as a country in the wider realm of things. Instead, the Government sought to introduce this package of outlandish increases, almost by stealth and on the eve of the IRA cease-fire.  Our political leaders are losing the run of themselves: trains, yachts and planes are the everyday currency of this Government.  Top salaries and top hotels and an entourage of advisers are reminiscent more of feudal times than of a 20th century democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Gleeson package the public can buy three TDs for one Taoiseach or two and a half TDs for one Minister.  It must be sobering for my colleagues on <Col N="1761" /> this side of the House to reflect on this quantum of their worth as they look across at the Government benches. Take, for example, the Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Woods, who was recently in charge of the country for a day because the rest of the Government was in exile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Minister Woods doubled his radio figure of £100 million to £200 million in <i>The Irish Times</i> of the following day.  He said that was the amount the social welfare amnesty would bring in.  According to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General it has brought in less than £1 million and, of course, it was only a figleaf to divert attention from the tax amnesty which gave away hundreds of millions of pounds to tax cheats and other evaders who owed money to the Exchequer. Is a man who cannot tell the difference between £1 million and £100 million worthy of £76,300 before perks?  I submit he is not.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, was so preoccupied with Cabinet-making at the end of 1992 that his Government cost the country £400 million because of devaluation.  Is he worth £76,300?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister for Education, Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach, worth £76,300? <Col N="1762" /> She put her first legislation since entering Cabinet through the House today.  I suggest this Minister is not worth £76,300.</P>
    <P>With these salaries and perks it is no wonder Albert and Dick kissed and made up at Baldonnel.  I thought Deputy Bruton's suggestion last night of a theme tune &ldquo;Leaving on a Jet Plane&rdquo; was entirely inappropriate for the occasion.  I had in mind something from <i>Casablanca.</i> It was stated on the RTE news last night that the Tánaiste was late for the Cabinet meeting because of fog at Farranfore.  I do not know if there was any fog at Baldonnel but if there was, it would be ideal for the video for the next election.  There is fog at Baldonnel, the Government jet is whirring in the background, Dick meets Albert and they decide to kiss and make up, round up the usual suspects &mdash; the media made it all up.  A deputation will be sent to meet the RTE Authority, in case they are not sufficiently cowed, because they are criticising us on the Pat Kenny and Gay Byrne shows.  They will say, of course, that it never really happened &mdash; it was about the system of judicial appointments.</P>
    <P>During the recent collective loss of nerve by the Labour Party backbenchers, many of them unconsciously joined in the mantra about how well the Government was doing before the hiccup on judicial appointments.  Deputy Shorthall stated: &ldquo;The economy is booming, all the indicators are right&rdquo;. Literally thousands of Deputy Shorthall's constituents in Finglas and Ballymun must be very surprised to hear about this booming economy.  Approximately 315,000 unemployed and those on make work schemes around the country must be very surprised to hear that Labour now regards them also as being invisible.  They know Fianna Fáil regards them as being invisible but it will plunge them into deeper despair that Labour also regards them as being the casualties of a booming economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1763" /> The Taoiseach today during Question Time introduced a farcical note when he said he could not understand what all the fuss was about for £3 per hour.  I realise figures are not the Taoiseach's strong suit but no matter how many times one divides three into 95,920 one cannot get £3 per hour or one will certainly get more hours than there are in the week.  I understand the origin of this figure is the general secretary of Fianna Fáil who told Pat Kenny that all the fuss was about the Taoiseach getting £3 per hour.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach showed the same casual grasp of figures before the beef tribunal and again during the £8 billion debate.  It seems we have a Taoiseach who cannot count and a Tánaiste who does not count.  Are these men worth the salaries suggested for them which Deputy Lawlor is heroically and loyally defending?  There has to be a reasonable measure fixed.  Six thousand clerical assistants in the public service enjoy per annum less than half of the increase to the Taoiseach.  A long term unemployed man with two children receives only £124 per week.  A person in retirement with a dependent spouse receives £116.20 per week. There is no regard either for workers who are paying their just taxes and creating wealth in the economy and <Col N="1764" /> whose total average industrial earnings are approximately equivalent to the amount the Taoiseach will receive by way of increase.</P>
      <P>I accept the jobs of Taoiseach and Tánaiste cannot be compared with those of the average industrial worker. It is fair to say they cannot be compared with somebody who is unemployed.  It is proper that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste be paid a salary commensurate with their office.  There are limits, however, and any Taoiseach or Cabinet Minister who cannot recognise these limits against the wider background I have described is scarcely suitable for a leadership position in a democratic society.  Any prudent Taoiseach or Tánaiste who would press ahead with the implementation of these enormous increases at a time of such parsimony in pay increases generally in the public service, not to mention the awful endemic concentrations of poverty, is guilty at a minimum of bad judgement.</P>
      <P>The only defence offered by the Minister for Finance for this appalling lapse of sensitivity on the part of the Government was that the report from an independent body would have to be implemented.  How many reports from independent bodies are groaning on the shelves of different Government Departments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

How many of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation have been implemented?  How many more reports are there from independent bodies, yet the Minister could not find it in himself to modify or gradually phase in these increases over a period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government Ministers and politicians generally should be paid adequately but <Col N="1765" /> comparisons with top salaries in the private sector are valid only up to a point.  There may be an argument in the marketplace for paying top chief executives in semi-State companies, for example, commensurate with their private sector colleagues, but political leaders must have some sensitivity to their constituency and to the plight of people generally and this Government has become so carried away with its own bloated self image that it has proceeded to sneak these increases in on the eve of the ceasefire in the hope that people will not note it.  It is a shame on the Labour Ministers that they ratified this, it is something that will come back to haunt them.  Ordinary people are not fools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party I support the Fine Gael motion which is straightforward.  I note what the Minister for Finance said when he desperately tried to defend his position by stating it is inconsistent to talk about the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and not to mention Deputies who received a fairly small salary increase by comparison.  It is also important to bear in mind the salary increases given to senior management in semi-State bodies, the lack of accountability and the problems in some of the companies.</P>
      <P>As a single person, my salary increase does not cause me any great feeling of guilt given that most of it is taken back by the Minister for Finance in taxation. However, that is not the main thrust of people's venom although the media report of politicians getting huge increases has not helped.  It is the top dogs or the élite in Government who are getting the lion's share.  When reporting such matters it is important to be accurate and focus attention on the correct areas.  I have been told in my constituency that I am getting a pay rise equivalent to an industrial wage.  Such remarks reflect the generalisations made in the media.  That needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" /> The Minister is codding himself if he thinks the ceasefire will provide sufficient smoke to hide behind.  People's memories are not that short although we are often told in politics that they are.  The rise given to senior politicians and senior management in the semi-State sector will be a thorn in the side of the Government parties.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quick to give an increase to top politicians and senior semi-State management but is in no hurry to pay money owing to Kerbside which continues to employ people by borrowing from the private sector. Money was sanctioned by the Government for this company to help it provide a socially useful service but the Minister is holding on to it.  I cannot understand how he is so quick to implement parts of the Gleeson report and so hesitant to pay people who earn between £50 and £160 a week and who provide a service which saves him and his Cabinet colleagues facing increased unemployment and environmental degradation.  He is aware of the difficulties of waste disposal.  All those irreconcilable facts should impinge on the Government and cause it to reflect.  I am not too worried if the Minister takes back the 3 per cent pay rise he gave me, it hardly pays for the newspapers I buy.  It is not a great deal and if he does take it back I am sure he will find a useful cause on which to spend it.</P>
    <P>We spend much time in the House talking about TEAM &mdash; there is hope for it now although there is still cause for concern &mdash; yet we do not spend too much time questioning salary increases for semi-State management.  A number of small companies have gone to the wall as a result of the management strategy adopted in An Post during the postal strike in May 1992.  I received a letter today from a company who will close by the end of the year as it has not recovered from the impact of a management decision to withold pay from staff <Col N="1767" /> in the spring of 1992.  The staff were forced to obtain a court order to get their rightful pay.  Lack of accountability in the semi-State sector is being rewarded. The Government should not only take note of that but should be aware that people are beginning to realise there is a golden circle and that those within it reward themselves and cod themselves we are on the road to economic recovery.  That is true for a few people.  The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.  There is an element of dallamullóg involved.  I hope the Labour Party has some effect on the Minister for Finance and his insensitivity in granting huge pay increases while people continue to scrape through on very little.  If it does, it will restore some of the credibility it lost as a result of the infighting between the parties.  It should be in Government to represent those who are less well of and find it difficult to survive in the free trade type of economy which has developed.  Unfortunately, Labour is seen to bolster up and protect those who are quite happy to reward themselves.  They try to justify the unjustifiable and it is pathetic to hear some of the arguments put forward.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil often talks about its natural coalition partner, the Labour Party and I wonder if Labour has become like the top dogs in Fianna Fáil or if Fianna Fáil has codded itself into thinking it has become a socialist party.  This action gives the lie to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am angry that the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and other Ministers saw fit to accept increases in recent weeks.  It was extraordinary that the announcement was made on the day the Dáil resumed to discuss the report of the Beef Tribunal.  It was also the day we received news of the ceasefire.  I hope the ceasefire works for all our sakes but that does not justify the Taoiseach giving himself an increase of <Col N="1768" /> £13,900 or 17 per cent when an ordinary person is expected to accept a 2 per cent increase.  The Taoiseach will receive a salary of £95,000-plus, three times the salary of a TD.  Lumping all politicians in the same basket has brought politics into disrepute.  The majority of people do not read the small print and, therefore, believe all politicians have received an increase of 17 per cent.  As a single person, I have received a very small increase, while some allowances which were not taxable have been cut.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is now the second highest paid prime minister in Europe while the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, the man who was going to bring honesty into politics, is paid more than the British Prime Minister, John Major.  The Taoiseach has received an increase of £267 per week.  We have been told that he is paid £2.90 per hour while the Tánaiste is paid £2.30 per hour.  Deputy Lawlor must have got his figures mixed up with the increase in the old age pensions for a man and his wife &mdash; a widower only received an increase of £1.80 per week.</P>
      <P>These increases were announced at a time when the Government was supposed to be negotiating with TEAM Aer Lingus &mdash; the dirty work was done by clerical staff and others who thankfully were prepared to do it.  I thank them for this work and I am glad TEAM Aer Lingus and Irish Steel are still viable to some extent.  What will happen to the ESB and Telecom Éireann?  Will those companies be told they will have to bite the bullet while the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Ministers go free, so to speak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Prime Minister receives £1,377 per million people he represents while the Taoiseach receives £27,400 per million people he represents.  It is hardly surprising that we find it difficult to get support at EU summits for the £8 billion package which was supposed to be in the bag at the time this great Government was formed.  That money <Col N="1769" /> was used to cement the partnership &mdash; everybody wanted to get in on the act so that they could be involved in the handouts.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance must find it difficult to tell the people of Dublin that they will not receive all the goodies originally proposed.</P>

      <P>I assume the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance decided that if the lawyers involved in the beef tribunal could be paid millions of pounds then they should get an increase in their salaries: if their good friends got £2.74 million they were entitled to an increase. People living in rural areas in County Cavan who have to pay £800 each to have the roads repaired &mdash; this is properly the responsibility of the Government &mdash; are not very happy about the increase in the Taoiseach's salary.</P>
      <P>Law clerks, some of whom did a lot of the work for the solicitors and barristers involved in the beef tribunal, are not too happy about these increases.  I received a letter from a law clerk which stated:</P>
      <P>We have received recently the wage proposals from the Law Clerks Joint Labour Committee.  My position is that not only will there be a slight increase in my gross wage but there will be a decrease in my net income, and this in spite of an increase in the cost of living.</P>

    <P>This young lady is paid a gross salary of £170.28 per week and after PAYE, £12.36, and PRSI, £9.37, are deducted she has a take home pay of £148.55.  She has received an increase of £3.50 per <Col N="1770" /> week, giving her a gross salary of £173.78 per week.  After PAYE, £13.28, and PRSI, £13, are deducted she will have a take home pay of £146.94, a reduction of £1.50.  How can we tell people whose take home pay will be reduced by £1.50, a widow or widower who got an increase of £1.80 per week and the majority of people who will get an increase of 2 per cent that the increase of £267 per week in the Taoiseach's salary is fair?</P>

      <P>The Opposition has been indulging in an orgy of populist cant and distortion on the matter of the proposed pay increases.  In so doing they have denigrated their profession. In the pursuit of cheap headlines they have compounded public cynicism about politics.  In the bluster the facts <Col N="1775" /> have been obscured.  In particular, a set of myths has sprung up about the Taoiseach's pay in comparison with that of other European prime ministers.  Once again the Opposition has played fast and loose with the facts.  So-called league tables have appeared in newspapers purporting to give the relevant facts.  They are inaccurate.  I will give the true state of affairs in regard to prime ministers' pay.  For example, in Belgium the pay of the prime minister is £88,000 plus an official residence; in Denmark the relevant figure is £87,141 plus an official residence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government amendment proposed by the Minister for Finance is quite extraordinary.  The Minister expected us to feel sympathetic towards him because he had no choice and had to take on board all of the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  I do not know whether I am stupid &mdash; I have never been called terribly stupid &mdash; but I want the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, to take on board some information.  Contained in the Minister's amendment last evening were the words &ldquo;...the Government accepted in principle &ldquo;the recommendations in Report No. 35 of the Review Body when that Report was published in 1992,&rdquo;.  I have a copy of the relevant pages of that report to hand, dated 30 April 1992.  On page 141, paragraph 1.21 of that report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recommend that the remuneration of the Taoiseach, as head of the <Col N="1777" /> Government and holder of the highest political office in the land, should be £88,000 a year.</P>
    <P>At present the Taoiseach is in receipt of £82,020.  Paragraph 1.22 states:</P>
    <P>We recommend a rate of remuneration of £70,000 a year for the office of Minister.</P>
    <P>Yet in the announcement we see that they were awarded £76,300.  Paragraph 1.23 states:</P>
    <P>We consider that the Tánaiste should continue to be paid more than other Ministers; we recommend an annual rate of remuneration of £75,500.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste was awarded £82,295. Now I understand what the words &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; mean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>A golden principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>They accepted the main recommendations of the report in principle and then added, in the case of the Taoiseach, an extra £7,920, in the case of the Tánaiste an additional £6,795 and in the case of Ministers an additional £6,300.  The crocodile tears of our hero, the Minister for Finance, last evening cut no ice with us.  Their interpretation of the words &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; means that they accepted the recommendations of that review body and added to them. Not alone does the Minister expect us to accept that the Taoiseach deserves a salary increase of £13,900 but he wants us to give him a Longford-based Chequers.  If giving the Taoiseach an official residence would mean that he would spend some time in the country, I suppose the suggestion would contain some merit.  The Minister for Finance claims that these Ministers, particularly the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, deserve these excessive increases because of the ceasefire in the North, claiming that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste are worth every penny of that increase to which they <Col N="1778" /> have been independently deemed to be entitled.  It gives a new meaning to the term &ldquo;peace dividend&rdquo;.  An additional £267 a week surely is some peace dividend for the Taoiseach, as is an additional £230 a week extra for the Tánaiste.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has rejected our motion and has called it, among other things, a cynical exercise.  I note that he passed on those words to some of his back benchers.  If the Minister does not want to listen to the Opposition he should take heed of the public discontent and anger at the extravagance of these pay increases and the manner of their announcement.</P>
      <P>I wondered whether I had missed something to date in the term of office of this Government, that perhaps when introducing the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> they had hinted there would be this type of increase for themselves because they were so competitive.  You can bet your life they are competitive; there is more competition between the Taoiseach and Tánaiste than between any public and private sector business.  I thought that, perhaps, they had reminded us that there were some who were more worthy of larger increases than others.  I shall quote from the speech of the Minister for Finance as reported in the Official Report of 4 March 1994 at column 1698, as follows:</P>
      <P>These aspirations must be seen in the context of 3.5 of the programme which states that the pursuit of economic stability on which increased employment is dependent, requires &ldquo;significantly greater restraint on public expenditure than has existed for the past three years, particularly in relation to current expenditure&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these increases to the Minister for Finance, his fellow Ministers and the <Col N="1779" /> Taoiseach and Tánaiste are not current expenditure, I do not know what they are.  I would remind him to read what he told us here on 4 March 1994 were the benchmarks of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> He told us there had to be constraint in public expenditure and in current expenditure and instead we get these enormous increases.  We have heard much to suggest that they are deserved and that they are worth every penny and pound. There are very few pennies in this increase, it is all pounds.</P>
    <P>If one calculated how many minutes, hours and days the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have spent here it would beggar description as to how any Minister for Finance could expect any worker in the public or private sector to accept that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste's productivity, particularly in the past four to five weeks, in any way deserved these increases.  If anything, they should have announced that because they had been out of the country so often, because they had the benefit of the jet and the helicopter, the foreign travel, all the meals abroad and so on, they would give up some of their income.  It is not unusual&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Yesterday, outside this building a group of men who served this country honourably in the <Col N="1781" /> United Nations services overseas, complete in the UN blue berets and walking sticks and who are paid minimal pensions, carried placards to tell us what had been done to them by Fianna Fáil. The Gleeson Commission recommended a certain pension for those who had served in the United Nations, the Government of the day changed it and reduced their pension rights.  The Government has now decided it has to take on board everything Gleeson said and more besides.  I want to know from the Government in reply to this debate &mdash; which they will not do tonight but I hope they will do so elsewhere &mdash; why it changed the Gleeson recommendation for these fine men who served this country so well and whose productivity was greater per man hours than that of the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste.  The Finanna Fáil Party is hurt to the quick following the poll in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government has <Col N="1782" /> already cowed RTE into submission. When the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, goes out to RTE he will recite a poem or read some prose to them.  Those in the press gallery look forward to this meeting.  The Government is hurt by the criticism.  On the basis of its behaviour in the past few weeks, if the Government had gone to the country, that criticism would be nothing to the criticism they would have met at the doors.  If the Government thought it was difficult canvassing in 1981 it was nothing compared with what they would meet this time.  The Government has an opportunity to salvage some of the self esteem they lost during the past few weeks but which has been leaking away for the past two years, in fact since the Government was formed because it was shaky from the beginning.</P>

      <P>If the Government wants to salvage some of its self-esteem it should say the Ministers, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste will forego these increases as Ministers in other countries have done when their economies need such sacrifices.  How can the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, go on radio stations and say to the media that despite all the wonderful fundamental improvement in growth and so on we should not expect too much in the budget?  The widows, the handicapped and the pensioners will have to pay for these increases.  The Minister has warned that the money in the coffers and the savings arising out of a reduction in borrowings will not be available to widen tax bands or make life easier for the women whose income is £51 a year over the limit to obtain a third level grant for her son.  He cannot take up his place in university because she does not have the necessary fees and maintenance costs.  That woman is <Col N="1783" /> paying for these increases.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, has had her head buried deeply in something during this debate.</P>

      <P>The decision by the ferry operators, Pandoro, to withdraw from transporting weanling cattle to Spain, Italy and France last week has caused consternation in the farming world.  Particularly badly hit are farmers with weanlings for sale as export markets are vital to keep prices up.  It is estimated that some weanling prices are reduced by as much as £50 per head and nobody knows what will happen if such exports are permanently disrupted.  It is ironic that there are no shortage of customers in Spain and Italy for our best weanlings and unlike live cattle exports to the so-called Third World countries EU subsidies are not granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The live trade for weanlings is vital to our economy.  Last year 33,000 weanlings and 71,000 calves were exported live.  This year alone up to 14 days ago 19,000 weanlings and 59,000 calves were exported to Europe.  The weanling business is just getting into full swing and it will be disastrous if a certain amount of the animals cannot be exported.  Our weanlings are in much demand on the Continent and it makes good sense to keep those contacts open at a time when we have a record number of one million suckler cows.  Failure to copperfasten this vital export trade will cause a glut <Col N="1787" /> here in a few years time when each animal could be devalued by as much as £150 per head.</P>
    <P>There has been a concerted campaign by animal rights organisations to stop the live shipment of all UK animals and some of these groups hold extreme views on the matter.  It is in everybody's interest &mdash; farmers, exporters and continental buyers &mdash; that cattle are exported in suitable conditions which would ensure their safe arrival in good condition.  Continental buyers will not pay for anything less than the proper product and many of the continental buyers have great praise for well fed and well handled animals.</P>
    <P>I was astounded to hear a spokesman for one of the animal rights associations say to the Minister on RTE last week he believed cattle should not be exported live from Ireland.  When the question was put to him, who would pay farmers for their huge drop in income, he blissfully told the listeners that it was up to the Government and the EU to compensate farmers for this loss.  It appears that many people are still living in Rip Van Winkle land.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to understand that because of the all time record number of suckler cows in the West of Ireland it is vital to have good live outlet trade. The Minister has not performed well. That lone telephone call to the shipping magnate, Lord Stirling, was not enough. The Minister should have done much more, and he does not have to go on bended knees either.  Ferry companies are here to make money; they ferry more than cattle.  If the Minister was interested in this trade he would speak to Lord Stirling in person.  Perhaps the reason the Minister is not there is because it is not far enough away.  If it was Russia or China the Government jet would be available.  Perhaps it was that the Government jet was not available.  Many people are extremely worried about the Minister's handling of this matter and some of the comments he made earlier this year about the live <Col N="1788" /> cattle trade are coming back to haunt him.  There are many whose incomes depend on this weanling trade and the Minister should do something about it immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>My constituents in the west are concerned because it is a very good trade there.  I agree with Deputy Connaughton that the Government has washed its hands of this.  I propose &mdash; and this is a serious proposal &mdash; that the Government buys a ferry of its own.  I have had many telephone calls to my clinic expressing concern about this issue and the Government does not seem to be concerned about it.  I hope the Minister has some very good answers and does more than make one telephone call.  If necessary the Government should provide a ferry.  Perhaps the Ministers could use it and they might not go so far or so fast out of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acutely conscious of the problems posed by the withdrawal of Pandoro from the livestock shipping trade to the Continent. This decision was foreshadowed by the decisions of all the livestock transporters operating on the English Channel route between England and France to ban the carriage of livestock on their ferry routes because of pressure from animal welfare groups in the UK. Despite this the short notice eventually given of the decision by Pandoro to ban livestock from their Rosslare/France ferry was unacceptable in normal commercial operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background in this matter is concern among animal welfare interests about the carriage of livestock over long distances.  There is merit in the argument that unnecessary transport of animals does not make sense, but the realities are that it is not always possible for various reasons such as climate, land productivity, agricultural practices, etc., <Col N="1789" /> to reconcile the availability of animals with demand.  Consequently, circumstances dictate that the animals must be brought to the location of demand.  In this respect, Ireland is a case in point. We are, by virtue of our climate a major producer of cattle and sheep and, because our production systems are based almost entirely on grass, surpluses of animals arise at certain times for which markets must be found.  We remain committed, of course, to supplying markets to the greatest possible extent with beef rather than live animals.  Market circumstances &mdash; and the need for essential competition &mdash; require, that we be able to export live animals also.  Therefore, we need acceptable shipping facilities from Ireland.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the word &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo;. We do not have a policy of selling at all cost without regard to the needs of the animal.  Animal welfare is a major concern of Ireland, first because it is an objective necessity, second we cannot antagonise our customers by falling down on welfare and third it does not make sense to have animals arrive at a destination in anything but the best possible condition.  We are conscious of our obligations in this respect and have on many occasions refused permission for consignments to unsuitable locations by unsuitable vessels.  I assure the House that we apply the highest standards.  All animals are inspected by a State veterinarian and a certificate of fitness to travel is issued.  The ships on which the animals are transported must be approved in advance, with stringent regulations applied to ventilation, drainage, feeding and watering of the animals.  Veterinary inspectors accompany selected consignments to their destination to monitor the well-being of the animals.</P>
    <P>In addition the welfare requirements laid down by the European Union require the preparation of a route plan for long journeys and this is also strictly <Col N="1790" /> enforced.  The EU is at present engaged in supplementing its welfare rules with detailed rules for stocking densities, feeding and watering intervals, rest periods, etc., and it is arising from this process that the suggestion of a maximum journey time for animals going for slaughter has emerged.  The question of a maximum journey is something which cannot be considered in isolation.  We are prepared to play our full part in reaching a consensus on revised rules but the rules must be reasonable and pragmatic and give our exporters the same opportunities and their counterparts in other member states to sell their product in the market while, of course, fully and above all else respecting animal welfare needs.</P>
    <P>When the ban was extended by Pandoro to Ireland, I immediately contacted the chairman of the parent company, P &amp; O Shipping, and pointed out that there was no justification for the action taken.  However, he is the chairman of a private company in another jurisdiction and there is a limit to what can be done in regard to private companies in other countries.</P>
    <P>The UK authorities are, of course, in the same position as ourselves and close contact is being maintained with them in an effort to find a solution.  I am also in contact with the Irish exporters in the field to see what options are available and have arranged that the problem be highlighted at every opportunity in the appropriate fora operating in Brussels. In a word, everything possible has been done to deal with the situation and any accusations to the contrary are without foundation.  Should those involved in the business come forward with alternative transport then, as long as they meet the required standards, they will be free to proceed.  However, it is not realistic to expect the Government to make transport available as suggested.  The provision of suitable transport is clearly a commercial and not a State responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> I believe that a solution can be found in the supplementary welfare rules currently under consideration by the Agriculture Council.  The Council will meet on 24 October, and I am confident that agreed rules will be adopted at that meeting.  This should enable the ferry companies which have withdrawn to reconsider their position.</P>
    <P>Having said that, some 85,000 cattle have been exported to the continent already this year, with a further 178,000 exported to third countries.  This year 400,000 animals will leave Ireland for the live trade.  Live exports will, over the whole year, probably exceed last year's very high levels.  Prices remain good despite the ferry situation.  This week's prices this year are higher than prices for the same week last year.  We have invested significant public and private funds in processing facilities in this country.  There are many jobs involved and we cannot afford as a country or as an industry to go back to a situation where we become principally livestock rather than beef exporters.  That would not be in the interests of farmers.  Nor would it be in the economic interests of the country.  I reiterate that we will do all we can to solve the problem but it should be seen in perspective and we should avoid talking a problem up into a crisis.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Louth Radon Gas Level Survey.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this issue.  The debate about radon gas levels has been concentrated mainly in the western counties of Galway, Mayo and Clare.  Although in recent times the Radiological Protection Institute has carried out a nationwide measurement of radon gas levels in every county, in many instances the survey is limited.  It is a question of householders being invited to participate and payment of a fee of £15.  Even where the <Col N="1792" /> survey is limited it provides valuable pointers to the radon gas levels that may exist in particular parts of the country.</P>
      <P>In regard to the results for County Louth I have been pursuing the matter by way of parliamentary question and, latterly, by way of correspondence with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication, Deputy Cowen.  We were surprised and indeed disturbed at some of the indications of the results from County Louth, particularly in the Cooley Peninsula.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland operates on a reference level of about 200 becquerels per cubic metre.  In one house in Cooley the level reached 752 becquerels per cubic metre, considerably above the reference level.</P>
      <P>The survey in County Louth was very limited.  To get a more accurate measurement it would be necessary to undertake a more intensive survey.  The environmental research unit of the Department of the Environment provides invaluable information to people who experience a problem in the environs of their house.  The cost of the remedial works necessary in some instances must be taken into consideration.  Contractors in the west specialise in providing a service to people who find themselves in a dilemma but along the east coast where the problem was previously unknown it will take some time for the building sector to come to terms with the problem.  The ductingextraction arrangement seems to be the most popular way of dealing with the problem.  As costs are involved, householders would like to be assured before spending money on remedial works that they will provide a solution to their problem.  I am not sure if the new building regulations take account of this problem.  If not, perhaps the time has come for us to examine them with a view to inserting a more assertive clause to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Cooley area of County Louth the number of deaths from cancer and cancer-related illnesses is high.  The close proximity to Sellafield and the <Col N="1793" /> most recently identified problem of radon gas levels are a great cause of concern among the people living in the area and I hope the Radiological Protection Institute will carry out a more intensive survey to identify the extent of the problem.  I am not sure of the position where the survey has already been effected.  It is not simply a matter of deciding to carry out a survey and providing the measurement equipment; it would take some time to carry out such a survey.  It is possible to get a variation in the reading from one room to another in a dwelling and that would also have to be taken into consideration.  I know the Minister, Deputy Cowen, is particularly interested in this subject and I await with interest his response.</P>

      <P>Radon is naturally occurring radioactive gas originating from the natural decay of uranium in rocks and soils.  It has no taste, smell or colour.  Uranium is found in small quantities in all soils and rocks, although the amount varies from place to place.  Radon which surfaces in the open air is quickly diluted to harmless concentrations, but when it enters an enclosed space it can sometimes build up to unacceptable levels.  On average about half of our radiation dose comes from radon, and long term exposure to high levels significantly increases a person's risk of contracting lung cancer. There is evidence that the risk associated with exposure to high radon levels is considerably greater for people who smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; RPII &mdash; is the national authority with responsibility for undertaking measurements of the naturally-occurring radioactive gas, radon.  The average radon concentration in Irish houses is about 60 becquerels per cubic metre &mdash; Bq/m³ &mdash; compared with typical outdoor values of about five <Col N="1794" /> becquerels per cubic metre.  Surveys to date indicate that about 4 per cent of houses in Ireland have radon concentrations above the reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre.  This is the radon concentration level above which remedial measures should be considered.  While houses with high radon levels are found throughout the country, there is evidence of a greater incidence of such houses in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In 1992, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland launched a geographically-based national radon survey.  This survey, when completed, will assist in the identification of areas of greater risk of high radon levels and allow planning and local authorities to consider what actions might be desirable to limit radon accumulation in new buildings.</P>
    <P>As part of this National Radon Survey, 130 householders in County Louth were issued with radon detectors in July 1993.  These were left in place for one year and were due to be returned in July 1994.  Measurements have now been completed by the institute in 74 houses throughout County Louth, 20 of the houses being in the Cooley Peninsula. Eleven of the 74 houses had radon levels above the reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre and eight of these houses were in the Cooley Peninsula.  The highest level recorded in the county, 752 becquerels per cubic metre, was in a house in the Cooley Peninsula.</P>
    <P>In the part of County Louth outside the Cooley Peninsula, three houses out of 54 &mdash; 5.5 per cent &mdash; exceeded the reference level, an incidence which does not differ greatly from the national average.  However, on the Peninsula, eight houses &mdash; 40 per cent &mdash; of the 20 tested exceeded the reference level. While it is necessary to be cautious in drawing general conclusions from such a small sample as 20 houses, the clear indication at this early stage is that there <Col N="1795" /> is a high incidence of elevated radon levels in the Cooley Peninsula.</P>
    <P>Householders for whom results are available have already been informed of their results and, where appropriate, advised that remedial measures should be considered.  Remedial action to deal with unacceptable level of radon gas is primarily a matter for the householders and property owners concerned.  Where high radon concentrations have been identified, techniques exist which enable levels to be reduced.  Responsibility for advice on these matters rests with the Department of the Environment.  That Department also provides guidance on appropriate measures to be taken in the design and construction of buildings.</P>
    <P>In view of the outcome of this survey and given the concern in the north-east about all aspects of radioactivity and the high degree of environmental awareness among the population, it is strongly recommended that other householders in that area should have radon measurements taken.  The national survey is proceeding now to other areas and the institute does not propose to carry out a further survey in the Cooley area at this time.  However, for householders not already included in the survey, the institute offers a radon measurement service for homes at a cost of £15 per house.  The measurement process involves placing radon detectors in a well used living area and in a bedroom for a period of three months.  Each detector is about the size of a matchbox and is completely harmless.  The survey will be conducted entirely by post.  At the end of the measurement period, the householder will be sent the results of the measurements and a recommendation.  Strict confidentiality is assured.

      <Col N="1796" /> I note from my discussions with Deputy Kirk that this matter is causing concern.  The Department of the Environment has some responsibility in this area and I will take up the matter with the Minister, Deputy Smith.  Grant aid is not available for the installation of underground fans which are sometimes used to disperse the radon outside the house.  This is a costly exercise, costing between £1,000 and £1,500, and perhaps that Department will consider introducing such a grant.  New houses can be radon proofed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you for allowing me to raise this matter and I am grateful to the Minister for coming in to reply.  The Minister will be aware of the case of a doctor jailed in England for gross misconduct and negligence in that he performed surgical operations on patients while suffering from a highly contagious form of hepatitis B.  Hundreds of patients were put at risk and many contracted the virus.  There is an Irish dimension in so far as the doctor in question worked for periods in Dublin, Limerick, Galway and in the General Hospital, Tullamore, in my constituency.  I understand that during that time he assisted in many routine surgical procedures.  The Minister should ensure that the hospitals in which he worked carry out a detailed survey to ascertain the number of operations performed and how many patients were exposed to the risk in this country.  What steps have been taken to date to compile this information?  What action does the Minister propose in view of this experience and what procedures are in place to deal with this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the guidelines state that a doctor suffering from a contagious disease must confide in a colleague who is empowered to restrict the practice of the person in question and surgery would be prohibited as the surgeon <Col N="1797" /> would, in effect, refrain from performing operations.  Hepatitis B is a contagious virus and can result from contact with blood, saliva, urine or semen of an infected person.  It must be noted that the disease can be transmitted through the tiniest scratch with a contaminated needle.  Patients can fall seriously ill as the liver becomes inflamed or damaged.  Most sufferers have few, if any, symptoms but others suffer from fever, nausea, vomiting, jaundice or abdominal pain.  Fatigue and debility may persist.</P>
    <P>I am aware that all front line health care staff are offered vaccination against hepatitis B but this is not sufficient for a number of reasons.  It has been suggested that all non-national doctors should be vaccinated on a compulsory basis.  This would be a doubtful procedure from an ethical point of view and would be less than acceptable on medical grounds because a person may already be a carrier.  Will the Minister be specific in his intentions to allay public anxiety in this matter?  I understand that within two months of a vaccination health care workers are screened to establish that they are sero positive. Those who fail to respond are offered a further vaccination and screened and those who still fail to respond may have an immune deficiency or may be a carrier.  I also understand that a specific blood test is required to establish if a person is a carrier.  Is this routine practice in this country?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tackle this problem to ensure that patients who may have been exposed are traced and dealt with accordingly and that patients in the future are not placed at such a risk.  I look forward to hearing his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to respond.  The Medical Council's guide to ethical conduct and behaviour and fitness to practise stipulates that doctors suffering from contagious infectious diseases, including hepatitis B, should put <Col N="1798" /> themselves in the hands of their professional colleagues for treatment and counselling and for advice on how far it is necessary for them to limit their professional practice to protect their patients.  It is clearly unethical for doctors who consider that they might be infected with a serious contagious disease not to seek diagnostic testing.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis B is a condition usually characterised by jaundice, nausea, vomiting and a variety of other symptoms. It occurs worldwide and is endemic in parts of Asia and Africa.  In western Europe hepatitis B is most prevalent in high risk groups.</P>
      <P>The causative agent in the hepatitis B virus infection can be diagnosed by blood tests which can also determine the degree to which the patient is infective.  Vaccination against the disease is available and effective.  As the Deputy rightly said, it has been my Department's policy since 1988 that all health care staff whose occupation exposes them to contact with blood should be offered vaccination against hepatitis B.  These include staff working in accident and emergency, haematology, oncology, operating theatres, laboratories and so on.  Vaccination is offered free of charge to all staff considered to be at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the recent case of a doctor infected with hepatitis B, I have asked the appropriate authorities of the hospitals in which this doctor is alleged to have worked to confirm whether he worked in that hospital; to indicate the date on which the hospital commenced hepatitis B vaccination of health care workers and if this doctor's hepatitis B status was known; to identify the capacity in which the doctor worked in the hospital and if his work has been likely to put patients at risk of contracting hepatitis B, that is, would he personally have been involved in surgical procedures or mostly have been an observer?  I also asked if the records of patients who may have undergone surgical procedures, including minor surgery, by the doctor concerned would be <Col N="1799" /> identifiable through the hospital records system.  My department's chief medical officer has also contacted his colleagues in the United Kingdom for information on the nature of the person's illness and if it is known when he contracted the disease.</P>
    <P>I presume the Deputy will be aware of the reply I gave earlier today to a parliamentary question setting out the measures which have been taken in this matter.  My Department is according priority to establishing full information to enable patients who may have been exposed to the infection arising out of contact with this doctor to be identified. Any such patient will be contacted for testing and other follow-up procedures which may be deemed necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue on the Adjournment. Although the matter I wish to discuss is crucial to a minority of students if it is allowed to remain unaltered it will bring disappointment and frustration to a growing number of students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago a girl working in a bank in County Cavan applied for a mature student's grant to enable her to undertake a degree course at University College, Cork.  To her delight she satisfied all the criteria and was awarded a grant under the higher education grants scheme for mature students.  As the bank refused her application for a career break to enable her undertake her studies she resigned her position.  To her consternation, and my amazement. she was subsequently told that she would qualify for a maintenace grant at the adjacent rate of £592 per annum only rather than the full rate of £1,486 per annum.  As the Minister will be aware, the adjacent rate is payable to students living within 15 miles of the <Col N="1800" /> educational institution which the student is attending.</P>
    <P>Cavan is definitely not within 15 miles of Cork but in interpreting clause 8 of the regulations relating to higher education grants a county council official decided that since this young lady would not be retaining her flat in Cavan for the duration of her studies, she would cease to be a permanent resident of County Cavan and hence would transfer the permanent address to Cork.  She would, therefore, be living within 15 miles of UCC and was only entitled to the lower rate.  The decision of Cavan County Council has been endorsed by the Department of Education and by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The idea of mature student grants was introduced by my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke.  I have no doubt that she would vehemently object to this interpretation of the regulations.  Most local authorities would be opposed to this decision and many interpret the regulations in a different fashion.  This goes against the spirit of the scheme and will cause untold financial difficulty for mature students.  The Minister is telling the student that she must maintain and pay for an empty flat in County Cavan to qualify for the full maintenance grant.  If she can afford to do this then she does not need a grant.  The Minister expects her to spend a year in college on a grant of £592 or perhaps she is expecting her to cycle daily to and from Cork with her jeans tucked into her socks.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister for Education commited to the disadvantaged and to those who want to better themselves?  If she cannot understand the ridiculous situation imposed on this student by bureaucracy gone mad, she does not understand the spirit in which the scheme was introduced or the difficulties facing mature students.  I hope the Minister, will take the sensible reading of the regulations and allow this girl the full grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that I am not in a position to deal with individual issues, notwithstanding the coherent and laudable way he outlined the matter.  I congratulate him on the vehemence of his representations but the issue cannot be resolved by raising on the Adjournment the urgent need to review the regulations concerning the payment of adjacent or non-adjacent higher education grants to mature students.</P>
      <P>It affords me, on behalf of the Minister for Education, the opportunity to clarify the position and to reiterate the continuing commitment of the Minister for Education to facilitating wider access to third level education for all students and to the continued improvement and reform of the third level student support schemes.  In the 1993-94 academic year out of a total of 85,800 third level students over 52,000, that is over 60 per cent, were in receipt of grant aid from the Department.  This compares with 44 per cent of third level students in receipt of grant aid in the 1983-84 academic year.  Expenditure on third level grants has increased significantly in the past number of years with over £85 million being expended on the third level student support schemes in the 1993 financial year.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 mature students are eligible for grant-aid under the student support schemes and are subject to the terms of the schemes as published.</P>
      <P>There are four common rates of maintenance grant payable to all categories of higher education grant holders, whether dependent mature, independent mature or otherwise, viz: (i) full maintenance at the non-adjacent rate; (ii) full maintenance at the adjacent rate; (iii) part maintenance at the non-adjacent rate; (iv) part maintenance at the adjacent rate.</P>
      <P>There is no distinction between the rates of maintenance grant payable to mature students and other students who are holders of higher education grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" /> Whether a grant holder is eligible for full maintenance or part maintenance is determined by the means assessment operated in accordance with the higher education grants scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme the adjacent rate of maintenance is payable in the case of every grant holder whose normal family residence is less than 15 miles from the college attended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Cavan to Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also payable in the case of any grant holder whose normal family residence is 15 miles or more from the college attended who could reasonably be expected, in the light of distance and the convenience of local public transport services, to travel daily. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the 1994 higher education grants scheme the residency requirement is used as a basis to determine the local authority which will process the grant application.  The relevant local authority may award, adjust or withdraw a grant in accordance with changes of circumstances relating to the following: (a) reckonable income which is likely to be permanent; (b) the number of dependent children or the number of children in full-time third level education; (c) normal residence.</P>
      <P>Change in circumstances involving the normal family residence is not confined to mature students.  If the normal residence changes from over 15 miles from college to within 15 miles the grant would be similarly adjusted downwards in the case of all student grant holders, mature or otherwise.  This could also involve a family, for instance, moving from one local authority area to another, notwithstanding that the body who initially processed and awarded the grant would continue to pay the higher education grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where independent mature students move their permanent address to within <Col N="1803" /> 15 miles of the college, it would not be possible in such cases to justify a higher level of entitlement than that of a fellow independent mature student already living within 15 miles of the college attended who would be in receipt of the adjacent rate of maintenance grant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> One of the main elements of the action plan is the phased improvement of primary and secondary care orthodontic treatment for all children who need it.  The action plan provides for the recruitment of a total of nine consultant orthodontists and appropriately trained dental support staff to health boards to meet treatment needs at secondary care level.  A total of six consultant orthodontists with support staff have now been appointed to health boards.  In addition a consultant orthodontist has been appointed to the National Cleft Palate Unit at St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>This year, as the initial phase of the action plan, I provided an additional £1 million to health boards for an additional ten dental support teams for the consultant orthodontists.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to progress its strategy for the development of consultant led orthodontic services in each health board area.</P>
    <P>In addition to his/her own direct clinical involvement the consultant orthodontist organises and co-ordinates training for health board dental surgeons in orthodontics.  This strategy ensures a high service level and the best possible standard of treatment at secondary care level.  Orthodontic treatment for some milder cases can be provided at primary care level by health board dental surgeons who are competent and who have access to consultant advice and cover.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 44 and 58 together.  Representations have been made to my Department in relation to children born with limb deficiencies. <Col N="1568" /> Under the 1970 Health Act, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist Chief Executive Officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the Chief Executive Officer considers that the person's medical needs would justify this.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or, in the case of children, to their parent's means, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.</P>
      <P>As far as services provided under the General Medical Service are concerned, the treatment and care provided by general practitioners for medical card holders and their dependants would include the provision of advice and counselling where appropriate.  If additional services in the nature of counselling are required, the general practitioner will arrange for referral to the relevant service.</P>

      <P>From unvalidated information available to my Department, it would appear that <Col N="1569" /> there are 1,217 persons with mental handicap awaiting residential places and 1,522 awaiting day care services.</P>
      <P>A national database on the needs of persons with a mental handicap is currently being established which will provide information, on an ongoing basis, on the number of persons with mental handicap in each region, the number in services and awaiting services, their current and future needs and the level of support which is required to meet those needs.</P>
      <P>The availability of such information will enable my Department and those responsible for the provision of services to plan, in a co-ordinated manner the services which are required to meet both current and future needs.</P>
      <P>The above mentioned figures do not however taken account of the additional service developments which are being put in place in 1994 as a result of the additional £12.5 million which I made available for services for persons with a mental handicap.  This funding has been used to put in place the following services:</P>
      <P>&mdash; 282 new residential/respite places</P>
      <P>&mdash; 550 day care places</P>
      <P>&mdash; the continued improvement and expansion of the home support programme to benefit over 1,400 clients and their families.</P>

    <P>The extra funding provided in 1994 is in addition to the £8.5 million which was made available in 1993.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> The Deputy will be pleased to note that between 1993 and 1994 a total of 1,127 additional places for persons with mental handicap have been made available.</P>
    <P>In relation to respite care it is difficult to estimate the number of places available due to the flexible use of residential places e.g. five day beds, holiday respite, etc.  However, a survey by my Department in late 1993 indicated that the total number of respite care nights provided was 51,702 and the number of clients benefiting from respite care was approximately 3,900.</P>
    <P>My Department is in the process of putting in place a National Data-base on the Needs of Persons with Mental Handicap.  The data-base will provide information, on an ongoing basis, on the number of people with a mental handicap in each region, the number in receipt of services and those awaiting services, their current and future needs and the level of support which is required to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>The Health Strategy &mdash; Shaping a Healthier Future and the Programme for Government both contain firm commitments to the continued development of services for persons with a mental handicap with a particular emphasis on catering for unmet needs.  I am satisfied that the injection of funds in recent years has contributed towards a real improvement in services and I intend to build on this in future years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 221 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generic medicines licensed for sale in Ireland are required to undergo the same rigorous safety controls as proprietary medicines.  A manufacturer of a <Col N="1573" /> generic medicine is required to demonstrate that the absorption of the medicine into the human body is similar, within stated limits to that of the branded product.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the permitted variation in absorption is of no clinical significance for the vast majority of medicines.  In a small number, it can give rise to problems, if a patient is switched from one brand of the medicine to another brand or to a generic version. These drugs are those in which the dose which is effective is close to the dose which is toxic and include drugs for the treatment of epilepsy.</P>
    <P>I should point out that all qualified doctors are trained to be aware of such problems, and the regulation of their use, as with all medicinal drugs, rests with the prescribing doctor.</P>
    <P>The National Therapeutics Advisory Committee, which advises me on all aspects of drug prescribing, has recommended that doctors should prescribe by generic name.  The committee has accepted that for patients already maintained on medication falling within the category which I have referred to, a transfer from a particular product to a generic may neither be desirable nor possible.  The recommendations of the committee are being widely circulated to hospitals and health board general practice units.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by Beaumont Hospital that, in general, the hospital has the equipment required to carry out all neurosurgical procedures.  However some neurosurgery patients have been referred to England for focused beam radiotherapy treatment, which is not currently available in this country.  Six patients were referred in 1993 and four patients have been referred for this treatment in the year to date.</P>
      <P>The equipment necessary to provide a service of this type will be provided in St. Luke's and St. Anne's Hospital as part of the redevelopment programme there and once this has been provided it will no longer be necessary to refer patients abroad for this treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to refer a patient abroad <Col N="1575" /> for specialised treatment is usually influenced by a number of factors and it would not be feasible to identify cases where the non-availability of particular equipment led to such a decision.  I am satisfied, however, that the Irish health service is equipped to provide virtually all types of treatment required by patients and this is evidenced by the small number referred abroad for treatment in any one year.</P>

      <P>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas.  Long-term exposure to very high levels of radon in an enclosed area can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of contracting lung cancer, particularly where other factors such as cigarette smoking are involved.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is the statutory body with responsibility for monitoring radiation in the State.  The institute initiated a national geographically based radon survey in 1992 which will extend over a number of years.  The survey is being carried out to assist in identifying areas at greatest risk of high indoor radon levels.  This will involve radon measurements being taken in at least ten houses in each ten kilometre grid square across the country.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment has published guidelines which give information to building designers and householders about measures they can take to reduce high radon levels.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 128 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>There were approximately 205 whole time equivalent speech therapists employed directly by the health boards, voluntary hospitals and the main mental handicap agencies at 31 December 1993. International norms vary greatly and are not necessarily relevant in an Irish context.  I have been aware of the need to strengthen speech therapy service provision and I have allocated additional funding to the expansion of these services over the past two years. In 1993, almost £200,000 of the £1.5 million additional funding for services for people with a physical disability was allocated to this service and a further £150,000 has been allocated this year. The current figure of 213 represents an increase of 45 on the December 1991 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the speech therapy service in this country is inhibited by the lack of sufficient numbers of trained speech therapists.  My Department took steps to remedy this problem by arranging for six extra training places to be provided at the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies, Trinity College Dublin, commencing in the 1992-93 academic year.  In the last two years, the total student body has increased from 80 students to 94 students and it is hoped to increase this <Col N="1580" /> to 104 in 1995-96.  The increased level of graduate output resulting from this important development should ease difficulties in the area of speech and language therapy in the medium to long term.</P>
    <P>The Review Group on Physical and Senatory Disabilities has been examining a range of services for people with physical disabilities, including speech therapy.  It is expected that the group will submit its final report within the next few months.</P>

      <P>Health boards and voluntary hospitals, upon receipt of their annual allocation from my Department, make decisions regarding the level of activity which can be supported by the hospital during the year.  In the case of the Mater Hospital, the approved 1994 revenue allocation from my Department was £46.270 million, an increase of £3.825 million &mdash; 9 per cent &mdash; over the hospital's original allocation of £42.445 million for 1993.</P>
      <P>In early 1994, the Mater Hospital made its decisions in relation to the quantum of service that would be provided by the approved allocation from my Department.  However, during a subsequent review over the summer, the hospital authorities decided that the elective cardiology service should be curtailed.  In making this decision, I understand that the hospital made it clear that emergency cases would continue to be treated.  In the circumstances, I cannot accept the implications contained in the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am acutely aware of the prevalence of heart disease in this country.  This is why, shortly after coming into office, I allocated a sum of £1 million from the 1993 waiting list fund to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital, to increase the annual <Col N="1582" /> throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000, an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994, I have provided capital funds which will facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
    <P>I have allocated in excess of £2 million in 1994 to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.  The development, which was completed recently, includes additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities required to support the cardiac surgery programme.  These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced.</P>
    <P>The developments at the Mater Hospital, together with the developments in progress for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital, will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.</P>
    <P>In relation to cardiology services generally, I should point out that a cardiology service is also provided by other Dublin hospitals.  The regional hospitals in Cork and Galway provide cardiology services and in 1994 I have sanctioned a new post of consultant cardiologist for Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 94, 133, 138, 154, 222 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>As the causes of breast cancer remain to be clearly established, emphasis is placed on early detection at the pre-invasive stage, through mammography, and consequent early treatment.  The yield from mammography is highly dependent upon the medical equipment being used and the expertise of the health professionals involved in the procedure.</P>
      <P>At present in Ireland, mammography is used largely as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or worried women on referral by their general practitioners. There are now diagnostic mammography units at 17 hospitals throughout the country and expertise has been growing in all aspects of the early detection of breast cancer and its treatment.</P>
      <P>Some months ago I met representatives of the Irish Countrywomen's Association to discuss breast cancer services generally.  As a result of our discussions, my Department's Health Promotion Unit together with the Irish Cancer Society are arranging a number of seminars on breast awareness over the coming months in order to increase public awareness of breast cancer and other aspects of women's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to mammography in particular, there has been considerable debate and discussion internationally regarding the effectiveness of mammography screening in reducing mortality <Col N="1585" /> from breast cancer.  Mammography screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis to detect those women with unrecognised breast cancer.</P>
    <P>It is important to mention also that mammography screening programmes tend to be directed at women aged between 50-65 years.  Provisional figures show that, of a total number of 650 women who died from breast cancer in Ireland in 1992, 249 were aged between 45-64 years.  Mammography screening programmes are not effective in reducing mortality in younger women and older women have proved reluctant to come forward for screening.  There has been a good deal of controversy as to whether mammography screening programmes can be successful in reducing mortality in this age group.  As a first step, it is essential, therefore, to establish whether a reduction in this mortality rate can be achieved in Ireland and most importantly, how this can be achieved.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, my Department is supporting a major mammographic breast screening programme currently underway at the Mater Foundation. This programme, the Eccless Breast Screening Programme, is part of a network of seven pilot schemes on breast cancer screening being carried out within the European Community.  The programme is being carried out in a defined catchment area, north Dublin and Cavan-Monaghan, representing both urban and rural populations.  All women in the catchment area aged between 50-64 years are eligible to attend and will be included in two round of screening.  Written invitations suggesting a date for screening were issued and these were followed with a second invitation in cases of no response.  The age group to be screened complies with EU criteria for such programmes.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the study are: to evaluate the impact of mammographic screening on mortality from breast cancer among Irish women, to compare the specificity, sensitivity and predictive <Col N="1586" /> value of the mammography screening programme with that reported internationally and to document compliance with a breast screening programme in Irish women.</P>
    <P>The Eccles Breast Screening Programme commenced screening in 1990 and is expected to conclude shortly.  I hope to have the report on the programme's finding by the end of this year.  National policy on this area will be guided by the findings of this programme.  This is the first study of its kind undertaken in this country and has established itself as one of the leading European pilot programmes.  The key factors which have contributed to its success in this regard are that it is a centralised screening programme with strong clinical leadership and trained and dedicated radiological, epidemiological and radiographical support. Another important feature of the Eccles Breast Screening Programme is the emphasis on quality assurance mechanisms.  As indicated in the National Health Strategy document which I published earlier this year, decisions on the national policy to be followed in this matter will be influenced by the results of the pilot study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 126 and 232 together.</P>
      <P>In its judgment delivered on 26 May last in the case of Keegan <i>v.</i> Ireland, the European Court of Human Rights held that the central problem with existing Irish adoption law is that it permits the secret placement of a child born outside marriage for adoption without the knowledge or consent of the child's father.</P>
      <P>The implications of the judgement for Irish adoption law and procedure are being urgently examined by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  It is my firm intention that legislative proposals aimed at addressing the various issues raised in the judgment will be brought forward at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I should mention that there have been changes in adoption practice since the domestic proceedings in the Keegan case were finally determined by the courts here in 1990. New procedures introduced by the Adoption Board have helped to create a greater awareness among the adoption agencies of the position of the natural father of a non-marital child in the adoption process and of the importance of consulting him, where possible, regarding the proposed adoption of the child.  These developments were acknowledged by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgement.</P>
      <P>Since the judgement was delivered, the Adoption Board has issued further guidance to the adoption agencies in relation to the involvement of natural fathers in the adoption process.</P>
      <P>The extent to which the procedures that are currently in place need to be further developed in the light of the judgement of the European Court is among the matters that are at present under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I reiterate the fact that the European Convention on Human Rights is not part of our domestic law. This means that the European Court ruling in the Keegan case has no direct <Col N="1589" /> effect on the validity of adoptions completed to date.  It is important to continue to stress this point in order to reassure adoptive parents.</P>

      <P>At present advertising of tobacco products in Ireland is governed by the Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Regulations, 1991 which confines such advertising to printed publications intended primarily for persons over 18 years of age, and within sales outlets.</P>
      <P>I have on a number of occasions indicated my support for a total ban on the advertising of tobacco products.  Such a ban is an integral part of effective anti-tobacco strategy.  The matter of a ban throughout member states of the European Union has been under discussion by the Council of Health Ministers for some time now.  However, progress to date has been slow.</P>
      <P>While I favour a ban I would not see merit in Ireland acting unilaterally as we are particularly vulnerable to overspill advertising in magazines, etc., from the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  A ban on advertising in Irish publications would, in such circumstances, put Irish companies at a disadvantage to foreign competitors.</P>
      <P>There is a commitment contained in &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;, the Government's Health Strategy, to reduce advertising and sponsorship of tobacco by 5 per cent per year.  Discussions will be held shortly with the tobacco companies about the implementation of this proposal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 118 and 163 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of beds which were closed in the Dublin area during the month of August was 307, the equivalent of 5.8 per cent of the total bed complement.  While these beds are now being reopened on a phased basis, Deputies will be aware that the closure of beds in August and indeed throughout the summer period has been part and parcel of the provision and organisation of hospital services throughout the country over many years.  The seasonal closure of beds is generally planned to coincide with staff annual leave at a <Col N="1591" /> time when the level of activity has traditionally declined.  It also provides hospitals with an opportunity to carry out much needed refurbishment work in wards and other accommodation.  This work can of course extend beyond the month of August.</P>
    <P>I should point out that in 1992 the average number of beds closed throughout the country during the period June, July, August was 934.  In 1993 this figure was reduced to 530, representing a reduction of 43 per cent on the 1992 figure.  In June, July and August of 1994, there was an average of 361 beds closed which represents a reduction of 32 per cent on the 1992 figure.</P>
    <P>The latest information available to my Department on bed closures for the October-November period indicates an average of 201 beds closed nationally, for a variety of reasons as stated earlier. These closures are spread over 18 hospitals out of a total of 60 and amount to 1.6 per cent of all available acute beds.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that all emergency and urgent services continue to be provided and that my Department will continue to closely monitor the situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 75, 125, 130 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the subvention scheme provided for by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is to ensure that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care. From 1 September 1993, the time the Act was commenced, to 31 August 1994, 7,019 applications had been received by health boards for a nursing home subvention.  Of this total, 3,136 have been approved.  Of the remaining applications, 1,422 have been refused and the balance are either being processed or have been withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of applications by health board is given in the table which follows.</P>
      <P>Figures in relation to the number of additional persons to benefit under the new arrangements will not be available until the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> In 1993, £4 million was made available to commence the Nursing Homes Act.  In 1994 a total of £9 million has been committed so far for the implementation of the Act.  I am satisfied that in respect of the number of persons in receipt of the new subvention, the choice of nursing homes which the scheme allows and the increase in the average rate of subvention, from approximately £50 a week to £81 a week, that expenditure made available to implement the Act represents good value for money.</P>
    <P>All of the health boards have paid invoices for subventions from nursing home proprietors up to 31 August 1994, with the exception of some homes which have yet to provide tax clearance certificates or are having difficulties with registration.  My Department is currently in consultation with the health boards regarding expenditure subvention to the end of the year and I am confident that all boards will be in a position to meet their liabilities under the Act.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health, I do not have responsibility for the regulation of the fees charged by nursing homes.  While the Nursing Homes Act gives new powers to health boards to enforce high standards of care and welfare in nursing homes, it respects in full the private or voluntary ownership and management of those homes.  I am aware that the requirements of registration under the new Act have imposed additional costs on a number of the 386 homes which have applied for registration under the Act, but it is necessary in the interests of dependent older people that all nursing homes conform to acceptable standards of care.</P>
    <P>Total number of applications for subvention under Nursing Homes Act, 1990, by health board (to 31 August 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Centre for Independent Living set up a two year pilot programme called Incare in December 1992.  This programme is funded principally by the EU Horizon Programme, a Social Fund initiative designed to provide for the training needs of disabled and other disadvantaged people.  The Incare programme involves training personal assistants to facilitate individuals with disabilities to live independent lives outside institutions.</P>
      <P>The Incare Programme ran into financial difficulties earlier this year with a projected shortfall of £120,000.  Following intervention by my Department, arrangements were made to meet this shortfall by contributions from my Department as well as the Department of Social Welfare and Rehab Lotteries. This additional funding will enable the Incare programme to continue to its completion date of December 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will shortly receive an evaluation of the Incare programme <Col N="1595" /> and future funding arrangements for the Centre for Independent Living will be examined in the light of that evaluation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 100 together.  I am aware of the difficulties associated with the provision of orthopaedic surgery at the Adelaide Hospital.  In 1993, as part of the national waiting list initiative I approved an additional allocation of £995,000 for the Adelaide Hospital for the purposes of performing an additional 500 orthopaedic procedures, including 150 hip replacement operations.  This workload was satisfactorily completed by the hospital.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I was pleased to have been in a position to allocate a further £500,000 to the hospital under the 1994 Waiting List Initiative for the purposes of performing 400 additional orthopaedic procedures, including 70 hip replacement operations.  The additional funding provided allowed the Adelaide Hospital to open for six months an extra 30 beds over and above the level for which the hospital is funded.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by the hospital authorities regarding the number of beds for which it is currently funded, and I am considering this matter in this context of the Health Estimates for 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 116 and 143 together.  Disabled person's maintenance allowance, is the primary income support scheme operated by my Department for people who, because of their disability, cannot work and are not in a position to maintain themselves in the community.  The Regulations governing medical eligibility for disabled persons maintenance allowance specify that the applicant must be suffering from a &ldquo;specified disability&rdquo; which prevents him-her from undertaking work which would normally be suited to a person of his-her age, experience and qualifications.  The term &ldquo;specified disability&rdquo; means an injury, disease, congenital deformity or physical or mental illness or defect which, in the opinion of a medical officer of the health board authorised by that board to examine or to have examined persons applying for or in receipt of a maintenance allowance, has continued or may reasonably be expected to continue for at least one year from its onset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed over the fact that persons with a HIV or AIDS diagnosis have had to wait in community welfare offices for <Col N="1599" /> payment of allowances which can cause distress in some circumstances.  I understand that this matter is being examined by the health boards with a view to improving access to community welfare officers by this client group.  Eligibility for social welfare benefit or assistance is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The objective of the new scheme of nursing home subventions, which I introduced last year, is to ensure that those most in need of care in a nursing home and without the means to pay for it receive assistance towards the cost.  A health board may only assess a son or daughter's ability to contribute towards the cost of the nursing home fees of parent if the son or daughter is aged 21 years and over, is residing in the jurisdiction and possesses sufficient personal income according to the procedures laid out in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>Of the 3,136 subventions approved to the end of August 1994, health boards had made a reduction as a result of the son or daughter's ability to pay in 494 cases or one in six of the subventions approved.  I believe that sons and daughters who are in a position to contribute towards the cost of a parent's nursing home fees should do so.  The State recognises this contribution in the tax relief it gives on such payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is now international evidence to suggest that the incidence of asthma is increasing on a worldwide basis.  A number of factors are thought to contribute to this, including environmental factors and allergies.</P>
      <P>There are no figures currently available on the incidence of cancers in Ireland, however the recent establishment of the National Cancer Register will address this issue.  While mortality figures available show a fall in lung cancer deaths since 1987, Irish figures still compare unfavourably with the EU average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various reports on both asthma and lung cancer highlight the need for health education, early diagnosis and <Col N="1602" /> treatment in minimising the incidence of both conditions.</P>
    <P>In relation to asthma, my Department recognises the importance of information for the general public on prevention and early detection of this condition.  Through the Health Promotion Unit ongoing support is given to the Asthma Society to enable them to engage in promotional campaigns.</P>
    <P>With regard to lung cancer, this is one of the most preventable lifestyle related diseases in Ireland.  Because of the strong links between the incidence of lung cancer and smoking the Health Promotion Unit spends a significant proportion of its total budget on anti-smoking campaigns.  These include television and radio commercials, health promotion programmes in schools and support for a wide number of Irish Cancer Society initiatives.</P>
    <P>Passive smoking is an area of increasing concern in regard to both asthma and lung cancer.  Last month I launched an updated version of the Voluntary Code of Practice on Smoking in the Workplace entitled &ldquo;Working together for cleaner air&rdquo; with the support of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, IBEC, the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society.  People who are exposed to passive smoking at work, particularly those with conditions such as asthma are subject to increased irritation and discomfort and there is now growing international data which links passive smoking and cancer.  I am hopeful that the development of smoke free policies in the workplace will go some way to reducing these problems.</P>
    <P>In general I have given the highest possible priority to the fight against cancer and this is reflected in the smoking target set in the Health Strategy <i>Shapping a Healthier Future</i> which aims to reduce the percentage of people who smoke by at least 1 per cent per year so that by the year 2000 more than 80 per cent of the population will be non-smokers.</P>

      <P>Information in relation to admissions to hospitals, both public and private, of persons with alcohol related disorders is collated on behalf of my Department on an annual basis by the Health Research Board.  The latest published information from the board is in respect of the year 1992.  The report showed that of a total of 6,081 admissions in that year for alcohol related disorders, 5,258 were to public hospitals and psychiatric units, while 823 were to private hospitals.  Figures are not available for the number of persons treated for alcoholism in specialist alcohol centres other than hospitals.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive range of services for the treatment of alcoholism exists for both public and private patients. Services include detoxification, hospital in-patient residential programmes, residential programmes in specialist alcohol centres, out-patients programmes, day programmes and counselling.  The services available are detailed in the Directory of Alcohol, Drugs and Related Services in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alcohol related problems make a heavy demand on our psychiatric services.  Traditionally those suffering from such problems have been treated in the controlled environment of both public and private psychiatric hospitals. However, the report of a study group on the development of the psychiatric service, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> published in 1984 recommended that the emphasis in the management of alcohol related problems should be on community based intervention rather than in-patient treatment.  There will, however, continue to be a need for a small number of in-patient places, for <Col N="1604" /> people who cannot benefit from community based programmes.</P>
    <P>In line with this approach, comprehensive community-based alcohol treatment programmes are being developed by the health boards.  Consideration is being given by the boards to ways in which services provided by voluntary and private organisations can be integrated with health board services.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in relation to alcohol related problems should be on their prevention.  This is a key element in the promotion of moderation in the consumption of alcohol in order to reduce the risks to physical, mental and family health which arises from alcohol misuse. As the Deputy will be aware, I gave a commitment on the publication of <i>Shaping a healthier Future,</i> a strategy for effective healthcare, that a national policy on alcohol would be adopted and launched by my Department within 12 months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 136, 147 and 213 together.</P>
      <P>I have not yet received the report of the team appointed by the Sisters of Charity to review the operation of Madonna House following allegations of misconduct against certain members of the staff.  I understand that the report is due to be completed within the next week or so.  On receipt of the report, it will be necessary for both the Sisters of Charity and my Department to obtain legal advice as to what parts can be published.  I assure the House, however, that it is my wish that as much information as possible should be made available, consistent with protecting the identities of innocent parties and avoiding interference with ongoing investigations and legal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board that, at this stage, it has identified at least 15 children who were allegedly abused while residing in Madonna House.  The allegations relate to both physical abuse and sexual abuse and stretch back over a number of years. <Col N="1608" /> Counselling and support services are being made available, as appropriate, to the persons in question, some of whom are now in their late teens and early twenties.  I intend to make a fuller statement on the Madonna House situation when I have had an opportunity to study the report of the investigation team.</P>
    <P>With regard to Cualann Family Group Home, allegations of child abuse came to the notice of the Eastern Health Board in early 1989.  The health board carried out a full child abuse investigation and the Garda also conducted their own inquiries.  There were six children in residence at the time, of whom three boys were allegedly abused over a period of about a year.  A warrant was issued for the arrest of a member of the staff who absconded and has not yet appeared before the courts.  Following the disclosure, an intensive programme of counselling was arranged for all of the children.  Two of them were subsequently returned to the care of their parents and others were placed in alternative residential homes.  The home at Cualann was closed by the religious order concerned in late 1989.</P>
    <P>In the light of events at Cualann, the Department of Health reviewed the residential care provisions of the Child Care Bill, 1988, which was then being processed through a special committee of this House.  This ultimately resulted in the amendment of the Bill to provide for the introduction of a more comprehensive system of registration and inspection of children's residential centres which is now contained in Part VIII of the Act.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy's question refers to the additional funding which was allocated in 1994 for the development of services for persons with a mental handicap.  Of the £12.5 million additional funding provided in 1994, £11.5 million has been allocated to date. The £1 million balance will be allocated in the course of the next few weeks.  In addition I have also made a separate capital allocation to enable additional training facilities to be provided for persons with a mental handicap under the European Regional Development Fund Structural Fund Programme.  I am not aware of any problems in regard to the planned implementation of these service developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 131 and 225 together.</P>
      <P>In 1992, the General Medical Services (Payments) Board decided to establish a working group to review in depth how the needs of people receiving non drug items, including ostomy products, under the GMS scheme were being met and if these needs could be met more efficiently.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the review of ostomy-urinary products on the General Medical Services scheme was to ensure that the needs of users of ostomy-urinary appliances would be met in the most effective manner and that the most modern &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo; products should be available on the GMS scheme.  To this end, each product currently on the scheme was evaluated by a group which included specific expertise in stoma care, on the basis of quality, suitability, and security.</P>
      <P>Following this evaluation, it was decided that a number of out-dated products should be replaced because they had been superseded by the more advanced products referred to above.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department met with the Ileostomy Association on 20 July 1994 and it was explained that although certain products were being removed from the GMS list, this was only being done in order that more modern products could be made available on the GMS scheme.  The association contacted my Department the following day to express their satisfaction with the outcome of the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both my Department and the GMS (Payments) Board are concerned to ensure that a quality service continues to be available to persons receiving ostomy-urinary products and that the introduction of these changes should not be a source of anxiety or uncertainty to individuals who need to avail of such products.  It is fully recognised that some patients may have difficulty or may not wish to change from the older type products.  Each health board has been requested to make arrangements for a health board stoma nurse or other <Col N="1612" /> health board professional trained in stoma therapy to make contact with these patients for the purposes of discussing their particular needs and making them aware of the benefits of the newer type products.</P>
    <P>Existing arrangements for the supply of older type products will continue in all cases until such time as this contact has been made and any changes have been discussed and agreed between the health board professional and the patient concerned.  Where patients do not wish to change, arrangements will be made for them to continue to be provided with their existing appliances.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that the wishes of these patients will be fully respected in this regard and that there is no question of patients being forced to change appliances.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 139, 159 and 228 together.  It has been my Department's policy since 1988 that all health care staff who have contact with blood should be vaccinated against hepatitis B.  These include staff working in accident and emergency; haemotology-oncology; operating theatres.</P>
      <P>As regards the recent case of the person infected with hepatitis B, I have asked the appropriate authorities of the hospitals in which this person is alleged to have worked to confirm whether or not he worked in that hospital; to indicate the date the hospital commenced hepatitis B vaccination of health care workers and if this person's hepatitis B status was known.  The hospital authorities have also been asked to identify the capacity in which the person worked.  If it should emerge that any patients were put at risk they will be contacted for testing and other follow-up procedures.</P>
      <P>My Department's chief medical officer has also contacted his colleague in the UK to establish when the person developed hepatitis B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1615" /> The Medical Council's &ldquo;Guide to Ethnical Conduct and Behaviour and to Fitness to Practice&rdquo; stipulates that doctors suffering from contagious-infectious diseases should put themselves in the hands of their professional colleagues for treatment and counselling and for advice on how far it is necessary for them to limit their professional practice in order to protect their patients.  It is clearly unethical for doctors who consider that they might be infected with a serious contagious disease not to seek diagnostic testing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 113, 124 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>Estimates indicated that the number of people with a significant form of dementia in this country, including Alzheimer's disease is between 20,000 and 30,000.</P>
      <P>The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia and their families, including purpose built accommodation.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly. Between 1990 and 1992 an additional £9 million was made available to the health services to implement the key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care and respite services has increased the support available to suffers of Alzheimer's disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.  All eight health boards have indicated that they have locations at which residential, day or respite care is available for Alzheimer sufferers though not all of these centres are dedicated exclusively to Alzheimer patients.</P>
      <P>In 1994, funding is being made available to provide specialist services for those with dementia in South-East Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  It is hoped that these services will be in operation before the end of the year or early next year.  Also in 1994, I was happy to be able to approve a grant of £20,000 from national lottery funds to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland to help towards their national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1618" /> The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which commenced on 1 September 1993 widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.</P>
    <P>The report <i>Caring without Limits</i> which was published by the Alzheimer Society in July last year provides an important insight into the lives of those who bear the brunt of Alzheimer disease &mdash; the carers.  I was pleased that my Department allocated a grant to the Alzheimer Society to enable this important research to be carried out. This report reflects the views expressed in <i>The Years Ahead</i>, namely that if carers are to continue giving care without intolerable cost to their own lives, more assistance is required from the health services for their support.</P>
    <P>The Government has expanded the eligibility criteria for the carer's allowance in recognition of the burden on relatives of caring for dependent elderly people such as those with dementia.  As Minister for Health I am very conscious of the contribution made by carers to the maintenance of dependent people in their own homes, and I will continue to encourage health boards to develop and extend support services for these informal carers, whether by services in the home or by way of respite care in a hospital or nursing home.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>Myasthenia gravis is a relatively uncommon disease which affects the neuro-muscular system.  Where a patient exhibits symptoms or signs of a neuro-muscular condition, a general practitioner would normally refer the patient to a medical consultant for confirmation of the condition and whether a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis can be confirmed.  I am satisfied that appropriate resources are available for the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to determine the degree to which patients are responding to treatment as this is a matter of confidentiality between doctors and individual patients.</P>
      <P>There are at present no official statistics on the prevalence of myasthenia gravis, which is not a notifiable disease. I accept the need for priority to be given to the development of epidemiological data on health needs in general, and this is one of the elements of the health strategy which I published recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 224 and 227 together.</P>
      <P>At the publication of the Kilkenny Incest Report I announced that the Child Care Act, 1991, would be brought into operation in its entirety by the end of 1996.  This remains my intention and I am determined that it will be achieved. Since making that announcement, I have approved a wide range of new child care and family support services, the full year cost of which is in the region of £20 million.  The scale of these developments is unprecedented and demonstrates in the most concrete way possible my determination to ensure that the Child Care Act is not simply implemented on paper but is backed up by a sustained programme of investment that will enable the health boards to respond effectively to the needs of those children and families whom the legislation is designed to assist.</P>
      <P>Among the important new measures that I have approved are the creation of over 370 new posts for the child care services around the country, including child psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and child care workers; the provision of additional hostel places for homeless children; the establishment of new family resource centres and community support projects to assist disadvantaged children; the expansion of the homemaker and home help services to help families in difficulty and the establishment of community mothers programmes in a number of health board areas; increased financial support to pre-school services in areas of social deprivation and the provision of additional places; the development of foster care and other alternative family placement services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These initiatives are laying the ground work for the assignment of <Col N="1621" /> additional statutory responsibilities to the health boards under the Act.  It is my firm intention that significant further progress will be made next year in expanding the range and quality of child care and family support services in each region.</P>
    <P>The next phase in the programme for the implementation of the Act involves the commencement of Parts 3, 4, 5 and 6 which deal respectively with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These provisions will strengthen the powers of the health boards, the gardaí and the courts to intervene in cases of child abuse and neglect.</P>
    <P>These are the most complex provisions of the Act.  Various sets of new regulations, as well as rules of court, are required to be made in order to give full effect to them.  The provisions in question are inter-related and must therefore be brought into force at the same time.</P>
    <P>I am committed to bringing Parts 3, 4, 5 and 6 into operation next year.  To this end, extensive preparatory work is currently under way in my Department. Two working groups were established to assist my Department in the preparation of the initial drafts of the new regulations relating to foster care and residential care.  The foster care working group has completed its task and the residential care working group is at an advanced stage in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>When the legislation was being processed through the Houses of the Oireachtas a commitment was given on behalf of the Government that the relevant interest groups would be consulted in relation to the preparation of the new regulations.  I intend to honour that commitment by circulating the draft regulations to the various interested parties before they are finalised.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 164 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Research Board is the main mechanism through which State funding is channelled to medical and related research.  The board is not, at present, carrying out any research into motor neurone disease.  However, I would point out that the board has an <Col N="1623" /> open invitation policy regarding applications for research funding and allocates its resources annually according to the priorities it attaches to the various requests received.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Motor Neurone Disease Association has sponsored research in this area and is awaiting at the end of this year the results of a two-year research programme.  My Department has grant-aided the association for the past three years.  The level of funding was increased from £16,000 in 1993 to £25,000 in 1994.</P>
    <P>Although there are no specific records regarding the incidence of motor neurone disease, medical research shows that it affects approximately 1 in 50,000 people.  It is estimated that approximately 250 people are affected at any one time in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Numbers of deaths by cause are collated by the Central Statistics Office. Numbers of deaths from motor neurone disease since 1980 are compiled in a tabular statement which I will arrange to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>Services for people with a mental illness, a mental handicap and the dependent elderly at St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane are the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  The board's proposals for these services are in line with Government policy as expressed in three policy documents &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;, &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo; dealing with services for the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and the elderly respectively.  These policy documents advocate the development of a comprehensive range of facilities in general hospitals and in the community for these client groups.</P>

      <P>The latest figures which are available indicate that a total of 158 patients were referred abroad for treatment under EC regulations in 1993.</P>
      <P>The majority of these patients were referred abroad for specialised procedures such as bone marrow transplants, heart-lung transplants, and liver transplants, and referrals were necessary due to the unavailability of the services or the shortfall in facilities for such operations in this country.</P>
      <P>To address the shortfalls additional resources have been provided in recent years to allow upgrading of services, including the bone marrow transplant unit at Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin. Work is also well underway on the new oncology-haematology-bone marrow transplant unit at St. James's Hospital. These developments when complete should allow the National Centre at the two hospitals to deal with most of the bone marrow transplant cases arising in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to liver transplants, the National Centre for adults at St. Vincent's Hospital was fully established last year and has achieved a high success <Col N="1626" /> rate.  This followed a considerable investment in services and staff training in co-operation with the Liver Unit at King's College Hospital, London.  The proposed children's liver unit at Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin is still under development.</P>
    <P>Developments such as these will allow Irish patients to be treated nearer to home and avoid serious disruptions associated with travelling abroad for treatment.  However, it must be accepted that it will not be possible to provide the resources necessary for all highly sophisticated procedures to be made available in this country because of the high cost of such techniques.  It will continue to be necessary to refer patients abroad for treatment in some cases.  The position regarding referrals abroad is kept under regular review in my Department and improvements to specialist services will continue to be made as resources permit.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance (DCA) is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and sixteen years who are so severely physically or mentally handicapped that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. Eligibility for this allowance is determined primarily by reference to the degree of care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of handicap involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the allowance is intended as a recognition of the additional burden <Col N="1627" /> involved in caring for severely handicapped children, it does not apply to children who live away from home while attending special schools or other institutions.  However, the allowance is not discontinued in cases where children who normally live at home are absent for periods of less than two months e.g. on holidays or undergoing treatment in hospital.</P>
    <P>Domiciliary care allowance is paid to the parents of the child and is not payable to special schools.  However, while the primary source of funding for special schools is the Department of Education, some special schools receive annual grants from health boards in respect of children with special needs.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will be pleased to note that between 1993 and 1994 a total of 1,127 additional places for persons with mental handicap have been made available.</P>
    <P>In relation to respite care, it is difficult to estimate the number of places available due to the flexible use of residential places, e.g. five day beds, holiday respite etc.  However, a survey by my Department in late 1993 indicated that the total number of respite care nights provided was 51,702 and the number of clients benefiting from respite care was approximately 3,900.</P>
    <P>Similar information in relation to persons with disabilities other than mental handicap is not readily available, but I have asked the health boards to provide me with the information requested by the Deputy and I will forward it to him when it becomes available.</P>

      <P>I have received a number of submissions from the Limerick Parents and Friends Association of the Mentally Handicapped giving details of service needs in the Mid-Western region.</P>
      <P>Of the £8.5 million in additional funding which I made available in 1993 for services for persons with a mental handicap, £6.5 million was allocated for the development of new services.  The Mid-Western region received £458,000 in additional revenue funding and £410,000 in capital funding.  This enabled the following additional services to put in place:</P>
      <P>&mdash;20 residential/respite places</P>
      <P>&mdash;10 day care places</P>
      <P>&mdash;Additional home support services.</P>
      <P>In 1994 £12.5 million was made available for the further development of services from which £10 million was allocated for the provision of new services. The Mid-Western region received £1.122 million and as a result of this additional funding, the following additional services are being put in place:</P>
      <P>&mdash;39 residential/respite places</P>
      <P>&mdash;52 day care places</P>
      <P>&mdash;Home support services for 65 families</P>
      <P>&mdash;28 persons with a mental handicap are being transferred from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant capital funding is also being provided in 1994 for the development of training facilities for persons with a mental handicap as part of the European Regional Development Fund Structural Programme.  £480,000 of this <Col N="1632" /> funding is being allocated to the Mid-Western region to provide additional training facilities in Thurles, Limerick, Roscrea and Kilrush.</P>
    <P>In both years the services which were put in place were agreed within the guidelines issued by my Department, with the Mid-Western Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee which is representative of the health board, service providers and families of persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>In addition to the development of new services, a further £4.5 million was made available over 1993 and 1994 to meet essential needs in existing services. As many of the agencies provide services in more than one health board region, it is not possible to say how much of this funding went to each area.</P>
    <P>I am aware that while very significant improvements have been made in the level of service provision available to persons with a mental handicap and their families in the mid-west and throughout the country, much more needs to be done and it is my intention to ensure that services are expanded and strengthened.  The Government is committed to the continued development of the services as outlined in both the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the Health Strategy &mdash;<i>Shaping a Healthier Future.</i></P>

Construction work on the first phase of the development consisting of a psychiatric unit, boiler house and ancillary facilities commenced in 1988 and was completed and commissioned in December, 1991 at a total cost of £3.3 million.

      <P>It is my policy as Minister for Health to encourage health boards to support community-based initiatives for the elderly, to the best of their financial ability. We are fortunate in this country to have such a strong and caring voluntary movement and the health boards and myself endeavour to help such groups in the fullest way possible.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board, which is the statutory authority for providing health and welfare services to the elderly, including care in the community, in County Roscommon informs me that discussions are ongoing with the Ballaghaderreen Social Services Council in relation to the proposed development of a day care centre for the elderly.  This is the next phase in a development which has already seen the completion of purpose built housing for the elderly. A total of 20 houses have been built.</P>
      <P>This development was the result of a partnership between the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Department of the Environment and Roscommon County Council.  The project was funded by the Department of the Environment under the scheme for special grants for communal facilities.  Funding for this scheme is granted to the Department under the National Lotteries Act.  This scheme also allows for the development of communal day care facilities as proposed by the Social Services Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>Under my Department's current personnel policy, each agency has responsibility for identifying manpower requirements.  Proposals for the filling of new and replacement permanent posts are reviewed on a regular basis by my Department.  This review is undertaken having regard to service and personnel criteria in the context of the priority afforded to each post by the agency concerned and with particular regard to the availability of financial resources.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board has not sought approval for the creation of a post of consultant rheumatologist on its most recent manpower submission to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Western Health Board has no proposals at this stage to appoint a consultant rheumatologist as a regional rheumatology and rehabilitation service is provided by the consultant rheumatologist based at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  I have, however, recently asked the board to examine the feasibility of establishing rheumatology clinics at Mayo General Hospital.  The board has also indicated that it will be making an input to the committee established by Comhairle na nOspidéal to examine the current level <Col N="1637" /> of consultant rheumatology and rehabilitation services throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I am glad to say that the Declaration, and the continued objective of a political settlement for Northern Ireland, have attracted sustained and widespread support throughout the world &mdash; notably in those countries which are homes to a significant number of the Irish diaspora and among our fellow member states of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The attainment of the IRA ceasefire drew messages of support and congratulations from many world leaders including President Clinton, Prime Minister Paul Keating and Yasser Arafat.  I have also received support from European Heads of Government and other countries such as Japan, India and South Africa.  In the context of that ceasefire, I have paid particular tribute to the contribution made by President Clinton and members of his Administration.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased at the commitment by both the United States and the European Union to increased financial support to consolidate peace.  In my recent visit to Australia and New Zealand, I was greatly heartened by the Australian Government's decision to contribute to the International Fund for Ireland and by the decision of the New Zealand Government to make an additional contribution.</P>

      <i>Notes on table</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (a)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1989 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1989-90.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The figures in column (a) of the table are based on income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism which covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (b)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt of income tax paid by full-time farmers in each calendar year has been divided by the number of full-time farming tax units which were formally assessed for tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1989 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1989-90, irrespective of whether tax was actually payable in all cases.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Unlike previous calculations, the current figures for averages do not take into account the tax attributable to the farming profits of farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession.  Farm tax represents a fraction of their overall tax liability and the emerging average farm tax payments could not be regarded as representative of the normal average tax yield from the farming sector.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are, to some extent, estimated.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (c)</i>
    </P>
    <P>The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax in each calendar year from tax units whose main source of income is from self-employment, other than full-time farming, by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>
    <P>
      <i>General notes</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously.  This is <Col N="1643" /> due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and tax deducted by building societies under the former composite rate arrangements are not included in the calculations.  Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these taxes referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The yield in 1991 from farmers and other self-employed was reduced by the once-off effect of deferring payment of the balances of 1990-91 tax from 1991 to 1992.  Ordinarily these balances, amounting to about £50 million, would have been paid in 1991 but were deferred to 1992 as a transitional effect of introducing the Current Year Basis of assessment for self-employed persons in 1990.  The yield from farmers in 1991 was further reduced because of a decrease in farming profits.</P>
    <P>(v)  For the purposes of these calculations, the yield in 1993 under the 15 per cent incentive amnesty in respect of declared amounts of income and gains has been attributed solely to the self-employed.  The breakdown of this yield between farmers and other self-employed is assumed <i>pro rata</i> with their ordinary tax payments.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent controversy in relation to issues raised by the increasing shift to self-employment in the construction industry through the use of the C2/C45 system.  As Minister for Social Welfare, I am concerned that moves from employed to self-employed status should be genuine and not simply devices to avoid the payment of employers' social insurance contributions thus leaving workers without vital social welfare cover when, in reality, the employer-employee relationship is still in existence.  The whole question of determining between employee and self-employed status is a complex one and is surrounded by a considerable body of case law.  Deciding officers of my Department decide on these matters on a case-by-case basis taking into account previous interpretations of the courts on the nature of employment.</P>
      <P>The Black Economy Monitoring Group under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has completed a review of the operation of the C45 scheme including recommendations on action to curb any abuse and to improve the scheme generally.  The implications of that review in so far as my Department is concerned are currently under examination.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium on eight animals under the 1992 suckler cow scheme on 30 June 1992.</P>
      <P>He presented eight cows at first inspection on 11 September 1992 but at a compliance inspection on 7 December 1992 it was found that all these cows were sold.  It is a condition of the suckler cow scheme that applicants retain their suckler cows for a period of six months after the date of lodgment of their application form.  Since the applicant sold his suckler cows within the retention period my Department has no option but to refuse payment of his suckler cow grants.</P>
      <P>He also submitted an application for grants under the 1992 beef cow scheme in the disadvantaged areas and has been requested to furnish further documentation in support of his claim.  The documentation provided so far shows he had the use of only about a quarter of an acre which would render him ineligible for 1992 beef cow headage &mdash; all disadvantaged areas applicants are required to farm at least seven and a half statute acres.  My Department has no record of having received applications from the person named in 1993 or 1994.</P>

      <P>While I presently have no statutory responsibilities in relation to the determination of VHI premium increases it is the convention that such increases are determined by the VHI Board following consultation with the Minister for Health.  Proposals by VHI for increases in premia are carefully considered in the context of the need to ensure the solvency of VHI and its ability to continue to provide an adequate range of insurance cover to its subscribers.  In this regard I must consider the solvency requirements which apply to insurance companies as part of the EU Single Market in non-life insurance.  Regard must also be had to ensuring that VHI has sufficient resources at its disposal to offer a comprehensive range of products which meet the needs of subscribers.</P>

      <P>Information on birth defects is available from a number of sources: registers operate in the Eastern Health Board <Col N="1664" /> area and in Galway; the birth notification scheme collects information on birth defects which are apparent before a new born baby is discharged from hospital and information would also be available from the hospital inpatient inquiry scheme in respect of babies with birth defects who were subsequently treated in an acute hospital.  I consider that it would be more appropriate to consider how existing sources of information on birth defects can be developed rather than to develop a separate register.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards are now adopting a planned systematic approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children in preference to a demand based system.  The results of epidemiological surveys show that a planned preventive service targeted at specific groups of children results in better dental health for the whole population of children.</P>
      <P>The school based system ensures a more equitable distribution of the dental resources available.  This approach aims to examine all children in specific classes and to provide treatment if necessary.  These classes are chosen with preventative treatments in mind and to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped that, in this way, children for whom a service was previously rarely, if ever, demanded and those in <Col N="1665" /> greatest need of dental care, will be screened, advised of the services available, educated in dental hygiene and referred for treatment as necessary. This development seeks to provide the optimum service to those in need and to ensure that all children have equal access to the same level of care.</P>
    <P>The small number of children who require more frequent screenings, such as medically compromised and the handicapped will receive it under the systematic approach.</P>
    <P>The planned systematic approach to provide dental care for children after they leave national school will be introduced, on a phased basis, over the next four years to care for their oral health until they reach their 16th birthday.  If a child is in pain or there is a matter of urgent concern to a parent concerning their child's dental health an emergency clinic is available each morning in most health centres.</P>

Current projections for 1994 would suggest that expenditure this year will be of a similar magnitude.  It is not possible to accurately estimate the expenditure on treating smoking related illnesses because of the many conditions which are contributed to by smoking.</P>

      <P>Under the Ombudsman Act, 1980, and statutory instruments made thereunder, the Ombudsman is empowered to investigate complaints against the Department of Health and, where administrative matters are concerned, the health boards.  The question of extending the remit of the Ombudsman into areas not covered at present is being examined in the context of the Department's review of the Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients and also in the context of the general review of the functions of the Ombudsman's Office which is being undertaken by the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>Disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA) is the primary income support scheme operated by my Department for people who, because of their disability, cannot work and are not in a position to maintain themselves in the community.  The regulations governing medical eligibility for disabled persons maintenance allowance specify that the applicant must be suffering from a &ldquo;specified disability&rdquo; which prevents him/her from undertaking work which would normally be suited to a person of his/her age, experience and qualifications.  The term &ldquo;specified disability&rdquo; means an injury, disease, congenital deformity or physical or mental illness or defect which, in the opinion of a medical officer of the health board authorised by that board to examine or to have examined persons applying for or in receipt of a maintenance allowance, has continued or may reasonably be expected to continue for at least one year from its onset.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare is responsible for the administration of the disability benefit scheme.  Disability benefit is normally a short term payment made to insured persons who are unfit to work due to an illness.  To qualify for this benefit a person must be under 66 years of age, be unfit to work due to an illness and satisfy the PRSI contribution conditions.  A person claiming disability benefit has to submit a completed first medical certificate claim form signed by their doctor to their local social welfare office and weekly medical certificates from their doctor thereafter while they are ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that these two schemes serve quite different purposes and I have no plans to change the <Col N="1668" /> medical criteria for eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>

This information for each of the past five years is set out in the following table.  The figures for 1989 and 1990 refer to live births which occurred during those years, whereas the provisional figures for 1991, 1992 and 1993 refer to live births registered during those years.  The data shows that the number of births to teenage mothers as a percentage of total births increased from 4.6 per cent in 1989 to 5.3 per cent in 1991.  This figure has remained unchanged since 1991.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the national campaign to immunise children aged 5-16 years which has been launched recently in the UK.  This campaign aims to prevent a measles epidemic predicted for 1995.  The prediction is based <i>inter alia</i> on the upward trend in notification of measles in secondary school pupils.</P>
      <P>The situation in this country differs from that in the UK in that children in the 10-14 year age group in this country have been included in the national immunisation schedule since 1992. Therefore the prevalance of measles infection and the pattern of immunisation give a different patern of susceptibility from that in the UK.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, in June of this year each health board was asked to intensify its efforts to ensure that the MMR vaccine is promoted and delivered to the relevant cohorts.  I am keeping the matter under review at present and will announce details of any initiatives considered necessary soon.</P>

    <P>In all other areas the Garda Síochána <Col N="1675" /> have responsibility for school attendance.  Details of the number of gardaí involved with school attendance are not available to my Department.</P>
    <P>Detailed operational procedures, follow-up action and reporting arrangements on incidences of truancy are a matter for the relevant enforcement authority.</P>
    <P>My Department carried out a review of the operation of the School Attendance Act, including an examination of the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved.  I published the resulting report on 8 April 1994.</P>
    <P>Copies of the report were circulated to interested parties who were asked to submit their considered views on it to the Department.</P>
    <P>The report together with submissions received from interested parties will form the basis for my proposals to update the legislative provisions in this area.</P>

      <P>My Department is also currently carrying out a review of the demand for post-primary places in the areas of Castleview, Kingswood and Kilnamanagh in the context of the projected availability of places in adjacent and accessible post-primary schools.</P>
